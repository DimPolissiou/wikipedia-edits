{"title_page": "Structure of the Italian Army in 1989", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=October 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\nThe '''[[Order of Battle]] of the [[Italian Army]] at the end of 1989''' is given below.\n\nThe article is based on the 1984 publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in [[Rome]] (a think thank of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link]. Specifically the Order of Battle after the 1986 reform was used, which was then corrected and expanded with the Italian Army's website information.\n\n== Graphic of the Italian Army in 1989 ==\n\n[[File:Italy Army - 1989.png|thumb|center|1200px|Structure of the Italian Army in 1989 (click image to enlarge)]]\n\n== Army General Staff ==\nThe Army General Staff in Rome oversaw all Italian Army units.

publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in [[Rome]] (a think thank of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link].

{"title_page": "Ad hominem", "text_new": "{{short description|Typically, a fallacious argumentative strategy that attacks the character of the person making the argument. Alternatively, a valid strategy basing arguments on the opponents' own commitments, without endorsing those commitments}}\n{{redirect|Personal attack|the policy on Wikipedia|Wikipedia:No personal attacks}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Ad hominem''''' ([[Latin]] for \"to the person\"), short for '''''argumentum ad hominem''''', is a term is applied to several different types of arguments, most of which are [[Fallacy#Informal fallacy|fallacious]]. Typically it refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The most common form of this fallacy is \"A makes a claim ''a'', B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument ''a'' is wrong\".\n\nThe valid types of ''ad hominem'' arguments are generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage and typically refer to the dialectical strategy of using the target's own beliefs and arguments against them while not assenting to the validity of those beliefs and arguments.\n\n== History ==\n\n<!--Ancient history-->\nThe various types of ''ad hominem'' arguments have been known in the West since at least the ancient Greeks. [[Aristotle]], in his work ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'', detailed the fallaciousness of putting the questioner but not the argument under scrutiny.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=82}} Many examples of ancient non-fallacious ''ad hominem'' arguments are preserved in the works of the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]]. In these arguments, the concepts and assumptions of the opponents are used as part of a dialectical strategy against the opponents to demonstrate the unsoundness of their own arguments and assumptions. In this way, the arguments are to the person (''ad hominem''), but without attacking the properties of the individuals making the arguments.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2001|1p=207-209|2a1=Wong|2y=2017|2p=49}} This kind of argument is also known as \"''argument from commitment.''\" \n\n<!--Modern era-->\nItalian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] and British philosopher [[John Locke]] also examined the argument from commitment, a form of the ''ad hominem'' argument, meaning examining an argument on the basis of whether it stands true to the principles of the person carrying the argument. In the mid-19th century, the modern understanding of the term ''ad hominem'' started to take shape, with the broad definition given by English logician [[Richard Whately]]. According to Whately, ''ad hominem'' arguments were \"''addressed to the peculiar circumstances, character, avowed opinions, or past conduct of the individual.''\"{{sfn|Walton|2001|pp=208-210}}\n\n<!--Hablin and contemporary-->\nDuring the course of the years the term acquired a different meaning and by the beginning of the 20th century, it was linked to a logical fallacy, in which a debater, instead of disproving an argument, attacked his opponent. This approach was also poppularized in philosophical textbooks of the mid-20th century, and it was challenged by Charles Leonard Hamblin in the second half of twentieth century. In a detailed work, he suggested that the inclusion of a statement against a person in an argument, does not necessarily make it a fallacious argument, since that particular phrase is not a premise that leads to a conclusion. While Hablin's criticism was not widely accepted, Canadian philosopher Douglas N. Walton examined the fallaciousness of the ad hominem even further.{{sfn|van Eemeren|Grootendorst|2015|pp=615-626}} Nowadays, except within specialized philosophical usages, the usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\nExcept within specialized philosophical usages, the modern usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe Latin phase ''argumentum ad hominem'' stands for \"argument against the person\".{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=91}} \"Ad\" corresponds to \"against\" but it could also mean \"to\" or \"towards\".{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=71-72}}\n\nThe terms ''ad mulierem'' and ''ad feminam'' have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.{{sfnm|1a1=Olivesi|1y=2010|2a1=Sommers|2y=1991}}\n\n== Types of ad hominem arguments ==\n{{see also|List of fallacies}}\n\n[[File:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement.svg|440px|thumb|''Ad hominem'' attack lies near the bottom end of [[Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement]]]]\n\nFallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2008|1p=190|2a1=Bowell|2a2=Kemp|2y=2010|2pp=201-213|3a1=Copi|3y=1986|3pp=112-113}}\n\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies can be separated in various different types, among others are ''tu quoque'', circumstantial, guilt by association, and abusive ''ad hominem''. All of them are similar to the general scheme of ''ad hominem'' argument, that is instead of dealing with the essence of someones argument or trying to refute it, the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is a sufficient reason to drop the initial argument.{{sfn|van Eemeren|2001|p=142}}\n\n=== ''Tu quoque'' ===\n{{main|Tu quoque}}\n''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: \"You also\") is a response to a personal attack (or ''ad hominem'' argument) that itself is a personal attack.{{sfnm|1a1=Wrisley|1y=2019|1p=88|2a1=Walton|2y=2015|2pp= 431-435|3a1=Lavery|3a2=Hughes|3y=2008|3p=132}}\n\n''Tu quoque'' appears as: \n*A makes a claim ''a''.\n*B attacks the character of A by saying he holds a ''property x'', which is bad.\n*A defends himself by attacking B, saying he also holds the same ''property x''.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=89}}\n\nHere is an example given by philosophy professor George Wrisley to illustrate the above: A businessman and politician is giving a lecture at a University about how good his company is and how nicely the system works. A student asks him \"Is it true that you and your company are selling weapons to third world rulers who use those arms against their own people?\" and the  businessman replies \"is it true that your university gets funding by the same company you are claiming it is selling guns to those countries? You are not a white dove either\". The ''ad hominem'' accusation of the student is relevant to the narrative the businessman tries to project thus not fallacious. On the other hand, the attack on the student (that is, the student being inconsistent) is irrelevant to the opening narrative. So the businessman's ''tu quoque'' response is fallacious.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=89-91}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Christopher Tindale]] approaches somewhat different the ''tu quoque'' fallacy. According to Tindale, a ''tu quoque'' fallacy appears when a response to an argument is made on the history of the arguer. This argument is also invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true, then source A may be a [[hypocrite]] or even changed their mind, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. A common example, given by Tindale, is when a doctor advises a patient to lose weight, but the patient argues that there is no need for him to go on a diet because the doctor is also overweight.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=94-96}}\n\n=== Circumstantial ===\n{{main|Bulverism}}\n''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances (for instance, their job, wealth, property, or relations) such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. As with other types of ''ad hominem'' attack, circumstantial attack could be fallacious or not. It could be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). But it also may be a sound argument, if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=1998|1pp=18-21|2a1=Wrisley|2y=2019|2pp=77-78}}\n\nA simple example is: a father may tell his daughter not to start smoking because she will damage her health, and she may point out that he is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that smoking might cause various diseases. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=211}}\n\nPhilosopher and pundit on informal fallacies [[Douglas N. Walton]] argues that a circumstantial ''ad hominem'' argument can be non-fallacious. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B) making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, i.e. B talks as an authority figure. To illustrate this reasoning, Walton gives the example of a witness at a trial, if he had been caught lying and cheating in his own life, should the jury take his word for granted? No, according to Walton.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== Guilt by association ===\n{{main|Association fallacy}}\nGuilt by association, that is accusing an arguerer because of his alleged connection with a discredited person or group, can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy when the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.{{sfn|Walton|1998|pp=18-21}}\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n# Source S makes claim C. \n# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.\n# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to their group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.\n\nAcademic Leigh Kolb gives as an example that the 2008 US vice\u2010presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] attacked [[Barack Obama]] for having worked with [[Bill Ayers]], who had been a leader in the [[Weather Underground]] terrorist group in the 1960s. Despite Obama's denouncing every act of terrorism, he was still associated by his opponents with terrorism.{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\nGuilt by association is frequently found in social and political debates. It also appears after horrible events, linked to a specific group. An example, given also by Leigh Kolb, is the peak of attacks against Muslims in the USA after the [[September_11_attacks| September 11 attacks]].{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\n===Abusive ''ad hominem''===\nAbusive ''ad hominem'' argument (or direct ''ad hominem'') is associated with an attack to the character of the person carrying an argument. This kind of argument, besides usually being fallacious, is also counterproductive, as a proper dialogue is hard to achieve after such an attack.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=92-93}}{{sfn|Hansen|2019|loc= 1. The core fallacies}}{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=123}}\n\nAn ''ad hominem'' fallacy occurs when one attacks the character of an interlocutor in an attempt to refute their argument. Insulting someone is not necessarily an instance of an ''ad hominem'' fallacy. For example, if one supplies sufficient reasons to reject an interlocutor's argument and adds a slight character attack at the end, this character attack is not necessarily fallacious. Whether it is fallacious depends on whether or not the insult is used as a reason against the interlocutor's argument. An ''ad hominem'' occurs when an attack on the interlocutor's character functions as a response to an interlocutor's argument or claim.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=83}}\n\nKey issues on examining an argument whether being an ''ad hominem'' fallacy or not are whether the accusation against the person stands true or not, whether the accusation is relevant to the argument. Lastly, it should be examined whether the ''ad hominem'' argument shortens or diminishes the counterargument. An example is a dialogue at the court, where the attorney cross-examines an eyewitness, bringing to light the fact that the witness was convicted in the past for lying. If the attorney's conclusion is that the witness is lying, that would be wrong. But if his argument would be that the witness should not be trusted, that would not be a fallacy.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=86-87}}\n\n=== Argument from commitment ===\nThe term ''ad hominem'' is used to refer to a type of valid argument that employs, as a dialectical strategy, the exclusive utilization of the beliefs, convictions, and assumptions of those holding the position being argued against, i.e., arguments constructed on the basis of what other people hold to be true. This usage is generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage or in pre-20th century usages.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=note1}} This type of argument is also known as \"argument from commitment\" or the ''ex concessis'' argument (Latin for \"from what has been conceded already\").{{sfn|Walton|2001}}\n\n== Usage in debates==\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies are considered to be uncivil and do not help creating a constructive atmosphere for dialogue to flourish.{{sfn|Weston|2018|p=82}} An ''ad hominem'' attack is an attack on the character of the target who tends to feel the necessity to defend himself from the accusation of being hypocrite\u2014not an easy task. It is so powerful of an argument it has been employed in many political debates. Since it is associated with negativity and dirty tricks, it has gained a bad fame, of being always fallacious.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=122}}\n\nAuthor Eithan Orkibi, having studied the Israeli politics prior to elections, described two other forms of ''ad hominem'' attacks that are common during election periods. They both depend on the collective memory shared by both proponents and the audience. The first is the ''precedential ad hominem'', according to which the previous history of someone means that they do not fit for the office. It goes like this: \"My opponent was (allegedly) wrong in the past, therefore he is wrong now\". The second one, is a behavioral ''ad hominem'': \"my opponent was not a descent in his arguments in the past, so he is not now either\".

Alternatively, a valid strategy basing arguments on the opponents' own commitments, without endorsing those commitments}}\n{{redirect|Personal attack|the policy on Wikipedia|Wikipedia:No personal attacks}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Ad hominem''''' ([[Latin]] for \"to the person\"), short for '''''argumentum ad hominem''''', is a term is applied to several different types of arguments, most of which are [[Fallacy#Informal fallacy|fallacious]]. Typically it refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The most common form of this fallacy is \"A makes a claim ''a'', B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument ''a'' is wrong\".\n\nThe valid types of ''ad hominem'' arguments are generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage and typically refer to the dialectical strategy of using the target's own beliefs and arguments against them while not assenting to the validity of those beliefs and arguments.\n\n== History ==\n\n<!--Ancient history-->\nThe various types of ''ad hominem'' arguments have been known in the West since at least the ancient Greeks. [[Aristotle]], in his work ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'', detailed the fallaciousness of putting the questioner but not the argument under scrutiny.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=82}} Many examples of ancient non-fallacious ''ad hominem'' arguments are preserved in the works of the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]]. In these arguments, the concepts and assumptions of the opponents are used as part of a dialectical strategy against the opponents to demonstrate the unsoundness of their own arguments and assumptions. In this way, the arguments are to the person (''ad hominem''), but without attacking the properties of the individuals making the arguments.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2001|1p=207-209|2a1=Wong|2y=2017|2p=49}} This kind of argument is also known as \"''argument from commitment.''\" \n\n<!--Modern era-->\nItalian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] and British philosopher [[John Locke]] also examined the argument from commitment, a form of the ''ad hominem'' argument, meaning examining an argument on the basis of whether it stands true to the principles of the person carrying the argument. In the mid-19th century, the modern understanding of the term ''ad hominem'' started to take shape, with the broad definition given by English logician [[Richard Whately]]. According to Whately, ''ad hominem'' arguments were \"''addressed to the peculiar circumstances, character, avowed opinions, or past conduct of the individual.''\"{{sfn|Walton|2001|pp=208-210}}\n\n<!--Hablin and contemporary-->\nDuring the course of the years the term acquired a different meaning and by the the beginning of the 20th century, it was linked to a logical fallacy, in which a debater, instead of disproving an argument, attacked his opponent. This approach was also poppularized in philosophical textbooks of the mid-20th century, and it was challenged by Charles Leonard Hamblin in the second half of twentieth century. In a detailed work, he suggested that the inclusion of a statement against a person in an argument, does not necessarily make it a fallacious argument, since that particular phrase is not a premise that leads to a conclusion. While Hablin's criticism was not widely accepted, Canadian philosopher Douglas N. Walton examined the fallaciousness of the ad hominem even further.{{sfn|van Eemeren|Grootendorst|2015|pp=615-626}} Nowadays, except within specialized philosophical usages, the usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\nExcept within specialized philosophical usages, the modern usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe Latin phase ''argumentum ad hominem'' stands for \"argument against the person\".{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=91}} \"Ad\" corresponds to \"against\" but it could also mean \"to\" or \"towards\".{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=71-72}}\n\nThe terms ''ad mulierem'' and ''ad feminam'' have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.{{sfnm|1a1=Olivesi|1y=2010|2a1=Sommers|2y=1991}}\n\n== Types of ad hominem arguments ==\n{{see also|List of fallacies}}\n\n[[File:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement.svg|440px|thumb|''Ad hominem'' attack lies near the bottom end of [[Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement]]]]\n\nFallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2008|1p=190|2a1=Bowell|2a2=Kemp|2y=2010|2pp=201-213|3a1=Copi|3y=1986|3pp=112-113}}\n\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies can be separated in various different types, among others are ''tu quoque'', circumstantial, guilt by association, and abusive ''ad hominem''. All of them are similar to the general scheme of ''ad hominem'' argument, that is instead of dealing with the essence of someones argument or trying to refute it, the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is a sufficient reason to drop the initial argument.{{sfn|van Eemeren|2001|p=142}}\n\n=== ''Tu quoque'' ===\n{{main|Tu quoque}}\n''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: \"You also\") is a response to a personal attack (or ''ad hominem'' argument) that itself is a personal attack.{{sfnm|1a1=Wrisley|1y=2019|1p=88|2a1=Walton|2y=2015|2pp= 431-435|3a1=Lavery|3a2=Hughes|3y=2008|3p=132}}\n\n''Tu quoque'' appears as: \n*A makes a claim ''a''.\n*B attacks the character of A by saying he holds a ''property x'', which is bad.\n*A defends himself by attacking B, saying he also holds the same ''property x''.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=89}}\n\nHere is an example given by philosophy professor George Wrisley to illustrate the above: A businessman and politician is giving a lecture at a University about how good his company is and how nicely the system works. A student asks him \"Is it true that you and your company are selling weapons to third world rulers who use those arms against their own people?\" and the  businessman replies \"is it true that your university gets funding by the same company you are claiming it is selling guns to those countries? You are not a white dove either\". The ''ad hominem'' accusation of the student is relevant to the narrative the businessman tries to project thus not fallacious. On the other hand, the attack on the student (that is, the student being inconsistent) is irrelevant to the opening narrative. So the businessman's ''tu quoque'' response is fallacious.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=89-91}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Christopher Tindale]] approaches somewhat different the ''tu quoque'' fallacy. According to Tindale, a ''tu quoque'' fallacy appears when a response to an argument is made on the history of the arguer. This argument is also invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true, then source A may be a [[hypocrite]] or even changed their mind, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. A common example, given by Tindale, is when a doctor advises a patient to lose weight, but the patient argues that there is no need for him to go on a diet because the doctor is also overweight.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=94-96}}\n\n=== Circumstantial ===\n{{main|Bulverism}}\n''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances (for instance, their job, wealth, property, or relations) such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. As with other types of ''ad hominem'' attack, circumstantial attack could be fallacious or not. It could be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). But it also may be a sound argument, if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=1998|1pp=18-21|2a1=Wrisley|2y=2019|2pp=77-78}}\n\nA simple example is: a father may tell his daughter not to start smoking because she will damage her health, and she may point out that he is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that smoking might cause various diseases. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=211}}\n\nPhilosopher and pundit on informal fallacies [[Douglas N. Walton]] argues that a circumstantial ''ad hominem'' argument can be non-fallacious. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B) making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, i.e. B talks as an authority figure. To illustrate this reasoning, Walton gives the example of a witness at a trial, if he had been caught lying and cheating in his own life, should the jury take his word for granted? No, according to Walton.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== Guilt by association ===\n{{main|Association fallacy}}\nGuilt by association, that is accusing an arguerer because of his alleged connection with a discredited person or group, can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy when the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.{{sfn|Walton|1998|pp=18-21}}\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n# Source S makes claim C. \n# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.\n# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to their group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.\n\nAcademic Leigh Kolb gives as an example that the 2008 US vice\u2010presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] attacked [[Barack Obama]] for having worked with [[Bill Ayers]], who had been a leader in the [[Weather Underground]] terrorist group in the 1960s. Despite Obama's denouncing every act of terrorism, he was still associated by his opponents with terrorism.{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\nGuilt by association is frequently found in social and political debates. It also appears after horrible events, linked to a specific group. An example, given also by Leigh Kolb, is the peak of attacks against Muslims in the USA after the [[September_11_attacks| September 11 attacks]].{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\n===Abusive ''ad hominem''===\nAbusive ''ad hominem'' argument (or direct ''ad hominem'') is associated with an attack to the character of the person carrying an argument. This kind of argument, besides usually being fallacious, is also counterproductive, as a proper dialogue is hard to achieve after such an attack.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=92-93}}{{sfn|Hansen|2019|loc= 1. The core fallacies}}{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=123}}\n\nAn ''ad hominem'' fallacy occurs when one attacks the character of an interlocutor in an attempt to refute their argument. Insulting someone is not necessarily an instance of an ''ad hominem'' fallacy. For example, if one supplies sufficient reasons to reject an interlocutor's argument and adds a slight character attack at the end, this character attack is not necessarily fallacious. Whether it is fallacious depends on whether or not the insult is used as a reason against the interlocutor's argument. An ''ad hominem'' occurs when an attack on the interlocutor's character functions as a response to an interlocutor's argument or claim.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=83}}\n\nKey issues on examining an argument whether being an ''ad hominem'' fallacy or not are whether the accusation against the person stands true or not, whether the accusation is relevant to the argument. Lastly, it should be examined whether the ''ad hominem'' argument shortens or diminishes the counterargument. An example is a dialogue at the court, where the attorney cross-examines an eyewitness, bringing to light the fact that the witness was convicted in the past for lying. If the attorney's conclusion is that the witness is lying, that would be wrong. But if his argument would be that the witness should not be trusted, that would not be a fallacy.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=86-87}}\n\n=== Argument from commitment ===\nThe term ''ad hominem'' is used to refer to a type of valid argument that employs, as a dialectical strategy, the exclusive utilization of the beliefs, convictions, and assumptions of those holding the position being argued against, i.e., arguments constructed on the basis of what other people hold to be true. This usage is generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage or in pre-20th century usages.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=note1}} This type of argument is also known as \"argument from commitment\" or the ''ex concessis'' argument (Latin for \"from what has been conceded already\").{{sfn|Walton|2001}}\n\n== Usage in debates==\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies are considered to be uncivil and do not help creating a constructive atmosphere for dialogue to flourish.{{sfn|Weston|2018|p=82}} An ''ad hominem'' attack is an attack on the character of the target who tends to feel the necessity to defend himself from the accusation of being hypocrite\u2014not an easy task. It is so powerful of an argument it has been employed in many political debates. Since it is associated with negativity and dirty tricks, it has gained a bad fame, of being always fallacious.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=122}}\n\nAuthor Eithan Orkibi, having studied the Israeli politics prior to elections, described two other forms of ''ad hominem'' attacks that are common during election periods. They both depend on the collective memory shared by both proponents and the audience. The first is the ''precedential ad hominem'', according to which the previous history of someone means that they do not fit for the office. It goes like this: \"My opponent was (allegedly) wrong in the past, therefore he is wrong now\". The second one, is a behavioral ''ad hominem'': \"my opponent was not a descent in his arguments in the past, so he is not now either\". These kinds of attacks are based on the inability of the audience to have a clear view of the statistical percentage of fault statements by both parts of the debate.{{sfn|Orkibi|2018|pp=497-498}}\n\n== Criticism as a fallacy ==\nCanadian academic and author [[Douglas N. Walton]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,{{sfn|Walton|2008|p=170}} as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.\n\nThe philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] has argued that ''ad hominem'' reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the [[apodicticity|apodictic]] reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.{{sfn|Taylor|1995|p=34-60}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* \"[[And you are lynching Negroes]]\"\n* [[Appeal to authority]]\n* [[Appeal to emotion]]\n* [[Appeal to motive]]\n* [[Association fallacy]]\n* [[Bulverism]]\n* [[Character assassination]]\n* [[Discrediting tactic]]\n* ''[[Ergo decedo]]''\n* [[Fair Game (Scientology)]]\n* [[Fake news]]\n* [[Fundamental attribution error]]\n* [[Gaslighting]]\n* [[Paul Graham (programmer)#Graham's hierarchy of disagreement|Graham's hierarchy of disagreement]]\n* [[Hostile witness]]\n* [[Negative campaigning]]\n* [[Poisoning the well]]\n* [[Presumption of guilt]] \n* [[Race card]]\n* [[Red herring]]\n* [[Reputation]]\n* [[Shooting the messenger]]\n* [[Smear campaign]]\n* [[Straw man]]\n* [[Tone policing]]\n* [[The Art of Being Right]]\n* ''[[Tu quoque]]''\n* [[Whataboutism]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Bowell|first1=Tracy|last2=Kemp|first2=Gary|title=Critical Thinking: A Concise Guide|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|isbn=978-0-415-47183-1|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Copi|first=Irving M.|title=Informal Logic|isbn=978-0-02-324940-2|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite encyclopedia |last= Hansen|first= Hans|author-link= |editor-last= Zalta |editor-first= Edward N. |editor-link= Edward N.

In the live-action film adaptation ''[[The Last Airbender]]'', he is portrayed by [[Jackson Rathbone]].\n\nIn the original series, sixteen-year-old Sokka is a [[warrior]] of the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender#Water Tribe|Southern Water Tribe]], a nation where some people are able to telekinetically manipulate, or \"bend\", water.<ref name=\"NickMagScan04\">{{cite journal|last=Pittarese|first=Frank|title=Nation Exploration|journal=Nickelodeon Magazine|pages=2|year=2006|issue=Winter 2006}}</ref> He, along with his younger sister [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]], discovers an Airbender named [[Aang]], the long-lost Avatar, and accompanies him to defeat the imperialistic Fire Nation and bring peace to the war-torn nations.<ref name=\"The Avatar Returns\">{{cite episode|title=The Avatar Returns|airdate=2005-02-21|season=1|number=2|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Among various running gags involving Sokka are his immersion in viscous substances, such as raw sewage, [[slurry]], phlegm, or saliva; and forgetting that [[Toph Beifong|Toph]] is blind. Sokka also has a tendency to produce or at times laugh at jokes shared by no other character.<ref name=\"The Guru\">{{cite episode|title=The Guru|airdate=2006-12-01|season=2 (Book 2)|number=19|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Fire Prince Zuko attacks the village and Sokka fights him. However he loses and Zuko takes Aang away. Advised by their grandmother Sokka and his sister, Katara save Aang and embark with him to find a waterbending instructor while Sokka plans to improve his own skill ''en route''.<ref name=\"The Avatar Returns\"/>  In the episode \"The Warriors of Kyoshi\", Sokka's male chauvinism is challenged when he and the gang are captured by the all female Kyoshi warriors led by fifteen year old Suki, who eventually host them graciously in honor of the avatar. Sokka learns to respect Suki's skill and soon after he apologizes for his behavior he trains with the warriors, even being forced to wear their female armor dresses. Sokka and Suki soon develop a romantic bond and later in the series they become a couple.\n\nAfter arriving in the Earth Kingdom, Sokka and the group discover a secret underground library. Sokka and Aang learn of the Day of Black Sun where all firebenders are powerless. Sokka and the group attempt to give this information to the Earth King but are stopped by the Dai Li. The group finally exposes their leader's corruption and they tell the Earth King of their plan of invading the Fire Nation.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Sokka's Master]]\", Sokka seeks an instructor in swordsmanship, and receives training with Master Piandao, a Fire Nation swordmaster, in which creativity and lateral thought are the bases of his technique. In the episode \"Day of Black Sun\", Sokka invades the Fire Nation along with his allies. However, he discovers from Azula where his girlfriend Suki is and that she has known about the invasion for months. The invasion fails and Sokka, his friends, and the younger members of the group are forced to retreat. Before Zuko joins the group, Sokka manages to kill the assassin (whom he nicknamed Combustion Man) he sent after them by hitting his third eye with his boomerang. In the episode \"The Boiling Rock\", Sokka infiltrates a prison where his father might be being held with the help of Zuko. Sokka also discovers that his girlfriend, Suki is being held at the prison. However, his father is not there, he initially decides to escape the prison with Suki, Zuko and other inmates but decides to wait for his father to possibly arrive. Sokka's father, Hakoda, does arrive and Sokka formulates a plan of escape with him. The two along with Zuko, Suki and another inmate execute the plan and after a fight with Azula they escape the prison. However, Sokka is again separated from his father at the Western Air Temple due to a Fire Nation ambush. They are forced to split up with Sokka going with Aang, Katara, Toph, Zuko and Suki. In the four-part series finale, ''\"[[Sozin's Comet]]\"'', Sokka and Katara meet with Piandao and Katara's waterbending master, Pakku, who has now married their paternal grandmother, Kanna or \"Gran-Gran\". In the battle against antagonist Ozai, characters Sokka, Suki, and Toph hijack a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy other airships while Aang duels with Ozai himself before the Earth Kingdom was burned down. With the battle over, the trio reunite with Aang. At Zuko's coronation, Suki is reunited with the Kyoshi Warriors, Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father, and the rest of the group is reunited with their friends. In the end, Sokka is seen in Ba Sing Se.\n\nIn the [[The Legend of Korra (season 1)|first season]] of the sequel series ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'', which picks up 70 years after Ozai's defeat, Katara (now an elderly woman) states that Sokka is deceased. Flashbacks reveal that a middle-aged Sokka served as the representative of the Southern Water Tribe on the United Republic Council 40 years prior. He declared the bloodbending crime lord, Yakonne, guilty after lots of testimony and evidence convinced him that he is a unique bender like Combustion Man and Toph. In the [[The Legend of Korra (season 3)|third season]], Tenzin (Katara and Aang's son) mentions that Sokka was present when a gang of criminals attempted to abduct Korra as a child. His age at death would have been between seventy-three and eighty.\n\n==Personality==\nAccording to his sister Katara, Sokka was initially skeptical, abrasive, sexist and immature and was always sharp-witted. Incapable of bending abilities himself, Sokka instead pursues martial arts, sciences, and engineering.<ref name=\"The Avatar Returns\"/><ref name=\"The Northern Air Temple\">{{cite episode|title=The Northern Air Temple|airdate=2005-11-04|season=1|number=17 (Book 1)|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Even though Sokka finds himself victim to embarrassment, he has the capability to apologize and seek resolution to avoid preceding moments of embarrassment from recurring. This capability is evident from his sincere apology to the Kyoshi Warriors for his sexist remarks in the fourth episode of&nbsp;Book One: Water&nbsp;of&nbsp;''Avatar: The Last Airbender''.\n\nAs an advocate of human carnivorism, Sokka is the main hunter in the group; often makes dry-witted jokes or abrasive remarks; and accordingly once describes himself as \"''the meat and sarcasm guy''\".<ref name=\"The Southern Air Temple\">{{cite episode|title=The Southern Air Temple|airdate=2005-02-25 |season=1|number=3|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

In the live-action film adaptation ''[[The Last Airbender]]'', he is portrayed by [[Jackson Rathbone]].\n\nIn the original series, sixteen-year-old Sokka is a [[warrior]] of the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender#Water Tribe|Southern Water Tribe]], a nation where some people are able to telekinetically manipulate, or \"bend\", water.<ref name=\"NickMagScan04\">{{cite journal|last=Pittarese|first=Frank|title=Nation Exploration|journal=Nickelodeon Magazine|pages=2|year=2006|issue=Winter 2006}}</ref> He, along with his younger sister [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]], discovers an Airbender named [[Aang]], the long-lost Avatar, and accompanies him to defeat the imperialistic Fire Nation and bring peace to the war-torn nations.<ref name=\"The Avatar Returns\">{{cite episode|title=The Avatar Returns|airdate=2005-02-21|season=1|number=2|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Among various running gags involving Sokka are his immersion in viscous substances, such as raw sewage, [[slurry]], phlegm, or saliva; and forgetting that [[Toph Beifong|Toph]] is blind. Sokka also has a tendency to produce or at times laugh at jokes shared by no other character.<ref name=\"The Guru\">{{cite episode|title=The Guru|airdate=2006-12-01|season=2 (Book 2)|number=19|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Fire Prince Zuko attacks the village and Sokka fights him. However he loses and Zuko takes Aang away. Advised by their grandmother Sokka and his sister, Katara save Aang and embark with him to find a waterbending instructor while Sokka plans to improve his own skill ''en route''.<ref name=\"The Avatar Returns\"/>  In the episode \"The Warriors of Kyoshi\", Sokka's male chauvinism is challenged when he and the gang are captured by the all female Kyoshi warriors led by fifteen year old Suki, who eventually host them graciously in honor of the avatar. Sokka learns to respect Suki's skill and soon after he apologizes for his behavior he trains with the warriors, even being forced to wear their female armor dresses. Sokka and Suki soon develop a romantic bond and later in the series they become a couple.\n\nAfter arriving in the Earth Kingdom, Sokka and the group discover a secret underground library. Sokka and Aang learn of the Day of Black Sun where all firebenders are powerless. Sokka and the group attempt to give this information to the Earth King but are stopped by the Dai Li. The group finally exposes their leader's corruption and they tell the Earth King of their plan of invading the Fire Nation.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Sokka's Master]]\", Sokka seeks an instructor in swordsmanship, and receives training with Master Piandao, a Fire Nation swordmaster, in which creativity and lateral thought are the bases of his technique. In the episode \"Day of Black Sun\", Sokka invades the Fire Nation along with his allies. However, he discovers from Azula where his girlfriend Suki is and that she has known about the invasion for months. The invasion fails and Sokka, his friends, and the younger members of the group are forced to retreat. Before Zuko joins the group, Sokka manages to kill the assassin (whom he nicknamed Combustion Man) he sent after them by hitting his third eye with his boomerang. In the episode \"The Boiling Rock\", Sokka infiltrates a prison where his father might be being held with the help of Zuko. Sokka also discovers that his girlfriend, Suki is being held at the prison. However, his father is not there, he initially decides to escape the prison with Suki, Zuko and other inmates but decides to wait for his father to possibly arrive. Sokka's father, Hakoda, does arrive and Sokka formulates a plan of escape with him. The two along with Zuko, Suki and another inmate execute the plan and after a fight with Azula they escape the prison. However, Sokka is again separated from his father at the Western Air Temple due to a Fire Nation ambush. They are forced to split up with Sokka going with Aang, Katara, Toph, Zuko and Suki. In the four-part series finale, ''\"[[Sozin's Comet]]\"'', Sokka and Katara meet with Piandao and Katara's waterbending master, Pakku, who has now married their paternal grandmother, Kanna or \"Gran-Gran\". In the battle against antagonist Ozai, characters Sokka, Suki, and Toph hijack a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy other airships while Aang duels with Ozai himself before the Earth Kingdom was burned down. With the battle over, the trio reunite with Aang. At Zuko's coronation, Suki is reunited with the Kyoshi Warriors, Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father, and the rest of the group is reunited with their friends. In the end, Sokka is seen in Ba Sing Se.\n\nIn the [[The Legend of Korra (season 1)|first season]] of the sequel series ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'', which picks up 70 years after Ozai's defeat, Katara (now an elderly woman) states that Sokka is deceased. Flashbacks reveal that a middle-aged Sokka served as the representative of the Southern Water Tribe on the United Republic Council 40 years prior. He declared the bloodbending crime lord, Yakonne, guilty after lots of testimony and evidence convinced him that he is a unique bender like Combustion Man and Toph. In the [[The Legend of Korra (season 3)|third season]], Tenzin (Katara and Aang's son) mentions that Sokka was present when a gang of criminals attempted to abduct Korra as a child. His age at death would have been between seventy-three and eighty.\n\n==Personality==\nAccording to his sister Katara, Sokka was initially skeptical, abrasive, sexist and immature and was always sharp-witted. Incapable of bending abilities himself, Sokka instead pursues martial arts, sciences, and engineering.<ref name=\"The Avatar Returns\"/><ref name=\"The Northern Air Temple\">{{cite episode|title=The Northern Air Temple|airdate=2005-11-04|season=1|number=17 (Book 1)|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

Even though Sokka finds himself victim to embarrassment, he has the capability to apologize and seek resolution to avoid preceding moments of embarrassment from recurring. This capability is evident from his sincere apology to the Kyoshi Warriors for his sexist remarks in the fourth episode of&nbsp;Book One: Water&nbsp;of&nbsp;''Avatar: The Last Airbender''.\n\nAs an advocate of human carnivorism, Sokka is the main hunter in the group; often makes dry-witted jokes or abrasive remarks; and accordingly once describes himself as \"''the meat and sarcasm guy''\".<ref name=\"The Southern Air Temple\">{{cite episode|title=The Southern Air Temple|airdate=2005-02-25 |season=1|number=3|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.
