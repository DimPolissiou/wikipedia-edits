Prof. Yuval Shany, Hersch Lauterpacht Professor of Public International Law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,<ref>The International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists (Justice No. 45, Spring 2008. Pages 21\u201326) [PDF FORMAT]http://www.infolink.co.il/intjewishlawyers/docenter/frames.asp?id=16867</ref> described the Court's conclusions on the three questions before it as controversial:\n\n{{quote|First, as far as the jurisdictional part of the decision goes, the court has been severely criticized for unjustifiably over-stretching the concept of ''res judicata'' to decisions on jurisdiction rendered at an earlier stage of the same proceedings; for over-relying on legal conclusions that were decided at earlier stages without serious consideration; and for narrowly construing its powers of revision. Indeed, seven out of the fifteen judges on the bench expressed varying degrees of unease with this particular outcome.\n\nSecond, as for the actual findings on the commission of genocide, some writers have criticized the court for refusing to look at the 'bigger picture' of the events in Bosnia \u2013 a picture that seems to suggest that the various atrocious crimes meted out by the Bosnian Serbs were all part of the same 'master-plan' of creating an ethnically homogeneous Serbian state. Others have questioned the court's readiness to rely on the absence of individual convictions in genocide by the ICTY (except with relation to the massacre in Srebrenica), without properly considering the difference between standards of liability under criminal law and state responsibility or fully appreciating the limited probative value of reduced charges as the result of plea bargains.\n\nThird, with respect to the question of Serbian responsibility, the court's legal analysis of attribution standards, the reluctance to find Serbia to be an accomplice to genocide, and the decision to refrain from ordering reparations, have all been criticized as excessively conservative. At the same time, the court's expansive reading of Article 1 of the Genocide Convention as potentially imposing on all states a duty to prevent genocide, even if committed outside their territory, has been noted for its remarkable boldness. Still, some writers have criticized the court for not clarifying whether Article 1 can provide an independent basis for exercising of universal jurisdiction against individual perpetrators of genocide. So, arguably, the court construed broadly the duty to prevent genocide while narrowly construing the duty to punish its perpetrators.}}\n\nAntonio Cassese, the first president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, criticized the ICJ judgement on the ground that \"The International Court has set an unrealistically high standard of proof for finding Serbia complicit in genocide.\" He added:\n\n{{quote|The ICJ, which&nbsp;... deals with controversies between states, was faced with Bosnia's claim that Serbia was responsible for the Srebrenica massacre. Although the Court ruled that genocide had taken place, it decided that Serbia was not responsible under international law.\n\nAccording to the Court, the Bosnian Serb generals who were guilty of this genocide, the various Mladi\u0107's and Krsti\u0107's, were neither acting as Serbia's agents nor receiving specific instructions from Belgrade&nbsp;... Why was it not enough to prove that the Bosnian Serb military leadership was financed and paid by Serbia and that it was tightly connected to Serbia political and military leadership? More importantly, the ICJ's decision that Serbia is responsible for not having prevented a genocide in which it was not complicit makes little sense. According to the Court, Serbia was aware of the very high risk of acts of genocide and did nothing. But Serbia was not complicit, the Court argued, because \"it has not been proven\" that the intention of committing the acts of genocide at Srebrenica \"had been brought to Belgrade's attention\".\n\nThis is a puzzling statement at best. The massacre was prepared in detail and took place over the course of six days (between 13 and 19 July). Is it plausible that the Serbian authorities remained in the dark while the killing was in progress and reported in the press all over the world?<ref>A judicial massacre, The Guardian, 27 February 2007. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/27/thejudicialmassacreofsrebr</ref>}}\n\nThe Vice-President of the International Court of Justice, Judge Al-Khasawneh, criticized the judgement as not reflecting the evidence with respect to Serbia's direct responsibility for genocide at Srebrenica:\n\n<blockquote>The 'effective control' test for attribution established in the Nicaragua case is not suitable to questions of State responsibility for international crimes committed with a common purpose. The 'overall control' test for attribution established in the Tadi\u0107 case is more appropriate when the commission of international crimes is the common objective of the controlling State and the non-State actors. The Court's refusal to infer genocidal intent from a consistent pattern of conduct in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inconsistent with the established jurisprudence of the ICTY. The FRY's knowledge of the genocide set to unfold in Srebrenica is clearly established. The Court should have treated the Scorpions as a de jure organ of the FRY. The statement by the Serbian Council of Ministers in response to the massacre of Muslim men by the Scorpions amounted to an admission of responsibility. The Court failed to appreciate the definitional complexity of the crime of genocide and to assess the facts before it accordingly.<ref>Dissenting opinion of Judge Al-Khasawneh, Vice-President of the International Court of Justice, {{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13689.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629193241/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13689.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Missing SDC Records====\nThe International Criminal Tribunal never received a complete archive of the Supreme Defense Council minutes from Serbia. According to the explanation given by Sir Geoffrey Nice, former prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107:\n\n<blockquote>First, it is important to note that Serbia did not hand over to the Prosecution (OTP) the complete collection of SDC [Supreme Defense Council] records. For example, for the year 1995 the OTP received recordings for only about half of all the sessions held by SDC. Further, some of the SDC records were not handed over in their full stenographically recorded form but were produced as extended minutes. That means that they were shorter than steno-notes but longer than the regular minutes. The dates of the missing meetings or the meetings where this lesser form of record was provided, as I recall, were significant \u2013 namely dates leading up to, surrounding and in the aftermath of the Srebrenica massacre. The full records of those meetings need yet to be provided. At the same time, these documents, significant as they are, do not constitute a single body of evidence that will explain once and for all what happened and who was culpable. They do provide a much fuller context and provide some very valuable testimonials of things that were said by Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and others. In their un-redacted form they would point all who are interested (not just governments and lawyers) to other documents that have never been provided and that might well be more candid than the words of those at the SD Council meetings who knew they were being recorded by a stenographer. Second, it should also be remembered that there are other protected document collections and individual documents which were, and still are, protected by direct agreements between Belgrade and the former OTP Prosecutor, i.e. they were not protected by the Trial Chamber. These documents are difficult now to identify but if and when Bosnia-Herzegovina decides to reopen the ICJ case it will be essential to require Serbia and/or the ICTY to produce all those documents for the ICJ.<ref>KBSA 2000, [http://www.kbsa2000kbs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=256:sir-geoffrey-nice-rtve-srebrenice-ivi-i-mrtvi-zasluuju-istinu&catid=45:intervju&Itemid=107 Interview with Sir Geofrey Nice, \"The Victims of Srebrenica, Living and Dead, Deserve Truth\"] [scroll down the page for English version]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==European Court of Human Rights==\n{{Main|Doboj massacre|Fo\u010da massacres}}\nThe Higher Regional Court of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, in September 1997, handed down a genocide conviction against [[Nikola Jorgi\u0107]], a Bosnian Serb who was the leader of a paramilitary group located in the [[Doboj]] region.

Had the International Court of Justice accepted this finding of the Tribunal, Serbia would have been found guilty of complicity in the Srebrenica genocide. Instead it concluded that the Appeals Chamber in the Tadic case \"did not attempt to determine the responsibility of a state but individual criminal responsibility\".

Although the ICJ could have subpoenaed the documents directly from Serbia, it did not do so and relied instead on those made public during the ICTY trials. Two of the ICJ judges criticised this decision in strongly worded dissents. Marlise Simons reporting on this in ''[[The New York Times]]'', states that \"When the documents were handed over [to the ICTY], the lawyers said, a team from Belgrade made it clear in letters to the tribunal and in meetings with prosecutors and judges that it wanted the documents expurgated to keep them from harming Serbia's case at the International Court of Justice. The Serbs made no secret of that even as they argued their case for 'national security,' said one of the lawyers, adding, 'The senior people here [at the ICTY] knew about this'.\". Simons continues that [[Rosalyn Higgins]] the president of the ICJ, declined to comment when asked why the full records had not been subpoenaed, saying that \"The ruling speaks for itself\". Diane Orentlicher, a law professor at [[American University]] in Washington, commented \"Why didn't the court request the full documents? The fact that they were blacked out clearly implies these passages would have made a difference.\", and William Schabas, a professor of international law at the University of Ireland in Galway, suggested that as a civil rather than a criminal court, the ICJ was more used to relying on materials put before it than aggressively pursuing evidence which might lead to a diplomatic incident.<ref>Marlise Simons.\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/world/europe/09archives.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin Genocide Court Ruled for Serbia Without Seeing Full War Archive], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 April 2007 <!--Retrieved 31 July 2008 --></ref>\n\n===Denial===\n{{Main|Bosnian genocide denial}}\nWriters, including [[Edward S.

Pages 21\u201326) [PDF FORMAT]http://www.infolink.co.il/intjewishlawyers/docenter/frames.asp?id=16867</ref> described the Court's conclusions on the three questions before it as controversial:\n\n{{quote|First, as far as the jurisdictional part of the decision goes, the court has been severely criticized for unjustifiably over-stretching the concept of ''res judicata'' to decisions on jurisdiction rendered at an earlier stage of the same proceedings; for over-relying on legal conclusions that were decided at earlier stages without serious consideration; and for narrowly construing its powers of revision. Indeed, seven out of the fifteen judges on the bench expressed varying degrees of unease with this particular outcome.\n\nSecond, as for the actual findings on the commission of genocide, some writers have criticized the court for refusing to look at the 'bigger picture' of the events in Bosnia \u2013 a picture that seems to suggest that the various atrocious crimes meted out by the Bosnian Serbs were all part of the same 'master-plan' of creating an ethnically homogeneous Serbian state. Others have questioned the court's readiness to rely on the absence of individual convictions in genocide by the ICTY (except with relation to the massacre in Srebrenica), without properly considering the difference between standards of liability under criminal law and state responsibility or fully appreciating the limited probative value of reduced charges as the result of plea bargains.\n\nThird, with respect to the question of Serbian responsibility, the court's legal analysis of attribution standards, the reluctance to find Serbia to be an accomplice to genocide, and the decision to refrain from ordering reparations, have all been criticized as excessively conservative. At the same time, the court's expansive reading of Article 1 of the Genocide Convention as potentially imposing on all states a duty to prevent genocide, even if committed outside their territory, has been noted for its remarkable boldness. Still, some writers have criticized the court for not clarifying whether Article 1 can provide an independent basis for exercising of universal jurisdiction against individual perpetrators of genocide. So, arguably, the court construed broadly the duty to prevent genocide while narrowly construing the duty to punish its perpetrators.}}\n\nAntonio Cassese, the first president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, criticized the ICJ judgement on the ground that \"The International Court has set an unrealistically high standard of proof for finding Serbia complicit in genocide.\" He added:\n\n{{quote|The ICJ, which&nbsp;... deals with controversies between states, was faced with Bosnia's claim that Serbia was responsible for the Srebrenica massacre. Although the Court ruled that genocide had taken place, it decided that Serbia was not responsible under international law.\n\nAccording to the Court, the Bosnian Serb generals who were guilty of this genocide, the various Mladi\u0107's and Krsti\u0107's, were neither acting as Serbia's agents nor receiving specific instructions from Belgrade&nbsp;... Why was it not enough to prove that the Bosnian Serb military leadership was financed and paid by Serbia and that it was tightly connected to Serbia political and military leadership? More importantly, the ICJ's decision that Serbia is responsible for not having prevented a genocide in which it was not complicit makes little sense. According to the Court, Serbia was aware of the very high risk of acts of genocide and did nothing. But Serbia was not complicit, the Court argued, because \"it has not been proven\" that the intention of committing the acts of genocide at Srebrenica \"had been brought to Belgrade's attention\".\n\nThis is a puzzling statement at best. The massacre was prepared in detail and took place over the course of six days (between 13 and 19 July). Is it plausible that the Serbian authorities remained in the dark while the killing was in progress and reported in the press all over the world?<ref>A judicial massacre, The Guardian, 27 February 2007. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/27/thejudicialmassacreofsrebr</ref>}}\n\nThe Vice-President of the International Court of Justice, Judge Al-Khasawneh, criticized the judgement as not reflecting the evidence with respect to Serbia's direct responsibility for genocide at Srebrenica:\n\n<blockquote>The 'effective control' test for attribution established in the Nicaragua case is not suitable to questions of State responsibility for international crimes committed with a common purpose. The 'overall control' test for attribution established in the Tadi\u0107 case is more appropriate when the commission of international crimes is the common objective of the controlling State and the non-State actors. The Court's refusal to infer genocidal intent from a consistent pattern of conduct in Bosnia and Herzegovina is inconsistent with the established jurisprudence of the ICTY. The FRY's knowledge of the genocide set to unfold in Srebrenica is clearly established. The Court should have treated the Scorpions as a de jure organ of the FRY. The statement by the Serbian Council of Ministers in response to the massacre of Muslim men by the Scorpions amounted to an admission of responsibility. The Court failed to appreciate the definitional complexity of the crime of genocide and to assess the facts before it accordingly.<ref>Dissenting opinion of Judge Al-Khasawneh, Vice-President of the International Court of Justice, {{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13689.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629193241/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13689.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Missing SDC Records====\nThe International Criminal Tribunal never received a complete archive of the Supreme Defense Council minutes from Serbia. According to the explanation given by Sir Geoffrey Nice, former prosecutor in the trial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107:\n\n<blockquote>First, it is important to note that Serbia did not hand over to the Prosecution (OTP) the complete collection of SDC [Supreme Defense Council] records. For example, for the year 1995 the OTP received recordings for only about half of all the sessions held by SDC. Further, some of the SDC records were not handed over in their full stenographically recorded form but were produced as extended minutes. That means that they were shorter than steno-notes but longer than the regular minutes. The dates of the missing meetings or the meetings where this lesser form of record was provided, as I recall, were significant \u2013 namely dates leading up to, surrounding and in the aftermath of the Srebrenica massacre. The full records of those meetings need yet to be provided. At the same time, these documents, significant as they are, do not constitute a single body of evidence that will explain once and for all what happened and who was culpable. They do provide a much fuller context and provide some very valuable testimonials of things that were said by Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and others. In their un-redacted form they would point all who are interested (not just governments and lawyers) to other documents that have never been provided and that might well be more candid than the words of those at the SD Council meetings who knew they were being recorded by a stenographer. Second, it should also be remembered that there are other protected document collections and individual documents which were, and still are, protected by direct agreements between Belgrade and the former OTP Prosecutor, i.e. they were not protected by the Trial Chamber. These documents are difficult now to identify but if and when Bosnia-Herzegovina decides to reopen the ICJ case it will be essential to require Serbia and/or the ICTY to produce all those documents for the ICJ.<ref>KBSA 2000, [http://www.kbsa2000kbs.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=256:sir-geoffrey-nice-rtve-srebrenice-ivi-i-mrtvi-zasluuju-istinu&catid=45:intervju&Itemid=107 Interview with Sir Geofrey Nice, \"The Victims of Srebrenica, Living and Dead, Deserve Truth\"] [scroll down the page for English version]</ref></blockquote>\n\n==European Court of Human Rights==\n{{Main|Doboj massacre|Fo\u010da massacres}}\nThe Higher Regional Court of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, in September 1997, handed down a genocide conviction against [[Nikola Jorgi\u0107]], a Bosnian Serb who was the leader of a paramilitary group located in the [[Doboj]] region.

In the judgment delivered in July 1999, the Appeals Chamber found that the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] was \"under overall control\" of [[Belgrade]] and the [[Yugoslav Army]], which meant that they had funded, equipped and assisted in the coordination and the planning of military operations. Had the International Court of Justice accepted this finding of the Tribunal, Serbia would have been found guilty of complicity in the Srebrenica genocide. Instead it concluded that the Appeals Chamber in the Tadic case \"did not attempt to determine the responsibility of a state but individual criminal responsibility\".

Although the ICJ could have subpoenaed the documents directly from Serbia, it did not do so and relied instead on those made public during the ICTY trials. Two of the ICJ judges criticised this decision in strongly worded dissents. Marlise Simons reporting on this in ''[[The New York Times]]'', states that \"When the documents were handed over [to the ICTY], the lawyers said, a team from Belgrade made it clear in letters to the tribunal and in meetings with prosecutors and judges that it wanted the documents expurgated to keep them from harming Serbia's case at the International Court of Justice. The Serbs made no secret of that even as they argued their case for 'national security,' said one of the lawyers, adding, 'The senior people here [at the ICTY] knew about this'.\". Simons continues that [[Rosalyn Higgins]] the president of the ICJ, declined to comment when asked why the full records had not been subpoenaed, saying that \"The ruling speaks for itself\". Diane Orentlicher, a law professor at [[American University]] in Washington, commented \"Why didn't the court request the full documents? The fact that they were blacked out clearly implies these passages would have made a difference.\", and William Schabas, a professor of international law at the University of Ireland in Galway, suggested that as a civil rather than a criminal court, the ICJ was more used to relying on materials put before it than aggressively pursuing evidence which might lead to a diplomatic incident.<ref>Marlise Simons.\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/09/world/europe/09archives.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&oref=slogin Genocide Court Ruled for Serbia Without Seeing Full War Archive], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 April 2007 <!--Retrieved 31 July 2008 --></ref>\n\n===Denial===\n{{Main|Bosnian genocide denial}}\nWriters, including [[Edward S.

He took over the [[Cwmtillery]] Colliery in 1852, sinking new shafts there in 1853 and 1858, and in 1864 incorporated Cwmtillery into his South Wales Colliery Company.<ref name=verity/><ref name=wialhs/>\n\nIt was said that Russell's collieries in South Wales were so prone to accidents that he had to bring workers in from [[Somerset]], [[Dorset]], [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Wiltshire]].  In 1846, an explosion at the Blackvein colliery at Risca resulted in the deaths of 35 men; more were killed in explosions in 1849 and 1853.  The worst disaster occurred on 1 December 1860, when 146 men were killed in an explosion at the Blackvein colliery.  As a result of the loss of life and legal arguments over rights with Lord Tredegar, the Risca Colliery Company was bankrupted, and the Blackvein colliery was sold.<ref name=verity/><ref name=wialhs/>  \n \nRussell also had business interests in iron workings in the [[Forest of Dean]], and in the [[Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company]].

In 1855, after having leased [[Piercefield Park]] at Chepstow for several years, he  bought that property, but sold it in 1861 in order to set up a trust for the families of the miners killed in the Blackvein disaster and returned to Terhill.  In 1867, he bought [[Badgeworth|Badgeworth Court]] near [[Churchdown]], [[Gloucestershire]].  He also owned a house in [[Westbourne Park, London|Westbourne Park]] in [[London]].<ref name=verity/><ref name=wialhs/>\n\nRussell was appointed as a [[Justice of the Peace]] in 1842, and [[High Sheriff of Monmouthshire]] in 1855.

The most recent Diablos were a member of the South Division of the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball]], which is not affiliated with [[Major League Baseball]]. From 1990 to 2013, the Diablos, in both incarnations, played their home games at [[Cohen Stadium]]. The team's name means \"[[devil]]s\" in the Spanish language.\n\n==Team history==\n\n=== A Maverick Beginning... ===\n\nThe team has its roots going back to 1892, when the team was originally called the El Paso Browns.  The name eventually changed to the Mavericks.  In 1913, the El Paso Mavericks played in the Copper League, which consisted of teams from [[Silver City, New Mexico|Silver City]], [[Hurley, New Mexico|Hurley]], and [[Santa Rita, New Mexico]].  Despite coming in third place that season, the Mavericks went on to win the post season tournament, becoming the Southwestern Champions of 1913.  In 1915, the Mavericks joined the Rio Grande Association, a Class D minor league.  Though the league folded after a year, the Mavericks continued to play in some form or another.\n\nIn 1924, the longtime home for the team, Dudley Field (known, locally as the \"Dudley Dome\") named for El Paso Mayor R.M. \"Dick\" Dudley, was constructed in South El Paso.  While technically not a Dome in any sense of the word, the stadium had a supernatural ability to avoid rain showers and the unique ability to keep the temperature inside the stadium the same as that outside of the stadium.  Another unique feature of the park was that the structure under the main grandstand was constructed out of adobe.  A final feature, one that would be used by the Brewers to test their pitchers in the future was that it was notoriously hitter friendly.  Due to its cozy dimensions (340-395-340), pitchers had to work hard to make sure their ERAs would at least be below five.\n\nIn 1922, Syd and Andy Cohen played for the Mavericks and later played in the Major Leagues.  Andy Cohen was a second baseman for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], and Syd was a pitcher for several different teams in the [[American League]], though he would be the last pitcher to strike out [[Babe Ruth]]. Syd also pitched in the Mexican leagues and later managed the Juarez team.\n\n===From Mavericks to Texans===\n\nIn 1930, the team, now known as the El Paso Texans, was admitted to the Arizona State League in 1930 to replace the defunct Mesa Jewels.  The Arizona State League included teams from Phoenix, Tucson, and Douglas.  El Paso was the only Texas team in the league and missed winning the pennant by only half a game, losing to the Bisbee Bees.\n\nThe Texans remained in this league for decades.  In 1931, the Arizona State League became the [[Arizona\u2013Texas League]], which ran from 1931\u201332 and revived in 1937\u20131941.  In 1940, the League was made into a Class C league.  The league halted play from 1942 to 1946 because of World War II, though the Texans did play in the [[Mexican National League]] for one year, in 1946.  The Arizona\u2013Texas League play resumed in 1947, until 1950, when the league merged with the [[Sunset League]] to form the [[Southwest International League]].  This league only lasted for a year before reverting into the Arizona\u2013Texas League.\n\nIn 1950, owner Jack Corbett sold the team in August to Dick Saunders and Tom Love, two young El Paso building contractors.  Saunders and Love hired John Phelan to be the general manager.  The Texans finished in second only to their rivals, the [[Juarez Indios]], at the end of the season.\n\nIn 1951, the [[New York Yankees]] (featuring a young rookie named [[Mickey Mantle]]) came to El Paso to play an exhibition game against the Texans, winning 16\u201310. In 1954, the team was sold to Dick Azar, the El Paso Coors distributor who brought beer to the ballpark for the first time.  Beer was sold during the game and was given to the players in their dressing room free of charge after the games.\n\nAfter losing money for two seasons, Azar sold the team to Pat McLaughlin in 1956.  The team won the Southwestern League pennant that season, but only 51,386 fans came to see the Texans play all season.  Due to money problems, McLaughlin handed the team in 1957 to Tom McHugh, S.E. Adams and Jimmy Hamilton.  At the end of the season, the Southwestern League dropped the El Paso Texans.\n\n===The dawn of the Sun Kings===\n\nProfessional baseball was not played in El Paso again until 1961 when a group of 40 people, known as the Sports Development Committee of the El Paso Chamber of Commerce, took it upon themselves to revive it.  John Phelan, the Texans former manager, was named Vice President and General Manager.  Each of the 40 people put up to $500 to help finance the team.  Phelan and the committee managed to get the organization into the Class D [[Sophomore League]] and renamed the team the '''El Paso Sun Kings'''. The Sun Kings had a terrific season, finishing in third, and, for the first time, turned a profit.\n\nIn 1962, the Sun Kings joined the [[Texas League|Class AA Texas League]].  The organization's rookie season was a huge success, as they won the [[Texas League]] championship.  In 1963, the team hit 207 home runs, setting a new league record for most home runs in a season.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1964, the El Paso Ball club had been affiliated with the [[San Francisco Giants]], their most notable player coming through the system at the time being [[Jes\u00fas Alou]] of the famous baseball family.  In 1965, the Sun Kings became a farm team for the [[California Angels]].\nThe Sports Development Committee sold the team to Angels owner [[Gene Autry]] for $1, fulfilling their mission of bringing professional baseball back to El Paso.  John Stanfill replaced John Phelan as general manager in 1967, and the team came in second to Albuquerque, which won the [[Texas League]] pennant that season. In the sixties several future major leaguers got their start in El Paso including Jos\u00e9 Cardenal and Randy Hundly. Several Hundly relatives have made it big in the majors. The most publicized of the young players was Dick Dietz who it was told got a $500,000 signing bonus. During the Sun Kings' tenure as an Angel Affiliate, one of their most famous prospects passed through their system:  a young second base prospect by the name of [[Kurt Russell]].  Russell led the league in hitting with a .563 batting average.  However, during a play, he was hit in the shoulder by another player running to second base, the collision resulting in a torn rotator cuff in his shoulder. The injury forced his retirement from baseball in 1973, and he returned to acting.  Russell recently told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that before his injury, he was going to be called up. During this era players collected dollar bills from the chicken wire fence between the stands and the field for outstanding play.\n\nThe partnership with the Angels lasted until 1970.  The city was without a team for one year until 1972 when the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] brought in their AA affiliate and the team's name was changed to Sun Dodgers for the season. The partnership with the Angels resumed and the name reverted to Sun Kings in 1973.<ref name=\"elpasotimes1\">{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Bill|title=El Paso Diablos look back on long history|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_23936674/diablos-baseball-final-homestand|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=El Paso Times|date=August 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Diablos and other Minor League revolutionaries===\nIn 1974, Jim Paul bought the team for $1000 and assumed the team's $52,000 in outstanding debt, and proceeded to revolutionize baseball, not only in El Paso but throughout the Minor Leagues and even influence the Majors.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hassler|first1=Rick|title=Game changer: Jim Paul's El Paso Diablos|url=http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_fc90a576-ce34-11e3-b072-001a4bcf6878.html|accessdate=19 July 2014|work=El Paso Inc.|date=April 27, 2014}}</ref> Paul's purchase of the team ushered in the golden age of El Paso baseball. The name of the team was changed to the Diablos, the Spanish word for \"[[devil]]s\". Paul held numerous innovative promotions and promoted a lively, fan-friendly atmosphere at the ballpark. Sparing any expense, save a coat of bright yellow paint with the word \"BASEBALL\" written in twelve foot tall red letters, Dudley Field was converted to \"The Dudley Dome.\" While technically not a dome in any sense of the word, the field had a supernatural ability to avoid rain-outs and the unique ability to keep the temperature inside the stadium the same as that outside of the stadium. The home team dugout had the word \"diablos\" painted on top while the visitors dugout received a coat of paint that said \"enemy.\" Upon entering the turnstiles fans were given a facial tissue to use for \"Bye, Bye, Baby\" when the visiting team changed pitchers the outgoing pitcher was serenaded by the [[Janis Joplin]] tune over the PA system while the fans in the grandstand waved their tissues. One notable victim was [[Dennis Eckersly]] who acknowledged the crowd by tipping his hat, though others were not so considerate and the [[Texas League]] created a standard fine for those obscene gestures. Other promotions included 10\u00a2 hotdog night, nickel beer night, and Martinez Appreciation Night where anyone with the last name Martinez received free admission.\n\nPaul's innovative marketing techniques showed outstanding results. In 1975 despite finishing 18 \u00bd games out of first place the Diablos drew 162,395 fans, more than every other Class AA team and 16 of the 24 [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] teams. Paul was named [[Sporting News]]' Class Double A Executive of the Year in 1974 and 1975. in 1976 the Diablos came in third and attendance increased to 181,747, outdrawing all but 6 teams in the minor leagues, and were awarded the MacPhail Trophy, which is given to the outstanding organization in all minor league baseball. In 1977 the Diablos finished in first place and drew 217,345 fans which outpaced all but 4 [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] teams and Paul was once again recognized as [[Sporting News]]' Class Double A Executive of the Year for a third time.\n\nIn 1978 the Diablos completed a 9-game winning streak to back-door the Texas League Western Division Championship and then swept the Jackson Mets in a best of 5 series to claim the Texas League banner.  During that 12-game winning streak, the [[San Diego Chicken]] made his debut outside the San Diego area and his minor league debut by performing in the final regular game of the season before a more than sold out stadium.  It was the catalyst to launch his career during his hiatus from San Diego due to court injunctions that prevented him from performing for the Padres.\n\nIn 1980, the Diablos began airing all of their baseball games on radio station [[KHEY (AM)]] AM-690 and simulcast select homegames on Paragon Cable, with current UTEP football announcer [[Jon Teicher]] as its first play-by-play announcer. Other notable Diablos announcers include current play-by-play announcer for the [[Oakland A's]] [[Vince Cotroneo]] (1985\u20131987), and [[Matt Vasgersian]] (1993\u20131995) who currently provides play-by-play for [[Fox Sports]]' [[Major League Baseball]] coverage and is a studio host for [[MLB Network]].<ref name=\"elpasotimes1\"/>\n\nIn 1981, the Diablos became an affiliate of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], a relationship which lasted until 1999.  Tony Muser was the manager for the first two seasons.\n\nAlso in 1981, Texaco sponsored the installation of a $70,000 electronic scoreboard at Dudley Field, previously the scoreboard had been hand operated.  The Diablos won the Texas League Pennant in 1986.  In 1988, the Diablos also had a young prospect named [[Gary Sheffield]].\n\nHowever, as the decade continued, the old [[Dudley Field (El Paso)|Dudley Dome]] was showing its age.  It became apparent that the team would need a new facility, as the city was expanding and the Dudley Dome was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.  Construction began in the growing Northeast area of El Paso on a new facility. With the stadium not completed in time for the start of the 1990 season the Diablos continued to play at [[Dudley Field|Dudley Dome]]. On June 13, 1990 the Diablos said farewell to the [[Dudley Field|Dudley Dome]], their home of 65 years, and greeted their new ballpark, [[Cohen Stadium]], named after the Cohen brothers, who had returned to El Paso to work for the club. The [[Dudley Field|Dudley Dome]] continued to have tenants however, hosting the El Paso Patriots Soccer Club, and the final tenant the El Paso Scorpions Rugby Club.  Dudley Field was finally demolished on November 5, 2005 to make room for the new African wing of the [[El Paso Zoo]].\n\nIn 1990, [[Cohen Stadium]] opened to the public, becoming an immediate success for the team.  That same year, it became the only minor league ballpark to grace the cover of ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]''.  In 1993 The Diablos became the first Double A team to ever draw 300,000 fans.  The Diablos won the [[Texas League]] pennant again in 1994 and remained competitive for several years after.\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:EPDiamondbacks.gif|right|thumb|300px|The New Diablos (Class AA \u2013 Diamondbacks 1999\u20132004)]] -->\n\nIn 1999, the Diablos ended their relationship with [[Milwaukee Brewers|Brewers]], and soon agreed to become the Double A affiliate for the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].  Around the same time, Paul, after years of building the Diablos into the model franchise, sold the team to Brett Sports and Entertainment, a sports conglomerate headed by former major leaguer [[George Brett]].\n\n===The death of the El Paso Diablos?===\n\nThis change instead signalled the beginning of the end of Minor League baseball in El Paso.  The Diablos ceased many of the promotions that made the team successful earlier, and the lack of strong players (save for the brief time that [[Brad Penny]] spent in the organization) in the Arizona system rendered the team weak and unsuccessful.  With the exception of making the playoffs in 2000, the team was largely dismal and the atmosphere around the park had largely changed from the lighthearted atmosphere that had existed during the Jim Paul era.\n\nOne other factor that affected attendance was the constant rumors that the team would be moved, rumors that Brett Sports and Entertainment would refuse to admit or deny. With every stadium construction that seemed to take place around the country, the Diablos would always be linked as a possible tenant. Furthermore, Brett Sports and Entertainment demanded the city of El Paso make millions in renovations to [[Cohen Stadium]], which the city refused when there was no indication that the team would be staying. There was a brief spike in attendance on July 11, 2003 when [[Randy Johnson]] made a rehab start, but attendance remained low and the team began to hemorrhage money.\n\nIn 2004, with the Diablos\u2019 contract with the Diamondbacks soon to expire, ownership made no move to re-sign with the Diamondbacks.  While there was speculation of the team possibly changing teams, Diablo fans' worst fears were realized when it was announced that the team had been sold to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for an estimated $9.8 million.  Public backlash  resulted; Brett Sports and Entertainment attempted to search for a team to replace the departing Diablos, but in the end, the Diablos moved to [[Springfield, Missouri]] to become the [[Springfield Cardinals]] (for more  information on the original team's history at this point, see the corresponding article).\n\n===The rebirth of the El Paso Diablos===\nHowever, the move of the team signalled a new beginning of the Diablos.  In 2005, it was announced that the independent [[Central Baseball League]] had granted a franchise to Mark Schuster, who brought back the Diablos to begin play that same year. Former [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] first-baseman/right fielder [[Mike Marshall (outfielder)|Mike Marshall]] was selected to manage the team.  The front office returned to the management style that had been in use during the Jim Paul era, bringing back many fans that had become disenchanted with the team in recent years.\n\nThe team's debut on May 6, 2005, set a league attendance record of 10,116.  Though the team finished in last during the first half of the season, the Diablos came alive in the second half, finishing in third and just missing the playoffs. The team set an attendance record for the league, finishing with an attendance of 190,429. The team also had several other special moments throughout the year. On Friday, July 8, 2005, former major leaguer and El Paso native [[Rocky Coppinger]] took the mound for a start. On July 27, the [[Florida Marlins]] purchased the contract of RHP Andy Torres from the Diablos.\n\nFollowing the end of the season, the Diablos announced that they would join with several fellow Central League members including the [[Coastal Bend Aviators]], the [[Fort Worth Cats]], the [[Pensacola Pelicans]], and the [[Shreveport Sports]] and join with former [[Northern League (baseball, 1993\u20132010)|Northern League]] teams the [[St. Paul Saints|Saint Paul Saints]], [[Sioux City Explorers]], the [[Sioux Falls Fighting Pheasants|Sioux Falls Pheasants]], and the [[Lincoln Saltdogs]] to form the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball]] as an independent minor league. The league began play in 2006 with a 96-game schedule along with an expansion team in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] known as the [[St. Joseph Blacksnakes|Blacksnakes]]. The league's first All-Star game was in [[El Paso, Texas]] and played against the [[Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball|Can-Am League]] in July 2006.\n\nWith the second season beginning in May 2006, the Diablos had an air of hope around them and were expected to contend in their new league.  However, the team had vastly changed from the year before thanks to the purchase of closer [[Derrick DePriest]] by the [[Kansas City Royals]] on February 13, 2006.  Also, upon Marshalls request, several members of the San Angelo Colts were signed, giving the Diablos possibly the most powerful offensive unit in the league, but the pitching staff that had been so mediocre the year before was unchanged.  The team stumbled badly at the start of the season. The offense was dormant through much of the time, a factor that was worsened when offensive star Juan Camacho was bought by the Chicago White Sox on May 29. With the team floundering, on June 16, 2006, Marshall was released and replaced in the coming days by former major league pitcher [[Butch Henry]], a graduate of El Paso's [[Eastwood High School (El Paso, Texas)|Eastwood High School]]. Though Henry provided some improvement, the team was still terrible and continued to struggle. The Diablos would lose shortstop Albenis Machado on August 13 when he was sold to the Chicago Cubs and eight days later would be on the receiving end of a [[no-hitter]] by Fort Worth Cats pitcher Joel Kirsten. The Diablos would ultimately finish last in the Southern Division.\n\nWith new manager Butch Henry on board the Diablos were expected to be a much better team for the 2007 season, and they did finish the first half of the season in first place in the Southern Division with 28 wins and 23 losses and 4 games ahead of second place Shreveport and automatically getting a spot for the league play-offs \u2013 their first play-off appearance since the 2000 season when they were in the AA Texas League. Another exciting thing happened in the first half of the season on the 4th of July, the Diablos set the league attendance single-game record with more than 11,000 fans attending a game.\n\n===The end, again===\nAfter a disappointing 2011 baseball season, Schuster sold the Diablos to the [[Ysleta del Sur Pueblo|Tigua Tribe]], a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kdbc.com/news/el-paso-diablos-have-new-owners |title=El Paso Diablos Have New Owners |publisher=KDBC.com |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>\n\nThe Diablos were replaced by the [[El Paso Chihuahuas]] of the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Pacific Coast League]] for the [[2014 in baseball|2014 baseball season]].  This coincided with the opening of a [[Southwest University Park|new baseball stadium]] in downtown El Paso, which replaced Cohen Stadium as the home of professional baseball in El Paso.\n\nThe Diablos relocated to [[Joe Becker Stadium]] in [[Joplin, Missouri]], as the [[Joplin Blasters]] beginning with the 2015 season.<ref name=\"jogl131123\">{{cite news |first=Debby |last=Woodin |newspaper=[[The Joplin Globe]] |publisher= |title=Landing pro squad would require city to upgrade historic Joe Becker Stadium |url=http://www.joplinglobe.com/topstories/x296455995/Landing-pro-squad-would-require-city-to-upgrade-historic-Joe-Becker-Stadium |date=November 23, 2013 |accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"koam140122\">{{cite news |first=Calley |last=Dougherty |publisher=[[KOAM-TV]] |location=Pittsburg, Kansas |title=Joplin City Council approves lease agreement for Joe Becker Stadium |url=http://www.koamtv.com/story/24513546/joplin-city-council-approves-lease-agreement-for-joe-becker-stadium |date=January 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Notable Diablo alumni===\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Willie Aikens]]\n*[[Jes\u00fas Alou]]\n*[[Jim Anderson (baseball)|Jim Anderson]]\n*[[John Balaz]]\n*[[Ralph Botting]]\n*[[Tom Brunansky]]\n*[[Tom Candiotti]]\n*[[Mark Clear]]\n*[[Andy Cohen (baseball)|Andy Cohen]]\n*[[Syd Cohen]]\n*[[Tim Crews]]\n*[[Paul Dade]]\n*[[Narciso Elvira]]\n*[[Bob Ferris]]\n*[[Danny Goodwin]]\n*[[Brian Harper]]\n*[[Teddy Higuera]]\n*[[Conor Jackson]]\n*[[John Jaha]]\n*[[Randy Johnson]]\n*[[Byung-hyun Kim]]\n*[[Fred Kuhaulua]]\n*[[Ken Landreaux]]\n*[[Carney Lansford]]\n*[[Cory Lidle]]\n*[[Lyle Overbay]]\n*[[Brad Penny]]\n*[[Carlos Quentin]]\n*[[Floyd Rayford]]\n*[[Kurt Russell]]\n*[[Ken Schrom]]\n*[[Daryl Sconiers]]\n*[[Gary Sheffield]]\n*[[Chris Snyder]]\n*[[Chad Tracy]]\n*[[Dan Uggla]]\n*[[Brandon Webb]]\n*[[Mike Witt]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19961103063237/http://www.diablos.com/ El Paso Diablos official website]\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?city=El%20Paso&state=TX&country=US&empty=0 Baseball Reference]\n*[http://epcc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=309255&sid=2626247 \"A Baseball Team by Any Other Name\".

The most recent Diablos were a member of the South Division of the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball]], which is not affiliated with [[Major League Baseball]]. From 1990 to 2013, the Diablos, in both incarnations, played their home games at [[Cohen Stadium]]. The team's name means \"[[devil]]s\" in the Spanish language.\n\n==Team history==\n\n=== A Maverick Beginning... ===\n\nThe team has its roots going back to 1892, when the team was originally called the El Paso Browns.  The name eventually changed to the Mavericks.  In 1913, the El Paso Mavericks played in the Copper League, which consisted of teams from [[Silver City, New Mexico|Silver City]], [[Hurley, New Mexico|Hurley]], and [[Santa Rita, New Mexico]].  Despite coming in third place that season, the Mavericks went on to win the post season tournament, becoming the Southwestern Champions of 1913.  In 1915, the Mavericks joined the Rio Grande Association, a Class D minor league.  Though the league folded after a year, the Mavericks continued to play in some form or another.\n\nIn 1924, the longtime home for the team, Dudley Field (known, locally as the \"Dudley Dome\") named for El Paso Mayor R.M. \"Dick\" Dudley, was constructed in South El Paso.  While technically not a Dome in any sense of the word, the stadium had a supernatural ability to avoid rain showers and the unique ability to keep the temperature inside the stadium the same as that outside of the stadium.  Another unique feature of the park was that the structure under the main grandstand was constructed out of adobe.  A final feature, one that would be used by the Brewers to test their pitchers in the future was that it was notoriously hitter friendly.  Due to its cozy dimensions (340-395-340), pitchers had to work hard to make sure their ERAs would at least be below five.\n\nIn 1922, Syd and Andy Cohen played for the Mavericks and later played in the Major Leagues.  Andy Cohen was a second baseman for the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], and Syd was a pitcher for several different teams in the [[American League]], though he would be the last pitcher to strike out [[Babe Ruth]]. Syd also pitched in the Mexican leagues and later managed the Juarez team.\n\n===From Mavericks to Texans===\n\nIn 1930, the team, now known as the El Paso Texans, was admitted to the Arizona State League in 1930 to replace the defunct Mesa Jewels.  The Arizona State League included teams from Phoenix, Tucson, and Douglas.  El Paso was the only Texas team in the league and missed winning the pennant by only half a game, losing to the Bisbee Bees.\n\nThe Texans remained in this league for decades.  In 1931, the Arizona State League became the [[Arizona\u2013Texas League]], which ran from 1931\u201332 and revived in 1937\u20131941.  In 1940, the League was made into a Class C league.  The league halted play from 1942 to 1946 because of World War II, though the Texans did play in the [[Mexican National League]] for one year, in 1946.  The Arizona\u2013Texas League play resumed in 1947, until 1950, when the league merged with the [[Sunset League]] to form the [[Southwest International League]].  This league only lasted for a year before reverting into the Arizona\u2013Texas League.\n\nIn 1950, owner Jack Corbett sold the team in August to Dick Saunders and Tom Love, two young El Paso building contractors.  Saunders and Love hired John Phelan to be the general manager.  The Texans finished in second only to their rivals, the [[Juarez Indios]], at the end of the season.\n\nIn 1951, the [[New York Yankees]] (featuring a young rookie named [[Mickey Mantle]]) came to El Paso to play an exhibition game against the Texans, winning 16\u201310. In 1954, the team was sold to Dick Azar, the El Paso Coors distributor who brought beer to the ballpark for the first time.  Beer was sold during the game and was given to the players in their dressing room free of charge after the games.\n\nAfter losing money for two seasons, Azar sold the team to Pat McLaughlin in 1956.  The team won the Southwestern League pennant that season, but only 51,386 fans came to see the Texans play all season.  Due to money problems, McLaughlin handed the team in 1957 to Tom McHugh, S.E. Adams and Jimmy Hamilton.  At the end of the season, the Southwestern League dropped the El Paso Texans.\n\n===The dawn of the Sun Kings===\n\nProfessional baseball was not played in El Paso again until 1961 when a group of 40 people, known as the Sports Development Committee of the El Paso Chamber of Commerce, took it upon themselves to revive it.  John Phelan, the Texans former manager, was named Vice President and General Manager.  Each of the 40 people put up to $500 to help finance the team.  Phelan and the committee managed to get the organization into the Class D [[Sophomore League]] and renamed the team the '''El Paso Sun Kings'''. The Sun Kings had a terrific season, finishing in third, and, for the first time, turned a profit.\n\nIn 1962, the Sun Kings joined the [[Texas League|Class AA Texas League]].  The organization's rookie season was a huge success, as they won the [[Texas League]] championship.  In 1963, the team hit 207 home runs, setting a new league record for most home runs in a season.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1964, the El Paso Ball club had been affiliated with the [[San Francisco Giants]], their most notable player coming through the system at the time being [[Jes\u00fas Alou]] of the famous baseball family.  In 1965, the Sun Kings became a farm team for the [[California Angels]].\nThe Sports Development Committee sold the team to Angels owner [[Gene Autry]] for $1, fulfilling their mission of bringing professional baseball back to El Paso.  John Stanfill replaced John Phelan as general manager in 1967, and the team came in second to Albuquerque, which won the [[Texas League]] pennant that season. In the sixties several future major leaguers got their start in El Paso including Jos\u00e9 Cardenal and Randy Hundly. Several Hundly relatives have made it big in the majors. The most publicized of the young players was Dick Dietz who it was told got a $500,000 signing bonus. During the Sun Kings' tenure as an Angel Affiliate, one of their most famous prospects passed through their system:  a young second base prospect by the name of [[Kurt Russell]].  Russell led the league in hitting with a .563 batting average.  However, during a play, he was hit in the shoulder by another player running to second base, the collision resulting in a torn rotator cuff in his shoulder. The injury forced his retirement from baseball in 1973, and he returned to acting.  Russell recently told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that before his injury, he was going to be called up. During this era players collected dollar bills from the chicken wire fence between the stands and the field for outstanding play.\n\nThe partnership with the Angels lasted until 1970.  The city was without a team for one year until 1972 when the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] brought in their AA affiliate and the teams name was changed to Sun Dodgers for the season. The partnership with the Angels resumed and the name reverted to Sun Kings in 1973.<ref name=\"elpasotimes1\">{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Bill|title=El Paso Diablos look back on long history|url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/ci_23936674/diablos-baseball-final-homestand|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=El Paso Times|date=August 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Diablos and other Minor League revolutionaries===\nIn 1974, Jim Paul bought the team for $1000 and assumed the team's $52,000 in outstanding debt, and proceeded to revolutionize baseball, not only in El Paso but throughout the Minor Leagues and even influence the Majors.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hassler|first1=Rick|title=Game changer: Jim Paul's El Paso Diablos|url=http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_fc90a576-ce34-11e3-b072-001a4bcf6878.html|accessdate=19 July 2014|work=El Paso Inc.|date=April 27, 2014}}</ref> Paul's purchase of the team ushered in the golden age of El Paso baseball. The name of the team was changed to the Diablos, the Spanish word for \"[[devil]]s\". Paul held numerous innovative promotions and promoted a lively, fan-friendly atmosphere at the ballpark. Sparing any expense, save a coat of bright yellow paint with the word \"BASEBALL\" written in twelve foot tall red letters, Dudley Field was converted to \"The Dudley Dome.\" While technically not a dome in any sense of the word, the field had a supernatural ability to avoid rain-outs and the unique ability to keep the temperature inside the stadium the same as that outside of the stadium. The home team dugout had the word \"diablos\" painted on top while the visitors dugout received a coat of paint that said \"enemy.\" Upon entering the turnstiles fans were given a facial tissue to use for \"Bye, Bye, Baby\" when the visiting team changed pitchers the outgoing pitcher was serenaded by the [[Janis Joplin]] tune over the PA system while the fans in the grandstand waved their tissues. One notable victim was [[Dennis Eckersly]] who acknowledged the crowd by tipping his hat, though others were not so considerate and the [[Texas League]] created a standard fine for those obscene gestures. Other promotions included 10\u00a2 hotdog night, nickel beer night, and Martinez Appreciation Night where anyone with the last name Martinez received free admission.\n\nPaul's innovative marketing techniques showed outstanding results. In 1975 despite finishing 18 \u00bd games out of first place the Diablos drew 162,395 fans, more than every other Class AA team and 16 of the 24 [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] teams. Paul was named [[Sporting News]]' Class Double A Executive of the Year in 1974 and 1975. in 1976 the Diablos came in third and attendance increased to 181,747, outdrawing all but 6 teams in the minor leagues, and were awarded the MacPhail Trophy, which is given to the outstanding organization in all minor league baseball. In 1977 the Diablos finished in first place and drew 217,345 fans which outpaced all but 4 [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] teams and Paul was once again recognized as [[Sporting News]]' Class Double A Executive of the Year for a third time.\n\nIn 1978 the Diablos completed a 9-game winning streak to back-door the Texas League Western Division Championship and then swept the Jackson Mets in a best of 5 series to claim the Texas League banner.  During that 12-game winning streak, the [[San Diego Chicken]] made his debut outside the San Diego area and his minor league debut by performing in the final regular game of the season before a more than sold out stadium.  It was the catalyst to launch his career during his hiatus from San Diego due to court injunctions that prevented him from performing for the Padres.\n\nIn 1980, the Diablos began airing all of their baseball games on radio station [[KHEY (AM)]] AM-690 and simulcast select homegames on Paragon Cable, with current UTEP football announcer [[Jon Teicher]] as its first play-by-play announcer. Other notable Diablos announcers include current play-by-play announcer for the [[Oakland A's]] [[Vince Cotroneo]] (1985\u20131987), and [[Matt Vasgersian]] (1993\u20131995) who currently provides play-by-play for [[Fox Sports]]' [[Major League Baseball]] coverage and is a studio host for [[MLB Network]].<ref name=\"elpasotimes1\"/>\n\nIn 1981, the Diablos became an affiliate of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], a relationship which lasted until 1999.  Tony Muser was the manager for the first two seasons.\n\nAlso in 1981, Texaco sponsored the installation of a $70,000 electronic scoreboard at Dudley Field, previously the scoreboard had been hand operated.  The Diablos won the Texas League Pennant in 1986.  In 1988, the Diablos also had a young prospect named [[Gary Sheffield]].\n\nHowever, as the decade continued, the old [[Dudley Field (El Paso)|Dudley Dome]] was showing its age.  It became apparent that the team would need a new facility, as the city was expanding and the Dudley Dome was becoming increasingly difficult to maintain.  Construction began in the growing Northeast area of El Paso on a new facility. With the stadium not completed in time for the start of the 1990 season the Diablos continued to play at [[Dudley Field|Dudley Dome]]. On June 13, 1990 the Diablos said farewell to the [[Dudley Field|Dudley Dome]], their home of 65 years, and greeted their new ballpark, [[Cohen Stadium]], named after the Cohen brothers, who had returned to El Paso to work for the club. The [[Dudley Field|Dudley Dome]] continued to have tenants however, hosting the El Paso Patriots Soccer Club, and the final tenant the El Paso Scorpions Rugby Club.  Dudley Field was finally demolished on November 5, 2005 to make room for the new African wing of the [[El Paso Zoo]].\n\nIn 1990, [[Cohen Stadium]] opened to the public, becoming an immediate success for the team.  That same year, it became the only minor league ballpark to grace the cover of ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]''.  In 1993 The Diablos became the first Double A team to ever draw 300,000 fans.  The Diablos won the [[Texas League]] pennant again in 1994 and remained competitive for several years after.\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:EPDiamondbacks.gif|right|thumb|300px|The New Diablos (Class AA \u2013 Diamondbacks 1999\u20132004)]] -->\n\nIn 1999, the Diablos ended their relationship with [[Milwaukee Brewers|Brewers]], and soon agreed to become the Double A affiliate for the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].  Around the same time, Paul, after years of building the Diablos into the model franchise, sold the team to Brett Sports and Entertainment, a sports conglomerate headed by former major leaguer [[George Brett]].\n\n===The death of the El Paso Diablos?===\n\nThis change instead signalled the beginning of the end of Minor League baseball in El Paso.  The Diablos ceased many of the promotions that made the team successful earlier, and the lack of strong players (save for the brief time that [[Brad Penny]] spent in the organization) in the Arizona system rendered the team weak and unsuccessful.  With the exception of making the playoffs in 2000, the team was largely dismal and the atmosphere around the park had largely changed from the lighthearted atmosphere that had existed during the Jim Paul era.\n\nOne other factor that affected attendance was the constant rumors that the team would be moved, rumors that Brett Sports and Entertainment would refuse to admit or deny. With every stadium construction that seemed to take place around the country, the Diablos would always be linked as a possible tenant. Furthermore, Brett Sports and Entertainment demanded the city of El Paso make millions in renovations to [[Cohen Stadium]], which the city refused when there was no indication that the team would be staying. There was a brief spike in attendance on July 11, 2003 when [[Randy Johnson]] made a rehab start, but attendance remained low and the team began to hemorrhage money.\n\nIn 2004, with the Diablos\u2019 contract with the Diamondbacks soon to expire, ownership made no move to re-sign with the Diamondbacks.  While there was speculation of the team possibly changing teams, Diablo fans' worst fears were realized when it was announced that the team had been sold to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for an estimated $9.8 million.  Public backlash  resulted; Brett Sports and Entertainment attempted to search for a team to replace the departing Diablos, but in the end, the Diablos moved to [[Springfield, Missouri]] to become the [[Springfield Cardinals]] (for more  information on the original team's history at this point, see the corresponding article).\n\n===The rebirth of the El Paso Diablos===\nHowever, the move of the team signalled a new beginning of the Diablos.  In 2005, it was announced that the independent [[Central Baseball League]] had granted a franchise to Mark Schuster, who brought back the Diablos to begin play that same year. Former [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] first-baseman/right fielder [[Mike Marshall (outfielder)|Mike Marshall]] was selected to manage the team.  The front office returned to the management style that had been in use during the Jim Paul era, bringing back many fans that had become disenchanted with the team in recent years.\n\nThe team's debut on May 6, 2005, set a league attendance record of 10,116.  Though the team finished in last during the first half of the season, the Diablos came alive in the second half, finishing in third and just missing the playoffs. The team set an attendance record for the league, finishing with an attendance of 190,429. The team also had several other special moments throughout the year. On Friday, July 8, 2005, former major leaguer and El Paso native [[Rocky Coppinger]] took the mound for a start. On July 27, the [[Florida Marlins]] purchased the contract of RHP Andy Torres from the Diablos.\n\nFollowing the end of the season, the Diablos announced that they would join with several fellow Central League members including the [[Coastal Bend Aviators]], the [[Fort Worth Cats]], the [[Pensacola Pelicans]], and the [[Shreveport Sports]] and join with former [[Northern League (baseball, 1993\u20132010)|Northern League]] teams the [[St. Paul Saints|Saint Paul Saints]], [[Sioux City Explorers]], the [[Sioux Falls Fighting Pheasants|Sioux Falls Pheasants]], and the [[Lincoln Saltdogs]] to form the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball]] as an independent minor league. The league began play in 2006 with a 96-game schedule along with an expansion team in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] known as the [[St. Joseph Blacksnakes|Blacksnakes]]. The league's first All-Star game was in [[El Paso, Texas]] and played against the [[Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball|Can-Am League]] in July 2006.\n\nWith the second season beginning in May 2006, the Diablos had an air of hope around them and were expected to contend in their new league.  However, the team had vastly changed from the year before thanks to the purchase of closer [[Derrick DePriest]] by the [[Kansas City Royals]] on February 13, 2006.  Also, upon Marshalls request, several members of the San Angelo Colts were signed, giving the Diablos possibly the most powerful offensive unit in the league, but the pitching staff that had been so mediocre the year before was unchanged.  The team stumbled badly at the start of the season. The offense was dormant through much of the time, a factor that was worsened when offensive star Juan Camacho was bought by the Chicago White Sox on May 29. With the team floundering, on June 16, 2006, Marshall was released and replaced in the coming days by former major league pitcher [[Butch Henry]], a graduate of El Paso's [[Eastwood High School (El Paso, Texas)|Eastwood High School]]. Though Henry provided some improvement, the team was still terrible and continued to struggle. The Diablos would lose shortstop Albenis Machado on August 13 when he was sold to the Chicago Cubs and eight days later would be on the receiving end of a [[no-hitter]] by Fort Worth Cats pitcher Joel Kirsten. The Diablos would ultimately finish last in the Southern Division.\n\nWith new manager Butch Henry on board the Diablos were expected to be a much better team for the 2007 season, and they did finish the first half of the season in first place in the Southern Division with 28 wins and 23 losses and 4 games ahead of second place Shreveport and automatically getting a spot for the league play-offs \u2013 their first play-off appearance since the 2000 season when they were in the AA Texas League. Another exciting thing happened in the first half of the season on the 4th of July, the Diablos set the league attendance single-game record with more than 11,000 fans attending a game.\n\n===The end, again===\nAfter a disappointing 2011 baseball season, Schuster sold the Diablos to the [[Ysleta del Sur Pueblo|Tigua Tribe]], a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe in June 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kdbc.com/news/el-paso-diablos-have-new-owners |title=El Paso Diablos Have New Owners |publisher=KDBC.com |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2011-12-27}}</ref>\n\nThe Diablos were replaced by the [[El Paso Chihuahuas]] of the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Pacific Coast League]] for the [[2014 in baseball|2014 baseball season]].  This coincided with the opening of a [[Southwest University Park|new baseball stadium]] in downtown El Paso, which replaced Cohen Stadium as the home of professional baseball in El Paso.\n\nThe Diablos relocated to [[Joe Becker Stadium]] in [[Joplin, Missouri]], as the [[Joplin Blasters]] beginning with the 2015 season.<ref name=\"jogl131123\">{{cite news |first=Debby |last=Woodin |newspaper=[[The Joplin Globe]] |publisher= |title=Landing pro squad would require city to upgrade historic Joe Becker Stadium |url=http://www.joplinglobe.com/topstories/x296455995/Landing-pro-squad-would-require-city-to-upgrade-historic-Joe-Becker-Stadium |date=November 23, 2013 |accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"koam140122\">{{cite news |first=Calley |last=Dougherty |publisher=[[KOAM-TV]] |location=Pittsburg, Kansas |title=Joplin City Council approves lease agreement for Joe Becker Stadium |url=http://www.koamtv.com/story/24513546/joplin-city-council-approves-lease-agreement-for-joe-becker-stadium |date=January 22, 2014 |accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Notable Diablo alumni===\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Willie Aikens]]\n*[[Jes\u00fas Alou]]\n*[[Jim Anderson (baseball)|Jim Anderson]]\n*[[John Balaz]]\n*[[Ralph Botting]]\n*[[Tom Brunansky]]\n*[[Tom Candiotti]]\n*[[Mark Clear]]\n*[[Andy Cohen (baseball)|Andy Cohen]]\n*[[Syd Cohen]]\n*[[Tim Crews]]\n*[[Paul Dade]]\n*[[Narciso Elvira]]\n*[[Bob Ferris]]\n*[[Danny Goodwin]]\n*[[Brian Harper]]\n*[[Teddy Higuera]]\n*[[Conor Jackson]]\n*[[John Jaha]]\n*[[Randy Johnson]]\n*[[Byung-hyun Kim]]\n*[[Fred Kuhaulua]]\n*[[Ken Landreaux]]\n*[[Carney Lansford]]\n*[[Cory Lidle]]\n*[[Lyle Overbay]]\n*[[Brad Penny]]\n*[[Carlos Quentin]]\n*[[Floyd Rayford]]\n*[[Kurt Russell]]\n*[[Ken Schrom]]\n*[[Daryl Sconiers]]\n*[[Gary Sheffield]]\n*[[Chris Snyder]]\n*[[Chad Tracy]]\n*[[Dan Uggla]]\n*[[Brandon Webb]]\n*[[Mike Witt]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19961103063237/http://www.diablos.com/ El Paso Diablos official website]\n*[https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?city=El%20Paso&state=TX&country=US&empty=0 Baseball Reference]\n*[http://epcc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=309255&sid=2626247 \"A Baseball Team by Any Other Name\".

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman|Sam Gelfman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956,  animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax appearantly wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R.

In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the US to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Uproduced attempts to film dune involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky|Alejandro Jodorowski]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]] and [[Pierre Morel]].\n</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

Kubrick's own films never exceeded the three-hour runtime before, and splitting the story (an approach considered with such widescreen epics as [[The Bounty (1984 film)|''The Bounty'']] and [[Cleopatra (1963 film)|''Cleopatra'']]) would have been risky given that 60s widescreen epics rarely had sequels, and the nature of the story would result in the first part feeling unresolved.

In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rated PG, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was the longest animated film made at the time, and cost $8-12<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce, grossing $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman|Sam Gelfman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books? It's easier to film The Odyssey'|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He had received a lot of fanmail on the matter, some proposing to adapt the works to film and some encouraging him to refuse such proposals.<ref name=\":15\" /> Tolkien and his publishers, [[Allen & Unwin|Allen and Unwin]], were willing to play along with film proposals, under the conditions of having a veto on creative decisions or relinquishing those for a hefty sum of money.<ref name=\":2\" /> Materials pertaining to the treatments of Ackerman, Boorman and Bakshi are stored in the Tolkien papers collection of [[Marquette University]].<ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> \n\n=== Walt Disney ===\nIn 1938, just as Tolkien began to work on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]],'' [[Walt Disney]] considered adapting ''The Hobbit'' to animation. An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956,  animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax appearantly wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Zimmerman, who never went into filmmaking after this ordeal,<ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> donated his script to the Tolkien collection.<ref name=\":25\" />\n\n=== Robert Gutwillig ===\nIn 1959, Tolkien entered brief negotiations with Robert Gutwillig to adapt ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien told Gutwillig he had \"given a considerable amount of time and thought\" to a film adaptation, noting \"some ideas concerning what I think would be desirable\" as well as the \"difficulties\" involved.<ref name=\":0\" /> Tolkien spoke with Gutwillig's agent and producer, [[Samuel Gelfman|Samuel W. Gelfman]]. Their discussion was appearantly amicable, with Tolkien finding Gelfman intelligent and reasonable,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?do=post_view_printable;post=133383;guest=126989777|title=FLASHBACK for...August 31 to September 13|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and Gelfman later recalled that they talked about specifics to do with an adaptation.<ref name=\":26\" /> Tolkien directed Gelfman to his publishers, but nothing came out of it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien later received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> \n\nWhile Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the US to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions. By 1967, Sam Gelfman established Katzka-Bernie productions with [[Gabriel Katzka]] and entered neogtiations with Tolkien to adapt ''The Lord of the Rings'' for United Artists,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":26\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/movies/l-lord-of-the-rings-serious-issues-557552.html|title=Samuel Gelfman letter to The New York Times|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"with an option for ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As was the case with Snyder, the emerging contracts would provide United Artists with complete creative freedom over the works, and even offered UA first bidding at the television rights, which were negotiated separately but never sold to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2017/11/15/104416-tolkien-rights-and-the-amazon-television-deal-some-insight/|title=Tolkien Rights and the Amazon Television Deal \u2013 some insight|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of American teenagers unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the rights to ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary who worked for Allen & Unwin, was said to have contacted Disney for the rights at the time,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/tolkien-cs-lewis-disney-snow-white-narnia-hobbit-dwarves|title=The Movie Date That Solidified J.R.R.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] were also said to have been interested in the rights at the time.<ref name=\":21\">{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/53926|title=AFI Catalog: THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUnited Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt [[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|''Dune'']], but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut|Bob Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Uproduced attempts to film dune involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky|Alejandro Jodorowski]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]] and [[Pierre Morel]].\n</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo.

When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work.

The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter.

Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success.

He considered helming a ''Hobbit'' film and a ''Lord of the Rings'' prequel film in 2006,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2006/11/19/24053-peter-jackson-and-fran-walsh-talk-the-hobbit-2/|title=Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh Talk THE HOBBIT|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> before deciding to produce two films based on ''The Hobbit'' for a director of his choosing. New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct. Other director's considered before Jackson took over are said to have included [[Neill Blomkamp|Neil Blomkamp]], [[David Yates]], [[David Dobkin (director)|David Dobkin]] and [[Brett Ratner|Bret Ratner]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/hobbit-rumor-neill-blomkamp-direct-no-job-mgm-gets-together/|title=Neill Blomkamp Rumored to Direct THE HOBBIT and Why No One Is Getting the Job Until MGM Gets It Together|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Tel Toro's ''The Hobbit'' would have had a similar scenario to Jackson's eventual film, but with a different design aesthetic.

{"title_page": "Surface plasmon", "text_new": "[[File:Sketch of surface plasmon.png| thumb|350px |Schematic representation of an electron density wave propagating along a metal\u2013[[Dielectrics|dielectric]] interface. The charge density oscillations and associated electromagnetic fields are called [[Surface plasmon polariton|surface plasmon-polariton]] waves. The exponential dependence of the electromagnetic field intensity on the distance away from the interface is shown on the right. These waves can be excited very efficiently with light in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.]]\n\n'''Surface plasmons''' ('''SPs''') are coherent [[delocalized electron]] oscillations that exist at the interface between any two materials where the real part of the [[Permittivity#Complex permittivity|dielectric function]] changes sign across the interface (e.g. a metal-dielectric interface, such as a metal sheet in air). SPs have lower energy than bulk (or volume) [[plasmon]]s which quantise the longitudinal electron oscillations about positive ion cores within the bulk of an [[Fermi gas|electron gas]] (or plasma).\n\nThe charge motion in a surface plasmon always creates electromagnetic fields outside (as well as inside) the metal. The ''total'' excitation, including both the charge motion and associated electromagnetic field, is called either a [[surface plasmon polariton]] at a planar interface, or a [[localized surface plasmon]] for the closed surface of a small particle.\n\nThe existence of surface plasmons was first predicted in 1957 by Rufus Ritchie.<ref name=\"ritchie-plasma-losses\"/> In the following two decades, surface plasmons were extensively studied by many scientists, the foremost of whom were T. Turbadar in the 1950s and 1960s, and E. N. Economou, [[Heinz Raether]], E. Kretschmann, and A. Otto in the 1960s and 1970s. Information transfer in nanoscale structures, similar to [[photonics]], by means of surface plasmons, is referred to as '''plasmonics'''.<ref name=\"atwater-plasmonics\"/>\n\n==Surface plasmon polaritons==\n{{main|Surface plasmon polariton}}\n\n===Excitation===\n{{main|Surface plasmon polariton#Excitation}}\nSurface plasmon polaritons can be excited by electrons or photons. In the case of photons, it cannot be done directly, but requires a prism, or a grating, or a defect on the metal surface.<ref name=\"modern-plasm\"/>\n\n===Dispersion relation===\n[[File:Dispersion Relationship.png|thumb|Lossless dispersion curve for surface plasmons. At low ''k'', the surface plasmon curve (red) approaches the photon curve (blue)]]\n{{main|Surface plasmon polariton#Dispersion relation}}\nAt low frequency, an SPP approaches a [[surface wave|Sommerfeld-Zenneck wave]], where the dispersion relation (relation between frequency and wavevector) is the same as in free space. At a higher frequency, the dispersion relation bends over and reaches an [[asymptotic limit]] called the \"[[plasma frequency]]\"<ref name=\"modern-plasm\"/> (see figure at right).{{efn|This lossless dispersion relation neglects the effects of [[Damping ratio|damping]] factors, such as the [[Attenuation|intrinsic losses]] in metals. For lossy cases, the dispersion curve backbends after the reaching the surface plasmon frequency instead of [[Asymptote|asymptotically increasing.]]<ref name=\"damping-sp\"/><ref name=\"maier-plasmonics-book\"/>}} For more details see [[surface plasmon polariton]].\n\n===Propagation length and skin depth===\n{{main|Surface plasmon polariton#Propagation length and skin depth}}\nAs an SPP propagates along the surface, it loses energy to the metal due to absorption. It can also lose energy due to scattering into free-space or into other directions. The electric field falls off evanescently perpendicular to the metal surface. At low frequencies, the SPP penetration depth into the metal is commonly approximated using the [[skin depth]] formula. In the dielectric, the field will fall off far more slowly. SPPs are very sensitive to  slight perturbations within the skin depth and because of this, SPPs are often used to probe inhomogeneities of a surface.<ref name=\"modern-plasm\"/> For more details, see [[surface plasmon polariton]].\n\n==Localized surface plasmons==\n{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=Quasiparticles}}\n{{main|Localized surface plasmon}}\nLocalize surface plasmons arise in small metallic objects, including nanoparticles. Since the translational invariance of the system is lost, a description in terms of [[wavevector]], as in SPPs, can not be made. Also unlike the continuous dispersion relation in SPPs, [[Mode (electromagnetism)|electromagnetic modes]] of the particle are discretized.<ref name=\"sers-book\"/> \n\nLSPs can be excited directly through incident waves; efficient coupling to the LSP modes correspond to resonances and can be attributed to [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[Light scattering by particles|scattering]], with increased local-field enhancements.<ref name=\"sers-book\"/> LSP resonances largely depend on the shape of the particle; spherical particles can be studied analytically by [[Mie scattering|Mie theory]].<ref name=\"modern-plasm\"/><ref name=\"sers-book\"/>\n\n==Experimental applications==\nThe excitation of surface plasmons is frequently used in an experimental technique known as [[surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR). In SPR, the maximum excitation of surface plasmons are detected by monitoring the reflected power from a prism coupler as a function of incident angle or [[wavelength]]. This technique can be used to observe [[nanometer]] changes in thickness, density fluctuations, or molecular absorption. Recent works have also shown that SPR can be used to measure the optical indexes of multi-layered systems, where [[ellipsometry]] failed to give a result.<ref name=\"multi-spectral\"/><ref name=\"thin-film-measurement\"/>\n\nSurface plasmon-based circuits have been proposed as a means of overcoming the size limitations of photonic circuits for use in high performance data processing nano devices.<ref name=\"ozbay-plasmonics\"/>\n\nThe ability to dynamically control the plasmonic properties of materials in these nano-devices is key to their development. A new approach that uses plasmon-plasmon interactions has been demonstrated recently. Here the bulk plasmon resonance is induced or suppressed to manipulate the propagation of light.<ref name=\"plasmon-plasmon\"/> This approach has been shown to have a high potential for nanoscale light manipulation and the development of a fully [[CMOS]]-compatible electro-optical plasmonic modulator, said to be a future key component in chip-scale photonic circuits.<ref name=\"plasmonic-modulator\"/>\n\nSome other surface effects such as [[Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy|surface-enhanced Raman]] scattering and [[surface-enhanced fluorescence]] are induced by surface plasmon of [[noble metal]]s, therefore sensors based on surface plasmons were developed.<ref name=\"plasmon-spectrophotometry\"/>\n\nIn [[surface second harmonic generation]], the second harmonic signal is proportional to the square of the electric field. The electric field is stronger at the interface because of the surface plasmon resulting in a [[Nonlinear optics|non-linear optical effect]]. This larger signal is often exploited to produce a stronger second harmonic signal.<ref name=\"plasmon-shg\"/>\n\nThe wavelength and intensity of the plasmon-related absorption and emission peaks are affected by molecular adsorption that can be used in molecular sensors. For example, a fully operational prototype device detecting [[casein]] in milk has been fabricated. The device is based on monitoring changes in plasmon-related absorption of light by a gold layer.<ref name=\"lsp-immunosensor\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosensor]]\n* [[Dual-polarization interferometry]]\n* [[Extraordinary optical transmission]]\n* [[Free electron model]]\n* [[List of plasma (physics) articles]]\n* [[Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance]]\n* [[Plasma oscillation]]\n* [[Plasmonic lens]]\n* [[Spinplasmonics]]\n* [[Surface plasmon resonance microscopy]]\n* [[Waves in plasmas]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=\"atwater-plasmonics\">{{cite journal|last=Polman|first=Albert|author2=Harry A.

The charge density oscillations and associated electromagnetic fields are called [[Surface plasmon polariton|surface plasmon-polariton]] waves. The exponential dependence of the electromagnetic field intensity on the distance away from the interface is shown on the right. These waves can be excited very efficiently with light in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum.]]\n\n'''Surface plasmons''' ('''SPs''') are coherent [[delocalized electron]] oscillations that exist at the interface between any two materials where the real part of the [[Permittivity#Complex permittivity|dielectric function]] changes sign across the interface (e.g. a metal-dielectric interface, such as a metal sheet in air). SPs have lower energy than bulk (or volume) [[plasmon]]s which quantise the longitudinal electron oscillations about positive ion cores within the bulk of an [[Fermi gas|electron gas]] (or plasma).\n\nThe charge motion in a surface plasmon always creates electromagnetic fields outside (as well as inside) the metal. The ''total'' excitation, including both the charge motion and associated electromagnetic field, is called either a [[surface plasmon polariton]] at a planar interface, or a [[localized surface plasmon]] for the closed surface of a small particle.\n\nThe existence of surface plasmons was first predicted in 1957 by Rufus Ritchie.<ref name=\"ritchie-plasma-losses\"/> In the following two decades, surface plasmons were extensively studied by many scientists, the foremost of whom were T. Turbadar in the 1950s and 1960s, and [[Heinz Raether]], E. Kretschmann, and A. Otto in the 1960s and 1970s. Information transfer in nanoscale structures, similar to [[photonics]], by means of surface plasmons, is referred to as '''plasmonics'''.<ref name=\"atwater-plasmonics\"/>\n\n==Surface plasmon polaritons==\n{{main|Surface plasmon polariton}}\n\n===Excitation===\n{{main|Surface plasmon polariton#Excitation}}\nSurface plasmon polaritons can be excited by electrons or photons. In the case of photons, it cannot be done directly, but requires a prism, or a grating, or a defect on the metal surface.<ref name=\"modern-plasm\"/>\n\n===Dispersion relation===\n[[File:Dispersion Relationship.png|thumb|Lossless dispersion curve for surface plasmons. At low ''k'', the surface plasmon curve (red) approaches the photon curve (blue)]]\n{{main|Surface plasmon polariton#Dispersion relation}}\nAt low frequency, an SPP approaches a [[surface wave|Sommerfeld-Zenneck wave]], where the dispersion relation (relation between frequency and wavevector) is the same as in free space. At a higher frequency, the dispersion relation bends over and reaches an [[asymptotic limit]] called the \"[[plasma frequency]]\"<ref name=\"modern-plasm\"/> (see figure at right).{{efn|This lossless dispersion relation neglects the effects of [[Damping ratio|damping]] factors, such as the [[Attenuation|intrinsic losses]] in metals. For lossy cases, the dispersion curve backbends after the reaching the surface plasmon frequency instead of [[Asymptote|asymptotically increasing.]]<ref name=\"damping-sp\"/><ref name=\"maier-plasmonics-book\"/>}} For more details see [[surface plasmon polariton]].\n\n===Propagation length and skin depth===\n{{main|Surface plasmon polariton#Propagation length and skin depth}}\nAs an SPP propagates along the surface, it loses energy to the metal due to absorption. It can also lose energy due to scattering into free-space or into other directions. The electric field falls off evanescently perpendicular to the metal surface. At low frequencies, the SPP penetration depth into the metal is commonly approximated using the [[skin depth]] formula. In the dielectric, the field will fall off far more slowly. SPPs are very sensitive to  slight perturbations within the skin depth and because of this, SPPs are often used to probe inhomogeneities of a surface.<ref name=\"modern-plasm\"/> For more details, see [[surface plasmon polariton]].\n\n==Localized surface plasmons==\n{{Condensed matter physics|expanded=Quasiparticles}}\n{{main|Localized surface plasmon}}\nLocalize surface plasmons arise in small metallic objects, including nanoparticles. Since the translational invariance of the system is lost, a description in terms of [[wavevector]], as in SPPs, can not be made. Also unlike the continuous dispersion relation in SPPs, [[Mode (electromagnetism)|electromagnetic modes]] of the particle are discretized.<ref name=\"sers-book\"/> \n\nLSPs can be excited directly through incident waves; efficient coupling to the LSP modes correspond to resonances and can be attributed to [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[Light scattering by particles|scattering]], with increased local-field enhancements.<ref name=\"sers-book\"/> LSP resonances largely depend on the shape of the particle; spherical particles can be studied analytically by [[Mie scattering|Mie theory]].<ref name=\"modern-plasm\"/><ref name=\"sers-book\"/>\n\n==Experimental applications==\nThe excitation of surface plasmons is frequently used in an experimental technique known as [[surface plasmon resonance]] (SPR). In SPR, the maximum excitation of surface plasmons are detected by monitoring the reflected power from a prism coupler as a function of incident angle or [[wavelength]]. This technique can be used to observe [[nanometer]] changes in thickness, density fluctuations, or molecular absorption. Recent works have also shown that SPR can be used to measure the optical indexes of multi-layered systems, where [[ellipsometry]] failed to give a result.<ref name=\"multi-spectral\"/><ref name=\"thin-film-measurement\"/>\n\nSurface plasmon-based circuits have been proposed as a means of overcoming the size limitations of photonic circuits for use in high performance data processing nano devices.<ref name=\"ozbay-plasmonics\"/>\n\nThe ability to dynamically control the plasmonic properties of materials in these nano-devices is key to their development. A new approach that uses plasmon-plasmon interactions has been demonstrated recently. Here the bulk plasmon resonance is induced or suppressed to manipulate the propagation of light.<ref name=\"plasmon-plasmon\"/> This approach has been shown to have a high potential for nanoscale light manipulation and the development of a fully [[CMOS]]-compatible electro-optical plasmonic modulator, said to be a future key component in chip-scale photonic circuits.<ref name=\"plasmonic-modulator\"/>\n\nSome other surface effects such as [[Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy|surface-enhanced Raman]] scattering and [[surface-enhanced fluorescence]] are induced by surface plasmon of [[noble metal]]s, therefore sensors based on surface plasmons were developed.<ref name=\"plasmon-spectrophotometry\"/>\n\nIn [[surface second harmonic generation]], the second harmonic signal is proportional to the square of the electric field. The electric field is stronger at the interface because of the surface plasmon resulting in a [[Nonlinear optics|non-linear optical effect]]. This larger signal is often exploited to produce a stronger second harmonic signal.<ref name=\"plasmon-shg\"/>\n\nThe wavelength and intensity of the plasmon-related absorption and emission peaks are affected by molecular adsorption that can be used in molecular sensors. For example, a fully operational prototype device detecting [[casein]] in milk has been fabricated. The device is based on monitoring changes in plasmon-related absorption of light by a gold layer.<ref name=\"lsp-immunosensor\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biosensor]]\n* [[Dual-polarization interferometry]]\n* [[Extraordinary optical transmission]]\n* [[Free electron model]]\n* [[List of plasma (physics) articles]]\n* [[Multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance]]\n* [[Plasma oscillation]]\n* [[Plasmonic lens]]\n* [[Spinplasmonics]]\n* [[Surface plasmon resonance microscopy]]\n* [[Waves in plasmas]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=\"atwater-plasmonics\">{{cite journal|last=Polman|first=Albert|author2=Harry A.
