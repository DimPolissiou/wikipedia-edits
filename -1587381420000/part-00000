The second season of the reality series debuted on August 12, 2014 and ended on November 4, 2014, after airing thirteen episodes. Both seasons featured a \"Reunion\" episode that reunited all the crew members to discuss the events of the season, as well as a special episode \"The Crew Tells All\" with unseen footage of the season. The third season premiered on August 25, 2015 and concluded on December 1, 2015 with a two-part \"Reunion\" episode. Season four premiered on September 6, 2016 and concluded on December 6, 2016. The fifth season premiered on September 5, 2017 and concluded on December 5, 2017 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on December 12, 2017. Season six premiered on October 2, 2018 and concluded on January 29, 2019 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on February 5, 2019.\n\nBoth Below Deck and Below Deck Med appeared on E! Network in Canada for the first five (I - V) seasons.  For the first five seasons, E! Network Canada would often air the seasons in the same time slot as in the US, however not all seasons followed the Bravo! U.S.A. schedule.  Starting in season VI (6) Below Deck and Below Deck Med were picked up by SLICE Network in Canada and all shows aired in the identical time slot as in the U.S.A. on Bravo!.  Funny enough, although Canadians have access to both networks, Bravo U.S.A. and Bravo Canada (not the same ownership), the Below Deck shows have never aired on Bravo in Canada.  The two shows have a faithful viewing audience in Canada - especially since season V when Canadians started to appear in the show as part of the crew.  Canadians appearing in the shows included Matt Burns from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada as the crew chef in season V and Courtney Skippon (third stew) from British Columbia in season VII.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.bravotv.com/below-deck}}\n* {{IMDb title|tt2342499|Below Deck}}\n* {{tv.com show|below-deck|Below Deck}}\n\n{{Bravo programming}}\n\n[[Category:2013 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:Bravo (American TV channel) original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Endemol]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Below Deck\n| image                    = Below Deck logo.png\n| genre                    = [[Reality television]]\n| country                  = United Status\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 7\n| num_episodes             = 105 <!--as of February 17, 2020-->\n| list_episodes            = List of Below Deck episodes\n| executive_producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Mark Cronin\n* Courtland Cox\n* {{nowrap|Nadine Rajabi <small>(season 3\u2013)</small>}}\n* Lauren Simms \n* Rebecca Henning <br /><small>(co-executive, season 3\u2013)</small>\n* James Bruce<br /> <small>(co-executive, season 1)</small>\n* Elise Duran <small>(season 2)</small>}}\n| runtime                  = 42 minutes\n| company                  = [[51 Minds Entertainment]]\n| channel                  = [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]]\n| picture_format           = {{plainlist|\n* [[480i]] ([[SDTV]])\n* [[1080i]] ([[HDTV]])}}\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2013|7|1}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| related                  = {{plainlist|\n* ''[[Below Deck Mediterranean]]''\n* ''[[Below Deck Sailing Yacht]]''}}\n| website                  = http://www.bravotv.com/below-deck\n}}\n\n'''''Below Deck''''' is an American [[reality television]] series on [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]] that debuted on July 1, 2013, created by Rebecca Taylor Henning & Doug Henning.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|title=Bravo Media Sets Sail With New Docu-Series 'Below Deck' Premiering Monday Junly 1|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/05/08/bravo-media-sets-sail-with-new-docu-series-below-deck-premiering-monday-junly-1/181578/|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Tribune Digital Ventures|accessdate=May 23, 2013|date=May 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hertzfeld|first=Laura|title='Below Deck': Check out the mega yacht that's home to new Bravo series -- VIDEO EXCLUSIVE|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/05/08/below-deck-bravo/|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=May 24, 2013|date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> Announced in April 2012, ''Below Deck'' chronicles the lives of the crew members who work and reside aboard a [[mega-yacht]] during [[Yacht charter|charter]] season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bibel|first=Sara|title=Bravo Greenlights 11 New and 8 Returning Unscripted Series and Plans First Scripted Premiere for 2013|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/04/04/bravo-greenlights-11-new-and-8-returning-unscripted-series-and-plans-first-scripted-premiere-for-2013/127574/|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Tribune Digital Ventures|accessdate=May 24, 2013|date=April 4, 2012}}</ref> It shows the crew as they deal with their personal issues in order to make their professional careers work.

The second season of the reality series debuted on August 12, 2014 and ended on November 4, 2014, after airing thirteen episodes. Both seasons featured a \"Reunion\" episode that reunited all the crew members to discuss the events of the season, as well as a special episode \"The Crew Tells All\" with unseen footage of the season. The third season premiered on August 25, 2015 and concluded on December 1, 2015 with a two-part \"Reunion\" episode. Season four premiered on September 6, 2016 and concluded on December 6, 2016. The fifth season premiered on September 5, 2017 and concluded on December 5, 2017 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on December 12, 2017. Season six premiered on October 2, 2018 and concluded on January 29, 2019 with a \"Reunion\" episode airing on February 5, 2019.\n\nBoth Below Deck and Below Deck Med appeared on E! Network in Canada for the first five (I - V) seasons.  For the first five seasons, E! Network Canada would often air the seasons in the same time slot as in the US, however not all seasons followed the Bravo! U.S.A. schedule.  Starting in season VI (6) Below Deck and Below Deck Med were picked up by SLICE Network in Canada and all shows aired in the identical time slot as in the U.S.A. on Bravo!.  Funny enough, although Canadians have access to both networks, Bravo U.S.A. and Bravo Canada (not the same ownership), the Below Deck shows have never aired on Bravo in Canada.  The two shows have a faithful viewing audience in Canada - especially since season V when Canadians started to appear in the show as part of the crew.  Canadians appearing in the shows included Matt Burns from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada as the crew chef in season V and Courtney Skippon (third stew) from British Columbia in season VII.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Television}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.bravotv.com/below-deck}}\n* {{IMDb title|tt2342499|Below Deck}}\n* {{tv.com show|below-deck|Below Deck}}\n\n{{Bravo programming}}\n\n[[Category:2013 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American reality television series]]\n[[Category:Bravo (American TV channel) original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Endemol]]\n", "name_user": "Phtempel", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix typo in 'Country' (`United Status` does not exist)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Below_Deck"}

Most modern uses of the symbol are directly or indirectly associated with its use by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire]], whose use of it represented the Empire's dominion over the Near East and the West. The symbol is much older, and its original meaning is debated among scholars. The [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] has long been a symbol of power and dominion.\n\nThe double-headed eagle or double-eagle is a [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] that appears in [[Mycenaean Greece]] and in the [[Ancient Near East]], especially in [[Hittite Empire#iconography|Hittite iconography]]. It re-appeared during the [[High Middle Ages]], from circa the 10th or 11th century, and was notably used by the [[East Roman Empire]], but 11th or 12th century representations have also been found originating from [[Islamic Spain]], [[Medieval France|France]] and the Serbian principality of [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. From the 13th century onward, it became even more widespread, and was used by the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] within the Islamic world, and by the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] within the Christian world.\n\nUsed in the Eastern Roman Empire as a dynastic emblem of the [[Palaiologos dynasty|Palaiologoi]], it was adopted during the Late Medieval to [[Early Modern period]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the one hand, and in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] principalities ([[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]) on the other, representing an [[heraldic augmentation|augmentation]] of the (single-headed) [[eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] or ''[[Aquila (Roman)|Aquila]]'' associated with the [[Roman Empire]]. In a few places, among them the Holy Roman Empire and Russia, the motif was further augmented to create the less prominent [[triple-headed eagle]].\n\n==Ancient Near East==\n[[Polycephalous]] [[mythological beast]]s are very frequent in the Bronze Age to Iron Age pictorial legacy of the [[Ancient Near East]], especially in the [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian sphere]], and thence adopted by the [[Hittites]]. Use of the double-headed eagle in Hittite imagery has been interpreted as \"royal insignia\".<ref>Collins, Billie Jean. 2010 \"Animal Mastery in Hittite Art and Texts\" in '' The Master of Animals in Old World Iconography'', ed.

Most modern uses of the symbol are directly or indirectly associated with its use by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire]], whose use of it represented the Empire's dominion over the Near East and the West. The symbol is much older, and its original meaning is debated among scholars. The [[Eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] has long been a symbol of power and dominion.\n\nThe double-headed eagle or double-eagle is a [[motif]] that appears in [[Mycenaean Greece]] and in the [[Ancient Near East]], especially in [[Hittite Empire#iconography|Hittite iconography]]. It re-appeared during the [[High Middle Ages]], from circa the 10th or 11th century, and was notably used by the [[East Roman Empire]], but 11th or 12th century representations have also been found originating from [[Islamic Spain]], [[Medieval France|France]] and the Serbian principality of [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. From the 13th century onward, it became even more widespread, and was used by the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]] and the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] within the Islamic world, and by the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]] within the Christian world.\n\nUsed in the Eastern Roman Empire as a dynastic emblem of the [[Palaiologos dynasty|Palaiologoi]], it was adopted during the Late Medieval to [[Early Modern period]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the one hand, and in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] principalities ([[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]]) on the other, representing an [[heraldic augmentation|augmentation]] of the (single-headed) [[eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] or ''[[Aquila (Roman)|Aquila]]'' associated with the [[Roman Empire]]. In a few places, among them the Holy Roman Empire and Russia, the motif was further augmented to create the less prominent [[triple-headed eagle]].\n\n==Ancient Near East==\n[[Polycephalous]] [[mythological beast]]s are very frequent in the Bronze Age to Iron Age pictorial legacy of the [[Ancient Near East]], especially in the [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian sphere]], and thence adopted by the [[Hittites]]. Use of the double-headed eagle in Hittite imagery has been interpreted as \"royal insignia\".<ref>Collins, Billie Jean. 2010 \"Animal Mastery in Hittite Art and Texts\" in '' The Master of Animals in Old World Iconography'', ed.
