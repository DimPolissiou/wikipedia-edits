In the [[21st century]], it refers generally to the capacity for the [[biosphere]] and human [[civilization]] to coexist.

Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems sustainably even though to [[policymaker]]s a definition remains elusive. Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the service's current and future generations need from them.  It is also concerned with commitment from [[geopolitical]] policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life.<ref>Walker, Brian and Salt, David (2012) ''Resilience Practice: Building Capacity to Absorb Disturbance and Maintain Function''. Island Press.</ref> The resiliency of an ecosystem, and thereby, its sustainability, can be reasonably measured at [[juncture]]s or events where the combination of [[nature|naturally]] occurring [[Regenerative (design)|regenerative]] forces ([[solar energy]], water, soil, [[atmosphere]], vegetation, and [[biomass]]) interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances.<ref>Falk, Ben (2013) ''The resilient farm and homestead''. Chelsea Green Publishing. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-1603584449}}</ref>\n\nA practical view of sustainability is [[closed system]]s that maintain processes of [[productivity]] indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.<ref>Melvin K. Hendrix, Sustainable Backyard Polyculture: Designing for ecological resiliency. Smashwords Edition, 2014.</ref> In this way, sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced. In nature, the accounting occurs naturally through a process of [[adaptation]] as an ecosystem returns to [[wikt:viability|viability]] from an external disturbance. The adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event (earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane, tornado, flood, or thunderstorm), followed by [[dissipation|absorption]], utilization, or [[wikt:rejection|deflection]] of the [[energy]] or energies that the external forces created.<ref>Walker, Brian and Salt, David (2006) ''Resilience Thinking: Sustaining ecosystems and people in a changing world''.

The environmental impact of a community or humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.<ref>Clark, D.

The most prominent among these concepts might be the [[Circular economy]], with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and some cases require different or additional strategies, such as purchasing new, more energy-efficient equipment.

It concludes that human activity is having a significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of the world [[ecosystems]], reducing both their [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] and [[biocapacity]]. The report refers to natural systems as humanity's \"life-support system\", providing essential \"[[ecosystem services]]\".

The report was finalized in Paris. The main conclusions:\n\n1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.\n\n2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution, and invasive species. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from consumption to governance.\n\n3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans, and land. It can cause problems with food, water and humanity's air supply.\n\n4.

Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year\u2014three times its current rate of consumption\u2014unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling.<ref>[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/ Decoupling: natural resource use and environmental impacts of economic growth]. International Resource Panel report, 2011</ref> The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce [[resource intensity]] (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.<ref>Daly, H. (1996). ''Beyond Growth: The Economics of Sustainable Development''. Boston: Beacon Press. {{ISBN|0-8070-4709-0}}.</ref>\n\nThere are conflicting views on whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit [[GDP]]) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution.<ref>Von Weizsacker, E.U. (1998). ''Factor Four: Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan.</ref><ref>Von Weizsacker, E.U., C. Hargroves, M.H. Smith, C. Desha, and P. Stasinopoulos (2009). ''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'', Routledge.</ref> On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]] resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.{{sfnp|Huesemann|Huesemann|2011|loc=Chapter 5, \"In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements\"}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cleveland|first1=C.J.|last2=Ruth|first2=M.|year=1998|title=Indicators of Dematerialization and the Materials Intensity of Use|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=2|issue=3|pages=15\u201350|doi=10.1162/jiec.1998.2.3.15}}</ref> Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., [[second law of thermodynamics]]) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions.{{sfnp|Huesemann|Huesemann|2011|p=111}} Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a [[steady state economy]] in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by [[Herman Daly]] and others in the [[ecological economics]] community.\n\nA different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the ''restore'' approach.<ref name=\"restore\">{{cite journal|last1=Bindewald|first1=Eckart|title=An R of sustainability that can tame the \"conundrum\"|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|date=2013|page=1:e46v1|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.46v1}}</ref> This approach views \"restore\" as a fourth component to the common reduce, reuse, recycle motto. Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources. These financial savings would normally lead to rebound effects, but a theoretical analysis suggests that donating even a small fraction of the experienced savings can potentially more than eliminate rebound effects.<ref name=\"restore\"/>\n\n===Nature as an economic externality===\n[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]]]]\n{{Further|Ecosystem services}}\nThe economic importance of nature is indicated by the use of the expression [[ecosystem services]] to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free.<ref name = Tragedy>{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = G. | year = 1968 | title = The Tragedy of the Commons | journal = Science | volume = 162 | issue = 3859| pages = 1243\u20131248 | doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 | pmid=5699198| bibcode = 1968Sci...162.1243H }}</ref> In general, as a [[commodity]] or service becomes more scarce the [[price]] increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products.

It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation. Such acknowledgment has been made by the [[Brundtland Report|Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=UN Documents Gathering a body of global agreements}}</ref> and the Millennium Development Goals.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Millennium Development Goals Report, 2009|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_Report_2009_ENG.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref> There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues: according to the Brundtland report, \"poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref> Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs (such as nutrition and medicine) and general well-being.<ref>{{cite web|date=May 2008|last=Lusigi|first=Angela|title=Linking Poverty to Environmental Sustainability|url=http://www.povertyandconservation.info/docs/20080524-UNDP-UNEP_Poverty_Environment_Initiative.pdf|publisher=UNDP-UNEP Poverty&nbsp;\u2014 Environment Initiative|accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref> As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials.

For example, teaching [[water treatment]] to the poor by boiling their water with [[charcoal]], would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy, whereas using [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] [[solar water disinfection]] would be. Also, sustainable [[best practices]] can involve the [[recycling]] of materials, such as the use of [[plastics recycling|recycled]] [[plastics]] for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as [[Bridges to Prosperity]]'s use of wire rope from shipping container [[gantry cranes]] to act as the structural wire rope for [[footbridges]] that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.\n\n===Human relationship to nature===\nAccording to [[Murray Bookchin]], the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] societies. Bookchin contends that [[capitalism]] and [[Market (economics)|market]] relationships, if unchecked, can reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a [[commodity]]: \"The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital.\"<ref>Bookchin, M. (2004). ''Post Scarcity Anarchism''. Oakland: [[AK Press]], pp.&nbsp;24\u201325. {{ISBN|978-1-904859-06-2}}.</ref> [[Social ecology (theory)|Social ecology]], founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic, etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.<ref>Bookchin, M.

Most governments and international organizations that aim to achieve sustainability employ all three approaches, though they may disagree on which deserves priority. The three approaches, embodied in the [[I&nbsp;=&nbsp;PAT]] formula,<ref name=Ehrlich&Holden/> can be summarized as follows:\n\n'''Affluence:''' Many believe that the best path to sustainability is reducing [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. This theory is represented most clearly in the idea of a [[steady-state economy]], meaning an economy without growth. Methods in this category include, among others, the [[phase-out of lightweight plastic bags]], promoting [[biking]], and increasing [[energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]]. For example, according to the report \"Plastic and Climate\", the plastic could emit [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, as much as 15% of the earth's remaining carbon budget, by 2050 and over 50% by 2100, except the impacts on [[phytoplankton]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Plastic & Climate The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet |date=May 2019 |publisher=Center for International Environmental Law, Environmental Integrity Project, FracTracker Alliance, Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, 5 Gyres, and Break Free From Plastic. |pages=4\u20135 |url=https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-FINAL-2019.pdf |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ciel.org\"/> The report says that for solving the problem, [[Consumption (economics)|reduction in consumption]] will be essential<ref>{{cite book |title=Plastic & Climate The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet |date=May 2019 |publisher=Center for International Environmental Law, Environmental Integrity Project, FracTracker Alliance, Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, 5 Gyres, and Break Free From Plastic. |pages=82\u201385 |url=https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-FINAL-2019.pdf |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Population:''' Others think that the most effective means of achieving sustainability is [[population control]], for example by improving access to [[birth control]] and education<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perkins |first1=Sid |title=The best way to reduce your carbon footprint is one the government isn't telling you about |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/best-way-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-one-government-isn-t-telling-you-about |website=Science |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Technology:''' Still others hold that the most promising path to sustainability is new technology.

To maintain this equilibrium, available resources must not be depleted faster than resources are naturally generated.\n\nModern use of the term sustainability is broad and difficult to define precisely. Originally, sustainability meant making only such use of natural, renewable resources that people can continue to rely on their yields in the long term.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sustainability Theories |url=https://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-4/concepts-for-a-better-world/what-is-sustainability/ |publisher=World Ocean Review |accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref> The concept of sustainability, or Nachhaltigkeit in German, can be traced back to [[Hans Carl von Carlowitz]] (1645\u20131714), and was applied to forestry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hans Carl von Carlowitz and Sustainability |url=http://www.environmentandsociety.org/tools/keywords/hans-carl-von-carlowitz-and-sustainability |website=Environment and Society Portal |accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nHealthy ecosystems and [[Natural environment|environments]] are necessary to the survival of humans and other [[organisms]].

Resilience-thinking evolved from the need to manage interactions between human-constructed systems and natural ecosystems sustainably even though to [[policymaker]]s a definition remains elusive. Resilience-thinking addresses how much planetary ecological systems can withstand assault from human disturbances and still deliver the service's current and future generations need from them.  It is also concerned with commitment from [[geopolitical]] policymakers to promote and manage essential planetary ecological resources to promote resilience and achieve sustainability of these essential resources for benefit of future generations of life.<ref>Walker, Brian and Salt, David (2012) ''Resilience Practice: Building Capacity to Absorb Disturbance and Maintain Function''. Island Press.</ref> The resiliency of an ecosystem, and thereby, its sustainability, can be reasonably measured at [[juncture]]s or events where the combination of [[nature|naturally]] occurring [[Regenerative (design)|regenerative]] forces ([[solar energy]], water, soil, [[atmosphere]], vegetation, and [[biomass]]) interact with the energy released into the ecosystem from disturbances.<ref>Falk, Ben (2013) ''The resilient farm and homestead''. Chelsea Green Publishing. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-1603584449}}</ref>\n\nA practical view of sustainability is [[closed system]]s that maintain processes of [[productivity]] indefinitely by replacing resources used by actions of people with resources of equal or greater value by those same people without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.<ref>Melvin K. Hendrix, Sustainable Backyard Polyculture: Designing for ecological resiliency. Smashwords Edition, 2014.</ref> In this way, sustainability can be concretely measured in human projects if there is a transparent accounting of the resources put back into the ecosystem to replace those displaced. In nature, the accounting occurs naturally through a process of [[adaptation]] as an ecosystem returns to [[wikt:viability|viability]] from an external disturbance. The adaptation is a multi-stage process that begins with the disturbance event (earthquake, volcanic eruption, hurricane, tornado, flood, or thunderstorm), followed by [[dissipation|absorption]], utilization, or [[wikt:rejection|deflection]] of the [[energy]] or energies that the external forces created.<ref>Walker, Brian and Salt, David (2006) ''Resilience Thinking: Sustaining ecosystems and people in a changing world''.

The environmental impact of a community or humankind as a whole depends both on population and impact per person, which in turn depends in complex ways on what resources are being used, whether or not those resources are renewable, and the scale of the human activity relative to the carrying capacity of the ecosystems involved. Careful resource management can be applied at many scales, from economic sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and industry, to work organizations, the consumption patterns of households and individuals and to the resource demands of individual goods and services.<ref>Clark, D.

The most prominent among these concepts might be the [[Circular economy]], with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also a broad range of similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and some cases require different or additional strategies, such as purchasing new, more energy-efficient equipment.

The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution, and invasive species.

ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet their needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.\n\nThe concept of ESD was born from the need for [[education]] to address the growing environmental challenges facing the planet.

Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the [[International Resource Panel]], hosted by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year\u2014three times its current rate of consumption\u2014unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling.<ref>[http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/ Decoupling: natural resource use and environmental impacts of economic growth]. International Resource Panel report, 2011</ref> The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce [[resource intensity]] (the amount of resource (e.g. water, energy, or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.<ref>Daly, H. (1996). ''Beyond Growth: The Economics of Sustainable Development''. Boston: Beacon Press. {{ISBN|0-8070-4709-0}}.</ref>\n\nThere are conflicting views on whether improvements in technological efficiency and innovation will enable a complete decoupling of economic growth from environmental degradation. On the one hand, it has been claimed repeatedly by efficiency experts that resource use intensity (i.e., energy and materials use per unit [[GDP]]) could in principle be reduced by at least four or five-fold, thereby allowing for continued economic growth without increasing resource depletion and associated pollution.<ref>Von Weizsacker, E.U. (1998). ''Factor Four: Doubling Wealth, Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan.</ref><ref>Von Weizsacker, E.U., C. Hargroves, M.H. Smith, C. Desha, and P. Stasinopoulos (2009). ''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'', Routledge.</ref> On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the [[rebound effect (conservation)]] or [[Jevons Paradox]] resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.{{sfnp|Huesemann|Huesemann|2011|loc=Chapter 5, \"In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements\"}}<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cleveland|first1=C.J.|last2=Ruth|first2=M.|year=1998|title=Indicators of Dematerialization and the Materials Intensity of Use|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=2|issue=3|pages=15\u201350|doi=10.1162/jiec.1998.2.3.15}}</ref> Furthermore, there are inherent thermodynamic (i.e., [[second law of thermodynamics]]) and practical limits to all efficiency improvements. For example, there are certain minimum unavoidable material requirements for growing food, and there are limits to making automobiles, houses, furniture, and other products lighter and thinner without the risk of losing their necessary functions.{{sfnp|Huesemann|Huesemann|2011|p=111}} Since it is both theoretically and practically impossible to increase resource use efficiencies indefinitely, it is equally impossible to have continued and infinite economic growth without a concomitant increase in resource depletion and environmental pollution, i.e., economic growth and resource depletion can be decoupled to some degree over the short run but not the long run. Consequently, long-term sustainability requires the transition to a [[steady state economy]] in which total GDP remains more or less constant, as has been advocated for decades by [[Herman Daly]] and others in the [[ecological economics]] community.\n\nA different proposed solution to partially decouple economic growth from environmental degradation is the ''restore'' approach.<ref name=\"restore\">{{cite journal|last1=Bindewald|first1=Eckart|title=An R of sustainability that can tame the \"conundrum\"|journal=PeerJ PrePrints|date=2013|page=1:e46v1|doi=10.7287/peerj.preprints.46v1}}</ref> This approach views \"restore\" as a fourth component to the common reduce, reuse, recycle motto. Participants in such efforts are encouraged to voluntarily donate towards nature conservation a small fraction of the financial savings they experience through a more frugal use of resources.

It has been widely acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation. Such acknowledgment has been made by the [[Brundtland Report|Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=UN Documents Gathering a body of global agreements}}</ref> and the Millennium Development Goals.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Millennium Development Goals Report, 2009|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/MDG_Report_2009_ENG.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref> There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions that it is impossible to separate economic development issues from environment issues: according to the Brundtland report, \"poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Common Future, From One Earth to One World|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-ov.htm#I|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref> Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs (such as nutrition and medicine) and general well-being.<ref>{{cite web|date=May 2008|last=Lusigi|first=Angela|title=Linking Poverty to Environmental Sustainability|url=http://www.povertyandconservation.info/docs/20080524-UNDP-UNEP_Poverty_Environment_Initiative.pdf|publisher=UNDP-UNEP Poverty&nbsp;\u2014 Environment Initiative|accessdate=2011-04-02}}</ref> As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials.

For example, teaching [[water treatment]] to the poor by boiling their water with [[charcoal]], would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy, whereas using [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] [[solar water disinfection]] would be. Also, sustainable [[best practices]] can involve the [[recycling]] of materials, such as the use of [[plastics recycling|recycled]] [[plastics]] for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as [[Bridges to Prosperity]]'s use of wire rope from shipping container [[gantry cranes]] to act as the structural wire rope for [[footbridges]] that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.\n\n===Human relationship to nature===\nAccording to [[Murray Bookchin]], the idea that humans must dominate nature is common in [[social hierarchy|hierarchical]] societies. Bookchin contends that [[capitalism]] and [[Market (economics)|market]] relationships, if unchecked, can reduce the planet to a mere resource to be exploited. Nature is thus treated as a [[commodity]]: \"The plundering of the human spirit by the market place is paralleled by the plundering of the earth by capital.\"<ref>Bookchin, M. (2004). ''Post Scarcity Anarchism''. Oakland: [[AK Press]], pp.&nbsp;24\u201325. {{ISBN|978-1-904859-06-2}}.</ref> [[Social ecology (theory)|Social ecology]], founded by Bookchin, is based on the conviction that nearly all of humanity's present ecological problems originate in, indeed are mere symptoms of, dysfunctional social arrangements. Whereas most authors proceed as if our ecological problems can be fixed by implementing recommendations which stem from physical, biological, economic, etc., studies, Bookchin's claim is that these problems can only be resolved by understanding the underlying social processes and intervening in those processes by applying the concepts and methods of the social sciences.<ref>Bookchin, M.

Most governments and international organizations that aim to achieve sustainability employ all three approaches, though they may disagree on which deserves priority. The three approaches, embodied in the [[I&nbsp;=&nbsp;PAT]] formula,<ref name=Ehrlich&Holden/> can be summarized as follows:\n\n'''Affluence:''' Many believe that the best path to sustainability is reducing [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. This theory is represented most clearly in the idea of a [[steady-state economy]], meaning an economy without growth. Methods in this category include, among others, the [[phase-out of lightweight plastic bags]], promoting [[biking]], and increasing [[energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]]. For example, according to the report \"Plastic and Climate\", the plastic could emit [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, as much as 15% of the earth's remaining carbon budget, by 2050 and over 50% by 2100, except the impacts on [[phytoplankton]]<ref>{{cite book |title=Plastic & Climate The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet |date=May 2019 |publisher=Center for International Environmental Law, Environmental Integrity Project, FracTracker Alliance, Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, 5 Gyres, and Break Free From Plastic. |pages=4\u20135 |url=https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-FINAL-2019.pdf |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ciel.org\"/> The report says that for solving the problem, [[Consumption (economics)|reduction in consumption]] will be essential<ref>{{cite book |title=Plastic & Climate The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet |date=May 2019 |publisher=Center for International Environmental Law, Environmental Integrity Project, FracTracker Alliance, Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, 5 Gyres, and Break Free From Plastic. |pages=82\u201385 |url=https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Plastic-and-Climate-FINAL-2019.pdf |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Population:''' Others think that the most effective means of achieving sustainability is [[population control]], for example by improving access to [[birth control]] and education<ref>{{cite web |last1=Perkins |first1=Sid |title=The best way to reduce your carbon footprint is one the government isn't telling you about |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/best-way-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-one-government-isn-t-telling-you-about |website=Science |accessdate=11 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n'''Technology:''' Still others hold that the most promising path to sustainability is new technology. This theory may be seen as a form of [[technological optimism]]. One popular tactic in this category is transitioning to [[renewable energy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=M.

Law literature has indicated legislative innovation might be needed.<ref>Frederik H. Kistenkas, ''Sustainable Development: New Thoughts, New Policy, New Law?'' p. 535-548, in. V.
