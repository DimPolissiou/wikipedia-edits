Sometimes called '''the Virgin Queen''', '''Gloriana''' or '''Good Queen Bess''', Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the [[House of Tudor]].\n\nElizabeth was the daughter of [[Henry VIII]] and [[Anne Boleyn]], his second wife, who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth's birth. Anne's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Her half-brother, [[Edward VI]], ruled until his death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to [[Lady Jane Grey]] and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and the younger Elizabeth, in spite of [[Third Succession Act|statute law to the contrary]].  Edward's will was set aside and Mary became queen, deposing Lady Jane Grey. During Mary's reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\n\nIn 1558 upon Mary's death, Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel.<ref>\"I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.\" Elizabeth's first speech as queen, [[Hatfield House]], 20 November 1558. Loades, 35.</ref> She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]]. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the [[supreme governor]]. This [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] was to evolve into the [[Church of England]]. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. She was eventually succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, [[James VI of Scotland]]. She had earlier been responsible for the imprisonment and execution of James's mother, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].\n\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been.<ref name=\"starkey5\">Starkey ''Elizabeth: Woman'', 5.</ref> One of her mottoes was \"''video et taceo''\" (\"I see but say nothing\").<ref>Neale, 386.</ref> In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope [[Regnans in Excelsis|declared her illegitimate]] in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers' secret service. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Spanish Kingdom|Spain]]. She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the [[Netherlands]], France, and . By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|war with Spain]].  England's victory against the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history.\n\nAs she grew older, Elizabeth became celebrated for her [[virginity]]. A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. Elizabeth's reign became known as the [[Elizabethan era]]. The period is famous for the flourishing of [[English Renaissance theatre|English drama]], led by playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]], and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as [[Francis Drake]]. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler,<ref>Somerset, 729.</ref> who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. After the short reigns of her half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.<ref name=starkey5/>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.png|thumb|left|Elizabeth's parents, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.

Her mother was Henry's second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]]. At birth, Elizabeth was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of England. Her older half-sister, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], had lost her position as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary's mother, [[Catherine of Aragon]], to marry Anne, with the intent to sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession.<ref>Loades, 3\u20135</ref><ref>Somerset, 4\u20135.</ref> She was baptised on 10 September 1533; Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]], the [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], the [[Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk|Duchess of Norfolk]] and the [[Margaret Wotton, Marchioness of Dorset|Dowager Marchioness of Dorset]] stood as her godparents.

His will ignored the [[Succession to the Crown Act 1543]], excluded both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir [[Lady Jane Grey]], granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister, [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]]. Jane was proclaimed queen by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy council]], but her support quickly crumbled, and she was deposed after nine days. On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at her side.<ref>Elizabeth had assembled 2,000 horsemen, \"a remarkable tribute to the size of her affinity\". Loades 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n[[File:Felipe of Spain and MariaTudor-2010-13-09.jpg|thumb|Philip and Mary I, during whose reign Elizabeth was heir presumptive]]\nThe show of solidarity between the sisters did not last long. Mary, a devout Catholic, was determined to crush the Protestant faith in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she ordered that everyone attend Catholic Mass; Elizabeth had to outwardly conform. Mary's initial popularity ebbed away in 1554 when she announced plans to marry [[Philip II of Spain|Philip of Spain]], the son of [[Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] and an active Catholic.<ref>Loades, 27.</ref> Discontent spread rapidly through the country, and many looked to Elizabeth as a focus for their opposition to Mary's religious policies.\n\nIn January and February 1554, [[Wyatt's rebellion]] broke out; it was soon suppressed.<ref>Neale, 45.</ref> Elizabeth was brought to court, and interrogated regarding her role, and on 18 March, she was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].

Mary's closest confidant, Charles V's ambassador [[Simon Renard]], argued that her throne would never be safe while Elizabeth lived; and the Chancellor, [[Stephen Gardiner]], worked to have Elizabeth put on trial.<ref>Somerset, 51.</ref> Elizabeth's supporters in the government, including [[William Paget, 1st Baron Paget|Lord Paget]], convinced Mary to spare her sister in the absence of hard evidence against her. Instead, on 22 May, Elizabeth was moved from the Tower to [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]], where she was to spend almost a year under house arrest in the charge of Sir [[Henry Bedingfeld|Henry Bedingfield]]. Crowds cheered her all along the way.<ref name=\"loades29\">Loades, 29.</ref><ref>\"The wives of Wycombe passed cake and wafers to her until her litter became so burdened that she had to beg them to stop.\" Neale, 49.</ref>\n\n[[File:Hatfield House Old Palace.jpg|thumb|left|Hatfield House, where Elizabeth lived during Mary's reign]]\n\nOn 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was recalled to court to attend the final stages of Mary's [[Mary I of England#False pregnancy|apparent pregnancy]]. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear that Mary was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child.<ref>Loades, 32.</ref> Elizabeth's succession seemed assured.<ref>Somerset, 66.</ref>\n\nKing Philip, who ascended the Spanish throne in 1556, acknowledged the new political reality and cultivated his sister-in-law.

By October 1558, Elizabeth was already making plans for her government. On 6 November, Mary recognised Elizabeth as her heir.<ref>Neale, 59.</ref> On 17 November 1558, Mary died and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne.\n\n== Accession ==\n[[File:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|thumb|Elizabeth I in her coronation robes, patterned with [[Tudor rose]]s and trimmed with [[ermine]]]]\n\nElizabeth became queen at the age of 25, and declared her intentions to her Council and other peers who had come to Hatfield to swear allegiance. The speech contains the first record of her adoption of the medieval [[political theology]] of the sovereign's \"two bodies\": the body natural and the [[body politic]]:<ref>Kantorowicz, ix</ref>\n\n<blockquote>My lords, the law of nature moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, considering I am God's creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring from the bottom of my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me.

She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons in defiance of a key Protestant belief.<ref name=collinson>Collinson, Patrick, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8636 \"Elizabeth I (1533\u20131603)\"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2008).  Retrieved 23 August 2011.</ref>\n\nIn terms of public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with religious matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively-declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.\n\nElizabeth and her advisers perceived the threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical [[Puritan]]s though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms.<ref>{{cite book|title=This Sceptred Isle 1547\u20131660|chapter=Disc 1|isbn=978-0-563-55769-2|last1=Lee|first1=Christopher|authorlink1=Christopher Lee (historian)|origyear=1995|year=1998|title-link=This Sceptred Isle}}</ref> As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the [[Edward VI of England#Reformation|Protestant settlement of Edward VI]], with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.<ref>Loades, 46.</ref>\n\nThe [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] backed the proposals strongly, but the bill of supremacy met opposition in the [[House of Lords]], particularly from the bishops. Elizabeth was fortunate that many bishoprics were vacant at the time, including the [[Archbishopric of Canterbury]].<ref>\"It was fortunate that ten out of twenty-six bishoprics were vacant, for of late there had been a high rate of mortality among the episcopate, and a fever had conveniently carried off Mary's Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Reginald Pole]], less than twenty-four hours after her own death\". Somerset, 98.</ref><ref>\"There were no less than ten sees unrepresented through death or illness and the carelessness of 'the accursed cardinal' [Pole]\". Black, 10.</ref> This enabled supporters amongst peers to outvote the bishops and conservative peers. Nevertheless, Elizabeth was forced to accept the title of [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]] rather than the more contentious title of [[Supreme Head]], which many thought unacceptable for a woman to bear. The new [[Act of Supremacy 1559|Act of Supremacy]] became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the [[heresy]] laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]] was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 [[Book of Common Prayer]] compulsory, though the penalties for [[recusancy]], or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.<ref>Somerset, 101\u2013103.</ref>\n\n== Marriage question ==\n\nFrom the start of Elizabeth's reign, it was expected that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships.<ref>Loades, 38.</ref><ref>Haigh, 19.</ref> She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]], 22 years her junior.

The marriage was the first of a series of errors of judgement by Mary that handed the victory to the Scottish Protestants and to Elizabeth. Darnley quickly became unpopular and was murdered in February 1567 by conspirators almost certainly led by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]]. Shortly afterwards, on 15 May 1567, Mary married Bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband. Elizabeth confronted Mary about the marriage, writing to her:\n\n<blockquote>How could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.<ref>Letter to Mary, Queen of Scots, 23 June 1567.\" Quoted by Loades, 69\u201370.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThese events led rapidly to Mary's defeat and imprisonment in [[Loch Leven Castle]]. The Scottish lords forced her to [[abdicate]] in favour of her son [[James VI]], who had been born in June 1566. James was taken to [[Stirling Castle]] to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from [[Loch Leven (Kinross)|Loch Leven]] in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe.

The exception was the English occupation of [[Le Havre]] from October 1562 to June 1563, which ended in failure when Elizabeth's [[Huguenot]] allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port.

It also extended Spanish influence along the [[English Channel|channel]] coast of France, where the Catholic League was strong, and exposed England to invasion.<ref name=haigh135/> The [[Siege of Antwerp (1584\u20131585)|siege of Antwerp]] in the summer of 1585 by the Duke of Parma necessitated some reaction on the part of the English and the Dutch.

Elizabeth from the start did not really back this course of action. Her strategy, to support the Dutch on the surface with an English army, while beginning secret peace talks with Spain within days of Leicester's arrival in Holland,<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 43.</ref> had necessarily to be at odds with Leicester's, who wanted and was expected by the Dutch to fight an active campaign.

Elizabeth saw this as a Dutch ploy to force her to accept sovereignty over the Netherlands,<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 50.</ref> which so far she had always declined. She wrote to Leicester:\n\n<blockquote>We could never have imagined (had we not seen it fall out in experience) that a man raised up by ourself and extraordinarily favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour&nbsp;...

The military campaign was severely hampered by Elizabeth's repeated refusals to send promised funds for her starving soldiers.

The Tsar even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised.<ref name=\"muscovy\"/> English merchant and explorer [[Anthony Jenkinson]], who began his career as a representative of the [[Muscovy Company]], became the queen's [[List of ambassadors of the Kingdom of England to Russia|special ambassador]] to the court of Ivan the Terrible.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Coote |first1=Charles Henry |title=Early Voyages and Travels to Russia and Persia by Anthony Jenkinson and other Englishmen |date=2017 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-1317146612 |page=1, Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NAkkDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT20&lpg}}</ref>\nUpon Ivan's death in 1584, he was succeeded by his less-ambitious son [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor]]. Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in maintaining exclusive trading rights with England. Feodor declared his kingdom open to all foreigners, and dismissed the English ambassador Sir [[Jerome Bowes]], whose pomposity had been tolerated by Ivan. Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent [[Boris Godunov]] that he convince the Tsar to reconsider. The negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor with two of his many titles omitted. Elizabeth continued to appeal to Feodor in half appealing, half reproachful letters. She proposed an alliance, something which she had refused to do when offered one by Feodor's father, but was turned down.<ref name=\"muscovy\">Crankshaw, Edward, ''Russia and Britain'', Collins, ''The Nations and Britain'' series.</ref>\n\n===Muslim states===\n[[File:MoorishAmbassador to Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|upright|Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud was the Moorish ambassador to Elizabeth in 1600.]]\nTrade and diplomatic relations developed between England and the [[Barbary states]] during the rule of Elizabeth.<ref name=\"vaughan\">{{cite book| author = Virginia Mason Vaughan| title = Performing Blackness on English Stages, 1500\u20131800| url = https://books.google.com/?id=19_SIlq3ZvsC&pg=PA57| year = 2005| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-84584-7| page = 57 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = Allardyce Nicoll| title = Shakespeare Survey With Index 1\u201310| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OeakAOji13EC&pg=PA90| year = 2002| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-52347-9| page = 90 }}</ref> England established a trading relationship with [[Morocco]] in opposition to Spain, selling armour, ammunition, timber, and metal in exchange for Moroccan sugar, in spite of a [[Pope|Papal]] ban.<ref>{{cite book| first = Emily Carroll |last=Bartels| title = Speaking of the Moor |page=24| url = https://books.google.com/?id=S6Z9J0OJmmQC&pg=PA24| year = 2008| publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press| isbn = 978-0-8122-4076-4 }}</ref> In 1600, [[Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud]], the principal secretary to the Moroccan ruler [[Ahmad al-Mansur|Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur]], visited England as an ambassador to the court of Queen Elizabeth I,<ref name=\"vaughan\"/><ref>[[University of Birmingham]] Collections [http://mimsy.bham.ac.uk/detail.php?t=objects&type=related&kv=101212 Mimsy.bham.ac.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228082016/http://mimsy.bham.ac.uk/detail.php?t=objects&type=related&kv=101212 |date=28 February 2009 }}</ref> to negotiate an [[Anglo-Moroccan alliance]] against Spain.<ref name=\"tate.org.uk\">[[Tate Gallery]] exhibition \"East-West: Objects between cultures\", [http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/east-west-objects-between-cultures/east-west-room-1 Tate.org.uk]</ref><ref name=\"vaughan\"/> Elizabeth \"agreed to sell munitions supplies to Morocco, and she and Mulai Ahmad al-Mansur talked on and off about mounting a joint operation against the Spanish\".<ref name=\"Kupperman39\">Kupperman, 39.</ref> Discussions, however, remained inconclusive, and both rulers died within two years of the embassy.<ref>Nicoll, 96.</ref>\n\nDiplomatic relations were also established with the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the chartering of the [[Levant Company]] and the dispatch of the first English ambassador to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]], [[William Harborne]], in 1578.<ref name=Kupperman39/> For the first time, a Treaty of Commerce was signed in 1580.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&pg=PA353 |title=The Encyclopedia of world history by Peter N.

A new generation was in power. With the exception of Lord Burghley, the most important politicians had died around 1590: the Earl of Leicester in 1588; Sir Francis Walsingham in 1590; and Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] in 1591.<ref>Collinson, 89.</ref> Factional strife in the government, which had not existed in a noteworthy form before the 1590s,<ref>Doran, ''Monarchy'', 216.</ref> now became its hallmark.<ref>Hammer, 1\u20132.</ref> A&nbsp;bitter rivalry arose between the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], son of Lord Burghley and their respective adherents, and the struggle for the most powerful positions in the state marred politics.<ref>Hammer, 1, 9.</ref> The queen's personal authority was lessening,<ref>Hammer, 9\u201310</ref> as is shown in the 1594 affair of Dr. Lopez, her trusted physician. When he was wrongly accused by the Earl of Essex of treason out of personal pique, she could not prevent his execution, although she had been angry about his arrest and seems not to have believed in his guilt.<ref>Lacey, 117\u2013120</ref>\n\nDuring the last years of her reign, Elizabeth came to rely on the granting of monopolies as a cost-free system of patronage, rather than asking Parliament for more subsidies in a time of war.<ref>A Patent of Monopoly gave the holder control over an aspect of trade or manufacture. See Neale, 382.</ref> The practice soon led to [[price fixing|price-fixing]], the enrichment of courtiers at the public's expense, and widespread resentment.<ref>Williams ''Elizabeth'', 208.</ref> This culminated in agitation in the House of Commons during the parliament of 1601.<ref>Black, 192\u2013194.</ref> In her famous \"[[Golden Speech]]\" of 30 November 1601 at [[Whitehall Palace]] to a deputation of 140 members, Elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions:<ref>Neale, 383\u2013384.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Who keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess.

During the 1590s, some of the great names of [[English literature]] entered their maturity, including [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]]. During this period and into the [[Jacobean era]] that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks.<ref>Black, 239\u2013245.</ref> The notion of a great [[Elizabethan era]] depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.<ref>Haigh, 176.</ref>\n\nAs Elizabeth aged her image gradually changed. She was portrayed as [[Belphoebe]] or [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], and after the Armada, as [[Gloriana]], the eternally youthful [[Faerie Queene]] of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s poem.

After Essex's desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies.<ref>Loades, 97.</ref> In February 1601, the earl tried to raise a rebellion in London. He intended to seize the queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on 25 February. Elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events.

His political mantle passed to his son, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], who soon became the leader of the government.<ref>After Essex's downfall, James VI of Scotland referred to Cecil as \"king there in effect\". Croft, 48.</ref> One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a [[succession to Elizabeth I of England|smooth succession]]. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret.<ref>Cecil wrote to James, \"The subject itself is so perilous to touch amongst us as it setteth a mark upon his head forever that hatcheth such a bird\". Willson, 154.</ref> He therefore entered into a [[Secret correspondence of James VI|coded negotiation]] with [[James VI of Scotland]], who had a strong but unrecognised claim.<ref>James VI of Scotland was a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England, and thus Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed, since Henry VII was Elizabeth's paternal grandfather.</ref> Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and \"secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions\".<ref>Willson, 154.</ref> The advice worked. James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: \"So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort\".<ref>Willson, 155.</ref> In historian J.&nbsp;E. Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with \"unmistakable if veiled phrases\".<ref>Neale, 385.</ref>\n\n[[File:Funeral Elisabeth.jpg|thumb|upright=1.85|Elizabeth's funeral cort\u00e8ge, 1603, with banners of her royal ancestors]]\n\nThe Queen's health remained fair until the autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of [[Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham]], the niece of her cousin and close friend [[Catherine Carey|Lady Knollys]], came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a \"settled and unremovable melancholy\", and sat motionless on a cushion for hours on end.<ref>Black, 411.</ref> When Robert Cecil told her that she must go to bed, she snapped: \"Must is not a word to use to princes, little man.\" She died on 24 March 1603 at [[Richmond Palace]], between two and three in the morning.

Sometimes called '''the Virgin Queen''', '''Gloriana''' or '''Good Queen Bess''', Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the [[House of Tudor]].\n\nElizabeth was the daughter of [[Henry VIII]] and [[Anne Boleyn]], his second wife, who was executed two-and-a-half years after Elizabeth's birth. Anne's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Her half-brother, [[Edward VI]], ruled until his death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to [[Lady Jane Grey]] and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mary I of England|Mary]] and the younger Elizabeth, in spite of [[Third Succession Act|statute law to the contrary]].  Edward's will was set aside and Mary became queen, deposing Lady Jane Grey. During Mary's reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\n\nIn 1558 upon Mary's death, Elizabeth succeeded her half-sister to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel.<ref>\"I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.\" Elizabeth's first speech as queen, [[Hatfield House]], 20 November 1558. Loades, 35.</ref> She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]]. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the [[supreme governor]]. This [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]] was to evolve into the [[Church of England]]. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. She was eventually succeeded by her first cousin twice removed, [[James VI of Scotland]]. She had earlier been responsible for the imprisonment and execution of James's mother, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].\n\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been.<ref name=\"starkey5\">Starkey ''Elizabeth: Woman'', 5.</ref> One of her mottoes was \"''video et taceo''\" (\"I see but say nothing\").<ref>Neale, 386.</ref> In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope [[Regnans in Excelsis|declared her illegitimate]] in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers' secret service. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain. She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585\u20131604)|war with Spain]].  England's victory against the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 associated Elizabeth with one of the greatest military victories in English history.\n\nAs she grew older, Elizabeth became celebrated for her [[virginity]]. A cult grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. Elizabeth's reign became known as the [[Elizabethan era]]. The period is famous for the flourishing of [[English Renaissance theatre|English drama]], led by playwrights such as [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]], and for the seafaring prowess of English adventurers such as [[Francis Drake]]. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler,<ref>Somerset, 729.</ref> who enjoyed more than her share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. After the short reigns of her half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped forge a sense of national identity.<ref name=starkey5/>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.png|thumb|left|Elizabeth's parents, Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Anne was executed within three years of Elizabeth's birth.]]\n\nElizabeth was born at [[Greenwich Palace]] and was named after her grandmothers, [[Elizabeth of York]] and [[Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire|Elizabeth Howard]].<ref>Somerset, 4.</ref> She was the second child of [[Henry VIII of England]] born in wedlock to survive infancy. Her mother was Henry's second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]]. At birth, Elizabeth was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne of England. Her older half-sister, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], had lost her position as a legitimate heir when Henry annulled his marriage to Mary's mother, [[Catherine of Aragon]], to marry Anne, with the intent to sire a male heir and ensure the Tudor succession.<ref>Loades, 3\u20135</ref><ref>Somerset, 4\u20135.</ref> She was baptised on 10 September 1533; Archbishop [[Thomas Cranmer]], the [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], the [[Elizabeth Stafford, Duchess of Norfolk|Duchess of Norfolk]] and the [[Margaret Wotton, Marchioness of Dorset|Dowager Marchioness of Dorset]] stood as her godparents. A canopy was carried at the ceremony over the three-day old child by her uncle [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|Viscount Rochford]], [[John Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford|Lord Hussey]], [[Lord Thomas Howard]], and [[William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stanley, Earl of Derby|first1=Edward|title=Correspondence of Edward, Third Earl of Derby, During the Years 24 to 31 Henry VIII.: Preserved in a Ms. in the Possession of Miss Pfarington, of Worden Hall, Volume 19|date=1890|publisher=Chetham Society|page=89}}</ref>\n\nElizabeth was two years and eight months old when her mother was beheaded on 19 May 1536,<ref>Loades, 6\u20137.</ref> four months after Catherine of Aragon's death from natural causes.

The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively-declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.\n\nElizabeth and her advisers perceived the threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical [[Puritan]]s though, who were pushing for far-reaching reforms.<ref>{{cite book|title=This Sceptred Isle 1547\u20131660|chapter=Disc 1|isbn=978-0-563-55769-2|last1=Lee|first1=Christopher|authorlink1=Christopher Lee (historian)|origyear=1995|year=1998|title-link=This Sceptred Isle}}</ref> As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the [[Edward VI of England#Reformation|Protestant settlement of Edward VI]], with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.<ref>Loades, 46.</ref>\n\nThe [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] backed the proposals strongly, but the bill of supremacy met opposition in the [[House of Lords]], particularly from the bishops.

The new [[Act of Supremacy 1559|Act of Supremacy]] became law on 8 May 1559. All public officials were to swear an oath of loyalty to the monarch as the supreme governor or risk disqualification from office; the [[heresy]] laws were repealed, to avoid a repeat of the persecution of dissenters practised by Mary. At the same time, a new [[Act of Uniformity 1559|Act of Uniformity]] was passed, which made attendance at church and the use of an adapted version of the 1552 [[Book of Common Prayer]] compulsory, though the penalties for [[recusancy]], or failure to attend and conform, were not extreme.<ref>Somerset, 101\u2013103.</ref>\n\n== Marriage question ==\n\nFrom the start of Elizabeth's reign, it was expected that she would marry and the question arose to whom.

Elizabeth confronted Mary about the marriage, writing to her:\n\n<blockquote>How could a worse choice be made for your honour than in such haste to marry such a subject, who besides other and notorious lacks, public fame has charged with the murder of your late husband, besides the touching of yourself also in some part, though we trust in that behalf falsely.<ref>Letter to Mary, Queen of Scots, 23 June 1567.\" Quoted by Loades, 69\u201370.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThese events led rapidly to Mary's defeat and imprisonment in [[Loch Leven Castle]]. The Scottish lords forced her to [[abdicate]] in favour of her son [[James VI]], who had been born in June 1566. James was taken to [[Stirling Castle]] to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from [[Loch Leven (Kinross)|Loch Leven]] in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe. Rather than risk returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France and the Catholic enemies of England, they detained her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.<ref>Loades, 72\u201373.</ref>\n\n===Catholic cause===\n[[File:Sir Francis Walsingham by John De Critz the Elder.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's [[spymaster]], uncovered several plots against her life.]]\nMary was soon the focus for rebellion. In 1569 there was a major Catholic [[Rising of the North|rising in the North]]; the goal was to free Mary, marry her to [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]], and put her on the English throne.<ref name=\"Loades, 73\">Loades, 73.</ref> After the rebels' defeat, over 750 of them were executed on Elizabeth's orders.<ref>Williams, ''Norfolk'', 174.</ref> In the belief that the revolt had been successful, [[Pope Pius V]] issued a [[papal bull|bull]] in 1570, titled ''[[Regnans in Excelsis]]'', which declared \"Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime\" to be excommunicated and a [[Heresy|heretic]], releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her.<ref name=\"McGrath, 69\">McGrath, 69</ref><ref name=\"Collinson p. 67\"/> Catholics who obeyed her orders were threatened with [[excommunication]].<ref name=\"McGrath, 69\"/> The papal bull provoked legislative initiatives against Catholics by Parliament, which were, however, mitigated by Elizabeth's intervention.<ref>Collinson, 67\u201368.</ref> In 1581, to convert English subjects to Catholicism with \"the intent\" to withdraw them from their allegiance to Elizabeth was made a [[High treason|treasonable offence]], carrying the death penalty.<ref>Collinson, 68.</ref> From the 1570s [[missionary|missionary priests]] from continental [[seminaries]] went to England secretly in the cause of the \"reconversion of England\".<ref name=\"Collinson p. 67\"/> Many suffered execution, engendering a cult of [[martyrdom]].<ref name=\"Collinson p. 67\">Collinson, 67.</ref>\n\n''Regnans in Excelsis'' gave English Catholics a strong incentive to look to Mary Stuart as the legitimate sovereign of England. Mary may not have been told of every Catholic plot to put her on the English throne, but from the [[Ridolfi Plot]] of 1571 (which caused Mary's suitor, the Duke of Norfolk, to lose his head) to the [[Babington Plot]] of 1586, Elizabeth's spymaster Sir [[Francis Walsingham]] and the royal council keenly assembled a case against her.<ref name=\"Loades, 73\"/> At first, Elizabeth resisted calls for Mary's death. By late 1586, she had been persuaded to sanction her trial and execution on the evidence of letters written during the Babington Plot.<ref>Guy, 483\u2013484.</ref> Elizabeth's proclamation of the sentence announced that \"the said Mary, pretending title to the same Crown, had compassed and imagined within the same realm divers things tending to the hurt, death and destruction of our royal person.\"<ref>Loades, 78\u201379.</ref> On 8 February 1587, Mary was beheaded at [[Fotheringhay Castle]], Northamptonshire.<ref>Guy, 1\u201311.</ref> After Mary's execution, Elizabeth claimed that she had not intended for the signed execution warrant to be dispatched, and blamed her Secretary, [[William Davison (diplomat)|William Davison]], for implementing it without her knowledge. The sincerity of Elizabeth's remorse and whether or not she wanted to delay the warrant have been called into question both by her contemporaries and later historians.<ref name=collinson/>\n\n== Wars and overseas trade ==\nElizabeth's foreign policy was largely defensive. The exception was the English occupation of [[Le Havre]] from October 1562 to June 1563, which ended in failure when Elizabeth's [[Huguenot]] allies joined with the Catholics to retake the port. Elizabeth's intention had been to exchange Le Havre for [[Calais]], lost to France in January 1558.<ref>Frieda, 191.</ref> Only through the activities of her fleets did Elizabeth pursue an aggressive policy.

In December 1584, an alliance between Philip II and the French [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] at [[Treaty of Joinville|Joinville]] undermined the ability of Anjou's brother, [[Henry III of France]], to counter [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] domination of the Netherlands. It also extended Spanish influence along the [[English Channel|channel]] coast of France, where the Catholic League was strong, and exposed England to invasion.<ref name=haigh135/> The [[Siege of Antwerp (1584\u20131585)|siege of Antwerp]] in the summer of 1585 by the Duke of Parma necessitated some reaction on the part of the English and the Dutch. The outcome was the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] of August 1585, in which Elizabeth promised military support to the Dutch.<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 20\u201326.</ref> The treaty marked the beginning of the [[Anglo\u2013Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War]], which lasted until the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]] in 1604.\n\nThe expedition was led by her former suitor, the Earl of Leicester. Elizabeth from the start did not really back this course of action. Her strategy, to support the Dutch on the surface with an English army, while beginning secret peace talks with Spain within days of Leicester's arrival in Holland,<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 43.</ref> had necessarily to be at odds with Leicester's, who wanted and was expected by the Dutch to fight an active campaign. Elizabeth, on the other hand, wanted him \"to avoid at all costs any decisive action with the enemy\".<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 72.</ref> He enraged Elizabeth by accepting the post of Governor-General from the Dutch [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]]. Elizabeth saw this as a Dutch ploy to force her to accept sovereignty over the Netherlands,<ref>Strong and van Dorsten, 50.</ref> which so far she had always declined. She wrote to Leicester:\n\n<blockquote>We could never have imagined (had we not seen it fall out in experience) that a man raised up by ourself and extraordinarily favoured by us, above any other subject of this land, would have in so contemptible a sort broken our commandment in a cause that so greatly touches us in honour&nbsp;...

The military campaign was severely hampered by Elizabeth's repeated refusals to send promised funds for her starving soldiers. Her unwillingness to commit herself to the cause, Leicester's own shortcomings as a political and military leader, and the faction-ridden and chaotic situation of Dutch politics led to the failure of the campaign.<ref>Haynes, 15; Strong and van Dorsten, 72\u201379.</ref> Leicester finally resigned his command in December 1587.\n\n===Spanish Armada===\n[[File:N\u00edcholas-Hilliard-Elizabeth-I-Queen-of-England-c-1586-87.tif|thumb|left|Portrait from 1586\u20131587, by Nicholas Hilliard, around the time of the voyages of Sir [[Francis Drake]]]]\nMeanwhile, Sir [[Francis Drake]] had undertaken a major voyage against Spanish ports and ships in the [[Caribbean]] in 1585 and 1586.

It was her first venture into France since the retreat from Le Havre in 1563. Henry's succession was strongly contested by the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports.

As for all such expeditions, Elizabeth was unwilling to invest in the supplies and reinforcements requested by the commanders. Norreys left for London to plead in person for more support. In his absence, a Catholic League army almost destroyed the remains of his army at [[Craon, Mayenne|Craon]], north-west France, in May 1591. In July, Elizabeth sent out another force under [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], to help Henry IV in besieging [[Rouen]]. The result was just as dismal.

She often wrote to [[Ivan the Terrible]] on amicable terms, though the Tsar was often annoyed by her focus on commerce rather than on the possibility of a military alliance.

See Neale, 382.</ref> The practice soon led to [[price fixing|price-fixing]], the enrichment of courtiers at the public's expense, and widespread resentment.<ref>Williams ''Elizabeth'', 208.</ref> This culminated in agitation in the House of Commons during the parliament of 1601.<ref>Black, 192\u2013194.</ref> In her famous \"[[Golden Speech]]\" of 30 November 1601 at [[Whitehall Palace]] to a deputation of 140 members, Elizabeth professed ignorance of the abuses, and won the members over with promises and her usual appeal to the emotions:<ref>Neale, 383\u2013384.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Who keeps their sovereign from the lapse of error, in which, by ignorance and not by intent they might have fallen, what thank they deserve, we know, though you may guess. And as nothing is more dear to us than the loving conservation of our subjects' hearts, what an undeserved doubt might we have incurred if the abusers of our liberality, the thrallers of our people, the wringers of the poor, had not been told us!<ref>Loades, 86.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Elizabeth I portrait, Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger c.1595.jpg|thumb|alt=Elizabeth I in later years|Portrait of Elizabeth I attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]] or his studio, c. 1595.]]\nThis same period of economic and political uncertainty, however, produced an unsurpassed literary flowering in England.<ref>Black, 239.</ref> The first signs of a new literary movement had appeared at the end of the second decade of Elizabeth's reign, with [[John Lyly]]'s ''Euphues'' and [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Shepheardes Calender]]'' in 1578. During the 1590s, some of the great names of [[English literature]] entered their maturity, including [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Christopher Marlowe]]. During this period and into the [[Jacobean era]] that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks.<ref>Black, 239\u2013245.</ref> The notion of a great [[Elizabethan era]] depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.<ref>Haigh, 176.</ref>\n\nAs Elizabeth aged her image gradually changed. She was portrayed as [[Belphoebe]] or [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], and after the Armada, as [[Gloriana]], the eternally youthful [[Faerie Queene]] of [[Edmund Spenser]]'s poem. Elizabeth gave [[Edmund Spenser]] a pension, as this was unusual for her, it indicates that she liked his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fivebooks.com/best-books/helen-hackett-on-elizabeth-i/|title=The best books on Elizabeth I \u2013 a Five Books interview with Helen Hackett|website=Five Books|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> Her painted portraits became less realistic and more a set of enigmatic [[iconography|icons]] that made her look much younger than she was. In fact, her skin had been scarred by [[smallpox]] in 1562, leaving her half bald and dependent on wigs and [[Skin whitening|cosmetics]].<ref name=\"loades92\">Loades, 92.</ref> Her love of sweets and fear of dentists contributed to severe tooth decay and loss to such an extent that foreign ambassadors had a hard time understanding her speech.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/11353064/The-Tudors-had-bad-teeth-What-rot.html \"The Tudors had bad teeth?

Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly.\" Yet he added, \"her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal.\"<ref>De Maisse: a journal of all that was accomplished by Monsieur De Maisse, ambassador in England from King Henri IV to Queen Elizabeth, anno domini 1597, Nonesuch Press, 1931, pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Sir Walter Raleigh called her \"a lady whom time had surprised\".<ref>Haigh, 171.</ref>\n\nThe more Elizabeth's beauty faded, the more her [[Court (royal)|courtiers]] praised it.<ref name=loades92/> Elizabeth was happy to play the part,<ref>\"The metaphor of drama is an appropriate one for Elizabeth's reign, for her power was an illusion\u2014and an illusion was her power. Like Henry IV of France, she projected an image of herself which brought stability and prestige to her country. By constant attention to the details of her total performance, she kept the rest of the cast on their toes and kept her own part as queen.\" Haigh, 179.</ref> but it is possible that in the last decade of her life she began to believe her own performance. She became fond and indulgent of the charming but petulant young Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, who was Leicester's stepson and took liberties with her for which she forgave him.<ref name = \"Lds\">Loades, 93.</ref> She repeatedly appointed him to military posts despite his growing record of irresponsibility. After Essex's desertion of his command in Ireland in 1599, Elizabeth had him placed under house arrest and the following year deprived him of his monopolies.<ref>Loades, 97.</ref> In February 1601, the earl tried to raise a rebellion in London. He intended to seize the queen but few rallied to his support, and he was beheaded on 25 February. Elizabeth knew that her own misjudgements were partly to blame for this turn of events. An observer wrote in 1602: \"Her delight is to sit in the dark, and sometimes with shedding tears to bewail Essex.\"<ref>Black, 410.</ref>\n\n== Death ==\n\nElizabeth's senior adviser, [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]], died on 4 August 1598. His political mantle passed to his son, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], who soon became the leader of the government.<ref>After Essex's downfall, James VI of Scotland referred to Cecil as \"king there in effect\". Croft, 48.</ref> One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a [[succession to Elizabeth I of England|smooth succession]]. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret.<ref>Cecil wrote to James, \"The subject itself is so perilous to touch amongst us as it setteth a mark upon his head forever that hatcheth such a bird\". Willson, 154.</ref> He therefore entered into a [[Secret correspondence of James VI|coded negotiation]] with [[James VI of Scotland]], who had a strong but unrecognised claim.<ref>James VI of Scotland was a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of England, and thus Elizabeth's first cousin twice removed, since Henry VII was Elizabeth's paternal grandfather.</ref> Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and \"secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions\".<ref>Willson, 154.</ref> The advice worked. James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: \"So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them to you in grateful sort\".<ref>Willson, 155.</ref> In historian J.&nbsp;E. Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with \"unmistakable if veiled phrases\".<ref>Neale, 385.</ref>\n\n[[File:Funeral Elisabeth.jpg|thumb|upright=1.85|Elizabeth's funeral cort\u00e8ge, 1603, with banners of her royal ancestors]]\n\nThe Queen's health remained fair until the autumn of 1602, when a series of deaths among her friends plunged her into a severe depression. In February 1603, the death of [[Catherine Carey, Countess of Nottingham]], the niece of her cousin and close friend [[Catherine Carey|Lady Knollys]], came as a particular blow. In March, Elizabeth fell sick and remained in a \"settled and unremovable melancholy\", and sat motionless on a cushion for hours on end.<ref>Black, 411.</ref> When Robert Cecil told her that she must go to bed, she snapped: \"Must is not a word to use to princes, little man.\" She died on 24 March 1603 at [[Richmond Palace]], between two and three in the morning. A few hours later, Cecil and the council set their plans in motion and proclaimed James King of England.<ref>Black, 410\u2013411.</ref>\n\nWhile it has become normative to record the death of the Queen as occurring in 1603, following [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|English calendar reform]] in the 1750s, at the time England observed [[New Year's Day]] on 25 March, commonly known as [[Lady Day]]. Thus Elizabeth died on the last day of the year 1602 in the old calendar. The modern convention is to use the old calendar for the date and month while using the new for the year.<ref>{{cite book | title=1603: The Death of Queen Elizabeth, the Return of the Black Plague, the Rise of Shakespeare, Piracy, Witchcraft and the Birth of the Stuart Era | publisher=St. Martin's Press | author=Lee, Christopher | year=2004 | page=[https://archive.org/details/1603deathofqueen0000leec/page/ viii] | isbn=978-0-312-32139-0 | url=https://archive.org/details/1603deathofqueen0000leec/page/ }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Elizabeth I of England grave (left) 2013 crop2.jpg|thumb|left|Elizabeth as shown on her tomb at Westminster Abbey]]\nElizabeth's coffin was carried downriver at night to [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]], on a barge lit with torches.

James was depicted as a Catholic sympathiser, presiding over a corrupt court.<ref>Strong, 164.</ref> The triumphalist image that Elizabeth had cultivated towards the end of her reign, against a background of factionalism and military and economic difficulties,<ref>Haigh, 170.</ref> was taken at face value and her reputation inflated. [[Godfrey Goodman]], Bishop of Gloucester, recalled: \"When we had experience of a Scottish government, the Queen did seem to revive. Then was her memory much magnified.\"<ref>Weir, 488.</ref> Elizabeth's reign became idealised as a time when crown, church and parliament had worked in constitutional balance.<ref>Dobson and Watson, 257.</ref>\n\nThe picture of Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers of the early 17th century has proved lasting and influential.<ref>Haigh, 175, 182.</ref> Her memory was also revived during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], when the nation again found itself on the brink of invasion.<ref>Dobson and Watson, 258.</ref> In the [[Victorian era]], the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the imperial ideology of the day,<ref name=Ld/><ref>The age of Elizabeth was redrawn as one of [[chivalry]], epitomised by courtly encounters between the queen and sea-dog \"heroes\" such as Drake and Raleigh. Some Victorian narratives, such as Raleigh laying his cloak before the queen or presenting her with a potato, remain part of the myth. Dobson and Watson, 258.</ref> and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat.<ref>Haigh, 175.</ref><ref>In his preface to the 1952 reprint of ''Queen Elizabeth I'', J.&nbsp;E. Neale observed: \"The book was written before such words as \"ideological\", \"fifth column\", and \"cold war\" became current; and it is perhaps as well that they are not there. But the ideas are present, as is the idea of romantic leadership of a nation in peril, because they were present in Elizabethan times\".</ref> Historians of that period, such as [[J. E. Neale]] (1934) and [[A. L. Rowse]] (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress.<ref>Haigh, 182.</ref> Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.<ref>Kenyon, 207</ref>\n\nRecent historians, however, have taken a more complicated view of Elizabeth.<ref>Haigh, 183.</ref> Her reign is famous for the defeat of the Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on C\u00e1diz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea.<ref name=haigh142/> In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record.<ref>Black, 408\u2013409.</ref> Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and failed to provide her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.<ref>Haigh, 142\u2013147, 174\u2013177.</ref>\n\nElizabeth established an English church that helped shape a national identity and remains in place today.<ref>Loades, 46\u201350.</ref><ref>Weir, ''Elizabeth'', 487.</ref><ref>Hogge, 9\u201310.</ref> Those who praised her later as a Protestant heroine overlooked her refusal to drop all practices of Catholic origin from the Church of England.<ref>The new state religion was condemned at the time in such terms as \"a cloaked papistry, or mingle mangle\". Somerset, 102.</ref> Historians note that in her day, strict Protestants regarded the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement|Acts of Settlement and Uniformity of 1559]] as a compromise.<ref>Haigh, 45\u201346, 177.</ref><ref>Black, 14\u201315.</ref> In fact, Elizabeth believed that faith was personal and did not wish, as [[Francis Bacon]] put it, to \"make windows into men's hearts and secret thoughts\".<ref>Williams ''Elizabeth'', 50.</ref><ref>Haigh, 42.</ref>\n\nThough Elizabeth followed a largely defensive foreign policy, her reign raised England's status abroad. \"She is only a woman, only mistress of half an island,\" marvelled [[Pope Sixtus V]], \"and yet she makes herself feared by Spain, by France, by [[Holy Roman Empire|the Empire]], by all\".<ref name=\"somerset1\">Somerset, 727.</ref> Under Elizabeth, the nation gained a new self-confidence and sense of sovereignty, as [[Christendom]] fragmented.<ref name=somerset726/><ref>Hogge, 9''n''.</ref><ref>Loades, 1.</ref> Elizabeth was the first Tudor to recognise that a monarch ruled by popular consent.<ref>As Elizabeth's [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]], Sir [[Nicholas Bacon (courtier)|Nicholas Bacon]], put it on her behalf to parliament in 1559, the queen \"is not, nor ever meaneth to be, so wedded to her own will and fantasy that for the satisfaction thereof she will do anything&nbsp;... to bring any bondage or servitude to her people, or give any just occasion to them of any inward grudge whereby any tumults or stirs might arise as hath done of late days\".

Power Calculator could store and reuse pre-defined functions, of any [[arity]]. For example, a function could be set by <code>cube(x) = x * x * x</code>, and later it could be used in an expression like <code>5 + cube(4)</code>.<ref>[http://malektips.com/xp_calculator_0008.html MalekTips - Download a Free Graphing Calculator]</ref> It did not evaluate every time an operator was entered. Rather, the entire expression must be entered for calculation. In the ''Numeric'' mode, it presented a visual keypad, in all other modes the expression had to be typed in. A scrolling text area maintained a history of all calculations. The advanced view allowed declaring and graphing functions, along with a list of all the saved functions. A flyout window provided the option of choosing either a Cartesian co-ordinate system or polar co-ordinates. It could also save a list of variables for use in expression. Unit conversions of the following types were supported: length, mass, time, velocity, and temperature. PowerToy Calc had support for typing calculations using [[Reverse Polish Notation]] (RPN).

In most cases, TweakUI exposed settings that were otherwise only accessible by directly modifying [[Windows Registry]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url        = http://threeclicks.com/powertoys.htm\n|title      = Windows Power Toys for Windows XP and for Windows 95 98 NT and 2000 \n|publisher  = ThreeClicks.com, Inc.\n|date       = 24 April 2012\n|accessdate = 24 April 2012\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Included components ===\n\n*'''CabView''' opened [[Cabinet (file format)|cabinet]] files like ordinary folders.\n*'''CDAutoPlay''' made[[AutoRun|AutoPlay]] work on any non-[[CD|audio CD]].\n*'''Command Prompt Here''' allowed the user to start a command prompt from any folder in [[Windows Explorer]] by right-clicking (native in [[Windows Vista]] onwards).\n*'''Contents Menu''' allowed [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] users to access folders and files from a [[context menu]] without having to open their folders.\n*'''Desktop Menu''' allowed users to open items on the desktop from a menu on the [[Taskbar]].\n*'''Explore From Here''' enabled users to open [[File Explorer|Windows Explorer]] view from any folder such so that the folder acts as the root level folder.\n*'''FindX''' added drag-and-drop capabilities to Find (later called Search) menu.\n*'''FlexiCD''' allowed users to play an [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|audio CD]] from the Taskbar.\n*'''Quick Res''' allowed users to quickly change the [[screen resolution]].\n*'''Round Clock''' added an analog round clock without a square window.\n*'''Send To X''' consisted of Shell extensions which added several commonly accessed locations such as [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]], [[Desktop environment|desktop]], [[command-line]] or any folder to the ''Send To'' context menu in [[File Explorer|Explorer]].\n*'''Shortcut Target Menu''' allowed users to access the target file a [[Computer shortcut|shortcut]] is pointing to from the context menu or directly cut, copy, delete the target, create [[Shortcut (computing)|shortcut]] to the target or view its properties.\n*'''Telephony Location Selector''' allowed [[mobile computer]] users to change their dialling location from the [[Taskbar]].\n*[[Tweak UI|'''TweakUI''']] a system utility for tweaking the more obscure settings in Windows\n*'''Xmouse 1.2''' made the [[Focus (computing)|window focus]] follow the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] without requiring to click the [[Window (computing)|window]] to make it active.\n\nPowerToys for [[Windows 95]] were developed by the [[Windows Shell]] Development Team. Some of the tools work on later versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] up to [[Windows XP]], but others may interfere with newer built-in features on [[Windows 98]], [[Windows Me|ME]], and [[Windows XP|XP]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url        = http://aumha.org/a/powertoy.php\n|title      = Windows PowerToys FAQ for Windows 95, 98, ME, 2000 & XP\n|publisher  = Windows Support Center: James A.

The tools in this set were available as separate downloads rather than in a single package.\n\n=== Included components ===\n{{As of|November 2009}}, the following PowerToys for [[Windows XP]] were available:<ref name=\"powertoysXP\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx|title = PowerToys for Windows XP|publisher = Microsoft Corporation|date = 25 September 2008|accessdate = 2 January 2016|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110201050734/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/Downloads/powertoys/Xppowertoys.mspx|url-status = dead|archivedate = 1 February 2011}}</ref>\n*'''Alt-Tab Replacement Task Switcher''' replaced the simpler Alt-Tab switcher with a more visual one which shows live window previews.\n*'''CD Slide Show Generator''' generated a [[slideshow]] from photos burned to a [[CD]].\n*'''ClearType Tuner''' allowed customizing [[ClearType]] settings to make it easier to read text on the screen.\n*'''Color Control Panel Applet''' allowed managing [[color profile]]s, changing color profile associations for devices, viewing detailed properties for color profiles (including a 3D rendering of the [[color space]] [[gamut]]).\n*'''HTML Slide Show Wizard''' generated an [[HTML]] slideshow presentation.\n*'''Image Resizer''' allowed right-clicking on multiple image files inside [[Windows Explorer]] to batch resize them.\n*'''Open Command Window Here''' allowed starting a command prompt from any folder in [[Windows Explorer]] by right-clicking.\n*[[Image:Powercalc.PNG|thumb|PowerToys Power Calculator|alt=]]{{Anchor|Power Calculator}}'''Power Calculator''' was a more advanced graphical calculator application than the [[Calculator (Windows)|built-in Windows Calculator]]; it could evaluate more complex expressions, draw a Cartesian or polar [[graph of a function]] or convert units of measurements. Power Calculator could store and reuse pre-defined functions, of any [[arity]]. For example, a function could be set by <code>cube(x) = x * x * x</code>, and later it could be used in an expression like <code>5 + cube(4)</code>.<ref>[http://malektips.com/xp_calculator_0008.html MalekTips - Download a Free Graphing Calculator]</ref> It did not evaluate every time an operator was entered. Rather, the entire expression must be entered for calculation. In the ''Numeric'' mode, it presented a visual keypad, in all other modes the expression had to be typed in. A scrolling text area maintained a history of all calculations. The advanced view allowed declaring and graphing functions, along with a list of all the saved functions. A flyout window provided the option of choosing either a Cartesian co-ordinate system or polar co-ordinates. It could also save a list of variables for use in expression. Unit conversions of the following types were supported: length, mass, time, velocity, and temperature. PowerToy Calc had support for typing calculations using [[Reverse Polish Notation]] (RPN). It could calculate up to 500 precision levels beyond the decimal point and supported [[complex number]]s.<ref>[http://dan.hersam.com/2010/11/10/powercalc-in-windows-7/ PowerCalc in Windows 7]</ref>\n*'''RAW Image Thumbnailer and Viewer''' provided thumbnails, previews, printing, and [[metadata]] display for [[Raw image format|RAW images]] from within [[Windows Explorer]].\n*'''[[SyncToy]]''' allowed synchronizing files and folders.\n*'''Taskbar Magnifier''' magnified part of the screen from the taskbar.\n*'''[[Tweak UI]]''' customized [[Windows XP]]'s user interface and advanced settings.\n*'''Virtual Desktop Manager''' allowed switching between four [[virtual desktop]]s from the taskbar.\n*'''Webcam Timershot''' took pictures at specified time intervals from a [[webcam]].\n\n===Discontinued components===\nThe following PowerToys for Windows XP were discontinued:<ref name=\"powertoysXP\" />\n*'''Background Switcher''' added a slideshow tab to ''Display properties'' and allows automatically changing the [[Computer Wallpaper|desktop wallpaper]] periodically.
