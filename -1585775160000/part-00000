A member of the group since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with the band and one solo record. As a guitarist, the Edge has crafted a minimalistic and [[texture (music)|textural]] style of playing.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} His use of a rhythmic [[delay (audio effect)|delay]] effect yields a distinctive sound that has become a signature of U2's music.\n\nThe Edge was born in England to a Welsh family, and was raised in Ireland after the Evans family moved there. In 1976, at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] he formed a band with his fellow students and elder brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] that would evolve into U2. Inspired by the ethos of [[punk rock]] and its basic arrangements, the group began to write its own material. They eventually became one of the most successful acts in [[popular music]], with albums such as 1987's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and 1991's ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Over the years, the Edge has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style, including [[American roots music]], [[industrial music]], and [[alternative rock]]. With U2, the Edge has also played keyboards, co-produced their 1993 record ''[[Zooropa]]'', and occasionally served as co-lyricist. The Edge met his second wife [[Morleigh Steinberg]] through her collaborations with the band.\n\nAs a member of U2 and as an individual, the Edge has campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes. He co-founded [[Music Rising]], a charity to support musicians affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate [[Bono]] on several projects, including songs for [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Tina Turner]], and the soundtracks to the musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s London stage adaptation of ''[[A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music|A Clockwork Orange]]''. As a member of U2, the Edge has won 22 [[Grammy Award]]s and has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Several music publications have ranked the Edge among the greatest guitarists of all time.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Howell Evans was born at the [[Barking, London|Barking]] Maternity Hospital,<ref>Dunphy (1988), p. 70</ref> in the county of [[Essex]] in [[England]], on 8 August 1961. He is the second child of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] parents Garvin and Gwenda Evans,<ref name=\"m21\" /> both of whom originated from [[Llanelli]], a coastal town in [[South Wales]]. Garvin was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board, and subsequently worked for the electronics company [[Plessey]].<ref name=\"m21\" />  The Edge has an elder brother [[Dik Evans|Richard]] (often called Dik) and a younger sister called Gillian.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nThe Evanses initially lived in [[Chadwell Heath]], Essex. Around 1962, Garvin was offered a promotion and a transfer at his job, and the family subsequently moved to [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for him to take it.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nDuring his childhood in Dublin he possessed two differing [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s to converse in, [[Welsh English|Welsh]] and [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]], the former being used when he was in the family home and the latter when he was outside; as he later explained: \"The reason for this dual identity was mainly to be understood by my peers but also to be accepted.\"<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nHe received his initial formal education at St. Andrew's National School, in Malahide. As a child, he also received piano and guitar lessons, and practised music with his brother Richard.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\n==U2==\n{{Main|U2}}\n[[File:The Edge in Belfast, Nov 19 2015.jpg|thumb|The Edge performing at a [[U2]] concert in Belfast in 2015]]\nWhilst the Evans brothers were at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] in Dublin in 1976, they went along to a meeting in response to an advert posted by another pupil, [[Larry Mullen Jr.]], on the school's noticeboard seeking musicians to form a new band with him. Among the several other pupils who also responded to the note were [[Paul Hewson]] and [[Adam Clayton]].<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 27\u201330</ref> The band went through a number of reformations before becoming known as [[U2]] in March 1978 (Richard Evans having left before this to join another band, leaving his younger brother as the lead guitarist).<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\nEarly in the band's career, Evans was given the nickname \"The Edge\" by members of the Lypton Village surrealist street gang to which Bono belonged. The nickname is commonly believed to be derived from the angular shape of Evans' head.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 68</ref><ref>McGee (2008), p. 9</ref> However, the origin of the name is disputed and other theories include a description of his guitar playing and his preference for not becoming fully involved and therefore remaining on the edge of things.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.threechordsandthetruth.net/u2bios/u2edgebio.php|title=Biography of U2's guitarist, The Edge|website=www.threechordsandthetruth.net|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref>\n\nU2 began its public performance life in small venues in Dublin in 1977, occasionally playing at other venues elsewhere in Ireland. In December 1979 they performed their first concerts outside Ireland, in [[London]], and in 1980 began extensive touring across the [[British Isles]], developing a following. Their debut album ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'' was released in 1980.\n\nIn 1981, leading up to the [[October Tour]], Evans came very close to leaving U2 for religious reasons, but he decided to stay.<ref name=\"m117\">McCormick (2006), pp. 117\u2013120</ref> During this period he became involved with a group called Shalom Tigers, in which bandmates [[Bono]] and Larry Mullen Jr. were also involved.<ref name=\"edge-bio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.atu2.com/band/edge/ |title=The Edge biography (@U2) |accessdate=9 September 2007}}</ref> Shortly after deciding to remain with the band, he wrote a piece of music that later became \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\".<ref name=\"m117\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nEvans married his secondary school girlfriend Aislinn O'Sullivan on 12 July 1983.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 144</ref> They have three daughters: Hollie (born in 1984), Arran (in 1985) and 'Blue Angel' (in 1989).<ref name=\"edge-bio\" /> The couple separated in 1990, but were unable to get legally divorced because of Irish laws regarding marriage [[annulment]] at the time; divorce was [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|legalised in 1995]], and the couple legally divided in 1996.<ref name=\"edge-bio\" /> Evans is a [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=7 May 2016|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/u2s-the-edge-being-protestant-in-an-ostensibly-catholic-country-it-felt-strange-34692060.html|title=U2's The Edge: 'Being Protestant in an ostensibly Catholic country... it felt strange'|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he began dating [[Morleigh Steinberg]], an American professional dancer and choreographer whom he had met whilst she was employed as a dancer during the band's [[Zoo TV Tour]]. They have a daughter, Sian (born 1997), and a son, Levi (born 25 October 1999). The couple were married in 2002.<ref name=\"edge-bio\" />\n\nEvans has been criticised for his efforts to build five luxury mansions on a 156-acre (63.13-hectare) plot of land in [[Malibu, California]].<ref name=\"u2-plans\">{{Cite news |date=18 June 2011\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/u2-stars-plans-push-malibu-over-the-edge-2299306.html |title=U2 star's plans push Malibu over the edge |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> The [[California Coastal Commission]] voted 8\u20134 against the plans.

They have power. I think of notes as being expensive. You don't just throw them around. I find the ones that do the best job and that's what I use. I suppose I'm a minimalist instinctively. I don't like to be inefficient if I can get away with it. Like on the end of '[[With or Without You]]'. My instinct was to go with something very simple. Everyone else said, \"Nah, you can't do that.\" I won the argument and I still think it's sort of brave, because the end of 'With or Without You' could have been so much bigger, so much more of a climax, but there's this power to it which I think is even more potent because it's held back... ultimately I'm interested in music. I'm a musician. I'm not a gunslinger. That's the difference between what I do and what a lot of ''guitar heroes'' do.\"\n | source = \u2014The Edge in 1991<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 43</ref>\n | width  = 27%\n | align  = right\n | style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\n=== Guitar playing ===\nAs a guitar player, The Edge has a sound typified by a low-key playing style, a chiming, shimmering sound (thanks in part to the sound of [[Vox AC30]]s) that he achieves with extensive use of [[Delay (audio effect)|delay effects]] and [[reverberation|reverb]]. The repeat delay is often set to a [[Dotted note|dotted]] eighth note, and the feedback gain is adjusted until a note played repeats two or three times.<ref name=\"edge delay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/|title=Edge Delay|publisher=Amnesta.net|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', The Edge often contributes just a few simple lead lines given depth and richness by an ever-present delay. For example, the introduction to \"[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]\" is simply a repeated six-note [[arpeggio]], broadened by a modulated delay effect. The Edge has said that he views musical notes as \"expensive\", in that he prefers to play as few notes as possible. He said in 1982 of his style,\n\n{{quote|I like a nice ringing sound on guitar, and most of my chords I find two strings and make them ring the same note, so it's almost like a 12-string sound. So for E I might play a B, E, E and B and make it ring. It works very well with the [[Gibson Explorer]]. It's funny because the bass end of the Explorer was so awful that I used to stay away from the low strings, and a lot of the chords I played were very trebly, on the first four, or even three strings. I discovered that through using this one area of the fretboard I was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way.<ref name=success />}}\n\nHis first guitar was an old acoustic guitar that his mother bought him at a local flea market for a few pounds; he was nine at the time. He and his brother [[Dik Evans]] both experimented with this instrument.<ref name=success>{{cite web |url=http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id16.html |title=On the Edge of Success |publisher=U2 Magazine |number=3 |date=1 May 1982 |accessdate=6 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724224912/http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id16.html |archivedate=24 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He said in 1982 of this early experimentation, \"I suppose the first link in the chain was a visit to the local [[jumble sale]] where I purchased a guitar for a [[pound sterling|pound]]. That was my first instrument. It was an acoustic guitar and me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that.\"<ref name=success /> The Edge has stated that many of his guitar parts are based around guitar effects. This is especially true from the ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' era onwards, although much of the band's 1980s material made heavy use of echos.\n\n=== Vocals ===\n[[File:The Edge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Edge in June 2005]]\nThe Edge also supplies the backing vocals for U2. U2's 1983 live album and video release, ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' and ''[[Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' are good reference points for his singing (as are the live DVDs from the Elevation Tour, ''[[U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle]]'' and ''[[Elevation 2001: Live from Boston]]''). For example, he sings the chorus to \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\" (Bono harmonises on the final 'Sunday'). U2 used this tradeoff technique later in \"[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]\" as well. His backing vocals are sometimes in the form of a repeated cry; examples of songs that use this approach include \"[[Beautiful Day (song)|Beautiful Day]]\", \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\" and \"[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]\". Another technique he uses in his backing vocals is the falsetto, in songs such as \"[[Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of]]\", \"[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]\", \"A Man and a Woman\", \"The Wanderer\", live versions of \"[[The Fly (song)|The Fly]]\", and \"[[Window in the Skies]]\".\n\nThe Edge sings the lead vocal on \"[[Van Diemen's Land (song)|Van Diemen's Land]]\" and \"[[Numb (U2 song)|Numb]]\", the first half of the song \"Seconds\", dual vocals with Bono in \"Discotheque\", and the bridge in the song \"[[Miracle Drug]]\".<ref name=\"edge-bio\"/> He also sings the occasional lead vocal in live renditions of other songs (such as \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" during the [[PopMart Tour]] and \"Party Girl\" during the Rotterdam Zoo TV show when it was Bono's birthday),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2-vertigo-tour.com/show355.html |title=U2 Rotterdam, 10 May 1993 at Feyenoord Stadion, ZOO TV Tour \u2013 U1}}</ref> and has sung the second verse of the \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\" cover on a few shows. A solo acoustic version of the song \"[[Love is Blindness]]\", that is featured in the documentary film ''[[From the Sky Down]]'', is sung by him as well.\n\n=== Other instruments ===\nHe has played keyboards on many of the band's songs, including \"I Fall Down\", \"[[October (song)|October]]\", \"[[So Cruel]]\", \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\", \"[[Running to Stand Still]]\", \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", \"The Hands that Built America\", and \"[[Original of the Species]]\" and others. In live versions of \"New Year's Day\", \"[[The Unforgettable Fire (song)|The Unforgettable Fire]]\", \"[[Your Blue Room]]\", \"[[Moment of Surrender]]\" and \"Raised By Wolves\", he plays both the piano and guitar parts alternately. In most live versions of \"Original of the Species,\" piano is the only instrument played during the song. Although The Edge is the band's lead guitarist, he occasionally plays bass guitar, including the live performances of the song [[40 (song)|\"40\"]] where The Edge and bassist [[Adam Clayton]] switch instruments.\n\n==Other musical pursuits==\n[[File:The Edge 360 Tour Foxboro 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|The Edge performing in 2009]]\nIn addition to his regular role within U2, The Edge has also recorded with such artists as [[Johnny Cash]], [[B. B. King]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Jah Wobble]], [[Holger Czukay]], [[Jay-Z]], and [[Rihanna]]. The Edge connected with [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] collaborator [[Michael Brook]] (the creator of the [[infinite guitar]], which he regularly uses), working with him on the [[Captive (soundtrack)|score to the film ''Captive'']] (1986). From this soundtrack the song \"Heroine\", the vocal of which was sung by a young [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] was released as a single.\n\nHe also created the theme song for season one and two of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. He and fellow U2 member Bono wrote the theme of the 1995 [[James Bond]] film ''[[GoldenEye]]''. The Edge, along with Bono, composed a [[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark|musical adaptation]] of [[Spider-Man]]. On 25 May 2011, a single titled \"[[Rise Above 1]]\" by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and The Edge was released digitally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/rise-above-1-20110526|title=Rise Above 1 by Reeve Carney feat.

The film examines the history of the electric guitar, focusing on the careers and styles of the Edge, [[Jimmy Page]], and [[Jack White]]. The film premiered on 5 September 2008 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Edge performed in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as part of a conference for the Angiogenesis Foundation, making him the first rock artist to stage a concert at the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/the-edge-becomes-first-rock-star-to-play-the-sistine-chapel-a7011056.html|title=The Edge becomes first rock star to play the Sistine Chapel|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Jess|last=Denham|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[Image:EdgeAC30.jpg|thumb|Edge's 1964 [[Vox AC30]] on stage in [[Foxborough]] for the [[U2 360\u00b0 Tour]].]]\nThe Edge plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards, piano, bass guitar (on \"40\" and \"Race Against Time\") and [[lap steel guitar]].

Key to his signature sound are the use of modulated delays, namely a Korg SDD-3000 delay unit made in the early 80's, as well as a special Herdim guitar pick, which Edge holds upside down to expose the \"dimples\" when hitting the guitar strings to achieve a raspier chime.<ref>http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/herdim.html</ref> For his main amplification, The Edge uses a vintage Vox AC30 particularly a 1964 JMI-era \"Top Boost\" model chassis fitted into an early 70's cabinet.<ref name=\"musicradar.com\"/>  In 2016, [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] unveiled a signature guitar model, The Edge Signature Stratocaster, which The Edge has been using on the most recent tours to replace his vintage 70's Stratocasters.<ref>http://www.guitarworld.com/gear/edge-discusses-his-new-signature-fender-strat</ref> Around the same time Fender also unveiled a signature amp, the Fender Edge Deluxe.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:The Edge with Steve Censky and Dr William W Li at USDA HQ 6-19-2018.jpeg|thumb|The Edge with [[United States Deputy Secretary of Agriculture|US Deputy Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Stephen Censky]] and Angiogenesis Foundation co-founder Dr. William W.

The instruments were originally only replaced for professional musicians but they soon realised the community churches and schools needed instruments as well. The charity's slogan is \"Rebuilding the Gulf Region note by note\" and has so far helped over a hundred musicians who were affected by Hurricane Katrina.

Irish musician and songwriter best known as the lead guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist of the [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. A member of the group since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with the band as well as one solo record. As a guitarist, the Edge has crafted a minimalistic and [[texture (music)|textural]] style of playing.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} His use of a rhythmic [[delay (audio effect)|delay]] effect yields a distinctive sound that has become a signature of U2's music.\n\nThe Edge was born in England to a Welsh family, and was raised in Ireland after the Evans family moved there. In 1976, at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] he formed a band with his fellow students and elder brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] that would evolve into U2. Inspired by the ethos of [[punk rock]] and its basic arrangements, the group began to write its own material. They eventually became one of the most successful acts in [[popular music]], with albums such as 1987's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and 1991's ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Over the years, the Edge has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style, including [[American roots music]], [[industrial music]], and [[alternative rock]]. With U2, the Edge has also played keyboards, co-produced their 1993 record ''[[Zooropa]]'', and occasionally served as co-lyricist. The Edge met his second wife [[Morleigh Steinberg]] through her collaborations with the band.\n\nAs a member of U2 and as an individual, the Edge has campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes. He co-founded [[Music Rising]], a charity to support musicians affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate [[Bono]] on several projects, including songs for [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Tina Turner]], and the soundtracks to the musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s London stage adaptation of ''[[A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music|A Clockwork Orange]]''. As a member of U2, the Edge has won 22 [[Grammy Award]]s and has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Several music publications have ranked the Edge among the greatest guitarists of all time.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Howell Evans was born at the [[Barking, London|Barking]] Maternity Hospital,<ref>Dunphy (1988), p. 70</ref> in the county of [[Essex]] in [[England]], on 8 August 1961. He is the second child of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] parents Garvin and Gwenda Evans,<ref name=\"m21\" /> both of whom originated from [[Llanelli]], a coastal town in [[South Wales]]. Garvin was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board, and subsequently worked for the electronics company [[Plessey]].<ref name=\"m21\" />  The Edge has an elder brother [[Dik Evans|Richard]] (often called Dik) and a younger sister called Gillian.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nThe Evanses initially lived in [[Chadwell Heath]], Essex. Around 1962, Garvin was offered a promotion and a transfer at his job, and the family subsequently moved to [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for him to take it.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nDuring his childhood in Dublin he possessed two differing [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s to converse in, [[Welsh English|Welsh]] and [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]], the former being used when he was in the family home and the latter when he was outside; as he later explained: \"The reason for this dual identity was mainly to be understood by my peers but also to be accepted.\"<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nHe received his initial formal education at St. Andrew's National School, in Malahide. As a child, he also received piano and guitar lessons, and practised music with his brother Richard.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\n==U2==\n{{Main|U2}}\n[[File:The Edge in Belfast, Nov 19 2015.jpg|thumb|The Edge performing at a [[U2]] concert in Belfast in 2015]]\nWhilst the Evans brothers were at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] in Dublin in 1976, they went along to a meeting in response to an advert posted by another pupil, [[Larry Mullen Jr.]], on the school's noticeboard seeking musicians to form a new band with him. Among the several other pupils who also responded to the note were [[Paul Hewson]] and [[Adam Clayton]].<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 27\u201330</ref> The band went through a number of reformations before becoming known as [[U2]] in March 1978 (Richard Evans having left before this to join another band, leaving his younger brother as the lead guitarist).<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\nEarly in the band's career, Evans was given the nickname \"The Edge\" by members of the Lypton Village surrealist street gang to which Bono belonged. The nickname is commonly believed to be derived from the angular shape of Evans' head.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 68</ref><ref>McGee (2008), p. 9</ref> However, the origin of the name is disputed and other theories include a description of his guitar playing and his preference for not becoming fully involved and therefore remaining on the edge of things.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.threechordsandthetruth.net/u2bios/u2edgebio.php|title=Biography of U2's guitarist, The Edge|website=www.threechordsandthetruth.net|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref>\n\nU2 began its public performance life in small venues in Dublin in 1977, occasionally playing at other venues elsewhere in Ireland. In December 1979 they performed their first concerts outside Ireland, in [[London]], and in 1980 began extensive touring across the [[British Isles]], developing a following. Their debut album ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'' was released in 1980.\n\nIn 1981, leading up to the [[October Tour]], Evans came very close to leaving U2 for religious reasons, but he decided to stay.<ref name=\"m117\">McCormick (2006), pp. 117\u2013120</ref> During this period he became involved with a group called Shalom Tigers, in which bandmates [[Bono]] and Larry Mullen Jr. were also involved.<ref name=\"edge-bio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.atu2.com/band/edge/ |title=The Edge biography (@U2) |accessdate=9 September 2007}}</ref> Shortly after deciding to remain with the band, he wrote a piece of music that later became \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\".<ref name=\"m117\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nEvans married his secondary school girlfriend Aislinn O'Sullivan on 12 July 1983.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 144</ref> They have three daughters: Hollie (born in 1984), Arran (in 1985) and 'Blue Angel' (in 1989).<ref name=\"edge-bio\" /> The couple separated in 1990, but were unable to get legally divorced because of Irish laws regarding marriage [[annulment]] at the time; divorce was [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|legalised in 1995]], and the couple legally divided in 1996.<ref name=\"edge-bio\" /> Evans is a [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=7 May 2016|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/u2s-the-edge-being-protestant-in-an-ostensibly-catholic-country-it-felt-strange-34692060.html|title=U2's The Edge: 'Being Protestant in an ostensibly Catholic country... it felt strange'|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he began dating [[Morleigh Steinberg]], an American professional dancer and choreographer whom he had met whilst she was employed as a dancer during the band's [[Zoo TV Tour]]. They have a daughter, Sian (born 1997), and a son, Levi (born 25 October 1999). The couple were married in 2002.<ref name=\"edge-bio\" />\n\nEvans has been criticised for his efforts to build five luxury mansions on a 156-acre (63.13-hectare) plot of land in [[Malibu, California]].<ref name=\"u2-plans\">{{Cite news |date=18 June 2011\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/u2-stars-plans-push-malibu-over-the-edge-2299306.html |title=U2 star's plans push Malibu over the edge |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> The [[California Coastal Commission]] voted 8\u20134 against the plans.

They have power. I think of notes as being expensive. You don't just throw them around. I find the ones that do the best job and that's what I use. I suppose I'm a minimalist instinctively. I don't like to be inefficient if I can get away with it. Like on the end of '[[With or Without You]]'. My instinct was to go with something very simple. Everyone else said, \"Nah, you can't do that.\" I won the argument and I still think it's sort of brave, because the end of 'With or Without You' could have been so much bigger, so much more of a climax, but there's this power to it which I think is even more potent because it's held back... ultimately I'm interested in music. I'm a musician. I'm not a gunslinger. That's the difference between what I do and what a lot of ''guitar heroes'' do.\"\n | source = \u2014The Edge in 1991<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 43</ref>\n | width  = 27%\n | align  = right\n | style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\n=== Guitar playing ===\nAs a guitar player, The Edge has a sound typified by a low-key playing style, a chiming, shimmering sound (thanks in part to the sound of [[Vox AC30]]s) that he achieves with extensive use of [[Delay (audio effect)|delay effects]] and [[reverberation|reverb]]. The repeat delay is often set to a [[Dotted note|dotted]] eighth note, and the feedback gain is adjusted until a note played repeats two or three times.<ref name=\"edge delay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/|title=Edge Delay|publisher=Amnesta.net|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', The Edge often contributes just a few simple lead lines given depth and richness by an ever-present delay. For example, the introduction to \"[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]\" is simply a repeated six-note [[arpeggio]], broadened by a modulated delay effect. The Edge has said that he views musical notes as \"expensive\", in that he prefers to play as few notes as possible. He said in 1982 of his style,\n\n{{quote|I like a nice ringing sound on guitar, and most of my chords I find two strings and make them ring the same note, so it's almost like a 12-string sound. So for E I might play a B, E, E and B and make it ring. It works very well with the [[Gibson Explorer]]. It's funny because the bass end of the Explorer was so awful that I used to stay away from the low strings, and a lot of the chords I played were very trebly, on the first four, or even three strings. I discovered that through using this one area of the fretboard I was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way.<ref name=success />}}\n\nHis first guitar was an old acoustic guitar that his mother bought him at a local flea market for a few pounds; he was nine at the time. He and his brother [[Dik Evans]] both experimented with this instrument.<ref name=success>{{cite web |url=http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id16.html |title=On the Edge of Success |publisher=U2 Magazine |number=3 |date=1 May 1982 |accessdate=6 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724224912/http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id16.html |archivedate=24 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He said in 1982 of this early experimentation, \"I suppose the first link in the chain was a visit to the local [[jumble sale]] where I purchased a guitar for a [[pound sterling|pound]]. That was my first instrument. It was an acoustic guitar and me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that.\"<ref name=success /> The Edge has stated that many of his guitar parts are based around guitar effects. This is especially true from the ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' era onwards, although much of the band's 1980s material made heavy use of echos.\n\n=== Vocals ===\n[[File:The Edge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Edge in June 2005]]\nThe Edge also supplies the backing vocals for U2. U2's 1983 live album and video release, ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' and ''[[Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' are good reference points for his singing (as are the live DVDs from the Elevation Tour, ''[[U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle]]'' and ''[[Elevation 2001: Live from Boston]]''). For example, he sings the chorus to \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\" (Bono harmonises on the final 'Sunday'). U2 used this tradeoff technique later in \"[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]\" as well. His backing vocals are sometimes in the form of a repeated cry; examples of songs that use this approach include \"[[Beautiful Day (song)|Beautiful Day]]\", \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\" and \"[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]\". Another technique he uses in his backing vocals is the falsetto, in songs such as \"[[Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of]]\", \"[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]\", \"A Man and a Woman\", \"The Wanderer\", live versions of \"[[The Fly (song)|The Fly]]\", and \"[[Window in the Skies]]\".\n\nThe Edge sings the lead vocal on \"[[Van Diemen's Land (song)|Van Diemen's Land]]\" and \"[[Numb (U2 song)|Numb]]\", the first half of the song \"Seconds\", dual vocals with Bono in \"Discotheque\", and the bridge in the song \"[[Miracle Drug]]\".<ref name=\"edge-bio\"/> He also sings the occasional lead vocal in live renditions of other songs (such as \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" during the [[PopMart Tour]] and \"Party Girl\" during the Rotterdam Zoo TV show when it was Bono's birthday),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2-vertigo-tour.com/show355.html |title=U2 Rotterdam, 10 May 1993 at Feyenoord Stadion, ZOO TV Tour \u2013 U1}}</ref> and has sung the second verse of the \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\" cover on a few shows. A solo acoustic version of the song \"[[Love is Blindness]]\", that is featured in the documentary film ''[[From the Sky Down]]'', is sung by him as well.\n\n=== Other instruments ===\nHe has played keyboards on many of the band's songs, including \"I Fall Down\", \"[[October (song)|October]]\", \"[[So Cruel]]\", \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\", \"[[Running to Stand Still]]\", \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", \"The Hands that Built America\", and \"[[Original of the Species]]\" and others. In live versions of \"New Year's Day\", \"[[The Unforgettable Fire (song)|The Unforgettable Fire]]\", \"[[Your Blue Room]]\", \"[[Moment of Surrender]]\" and \"Raised By Wolves\", he plays both the piano and guitar parts alternately. In most live versions of \"Original of the Species,\" piano is the only instrument played during the song. Although The Edge is the band's lead guitarist, he occasionally plays bass guitar, including the live performances of the song [[40 (song)|\"40\"]] where The Edge and bassist [[Adam Clayton]] switch instruments.\n\n==Other musical pursuits==\n[[File:The Edge 360 Tour Foxboro 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|The Edge performing in 2009]]\nIn addition to his regular role within U2, The Edge has also recorded with such artists as [[Johnny Cash]], [[B. B. King]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Jah Wobble]], [[Holger Czukay]], [[Jay-Z]], and [[Rihanna]]. The Edge connected with [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] collaborator [[Michael Brook]] (the creator of the [[infinite guitar]], which he regularly uses), working with him on the [[Captive (soundtrack)|score to the film ''Captive'']] (1986). From this soundtrack the song \"Heroine\", the vocal of which was sung by a young [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] was released as a single.\n\nHe also created the theme song for season one and two of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. He and fellow U2 member Bono wrote the theme of the 1995 [[James Bond]] film ''[[GoldenEye]]''. The Edge, along with Bono, composed a [[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark|musical adaptation]] of [[Spider-Man]]. On 25 May 2011, a single titled \"[[Rise Above 1]]\" by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and The Edge was released digitally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/rise-above-1-20110526|title=Rise Above 1 by Reeve Carney feat.

The film examines the history of the electric guitar, focusing on the careers and styles of the Edge, [[Jimmy Page]], and [[Jack White]]. The film premiered on 5 September 2008 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Edge performed in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as part of a conference for the Angiogenesis Foundation, making him the first rock artist to stage a concert at the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/the-edge-becomes-first-rock-star-to-play-the-sistine-chapel-a7011056.html|title=The Edge becomes first rock star to play the Sistine Chapel|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Jess|last=Denham|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[Image:EdgeAC30.jpg|thumb|Edge's 1964 [[Vox AC30]] on stage in [[Foxborough]] for the [[U2 360\u00b0 Tour]].]]\nThe Edge plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards, piano, bass guitar (on \"40\" and \"Race Against Time\") and [[lap steel guitar]].

Key to his signature sound are the use of modulated delays, namely a Korg SDD-3000 delay unit made in the early 80's, as well as a special Herdim guitar pick, which Edge holds upside down to expose the \"dimples\" when hitting the guitar strings to achieve a raspier chime.<ref>http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/herdim.html</ref> For his main amplification, The Edge uses a vintage Vox AC30 particularly a 1964 JMI-era \"Top Boost\" model chassis fitted into an early 70's cabinet.<ref name=\"musicradar.com\"/>  In 2016, [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] unveiled a signature guitar model, The Edge Signature Stratocaster, which The Edge has been using on the most recent tours to replace his vintage 70's Stratocasters.<ref>http://www.guitarworld.com/gear/edge-discusses-his-new-signature-fender-strat</ref> Around the same time Fender also unveiled a signature amp, the Fender Edge Deluxe.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:The Edge with Steve Censky and Dr William W Li at USDA HQ 6-19-2018.jpeg|thumb|The Edge with [[United States Deputy Secretary of Agriculture|US Deputy Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Stephen Censky]] and Angiogenesis Foundation co-founder Dr. William W.

The instruments were originally only replaced for professional musicians but they soon realised the community churches and schools needed instruments as well. The charity's slogan is \"Rebuilding the Gulf Region note by note\" and has so far helped over a hundred musicians who were affected by Hurricane Katrina.

In 1919, Sion formally organised its managerial structure, with Gilliard becoming vice-president and Charles Aymon taking the presidency.<ref name=Officialwebsite />\n\nFrom 1932, Sion played in the fourth tier of Swiss football, where they spent much of the next 20 years, briefly interrupted by promotion to the third tier in 1944, quickly followed by relegation in 1946. In 1952, Sion returned to the third tier. Five years later, Sion gained promotion again to the [[Swiss Challenge League|National League B]], followed five years later by promotion to the [[Swiss Super League|National League A]] (now the Swiss Super League) in 1962.<ref name=Officialwebsite /> 1965 saw the first of Sion's [[Swiss Cup]] wins following a 2\u20131 victory over [[Servette FC|Servette]].\n\nThe 16,263 capacity [[Stade Tourbillon]] was officially opened in August 1968, but the club was relegated in 1969. Sion returned to the National League A at the first attempt and secured a second victory in the Swiss Cup, winning 3\u20132 against [[Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax]] in 1974. Sion would go on to consistently perform well in the Swiss Cup, with victories in 1980 (against [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]), 1982 (against [[FC Basel|Basel]]), 1986 (against Servette) and 1991 (against Young Boys).<ref name=Officialwebsite /> This period of success also saw the renovation and expansion of the Tourbillon in 1989, and was crowned with Sion's first Swiss League Championship in [[1991\u201392 Nationalliga A|1992]].\n\nMore success in the Swiss Cup followed, winning the tournament in three consecutive years from 1995 with victories over [[Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich|Grasshopper]], Servette and [[FC Luzern|Luzern]]. Their win against Luzern in 1997 secured Sion their only [[Double (association football)|domestic double]], having also won the [[1996\u201397 Nationalliga A|Swiss League]].<ref name=Officialwebsite />\n\nHowever, the club quickly fell into financial trouble, and having narrowly avoided bankruptcy due to its purchase by Gilbert Kadji, the club suffered relegation in 1999. Despite returning to the top division the following season, financial problems plagued the team, culminating in relegation in 2001, the departure of Kadji and a denial of a professional license in 2003. The club was saved by architect and former footballer [[Christian Constantin]], and they were re-instated into the second division in October 2003.\n\nConstantin spent the following seasons rebuilding the club, with the club going through 20 managers in the following eight years, including taking the role himself twice, in a bid to financially stabilize.<ref name=BBCSion>{{cite

The club was founded in 1909, and play their home matches at the [[Stade Tourbillon]]. They have won the [[Swiss Super League]] twice, and the [[Swiss Cup]] in 13 of their 14 appearances in the final, the most recent being in [[2014\u201315 Swiss Cup|2015]]. The first team of the club was also known as their incorporated name '''Olympique des Alpes SA'''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sion Performance Graph.png|320px|thumb|Chart of FC Sion table positions in the Swiss football league system]]\n\nFC Sion were founded in 1909 by Robert Gilliard, who became club captain, and played their first match the same year, a 3\u20132 win against FC Aigle.<ref name=Officialwebsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.fc-sion-live.ch/index.php?pageID=407d0e2e4baada7b96de4fb7f5af3a05 |title=FC Sion Official Club History (French)|accessdate=13 September 2011 |publisher=FC Sion}}</ref> The club grew thanks to contributions from locals, and played their first competitive league fixture in 1914, again a 3\u20132 victory, against FC Monthey. In 1919, Sion formally organised its managerial structure, with Gilliard becoming vice-president and Charles Aymon taking the presidency.<ref name=Officialwebsite />\n\nFrom 1932, Sion played in the fourth tier of Swiss football, where they spent much of the next 20 years, briefly interrupted by promotion to the third tier in 1944, quickly followed by relegation in 1946. In 1952, Sion returned to the third tier. Five years later, Sion gained promotion again to the [[Swiss Challenge League|National League B]], followed five years later by promotion to the [[Swiss Super League|National League A]] (now the Swiss Super League) in 1962.<ref name=Officialwebsite /> 1965 saw the first of Sion's [[Swiss Cup]] wins following a 2\u20131 victory over [[Servette FC|Servette]].\n\nThe 16,263 capacity [[Stade Tourbillon]] was officially opened in August 1968, but the club was relegated in 1969. Sion returned to the National League A at the first attempt and secured a second victory in the Swiss Cup, winning 3\u20132 against [[Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax]] in 1974. Sion would go on to consistently perform well in the Swiss Cup, with victories in 1980 (against [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]), 1982 (against [[FC Basel|Basel]]), 1986 (against Servette) and 1991 (against Young Boys).<ref name=Officialwebsite /> This period of success also saw the renovation and expansion of the Tourbillon in 1989, and was crowned with Sion's first Swiss League Championship in [[1991\u201392 Nationalliga A|1992]].\n\nMore success in the Swiss Cup followed, winning the tournament in three consecutive years from 1995 with victories over [[Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich|Grasshopper]], Servette and [[FC Luzern|Luzern]]. Their win against Luzern in 1997 secured Sion their only [[Double (association football)|domestic double]], having also won the [[1996\u201397 Nationalliga A|Swiss League]].<ref name=Officialwebsite />\n\nHowever, the club quickly fell into financial trouble, and having narrowly avoided bankruptcy due to its purchase by Gilbert Kadji, the club suffered relegation in 1999. Despite returning to the top division the following season, financial problems plagued the team, culminating in relegation in 2001, the departure of Kadji and a denial of a professional license in 2003. The club was saved by architect and former footballer [[Christian Constantin]], and they were re-instated into the second division in October 2003.\n\nConstantin spent the following seasons rebuilding the club, with the club going through 20 managers in the following eight years, including taking the role himself twice, in a bid to financially stabilize.<ref name=BBCSion>{{cite
