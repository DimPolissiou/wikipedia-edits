The main affected areas are [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]].\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all carnival events in the country were initially cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Movement outside the house is permitted only for specific reasons that include moving to or from the workplace, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help and exercising outside individually or in pairs, among other reasons. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as some type of attestation depending on the purpose of travel. The [[Hellenic Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Greece)|Municipal Police]], the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] and the National Transparency Authority are empowered to enforce the restrictions and can issue fines for each offense.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Greece medical cases chart}}\n\n=== February ===\n\n* On 26 February, the first case in Greece was confirmed.

Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Movement outside the house is permitted only for specific reasons that include moving to or from the workplace, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help and exercising outside individually or in pairs, among other reasons. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as some type of attestation depending on the purpose of travel.

The \"sculpture-like\" figure, the hormonal breath, also reflects his self-discipline and strict requirements on himself (reviewed by Xinhua News, New Express, and Peninsula Metropolis Daily). Li's eyes can speak, and his eyes can pass on the character's soul. His performance is delicate and layered. He can capture people's hearts by his face value, but he is a \u201cnaughter\u201d with strong acting skills. In the face of different situations, his performance instantly switches like a chameleon.

He has left everyone with the impression of sunshine, handsomeness and versatile healing department warm men (China Entertainment Network Review)   .\nLi belongs to the kind of simmering actor. From the forest team in Forensic Qin Ming to the Guo team in River God, Li Xian is just right on the tough and handsome role. Each of Li Xian's works has a good response. The characters he plays each time are also very characteristic and individual, and he also sees his unique vision. The \"sculpture-like\" figure, the hormonal breath, also reflects his self-discipline and strict requirements on himself (reviewed by Xinhua News, New Express, and Peninsula Metropolis Daily). Li's eyes can speak, and his eyes can pass on the character's soul. His performance is delicate and layered. He can capture people's hearts by his face value, but he is a \u201cnaughter\u201d with strong acting skills. In the face of different situations, his performance instantly switches like a chameleon. In front of the camera, it is either public or casual or erupts, showing natural aura (Review of The Peninsula Metropolis).\n\nLi has been labeled as \"July Boyfriend\" by netizen after his role as Han Sahangyan in Go Go Squid!

The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] by [[communist]] and [[socialist]] parties, under the leadership of [[centre-left]] President [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=43}}{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=84}} The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups, including [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups|CEDA]], monarchists, including both the opposing [[Alfonsism|Alfonsists]] and the religious conservative [[Carlism|Carlists]], and the [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|FE de las JONS]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] political party.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=200\u2013203}} After the deaths of Sanjurjo, [[Emilio Mola]] and [[Manuel Goded Llopis]], Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.\n\nThe coup was supported by military units in the [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], [[Pamplona]], [[Burgos]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Valladolid]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], and [[Seville]]. However, rebelling units in some important cities\u2014such as [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]], [[Bilbao]], and [[M\u00e1laga]]\u2014did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], while the Republican side received support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]]. Other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and the [[United States]], continued to recognise the Republican government, but followed an official policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]]. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican [[International Brigades]], which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.\n\nThe Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of [[Catalonia]] was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the recognition of the Francoist regime by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939, and internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in March 1939, Franco entered the capital and declared victory on 1 April 1939. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards fled to refugee camps in [[southern France]].<ref name=\"historytoday.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/refugees-and-spanish-civil-war |title = Refugees and the Spanish Civil War &#124; History Today}}</ref><ref name=\"historytoday.com\"/> Those associated with the losing Republicans who stayed were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists. Franco established a dictatorship in which all right-wing parties were fused into the structure of the Franco regime.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=200\u2013203}}\n\nThe war became notable for the passion and political division it inspired and for the many atrocities that occurred, on both sides.

Those in favour of reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms. Some liberals, in a tradition that started with the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], sought to limit the power of the [[monarchy of Spain]] and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 were overturned when [[King Ferdinand VII]] dissolved the Constitution and ended the [[Trienio Liberal]] government.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates called ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'' as well as all the important government positions.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=19}}\n\nIn 1868, popular uprisings led to the overthrow of [[Queen Isabella II]] of the [[House of Bourbon]]. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by [[Joan Prim|General Joan Prim]]) concerned with the ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873, Isabella's replacement, King [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]] of the [[House of Savoy]], abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;13.</ref><ref>Preston (2006). p.&nbsp;21.</ref> After the [[Restoration (Spain)|restoration of the Bourbons]] in December 1874,<ref>Preston (2006). p. 22.</ref> [[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] emerged in opposition to the monarchy.<ref>Preston (2006). p. 24.</ref><ref>Fraser (1979). pp.&nbsp;38\u201339.</ref> [[Alejandro Lerroux]], Spanish politician and leader of the [[Radical Republican Party]], helped bring [[republicanism]] to the fore in [[Catalonia]], where poverty was particularly acute.<ref>Preston (2006). pp.&nbsp;24\u201326.</ref> Growing resentment of [[conscription]] and of the military culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in [[Barcelona]] in 1909.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;15.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfonso XIIIdeEspa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|On 12 April 1931, the Republicans won the elections and the [[Spanish Second Republic]] was proclaimed two days later. King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] resigned and went into exile.]]\n[[Spain]] was neutral in [[World War I]]. Following the war, wide swathes of Spanish society, including the armed forces, united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful.<ref>Preston (2006). pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Popular perception of communism as a major threat significantly increased during this period.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=15}} In 1923, a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] brought [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] to power; as a result, Spain transitioned to government by military dictatorship.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Support for the Rivera regime gradually faded, and he resigned in January 1930. He was replaced by General [[D\u00e1maso Berenguer]], who was in turn himself replaced by [[Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as|Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as]]; both men continued a policy of rule by decree. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities. Consequently, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] gave in to popular pressure for the establishment of a republic in 1931 and called municipal elections for 12 April of that year. The socialist and liberal republicans won almost all the provincial capitals, and following the resignation of Aznar's government, King Alfonso XIII fled the country.<ref>Beevor (2006) pp.&nbsp;20\u201322.</ref> At this time, the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was formed. It remained in power until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=20}}\n\nThe revolutionary committee headed by [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] became the provisional government, with Alcal\u00e1-Zamora as [[President (government title)|president]] and [[head of state]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=23}} The republic had broad support from all segments of society.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=38\u201339}} In May, an incident where a taxi driver was attacked outside a monarchist club sparked anti-clerical violence throughout [[Madrid]] and south-west [[Spain]]. The government's slow response disillusioned the right and reinforced their view that the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] was determined to persecute the church. In June and July the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]], known as the CNT, called several [[Strike action|strikes]], which led to a violent incident between CNT members and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and a brutal crackdown by the Civil Guard and the [[Spanish Army|army]] against the CNT in [[Seville]]. This led many workers to believe the Spanish Second Republic was just as oppressive as the monarchy, and the CNT announced its intention of overthrowing it via [[revolution]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=26}} Elections in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and [[Socialism|Socialists]].<ref>Preston (2006). p. 50.</ref> With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the government tried to assist rural Spain by instituting an [[eight-hour day]] and redistributing [[land tenure]] to farm workers.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=42}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=22}} The rural workers lived in some of the worst poverty in Europe at the time and the government tried to increase their wages and improve working conditions. This estranged small and medium landholders who used hired labour. The Law of Municpal Boundaries forbade the hiring of workers from outside the locality of the owner's holdings. Since not all localities had enough labour for the tasks required, the law had unintended negative consequences, such as sometimes shutting out peasants and renters from the labour market when they needed extra income as pickers. Labour arbitration boards were set up to regulate salaries, contracts and working hours; they were more favourable to workers than employers and thus the latter became hostile to them. A decree in July 1931 increased overtime pay and several laws in late 1931 restricted whom landowners could hire. Other efforts included decrees limiting the use of machinery, efforts to create a monopoly on hiring, strikes and efforts by unions to limit women's employment to preserve a labour monopoly for their members. Class struggle intensified as landowners turned to counterrevolutionary organisations and local oligarchs. Strikes, workplace theft, arson, robbery and assaults on shops, strikebreakers, employers and machines became increasingly common. Ultimately, the reforms of the Republican-Socialist government alienated as many people as they pleased.<ref>Seidman, Michael. \"The Victorious Counterrevolution.\" The Nationalist Effort in the (2011), pp.16-17</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Main altarpiece of the Church del Salvador (Elche) before it was burned by Republicans.jpg\n| width1 = 120\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Church del Salvador (Elche) after it was burned by Republicans.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The Church was a frequent target of the revolutionary left in the Republic and in the War.

Spanish commentators spoke of chaos and preparation for revolution, foreign diplomats made plans in case of revolution and an interest in fascism developed among the threatened. Payne states that by July 1936:\n::\"The frequent overt violations of the law, assaults on property, and political violence in Spain were without precedent for a modern European country not undergoing total revolution. These included massive, sometimes violent and destructive strike waves, large-scale illegal seizures of farmland in the south, a wave of arson and destruction of property, arbitrary closure of Catholic schools, seizure of churches and Catholic property in some areas, widespread censorship, thousands of arbitrary arrests, virtual impunity for criminal action by members of Popular Front parties, manipulation and politicisation of justice, arbitrary dissolution of rightist organisations, coercive elections in Cuenca and Granada that excluded all opposition, subversion of the security forces, and a substantial growth in political violence, resulting in more than three hundred deaths. Moreover, because local and provincial governments were forcibly taken over, decreed by the government in much of the country rather than secured via any elections, they tended to have a coercive cast akin to that of local governments taken over by Italian Fascists in northern Italy during the summer of 1922. Yet as of early July the centrist and rightist opposition in Spain remained divided and impotent.\"<ref>Payne, S.G. and Palacios, J., 2014. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Press. p.&nbsp;117.</ref>\n\nLaia Balcells observes that polarisation in Spain just before the coup was so intense that physical confrontations between leftists and rightists were a routine occurrence in most localities; six days before the coup occurred, there was a riot between the two in the province of Teruel. Balcells notes that Spanish society was so divided along Left-Right lines that the monk Hilari Raguer stated that in his parish, instead of playing \"cops and robbers\", children would sometimes play \"leftists and rightists.\"<ref>Balcells, Laia. Rivalry and revenge. Cambridge University Press, 2017. pp.58-59</ref> Within the first month of the Popular Front's government, nearly a quarter of the provincial governors had been removed due to their failure to prevent or control strikes, illegal land occupation, political violence and arson. The Popular Front government was more likely to persecute rightists for violence than leftists who committed similar acts. Aza\u00f1a was hesitant to use the army to shoot or stop rioters or protestors as many of them supported his coalition. On the other hand, he was reluctant to disarm the military as be believed he needed them to stop insurrections from the extreme left. Illegal land occupation became widespread - poor tenant farmers knew the government was disinclined to stop them. By April 1936, nearly 100,000 peasants had appropriated 400,000 hectares of land and perhaps as many as 1 million hectares by the start of the civil war; for comparison, the 1931-33 land reform had granted only 6000 peasants 45,000 hectares. As many strikes occurred between April and July as had occurred in the entirety of 1931. Workers increasingly demanded less work and more pay. \"Social crimes\" - refusing to pay for goods and rent - became increasingly common by workers, particularly in Madrid. In some cases this was done in the company of armed militants. Conservatives, the middle classes, businessmen and landowners became convinced that revolution had already begun.<ref>Seidman, Michael.

The 1931 Constitution would be suspended, replaced by a new \"constituent parliament\" which would be chosen by a new politically purged electorate, who would vote on the issue of republic versus monarchy. Certain liberal elements would remain, such as separation of church and state as well as freedom of religion. Agrarian issues would be solved by regional commissioners on the basis of smallholdings but collective cultivation would be permitted in some circumstances.

Payne|Stanley Payne]] claims that before these events, the idea of rebellion by army officers against the government had weakened; Mola had estimated that only 12% of officers reliably supported the coup and at one point considered fleeing the country for fear he was already compromised, and had to be convinced to remain by his co-conspirators.<ref>Payne, S.G. and Palacios, J., 2014. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres. pp115</ref> So according to Payne, the kidnapping and murder of Sotelo transformed the \"limping conspiracy\" into a revolt that could trigger a civil war. The involvement of forces of public order and a lack of action against the attackers hurt public opinion of the government. No effective action was taken; Payne points to a possible veto by socialists within the government who shielded the killers who had been drawn from their ranks. The murder of a parliamentary leader by state police was unprecedented, and the belief that the state had ceased to be neutral and effective in its duties encouraged important sectors of the right to join the rebellion.<ref>Seidman, Michael.

The principal source of manpower was conscription; both sides continued and expanded their schemes, the Nationalists drafting more aggressively, and there was little room left for volunteering. Foreigners contributed little to further growth; on the Nationalist side the Italians scaled down their engagement, while on the Republican side the influx of new ''interbrigadistas'' did not cover losses on the front.

His novel ''L'Espoir'' and the film version he produced and directed (''[[Espoir: Sierra de Teruel]]'') were a great help for the Republican cause in France.\n\nEven after covert support by France to the Republicans ended in December 1936, the possibility of French intervention against the Nationalists remained a serious possibility throughout the war.

Financing the war posed enormous challenge for both the Nationalists and the Republicans.\n\nThe two combatant parties followed similar financial strategies; in both cases money creation, rather than new taxes or issue of debt, was key to financing the war.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 1</ref> \n\nBoth sides relied mostly on domestic resources; in case of the Nationalists they amounted to 63% of the overall spendings ($1,28bn) and in case of the Republicans they stood at 59% ($1,09bn). In the Nationalist zone money creation was responsible for some 69% of domestic resources, while in the Republican one the corresponding figure stood at 60%;<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 11</ref> it was accomplished mostly by means of advances, credits, loans and debit balances from respective central banks.<ref>Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 11-12</ref> However, while in the Nationalist zone the rising stock of money was only marginally above the production growth rate, in the Republican zone it by far exceeded dwindling production figures. The result was that while by the end of the war the Nationalist inflation was 41% compared to 1936, the Republican one was in triple digits. The second component of domestic resource was fiscal revenue. In the Nationalist zone it grew steadily and in the 2nd half of 1938 it was 214% of the figure from the 2nd half of 1936.<ref>in nominal terms, in terms of purchasing power the growth was smaller; nominal figures were 396m ptas in the 2nd half of 1936 and 847m ptas in the 2nd half of 1938, Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 10</ref>. In the Republican zone fiscal revenues in 1937 dropped to some 25% of revenues recorded in the proportional area in 1935, but recovered slightly in 1938. Neither side re-engineered the pre-war tax system; differences resulted from dramatic problems with tax collection in the Republican zone and from the course of the war, as more and more population was governed by the Nationalists. A smaller percentage of domestic resources came from expropriations, donations or internal borrowing.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 7-11</ref>\n\nForeign resources amounted to 37% in case of the Nationalists ($0,76bn) and 41% in case of the Republicans ($0,77bn).<ref>when assessing financial cost of waging the war, some scholars limit their analysis to foreign resources only and set expenditures of both sides at some $0,7bn each, compare e.g. Romero Salvado, Francisco J. (2013), ''Historical Dictionary of the Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9780810857841}}, p. 20. Similarly, another author claims that \"the republican authorities obtained 714 million dollars, and this was the financial cost of the civil war for the Republicans\", while \"the financial cost of the war on the Francoist side was very similar, between 694 and 716 million dollars\", Casanova, Julian (2013), ''The Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9781848856578}}, p. 91. The same author claims in the same work that \"losing the war cost the Republic almost as much as Franco spent on winning it, some six hundred million dollars on each side\" (p. 185)</ref> For the Nationalists it was mostly the Italian and German credit;<ref>exact figures differ; one source claims $0,45bn for Italy and $0,23bn for Germany, Romero Salvado 2013, p. 20; the rest was mostly private credit from British (e.g. Rio Tinto) or US (e.g. Texaco) companies</ref> in case of the Republicans it was sales of gold reserves, mostly to the USSR and in much smaller amount to France.

The Spanish Nationalists, in contrast, imposed a puritanically terrorist order on the populace in their territory. They never suffered from serious partisan activity behind their lines and the fact that banditry did not develop into a serious problem in Spain, despite how easy it would have been in such mountainous terrain, demands explanation.

Many people including, as they are now called, the ''insumisos'' (\"defiant ones\", [[conscientious objector]]s) argued and worked for non-violent strategies. Prominent Spanish pacifists, such as [[Amparo Poch y Gasc\u00f3n]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Brocca]], supported the Republicans. Brocca argued that Spanish pacifists had no alternative but to make a stand against fascism. He put this stand into practice by various means, including organizing agricultural workers to maintain food supplies, and through humanitarian work with war refugees.{{NoteTag|See variously: Bennett, Scott, ''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915\u20131963'', Syracuse NY, Syracuse University Press, 2003; Prasad, Devi, ''War Is a Crime Against Humanity: The Story of War Resisters' International'', London, WRI, 2005.

Motion pictures, posters, books, radio programs, and leaflets are a few examples of this media art that was so influential during the war. Produced by both nationalists and republicans, propaganda allowed Spaniards a way to spread awareness about their war all over the world. A film co-produced by famous early-twentieth century authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Lillian Hellman]] was used as a way to advertise Spain's need for military and monetary aid. This film, ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', premiered in America in July 1937. In 1938, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', a personal account of his experiences and observations in the war, was published in the United Kingdom. In 1939, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] published in France a short story, [[The Wall (Sartre short story collection)|\"The Wall\"]] in which he describes the last night of prisoners of war sentenced to death by shooting.\n\nLeading works of sculpture include [[Alberto S\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez]]'s ''El pueblo espa\u00f1ol tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella'' (\"The Spanish People Have a Path that Leads to a Star\"), a 12.5&nbsp;m monolith constructed out of plaster representing the struggle for a socialist utopia;<ref name=\"museonacional\">[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/pueblo-espanol-tiene-camino-que-conduce-estrella-maqueta-there-way-spanish-people Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia], El pueblo espa\u00f1ol tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella (maqueta) (There Is a Way for the Spanish People That Leads to a Star [Maquette]).</ref> [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez's]] ''La Montserrat'', an anti-war work which shares its title with a mountain near Barcelona, is created from a sheet of iron which has been hammered and welded to create a peasant mother carrying a small child in one arm and a sickle in the other. and [[Alexander Calder]]'s ''Fuente de mercurio'' (Mercury Fountain) a protest work by the American against the Nationalist forced control of Almad\u00e9n and the mercury mines there.<ref name=\"montserrat\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2231 Museum of Modern Art].</ref>\n\n[[Pablo Picasso]] painted [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']] in 1937, taking inspiration from the bombing of Guernica, and in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Battle of Anghiari]]''.

This process led many to exile or death. \nExile happened in three waves. The first one was during the Northern Campaign (March\u2013November 1937), followed by a second wave after the fall of Catalonia (January\u2013February 1939), in which about 400,000 people fled to France. The French authorities had to improvise concentration camps, with such hard conditions that almost half of the exiled Spaniards returned. The third wave occurred after the War, at the end of March 1939, when thousands of Republicans tried to board ships to exile, although few succeeded.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bahamonde |first1=\u00c1ngel |last2=Cervera Gil |first2=Javier |title=As\u00ed termin\u00f3 la Guerra de year |publisher=Marcial Pons |location=Madrid |isbn = 84-95379-00-7}}</ref>\n\n=== International relations ===\nThe political and emotional repercussions of the War transcended the National scale, becoming a precursor to [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Payne |first = Stanley G. |title=Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II |date=2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15021-6 |page = 336 |jstor=j.ctt5vks5w}}</ref> The war has frequently been described as the \"prelude to\" or the \"opening round of\" the Second World War, as part of an international battle against fascism. However Stanley Payne suggests this isn't accurate, arguing that the international alliance that was created in December 1941, once the United States entered WW2, was politically much broader than the Spanish Popular Front as it included conservative capitalist states such as Great Britain and the United States; indeed it included the equivalent of many forces on Franco's side. The Spanish Civil War, Payne argues, was thus a much more clear-cut revolutionary/counterrevolutionary battle between the left and right, while the Second World War initially had the fascists and communists on the same side with the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Eastern Europe. Payne suggests that instead the civil war was the last of the revolutionary crises that emerged from the First World War, observing it had parallels such as: (1) the complete revolutionary breakdown of domestic institutions, (2) the development of full-scale revolutionary/counterrevolutionary war, (3) development of a typical post-World War One Red Army in the form of the People's Army, (4) an extreme exacerbation of nationalism, (5) frequent use of World War One style military material and concepts and (6) the fact that it was not the product of the plan of any the major powers, making it more similar to the post-First World War crises.<ref>Payne, Stanley G.

However, the end of the Civil War and later the Second World War saw the isolation of the country from most other nations until the 1950s, in which the American anti-Communist international policy favoured having a far-right and extremely anti-communist ally in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Alexander |title=Base Politics : Democratic Change and the U.S. Military Overseas |year=2008 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |isbn = 978-0801446054 |pages=57\u201364 |url = http://search.ebscohost.com.ccl.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=671393&site=ehost-live&scope=site.}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"<!-- do not collapse, per [[MOS:COLLAPSE]] -->\n|-\n!

Due to the international [[Interwar period#Great Depression|political climate]] at the time, the war had many facets and was variously viewed as [[class struggle]], a [[war of religion]], a struggle between [[dictatorship]] and [[Republicanism|republican democracy]], between [[revolution]] and [[counterrevolution]], and between [[fascism]] and [[communism]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Juli\u00e1 |first = Santos |author-link = Santos Juli\u00e1 |title = Un siglo de Espa\u00f1a.

The government at the time was a coalition of Republicans, supported in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] by [[communist]] and [[socialist]] parties, under the leadership of [[centre-left]] President [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=43}}{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=84}} The Nationalist group was supported by a number of conservative groups, including [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups|CEDA]], monarchists, including both the opposing [[Alfonsism|Alfonsists]] and the religious conservative [[Carlism|Carlists]], and the [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|FE de las JONS]], a [[Fascism|fascist]] political party.{{sfn|Payne|1973|pp=200\u2013203}} After the deaths of Sanjurjo, [[Emilio Mola]] and [[Manuel Goded Llopis]], Franco emerged as the remaining leader of the Nationalist side.\n\nThe coup was supported by military units in the [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]], [[Pamplona]], [[Burgos]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Valladolid]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], and [[Seville]]. However, rebelling units in some important cities\u2014such as [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]], [[Bilbao]], and [[M\u00e1laga]]\u2014did not gain control, and those cities remained under the control of the government. This left Spain militarily and politically divided. The Nationalists and the Republican government fought for control of the country. The Nationalist forces received munitions, soldiers, and air support from [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], while the Republican side received support from the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Mexico]]. Other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and the [[United States]], continued to recognise the Republican government, but followed an official policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]]. Despite this policy, tens of thousands of citizens from non-interventionist countries directly participated in the conflict. They fought mostly in the pro-Republican [[International Brigades]], which also included several thousand exiles from pro-Nationalist regimes.\n\nThe Nationalists advanced from their strongholds in the south and west, capturing most of Spain's northern coastline in 1937. They also besieged Madrid and the area to its south and west for much of the war. After much of [[Catalonia]] was captured in 1938 and 1939, and Madrid cut off from Barcelona, the Republican military position became hopeless. Following the fall without resistance of Barcelona in January 1939, the recognition of the Francoist regime by France and the United Kingdom in February 1939, and internal conflict between Republican factions in Madrid in March 1939, Franco entered the capital and declared victory on 1 April 1939. Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards fled to refugee camps in [[southern France]].<ref name=\"historytoday.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.historytoday.com/archive/refugees-and-spanish-civil-war |title = Refugees and the Spanish Civil War &#124; History Today}}</ref><ref name=\"historytoday.com\"/> Those associated with the losing Republicans who stayed were persecuted by the victorious Nationalists.

Those in favour of reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms. Some liberals, in a tradition that started with the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], sought to limit the power of the [[monarchy of Spain]] and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 were overturned when [[King Ferdinand VII]] dissolved the Constitution and ended the [[Trienio Liberal]] government.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=7}} Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates called ''[[Latifundium|latifundia]]'' as well as all the important government positions.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=19}}\n\nIn 1868, popular uprisings led to the overthrow of [[Queen Isabella II]] of the [[House of Bourbon]]. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by [[Joan Prim|General Joan Prim]]) concerned with the ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873, Isabella's replacement, King [[Amadeo I of Spain|Amadeo I]] of the [[House of Savoy]], abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]] was proclaimed.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;13.</ref><ref>Preston (2006). p.&nbsp;21.</ref> After the [[Restoration (Spain)|restoration of the Bourbons]] in December 1874,<ref>Preston (2006). p. 22.</ref> [[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Anarchism|Anarchists]] emerged in opposition to the monarchy.<ref>Preston (2006). p. 24.</ref><ref>Fraser (1979). pp.&nbsp;38\u201339.</ref> [[Alejandro Lerroux]], Spanish politician and leader of the [[Radical Republican Party]], helped bring [[republicanism]] to the fore in [[Catalonia]], where poverty was particularly acute.<ref>Preston (2006). pp.&nbsp;24\u201326.</ref> Growing resentment of [[conscription]] and of the military culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] in [[Barcelona]] in 1909.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;15.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alfonso XIIIdeEspa\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|On 12 April 1931, the Republicans won the elections and the [[Spanish Second Republic]] was proclaimed two days later.

Following the war, wide swathes of Spanish society, including the armed forces, united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful.<ref>Preston (2006). pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Popular perception of communism as a major threat significantly increased during this period.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=15}} In 1923, a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] brought [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] to power; as a result, Spain transitioned to government by military dictatorship.<ref>Thomas (1961). p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Support for the Rivera regime gradually faded, and he resigned in January 1930. He was replaced by General [[D\u00e1maso Berenguer]], who was in turn himself replaced by [[Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as|Admiral Juan Bautista Aznar-Caba\u00f1as]]; both men continued a policy of rule by decree. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities. Consequently, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII]] gave in to popular pressure for the establishment of a republic in 1931 and called municipal elections for 12 April of that year. The socialist and liberal republicans won almost all the provincial capitals, and following the resignation of Aznar's government, King Alfonso XIII fled the country.<ref>Beevor (2006) pp.&nbsp;20\u201322.</ref> At this time, the [[Second Spanish Republic]] was formed. It remained in power until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=20}}\n\nThe revolutionary committee headed by [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] became the provisional government, with Alcal\u00e1-Zamora as [[President (government title)|president]] and [[head of state]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=23}} The republic had broad support from all segments of society.{{sfn|Preston|2006|pp=38\u201339}} In May, an incident where a taxi driver was attacked outside a monarchist club sparked anti-clerical violence throughout [[Madrid]] and south-west [[Spain]]. The government's slow response disillusioned the right and reinforced their view that the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] was determined to persecute the church. In June and July the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]], known as the CNT, called several [[Strike action|strikes]], which led to a violent incident between CNT members and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] and a brutal crackdown by the Civil Guard and the [[Spanish Army|army]] against the CNT in [[Seville]]. This led many workers to believe the Spanish Second Republic was just as oppressive as the monarchy, and the CNT announced its intention of overthrowing it via [[revolution]].{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=26}} Elections in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and [[Socialism|Socialists]].<ref>Preston (2006). p. 50.</ref> With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the government tried to assist rural Spain by instituting an [[eight-hour day]] and redistributing [[land tenure]] to farm workers.{{sfn|Preston|2006|p=42}}{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=22}} The rural workers lived in some of the worst poverty in Europe at the time and the government tried to increase their wages and improve working conditions. This estranged small and medium landholders who used hired labour. The Law of Municpal Boundaries forbade the hiring of workers from outside the locality of the owner's holdings. Since not all localities had enough labour for the tasks required, the law had unintended negative consequences, such as sometimes shutting out peasants and renters from the labour market when they needed extra income as pickers. Labour arbitration boards were set up to regulate salaries, contracts and working hours; they were more favourable to workers than employers and thus the latter became hostile to them. A decree in July 1931 increased overtime pay and several laws in late 1931 restricted whom landowners could hire. Other efforts included decrees limiting the use of machinery, efforts to create a monopoly on hiring, strikes and efforts by unions to limit women's employment to preserve a labour monopoly for their members. Class struggle intensified as landowners turned to counterrevolutionary organisations and local oligarchs. Strikes, workplace theft, arson, robbery and assaults on shops, strikebreakers, employers and machines became increasingly common. Ultimately, the reforms of the Republican-Socialist government alienated as many people as they pleased.<ref>Seidman, Michael. \"The Victorious Counterrevolution.\" The Nationalist Effort in the (2011), pp.16-17</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Main altarpiece of the Church del Salvador (Elche) before it was burned by Republicans.jpg\n| width1 = 120\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Church del Salvador (Elche) after it was burned by Republicans.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The Church was a frequent target of the revolutionary left in the Republic and in the War.

Spanish commentators spoke of chaos and preparation for revolution, foreign diplomats made plans in case of revolution and an interest in fascism developed among the threatened. Payne states that by July 1936:\n::\"The frequent overt violations of the law, assaults on property, and political violence in Spain were without precedent for a modern European country not undergoing total revolution. These included massive, sometimes violent and destructive strike waves, large-scale illegal seizures of farmland in the south, a wave of arson and destruction of property, arbitrary closure of Catholic schools, seizure of churches and Catholic property in some areas, widespread censorship, thousands of arbitrary arrests, virtual impunity for criminal action by members of Popular Front parties, manipulation and politicisation of justice, arbitrary dissolution of rightist organisations, coercive elections in Cuenca and Granada that excluded all opposition, subversion of the security forces, and a substantial growth in political violence, resulting in more than three hundred deaths. Moreover, because local and provincial governments were forcibly taken over, decreed by the government in much of the country rather than secured via any elections, they tended to have a coercive cast akin to that of local governments taken over by Italian Fascists in northern Italy during the summer of 1922. Yet as of early July the centrist and rightist opposition in Spain remained divided and impotent.\"<ref>Payne, S.G. and Palacios, J., 2014. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Press. p.&nbsp;117.</ref>\n\nLaia Balcells observes that polarisation in Spain just before the coup was so intense that physical confrontations between leftists and rightists were a routine occurrence in most localities; six days before the coup occurred, there was a riot between the two in the province of Teruel. Balcells notes that Spanish society was so divided along Left-Right lines that the monk Hilari Raguer stated that in his parish, instead of playing \"cops and robbers\", children would sometimes play \"leftists and rightists.\"<ref>Balcells, Laia. Rivalry and revenge. Cambridge University Press, 2017. pp.58-59</ref> Within the first month of the Popular Front's government, nearly a quarter of the provincial governors had been removed due to their failure to prevent or control strikes, illegal land occupation, political violence and arson. The Popular Front government was more likely to persecute rightists for violence than leftists who committed similar acts. Aza\u00f1a was hesitant to use the army to shoot or stop rioters or protestors as many of them supported his coalition. On the other hand, he was reluctant to disarm the military as be believed he needed them to stop insurrections from the extreme left. Illegal land occupation became widespread - poor tenant farmers knew the government was disinclined to stop them. By April 1936, nearly 100,000 peasants had appropriated 400,000 hectares of land and perhaps as many as 1 million hectares by the start of the civil war; for comparison, the 1931-33 land reform had granted only 6000 peasants 45,000 hectares. As many strikes occurred between April and July as had occurred in the entirety of 1931. Workers increasingly demanded less work and more pay. \"Social crimes\" - refusing to pay for goods and rent - became increasingly common by workers, particularly in Madrid. In some cases this was done in the company of armed militants. Conservatives, the middle classes, businessmen and landowners became convinced that revolution had already begun.<ref>Seidman, Michael.

The initial government would be an all-military \"Directory\", which would create a \"strong and disciplined state.\" General Sanjurjo would be the head of this new regime, due to being widely liked and respected within the military, though his position would be a largely symbolic due to his lack of political talent. The 1931 Constitution would be suspended, replaced by a new \"constituent parliament\" which would be chosen by a new politically purged electorate, who would vote on the issue of republic versus monarchy. Certain liberal elements would remain, such as separation of church and state as well as freedom of religion. Agrarian issues would be solved by regional commissioners on the basis of smallholdings but collective cultivation would be permitted in some circumstances. Legislation prior to February 1936 would be respected.<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Stanley G. Payne. The Spanish civil war.

Payne|Stanley Payne]] claims that before these events, the idea of rebellion by army officers against the government had weakened; Mola had estimated that only 12% of officers reliably supported the coup and at one point considered fleeing the country for fear he was already compromised, and had to be convinced to remain by his co-conspirators.<ref>Payne, S.G. and Palacios, J., 2014. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres. pp115</ref> So according to Payne, the kidnapping and murder of Sotelo transformed the \"limping conspiracy\" into a revolt that could trigger a civil war. The involvement of forces of public order and a lack of action against the attackers hurt public opinion of the government. No effective action was taken; Payne points to a possible veto by socialists within the government who shielded the killers who had been drawn from their ranks. The murder of a parliamentary leader by state police was unprecedented, and the belief that the state had ceased to be neutral and effective in its duties encouraged important sectors of the right to join the rebellion.<ref>Seidman, Michael.

Finally, the final months of 1936 saw the arrival of foreign troops, International Brigades joining the Republicans and Italian CTV, German Legion Condor and Portuguese Viriatos joining the Nationalists. The result was that in April 1937 there were some 360,000 soldiers in the Republican ranks and some 290,000 in the Nationalist ones.<ref>Payne (1970), pp. 329\u2013330</ref>\n\n[[File:Republican forces during the Battle of Ir\u00fan.jpg|thumb|Republican forces during the [[battle of Ir\u00fan]] in 1936]]\n\nThe armies kept growing. The principal source of manpower was conscription; both sides continued and expanded their schemes, the Nationalists drafting more aggressively, and there was little room left for volunteering. Foreigners contributed little to further growth; on the Nationalist side the Italians scaled down their engagement, while on the Republican side the influx of new ''interbrigadistas'' did not cover losses on the front. At the turn of 1937/1938, each army numbered about 700,000.<ref>Payne (2012), p. 188</ref>\n\nThroughout 1938, the principal if not exclusive source of new men was a draft; at this stage it was the Republicans who conscripted more aggressively, and only 47% of their combatants were in age corresponding to the Nationalist conscription age limits.<ref>following the Battle of Ebro the Nationalists have established that only 47% of Republican POWs taken were in age corresponding to the Nationalist conscription age; 43% were older and 10% were younger, Payne, Stanley G., ''The Spanish civil War, the Soviet Union, and communism'', Yale University Press, 2008, p. 269</ref> Just prior to the Battle of Ebro, Republicans achieved their all-time high, slightly above 800,000; yet Nationalists numbered 880,000.<ref>Payne (2012), p. 299</ref> The Battle of Ebro, fall of Catalonia and collapsing discipline caused a great shrinking of Republican troops.

Catholic support became particularly pronounced as a consequence of the burning of churches and killing of priests in most leftists zones during the first six months of the war.

His novel ''L'Espoir'' and the film version he produced and directed (''[[Espoir: Sierra de Teruel]]'') were a great help for the Republican cause in France.\n\nEven after covert support by France to the Republicans ended in December 1936, the possibility of French intervention against the Nationalists remained a serious possibility throughout the war.

Financing the war posed enormous challenge for both the Nationalists and the Republicans.\n\nThe two combatant parties followed similar financial strategies; in both cases money creation, rather than new taxes or issue of debt, was key to financing the war.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 1</ref> \n\nBoth sides relied mostly on domestic resources; in case of the Nationalists they amounted to 63% of the overall spendings ($1,28bn) and in case of the Republicans they stood at 59% ($1,09bn). In the Nationalist zone money creation was responsible for some 69% of domestic resources, while in the Republican one the corresponding figure stood at 60%;<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 11</ref> it was accomplished mostly by means of advances, credits, loans and debit balances from respective central banks.<ref>Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 11-12</ref> However, while in the Nationalist zone the rising stock of money was only marginally above the production growth rate, in the Republican zone it by far exceeded dwindling production figures. The result was that while by the end of the war the Nationalist inflation was 41% compared to 1936, the Republican one was in triple digits. The second component of domestic resource was fiscal revenue. In the Nationalist zone it grew steadily and in the 2nd half of 1938 it was 214% of the figure from the 2nd half of 1936.<ref>in nominal terms, in terms of purchasing power the growth was smaller; nominal figures were 396m ptas in the 2nd half of 1936 and 847m ptas in the 2nd half of 1938, Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, p. 10</ref>. In the Republican zone fiscal revenues in 1937 dropped to some 25% of revenues recorded in the proportional area in 1935, but recovered slightly in 1938. Neither side re-engineered the pre-war tax system; differences resulted from dramatic problems with tax collection in the Republican zone and from the course of the war, as more and more population was governed by the Nationalists. A smaller percentage of domestic resources came from expropriations, donations or internal borrowing.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 7-11</ref>\n\nForeign resources amounted to 37% in case of the Nationalists ($0,76bn) and 41% in case of the Republicans ($0,77bn).<ref>when assessing financial cost of waging the war, some scholars limit their analysis to foreign resources only and set expenditures of both sides at some $0,7bn each, compare e.g. Romero Salvado, Francisco J. (2013), ''Historical Dictionary of the Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9780810857841}}, p. 20. Similarly, another author claims that \"the republican authorities obtained 714 million dollars, and this was the financial cost of the civil war for the Republicans\", while \"the financial cost of the war on the Francoist side was very similar, between 694 and 716 million dollars\", Casanova, Julian (2013), ''The Spanish Civil War'', {{ISBN|9781848856578}}, p. 91.

None of the sides resolved to public borrowing and none floated debt on foreign exchange markets.<ref> Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 11-14</ref>\n\nAuthors of recent studies suggest that given Nationalist and Republican spendings were comparable, earlier theory pointing to Republican mismanagement of resources is no longer tenable.<ref>earlier studies suggested that the Republican military expenditures were 4 times larger than the Nationalist ones (40bn ptas v. 12bn ptas); the conclusion drawn was that the Republicans have grossly mismanaged their resources. Recent studies claim that the above figures are calculated in nominal terms, and that entirely different picture emerges when inflation and exchange rates are taken into account, Martin-Acena, Martinez Ruiz, Pons Brias 2010, pp. 2-3</ref> Instead, they claim that the Republicans failed to translate their resources into military victory largely because of constraints of the international non-intervention agreement; they were forced to spend in excess of market prices and accept goods of lower quality.

The Spanish Nationalists, in contrast, imposed a puritanically terrorist order on the populace in their territory. They never suffered from serious partisan activity behind their lines and the fact that banditry did not develop into a serious problem in Spain, despite how easy it would have been in such mountainous terrain, demands explanation.

Many people including, as they are now called, the ''insumisos'' (\"defiant ones\", [[conscientious objector]]s) argued and worked for non-violent strategies. Prominent Spanish pacifists, such as [[Amparo Poch y Gasc\u00f3n]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Brocca]], supported the Republicans. Brocca argued that Spanish pacifists had no alternative but to make a stand against fascism. He put this stand into practice by various means, including organizing agricultural workers to maintain food supplies, and through humanitarian work with war refugees.{{NoteTag|See variously: Bennett, Scott, ''Radical Pacifism: The War Resisters League and Gandhian Nonviolence in America, 1915\u20131963'', Syracuse NY, Syracuse University Press, 2003; Prasad, Devi, ''War Is a Crime Against Humanity: The Story of War Resisters' International'', London, WRI, 2005.

Motion pictures, posters, books, radio programs, and leaflets are a few examples of this media art that was so influential during the war. Produced by both nationalists and republicans, propaganda allowed Spaniards a way to spread awareness about their war all over the world. A film co-produced by famous early-twentieth century authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Lillian Hellman]] was used as a way to advertise Spain's need for military and monetary aid. This film, ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', premiered in America in July 1937. In 1938, [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', a personal account of his experiences and observations in the war, was published in the United Kingdom. In 1939, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] published in France a short story, [[The Wall (Sartre short story collection)|\"The Wall\"]] in which he describes the last night of prisoners of war sentenced to death by shooting.\n\nLeading works of sculpture include [[Alberto S\u00e1nchez P\u00e9rez]]'s ''El pueblo espa\u00f1ol tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella'' (\"The Spanish People Have a Path that Leads to a Star\"), a 12.5&nbsp;m monolith constructed out of plaster representing the struggle for a socialist utopia;<ref name=\"museonacional\">[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/pueblo-espanol-tiene-camino-que-conduce-estrella-maqueta-there-way-spanish-people Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia], El pueblo espa\u00f1ol tiene un camino que conduce a una estrella (maqueta) (There Is a Way for the Spanish People That Leads to a Star [Maquette]).</ref> [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez's]] ''La Montserrat'', an anti-war work which shares its title with a mountain near Barcelona, is created from a sheet of iron which has been hammered and welded to create a peasant mother carrying a small child in one arm and a sickle in the other. and [[Alexander Calder]]'s ''Fuente de mercurio'' (Mercury Fountain) a protest work by the American against the Nationalist forced control of Almad\u00e9n and the mercury mines there.<ref name=\"montserrat\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=2231 Museum of Modern Art].</ref>\n\n[[Pablo Picasso]] painted [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']] in 1937, taking inspiration from the bombing of Guernica, and in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Battle of Anghiari]]''.

This process led many to exile or death. \nExile happened in three waves. The first one was during the Northern Campaign (March\u2013November 1937), followed by a second wave after the fall of Catalonia (January\u2013February 1939), in which about 400,000 people fled to France. The French authorities had to improvise concentration camps, with such hard conditions that almost half of the exiled Spaniards returned. The third wave occurred after the War, at the end of March 1939, when thousands of Republicans tried to board ships to exile, although few succeeded.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bahamonde |first1=\u00c1ngel |last2=Cervera Gil |first2=Javier |title=As\u00ed termin\u00f3 la Guerra de year |publisher=Marcial Pons |location=Madrid |isbn = 84-95379-00-7}}</ref>\n\n=== International relations ===\nThe political and emotional repercussions of the War transcended the National scale, becoming a precursor to [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Payne |first = Stanley G. |title=Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II |date=2008 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15021-6 |page = 336 |jstor=j.ctt5vks5w}}</ref> The war has frequently been described as the \"prelude to\" or the \"opening round of\" the Second World War, as part of an international battle against fascism. However Stanley Payne suggests this isn't accurate, arguing that the international alliance that was created in December 1941, once the United States entered WW2, was politically much broader than the Spanish Popular Front as it included conservative capitalist states such as Great Britain and the United States; indeed it included the equivalent of many forces on Franco's side. The Spanish Civil War, Payne argues, was thus a much more clear-cut revolutionary/counterrevolutionary battle between the left and right, while the Second World War initially had the fascists and communists on the same side with the Nazi-Soviet invasion of Eastern Europe. Payne suggests that instead the civil war was the last of the revolutionary crises that emerged from the First World War, observing it had parallels such as: (1) the complete revolutionary breakdown of domestic institutions, (2) the development of full-scale revolutionary/counterrevolutionary war, (3) development of a typical post-World War One Red Army in the form of the People's Army, (4) an extreme exacerbation of nationalism, (5) frequent use of World War One style military material and concepts and (6) the fact that it was not the product of the plan of any the major powers, making it more similar to the post-First World War crises.<ref>Payne, Stanley G.

However, the end of the Civil War and later the Second World War saw the isolation of the country from most other nations until the 1950s, in which the American anti-Communist international policy favoured having a far-right and extremely anti-communist ally in Europe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cooley |first=Alexander |title=Base Politics : Democratic Change and the U.S. Military Overseas |year=2008 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |isbn = 978-0801446054 |pages=57\u201364 |url = http://search.ebscohost.com.ccl.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=671393&site=ehost-live&scope=site.}}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\"<!-- do not collapse, per [[MOS:COLLAPSE]] -->\n|-\n!

It exists exclusively in [[Christianity]] and related religions, as others generally do not contain a Eucharistic ceremony.\n\nIn the [[Gospel]] accounts of Jesus' earthly ministry, a crowd of listeners challenges him regarding the rain of manna before he delivers the famous [[Bread of Life Discourse]] ({{bibleverse||John|6:22\u201359|RSV}}), and he describes himself as the \"True Bread from [[Heaven]]\".<ref>''The Gospel According to John: A Literary and Theological Commentary'' by Thomas L. Brodie 1997 {{ISBN|0-19-511811-1}} p. 266</ref> The aforementioned Bread of Life Discourse occurs in the [[Gospel of John]], {{Bibleverse-nb||John|6:30\u201359|KJV}}. Therein, Jesus promises to give His Flesh and Blood, which will give eternal life to all who receive It.  In John 6:53 (RSV), Jesus says, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.\"  And continues, (v. 54\u201355) \"he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed.\"  Every year, the nation of Israel celebrated the Passover Meal, remembering and celebrating their liberation from captivity in Egypt.  It was at the Passover that Jesus Christ celebrated the Last Supper with his Apostles.\n\n[[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]] in his [[First Letter to the Corinthians]] ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201326|KJV}}) and the [[Synoptic Gospels]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|26:26\u201328|KJV}}), [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:22\u201324|KJV}}), and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:19\u201320|KJV}}) state that Jesus, in the course of the [[Last Supper]] on the night before his [[death and resurrection of Jesus|death and resurrection]], [[Last Supper#Institution of the Eucharist|said]]: \"This is my body\", and \"This is my blood\". For instance, Matthew recounts: \"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body; And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\" The [[Gospel of John]], on the other hand, makes no mention of this. One explanation offered is that he wrote his Gospel to supplement what the other [[Evangelism|evangelist]]s had already written.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cooke|first1=Richard|title=New Testament|date=2009|publisher=Hymns Ancient and Modern Ltd|isbn=9780334040606|page=364|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4oWyn4nGxGIC&pg=PA364&dq=John+Gospel+supplementing+Synoptics+%22last+supper%22#v=onepage&q=John%20Gospel%20supplementing%20Synoptics%20%22last%20supper%22&f=false|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Unger|first1=Merrill F.|title=The New Unger's Bible Handbook|date=2005|publisher=Moody|isbn=9781575676340|page=444|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zpl1060FCcQC&pg=PA444&dq=John+Gospel+supplementing+Synoptics+%22last+supper%22#v=onepage&q=John%20Gospel%20supplementing%20Synoptics%20%22last%20supper%22&f=false|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\nBecause Jesus Christ is a person, theologies regarding the Eucharist involve consideration of the way in which the communicant's personal relationship with God is fed through this mystical meal. However, debates over Eucharistic theology in the West have centered not on the personal aspects of Christ's presence but on the metaphysical. The opposing views are summarized below.\n\n===Real presence===\n{{main article|Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist}}\n\n====Transubstantiation====\n{{Main article|Transubstantiation|Eucharist in the Catholic Church}}\nThe [[Substance theory|substance]] (fundamental reality) of the bread and wine is changed in a way beyond human comprehension into that of the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ, but the [[accident (philosophy)|accidents]] (physical traits, including chemical properties) of the bread and wine remain.  This view is taught by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], including its Eastern Rites.\n\n====Definitive change====\nEastern Orthodox Christians generally prefer not to be tied down by the specifics of the defined doctrine of transubstantiation, though they all agree with the definition's conclusion about the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]]. They prefer simply to use the term \"change\" (Greek: \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae), as in the [[epiclesis]] of the [[Divine Liturgy]], to describe the change of the bread and wine into the actual [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ]].<ref>{{Cite book|last = Ware|first = Timothy|author-link = Timothy Ware|title = The Orthodox Church|place = London|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1964|pages = [https://archive.org/details/orthodoxchurchac00ware/page/290 290ff]|isbn = 0-14-020592-6|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/orthodoxchurchac00ware/page/290}}</ref> (See \"[[Eucharistic theology#Objective reality.2C silence about technicalities|Objective reality, silence about technicalities]]\", below.) The terminology of transubstantiation was adopted within the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] by the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] (1672), although it is not recognized as having the authority of an [[Ecumenical Council]] and has been criticized for a perceived tendency toward [[Liturgical Latinisation|Latinization]].\n\n====Consubstantiation====\n{{Main article|Consubstantiation}}\n\"The bread retains its substance and ... Christ\u2019s glorified body comes down into the bread through the consecration and is found there together with the natural substance of the bread, without quantity but whole and complete in every part of the sacramental bread.\" It was the position of the [[Lollardist]]s.<ref>Bengt H\u00e4gglund, ''History of Theology'', Gene J. Lund, trans., (St. Louis: CPH, 1968), 194</ref> It is erroneously used to denote the position of [[Lutheranism|the Lutheran Church]] (see below), who instead affirm the doctrine of [[sacramental union]].

This is the position of the Lutheran Church that echoes the next view with its \"pious silence about technicalities\" in that it objects to philosophical terms like \"consubstantiation.\"\n\n====Objective reality, silence about technicalities====\n\"Objective reality, but pious silence about technicalities\" (or \"divine [or holy] mystery\") is the view of all the ancient Churches of the East, as well as of many Anglicans (including those of [[Anglo-Catholic]] churchmanship) and [[Methodists]].<ref name=\"Poulson1999\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gbod.org/worship/thisholymystery/parttwo.html |title=This Holy Mystery: Part Two |publisher=The United Methodist Church GBOD |accessdate=15 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020212029/http://www.gbod.org/worship/thisholymystery/parttwo.html |archivedate=20 October 2004 |df=dmy }}</ref> While they agree that in the sacrament the bread and the wine are really and truly changed into the body and the blood of Christ, and while they have at times employed the terminology of \"substance\" to explain what is changed,<ref>\"after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, there no longer remaineth the ''substance'' of the bread and of the wine, but the Body Itself and the Blood of the Lord, under the species and form of bread and wine; that is to say, under the ''accidents'' of the bread\" ([http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html Confession of Dositheus] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012149/http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html |date=27 September 2011 }}, Synod of Jerusalem); \"the word ''transubstantiation'' is not to be taken to define the manner in which the bread and wine are changed into the Body and Blood of the Lord; for this none can understand but God; but only thus much is signified, that the bread truly, really, and ''substantially'' becomes the very true Body of the Lord, and the wine the very Blood of the Lord\" ([http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm ''The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church'']); the [http://www.bible.ca/cr-Orthodox.htm#catechism Catechism of the Eastern Orthodox Church] also uses the term ''transubstantiation''.</ref> they usually avoid this language, considering it redolent of [[scholasticism]], as presenting speculative metaphysics as doctrine, and as scrutinizing excessively the manner in which the mystical transformation takes place.\n\n====Pneumatic presence====\n{{Main|Lord's Supper in Reformed theology}}\n\"Real Spiritual presence\", also called \"pneumatic presence\", holds that not only the Spirit of Christ, but also the true body and blood of Jesus Christ (hence \"real\"), are received by the sovereign, mysterious, and miraculous power of the Holy Spirit (hence \"spiritual\"), but only by those partakers who have faith. This view approaches the \"pious silence\" view in its unwillingness to specify how the Holy Spirit makes Christ present, but positively excludes not just symbolism but also trans- and con-substantiation. It is also known as the \"mystical presence\" view, and is held by some [[Low Church]] Reformed Anglicans, as well as other [[Presbyterian]] Christians.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pursuingveritas.com/2017/10/19/a-brief-history-of-communion-five-reformation-views/|title=A Brief History of Communion: Five Reformation Views|last=Prahlow|first=Jacob J.|date=19 October 2017|publisher=Pursuing Veritas|language=English|accessdate=19 July 2018}}</ref> This understanding is often called \"receptionism\". Some argue that this view can be seen as being suggested\u2014though not clearly\u2014by the \"[[epiclesis|invocation]]\" of the Anglican Rite as found in the American [[Book of Common Prayer]], 1928 and earlier and in Rite I of the American BCP of 1979 as well as in other Anglican formularies:\n: ''And we most humbly beseech thee, O merciful Father, to hear us, and of thy almighty goodness, vouchsafe to bless and sanctify, with thy Word and Holy Spirit, these thy gifts and creatures of bread and wine; that we, receiving them according to thy Son our Savior Jesus Christ's holy institution, in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed body and blood.''\n\n===Memorialism===\nThe bread and wine are symbolic of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, and in partaking of the elements the believer commemorates the sacrificial death of Christ. Christ is not present in the sacrament, except in the minds and hearts of the communicants. This view is also known as \"memorialism\" and \"Zwinglianism\" after [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and is held by most [[Anabaptists]],<ref name=\"Willis2017\">{{cite book|last=Willis|first=Wendell|title=Eucharist and Ecclesiology|date=6 January 2017|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781498282932|page=52|quote=The Anabaptists picked up from Zwingli an emphasis on the memorial aspects of the Eucharist. The ''Schleitheim Confession of Faith'' in 1527 stated: \"All those who wish to break bread in remembrance of the broken body of Christ, and all who wish to drink of one drink as a remembrance of the shed blood of Christ, shall be united beforehand by baptism in one body of Christ.}}</ref> [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], as well as [[Latter-day Saint]] denominations.\n\n===Suspension===\nThe partaking of the bread and wine was not intended to be a perpetual ordinance, or was not to be taken as a religious rite or ceremony (also known as ''adeipnonism,'' meaning \"no supper\" or \"no meal\"). This is the view of [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and the [[Salvation Army]], as well as the [[hyperdispensationalism|hyperdispensationalist]] positions of [[E. W. Bullinger]], Cornelius R. Stam, and others.\n\n==Efficacy of the rite==\n{{Main article|Ex opere operato}}\nEastern and Western eucharistic traditions generally agree with St. [[Augustine of Hippo]] in teaching that the efficacy of the sacraments as a means of divine grace does not depend on the worthiness of the priest or minister administering them. Augustine developed this concept in his controversy with the [[Donatists]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|title=A History of Christian Thought, volume 2|publisher=Nashville:Abingdon Press|year=1987|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> In traditional Christianity, the efficacy and validity of the sacrament does, however, depend on properly ordained [[bishop]]s and [[priest (Christianity)|priests]] with a lineage from the Apostles, a doctrine called \"[[apostolic succession]]\".\n\n==Theologies of different churches==\n\n\n===Roman Catholic Church===\n{{Main article|Eucharist in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Missa tridentina 002.jpg|270px|right|thumb|Elevation of the Eucharist at a [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]] Catholic Mass]]\n\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], the Communion bread is fervently revered in view of the Church's doctrine that, when bread and wine are consecrated during the Eucharistic celebration, they cease to be bread and wine and become the body and blood of Christ. The empirical appearances continue to exist unchanged, but the reality is changed by the power of the Holy Spirit, Who has been called down upon the bread and wine.  The separate consecrations of the bread (known as the [[sacramental bread|host]]) and of the wine symbolizes the separation of Jesus' body from his blood at Calvary. However, since He has risen, the Church teaches that His Body and Blood are no longer actually separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or other minister) says \"The Body of Christ\" when administering the host and \"The Blood of Christ\" when presenting the chalice, the [[communicant]] who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire, body and blood, soul and divinity.<ref>[http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm Council of Trent, Session XIII, canon 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211215226/http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm |date=11 February 2008 }};[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt1art3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1390]; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04175a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', Communion under Both Kinds]</ref> This belief is succinctly summarised in St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]' hymn, ''[[Adoro Te Devote]]''.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01154b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, article \"Adoro Te Devote\"]</ref>\n\nThe mysterious<ref>The Roman Catholic Church holds that no explanation is possible about ''how'' the change from bread and wine to the body and blood of Christ is brought about, and limits itself to teaching ''what'' is changed: \"The signs of bread and wine become, ''in a way surpassing understanding'', the Body and Blood of Christ\" ([https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Z.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333], emphasis added).</ref> change of the reality of the bread and wine began to be called \"transubstantiation\" in the 11th century.

Orthodox [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] affirm the real presence in the [[Sacred Mysteries]] ([[consecrated]] bread and wine) which they believe to be the actual Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. The Eucharist is normally received in the context of the Divine Liturgy. The bread and wine are believed to become the genuine Body and Blood of Christ [[Jesus]] through the operation of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Church has never described exactly ''how'' this occurs, or gone into the detail that the Roman Catholic Church has with the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]]. This doctrine was formulated after the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] took place, and the Eastern Orthodox churches have never formally affirmed or denied it, preferring to state simply that it is a \"Mystery\",<ref>Ware pp. 283\u2013285</ref> while at the same time using, as in the 1672 Synod of Jerusalem, language that might look similar as to one that is used by the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>For instance, \"after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, there no longer remaineth the substance of the bread and of the wine, but the Body Itself and the Blood of the Lord, under the species and form of bread and wine; that is to say, under the accidents of the bread\" ([http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html Chapter VI of ''Acts and Decrees of the Synod of Jerusalem''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012149/http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html |date=27 September 2011 }}).</ref>\n\nThe [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]] (Eucharistic prayer) contains an [[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]] (lit. \"making present\") which not only recounts the historical facts of Jesus' death and resurrection, but actually makes them present, forming an undivided link to the one unique event on [[Calvary]]. The Anaphora ends with an [[epiclesis]] (\"calling down from on high\") during which the [[priest]] invokes the [[Holy Spirit]] to come and \"change\" the Gifts (elements of bread and wine) into the actual Body and Blood of Christ. The Orthodox do not link the moment the Gifts change to the [[Words of Institution]], or indeed to any one particular moment. They merely affirm that the change is ''completed'' at the Epiclesis.\n\nCommunion is given only to baptized, chrismated Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer, and confession (different rules apply for children, elderly, sick, pregnant, etc. and are determined on a case-by-case basis by parish priests). The priest administers the Gifts with a spoon directly into the recipient's mouth from the chalice.<ref>Ware p. 287</ref> From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive Holy Communion.<ref>Ware p. 279</ref>\n\nThe holy gifts reserved for the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] or communion of the sick are specially consecrated as needed, especially on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]]. They are kept in an elaborately decorated [[Church tabernacle#Eastern Orthodox Church|tabernacle]], a container on the altar often in the shape of a church or of a dove. Generally, Eastern Christians do not adore the consecrated bread outside the Liturgy itself. However, they prostrate to the ground during the transfer of the Holy Gifts during the Presanctified Liturgy (the \"Entrance\"), as a sign of utmost reverence. After the Eucharist has been given to the congregation, the priest or the deacon has to consume the Holy Gifts that are left.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Icon last supper.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian icon]] of the [[Last Supper]] (1497)]]\n\nIn the Orthodox Churches, the Eucharistic celebration is known as the Divine Liturgy and is believed to impart the actual Body and Blood of Christ to the faithful. In the act of communion, the entire Church\u2014past, present, and even future\u2014is united in eternity. In Orthodox Eucharistic theology, although many separate Divine Liturgies may be celebrated, there is only one Bread and one Cup throughout all the world and throughout all time.\n\nThe most perfect expression of the Eucharistic unity of the church is found in the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy (i.e., a Liturgy at which a [[bishop]] is the chief celebrant), for as St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] stated, where the bishop is, surrounded by his clergy and faithful, there is the church in all of her fullness.\n\n=== Anglican Church ===\n{{Main article|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}\n\nThe historical position of the [[Church of England]] is found in the ''[[Thirty-Nine Articles]]'' of 1571, which state \"the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ\"; and likewise that \"the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ\" (Articles of Religion, Article XXVIII: Of the Lord's Supper) and that \"Transubstantiation is repugnant to Holy Writ\". However, the Articles also state that adoration, or worship ''per se,'' of the consecrated elements was not commanded by Christ. It also stated that those who receive unworthily do not actually receive Christ but rather their own condemnation.\n\nAnglicans generally and officially believe in the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist, but the specifics of belief regarding the manner of His presence range from a belief in the [[Anglican_eucharistic_theology#Corporeal_presence|corporeal presence]], sometimes but not always affirming Eucharistic adoration (mainly [[Anglo-Catholics]]),<ref name=\"Poulson1999\">{{cite book|last=Poulson|first=Christine|title=The Quest for the Grail: Arthurian Legend in British Art, 1840\u20131920|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0719055379|page=40|quote=By the late 1840s Anglo-Catholic interest in the revival of ritual had given new life to doctrinal debate over the nature of the Eucharist.

Of the Sacraments.|Westminster Confession of Faith Ch. XXVII Sec. 7]]</ref> The elements are spiritual nourishment in Christ by faith. According to John Calvin,\n\n:The sum is, that the flesh and blood of Christ feed our souls just as bread and wine maintain and support our corporeal life. For there would be no aptitude in the sign, did not our souls find their nourishment in Christ. [...] I hold...that the sacred mystery of the Supper consists of two things\u2014the corporeal signs, which, presented to the eye, represent invisible things in a manner adapted to our weak capacity, and the spiritual truth, which is at once figured and exhibited by the signs.<ref name=\"Calvin\">Calvin, [[Institutes of the Christian Religion]], book 4, chapter 17, points 10\u201311 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xviii.html]</ref>\n\nFollowing a phrase of Augustine, the Calvinist view is that \"no one bears away from this Sacrament more than is gathered with the vessel of faith.\" \"The flesh and blood of Christ are no less truly given to the unworthy than to God's elect believers\", Calvin said.  Faith, not a mere mental apprehension, and the work of the Holy Spirit, are necessary for the partaker to behold God incarnate, and in the same sense touch Christ with their hands; so that by eating and drinking of bread and wine Christ's actual presence penetrates to the heart of the believer more nearly than food swallowed with the mouth can enter in.<ref name =\"Calvin\"/>  The 'experience' of Eucharist, or the Lord's Supper, has traditionally been spoken of in the following way: the faithful believers are 'lifted up' by the power of the Holy Spirit to feast with Christ in heaven.  The Lord's Supper in this way is truly a 'Spiritual' experience as the Holy Spirit is directly involved in the action of 'eucharist'.\n\nThe Calvinist/Reformed view also places great emphasis on the action of the community as the Body of Christ.  As the faith community participates in the action of celebrating the Lord's Supper they are 'transformed' into the Body of Christ, or 'reformed' into the Body of Christ each time they participate in this sacrament.  In this sense it has been said that the term \"transubstantiation\" can be applied to the Faith Community (the Church) itself being transformed into the real Body and Blood of Christ truly present in the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAlthough Calvin rejected adoration of the Eucharistic bread and wine as \"idolatry\" later Reformed Christians have argued otherwise. Leftover elements may be disposed of without ceremony (or reused in later services); they are unchanged, and as such the meal directs attention toward Christ's bodily resurrection and return.<ref name =\"Calvin\"/>\n\nChristians in the [[Presbyterian Church U.S.A.]] and some Christians in the [[United Church of Christ]] would reverently endorse this view.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nTheology in the [[Mainline Protestant|mainline]] branch of this tradition is in flux, and recent agreements between these denominations and the [[Lutheran]]s have stressed that: \"The theological diversity within our common confession provides both the complementarity needed for a full and adequate witness to the gospel (mutual affirmation) and the corrective reminder that every theological approach is a partial and incomplete witness to the Gospel (mutual admonition) (A Common Calling, p. 66).\" Hence, in seeking to come to consensus about the Real Presence, the churches have written:\n::\"During the Reformation both Reformed and Lutheran Churches exhibited an evangelical intention when they understood the Lord's Supper in the light of the saving act of God in Christ. Despite this common intention, different terms and concepts were employed which. . . led to mutual misunderstanding and misrepresentation. Properly interpreted, the differing terms and concepts were often complementary rather than contradictory (Marburg Revisited, pp. 103\u2013104);\"\n:and further:\n::\"In the Lord's Supper the risen Christ imparts himself in body and blood, given up for all, through his word of promise with bread and wine....we proclaim the death of Christ through which God has reconciled the world with himself. We proclaim the presence of the risen Lord in our midst. Rejoicing that the Lord has come to us, we await his future coming in glory....Both of our communions, we maintain, need to grow in appreciation of our diverse eucharistic traditions, finding mutual enrichment in them. At the same time both need to grow toward a further deepening of our common experience and expression of the [[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]] of our Lord's Supper.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=A Formula of Agreement|url=http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Office-of-the-Presiding-Bishop/Ecumenical-and-Inter-Religious-Relations/Full-Communion-Partners/Presbyterian-Church-USA/A-Formula-of-Agreement.aspx}}</ref>\n\n=== Presbyterian Church ===\nAccording to the Presbyterian mission doctrine, the Lord's Supper is considered \"a sacrament of continuous growth, nourishment and new life\". In their understanding of the Reformed tradition, the participation in this sacrament should follow the sacrament of baptism. Just as humans need food and drink for nurture and sustenance, Calvin wrote that the Holy Meal of Lord's Supper is God's way of providing for the maintenance of sinful humans during the whole course of their lives after they have been received into God's family, in what Presbyterians call \"the Covenant Community\".<ref>David McKay \u2013 [https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/covenant-community/ Covenant Community] \u2013 ''ligonier.org.''

It is a primal physical act in the Church that signifies a spiritual relationship between personal beings.  And this is what the Eucharist is in Presbyterian understanding.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nAccording to Presbyterian Eucharistic theology, there's not actual \"transubstantiation\" in the bread and wine, but that Jesus is spiritually present in the elements of the Eucharist, authentically present in the non-atom-based substance, with which they believe that he is [[Consubstantiality|con-substantial]] with God in the [[Trinity]].   They teach that Christ is genuinely there in the elements of the Lord's Supper to be received by them, and not just in their memories.    So that it is both a memorial and a presence of Christ.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nThey teach that receiving the Communion elements is taking the symbolic representation of the broken body and shed blood of Jesus into the inmost being, receiving the Jesus who died for our forgiveness and transformation. That humans depend on these elements for their very life and salvation.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nPresbyterians believe that the Word of God should be read, proclaimed and enacted in the Lord's Supper as an integral part of worship. The relationship of Word and Sacrament can be understood in the context of the Emmaus Road narrative (Luke 24:13ff). While there are various interpretations of this account, the Presbyterian Church interprets the \u201cbreaking of bread\u201d in Luke 24 as  a reference to the Lord's Supper.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nMany Presbyterian churches use unfermented grape juice for Communion, which is of relatively recent practice, starting in the late 19th century or in the past one hundred years, out of concern for drunkenness and also because some congregants view any alcohol as \"sinful\", so to accommodate their consciences grape juice is utilized in most Presbyterian churches instead.  But  recently some individual Presbyterian churches have gone back to using actual fermented wine as Christ used and commanded.  Noting that wine in itself is not sinful, but that Christ made and drank it, etc., and that only excessive drinking of wine and actual drunkenness are wrong and sinful.<ref>Jack Lash \u2013 [https://www.gpcweb.org/why-do-we-use-wine-in-communion- Why Do We Use Wine in Communion? ] Gainsevill Presbyterian Church, PCA. Retrieved December 23, 2019.</ref>  \n\nThe Directory for Worship in the Presbyterian [[Book of Order]] encourages the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of frequent celebrations of the Lord's Supper. A few Presbyterian congregations have begun celebrations of the sacrament as often as each Lord's Day (or Sunday) and on other occasions of special significance in the life of the Christian community. And also on Presbyterian \"liturgical seasons\", such as \"Holy Week\" and \"Easter\", the Lord's Supper is especially celebrated and observed in Presbyterian churches.<ref>[https://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/worship/faq/faq-christianyear/ The Christian Year] - \"What are the liturgical seasons?\" ''PresbyterianMission.org.''

The doctrine is articulated in the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith]] and the [[Keach's Catechism|Catechism]]. It holds that the Lord's Supper to be a means of \"spiritual nourishment and growth\", stating:<ref name=\"CrossThompson2007\"/>\n{{quote|The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and showing to all the world the sacrifice of himself in his death, confirmation of the faith of believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment, and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all duties which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.<ref name=\"CrossThompson2007\">{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Anthony R.|last2=Thompson|first2=Philip E.|title=Baptist Sacramentalism|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781597527439|page=182}}</ref>}}\n\nIndependent Baptists hold to the [[Eucharist#Fundamental Independent Baptist (Hyles typology): Relational Presence|Relational Presence]]\n\nThe [[American Baptist Churches USA]], a mainline Baptist denomination, believes that \"The bread and cup that symbolize the broken body and shed blood offered by Christ remind us today of God's great love for us...\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc-usa.org/identity/bible.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417142835/http://www.abc-usa.org/identity/bible.html |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Zwinglianism ===\n{{Main article|Memorialism}}\n\nSome Protestant groups regard the Eucharist (also called the Lord's Supper or the Lord's Table) as a symbolic meal, a [[Memorialism|memorial]] of the Last Supper and the Passion in which nothing miraculous occurs. This view is known as the Zwinglian view, after Huldrych Zwingli, a Church leader in [[Zurich, Switzerland]] during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. It is commonly associated with the United Church of Christ, Baptists, the [[Disciples of Christ]] and the [[Mennonite]]s. Elements left over from the service may be discarded without any formal ceremony, or if feasible may be retained for use in future services.\n\nThe successor of Zwingli in Zurich, [[Heinrich Bullinger]], came to an agreement theologically with John Calvin. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20091002220509/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Tigurinus/tigur-bvd.htm Consensus Tigurinus] lays out an explanation of the doctrine of the Sacraments in general, and specifically, that of Holy Communion, as the view embraced by John Calvin and leaders of the Church of Zurich who followed Zwingli. It demonstrates that at least the successors of Zwingli held to the real spiritual presence view most commonly attributed to Calvin and Reformed [[Protestantism]].\n\nThe [[Plymouth Brethren]] hold the Lord's Supper, or the Breaking of Bread, instituted in the upper room on Christ's betrayal night, to be the weekly remembrance feast enjoined on all true Christians. They celebrate the supper in utmost simplicity. Among \"closed\" Brethren assemblies usually any one of the brothers gives thanks for the loaf and the cup. In conservative \"open\" Brethren assemblies usually two different brothers give thanks, one for the loaf and the other for the cup. In liberal \"open\" Brethren assemblies (or churches/community chapels, etc.) sisters also participate with audible prayer.\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\nThe [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses]] views the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper as symbolically representing and commemorating the sinless body and blood of the [[Messiah|Messiah Jesus]], the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]].  They don't consider that the elements become supernaturally altered, or that Christ's actual physical presence is literally in the bread and wine per se, but that the elements (which they generally call \"emblems\") are commemorative and symbolic, and are consecrated for the Lord's Supper observance, and are figurative of the body and blood of Christ, as the true \"[[Passover Lamb|Lamb of God]]\" who died once for all, and view the celebration as an anti-typical fulfillment of the ancient [[Jewish Passover]] celebration, which memorialized the freeing and rescuing of God's covenant people [[Ancient Israel|Israel]] from painful bondage to sinful Egypt.   The Witnesses commemorate Christ's death as a [[ransom sacrifice|ransom]] or [[propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] by observing a Memorial annually on the evening that corresponds to the Passover,<ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 265.</ref> [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], according to the ancient [[Jewish calendar]].<ref>''Insight On The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 392.</ref> They refer to this observance generally as \"the Lord's Evening Meal\" or the \"Memorial of Christ's Death\", taken from Jesus' words to his Apostles \"do this as a memorial of me\". (Luke 22:19)<ref>[https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers \u2013 Luke 22] \"This do in remembrance of me.\u2014Literally, ''as My memorial,'' or, ''as your memorial of Me.''\" \u2013 Retrieved October 18, 2019.</ref>  They believe that this is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.<ref>\"Jehovah is a God of Covenants\", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1998, p. 8, \"Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians\u2014the Memorial of his death.\"</ref>\n\nOf those who attend the Memorial a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only [[144,000#Jehovah's Witnesses|144,000]] people will receive heavenly salvation and immortal life and thus spend eternity with God and Christ in heaven, with glorified bodies, as under-priests and co-rulers under [[Christ the King]] and [[High priest#Christianity|High Priest]], in [[God's Kingdom|Jehovah's Kingdom]]. Paralleling the [[anointing]] of kings and priests, they are referred to as the \"anointed\" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine.  They believe that the baptized \"[[other sheep]]\" of Christ's flock, or the \"[[Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The 'other sheep' and the 'great crowd'|great crowd]]\", also benefit from the [[ransom sacrifice]], and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord's Supper remembrance at these special meetings of Jehovah's witnesses, with hope of receiving salvation, through Christ's atoning sacrifice, which is memorialized by the Lord's Evening Meal, and with the hope of obtaining everlasting life in Paradise restored on a prophesied \"[[New Earth (Christianity)|New Earth]]\", under Christ as Redeemer and Ruler.<ref name=jwbh>{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005155|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=207}}</ref>\n\nThe Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed at Calvary and redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as \"emblems\") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]]; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply sacred symbolisms and representations, denoting what was used in the first Lord's Supper, and which figuratively represent the ransom sacrifice of Jesus and sacred realities.<ref name=jwbh /><ref>\"Discerning What We Are \u2013 At Memorial Time\", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.</ref>\n\n===Quakers===\n*primary theological development from the 17th century\n*Eucharistic theology: suspension/[[Memorialism]]\n*\"The bread and wine remind us of Jesus' body and blood.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.request.org.uk/main/dowhat/communion/communion02.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316024210/http://www.request.org.uk/main/dowhat/communion/communion02.htm |archive-date=16 March 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Quakers understand all of life as being sacramental and thus do not practice baptism or holy communion. \"We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and in communion with that Spirit.

It is viewed as a renewal of the covenant made at [[baptism]], which is to take upon oneself the name of Jesus. As such, it is considered efficacious only for baptized members in good standing. However, the unbaptized are not forbidden from communion, and it is traditional for children not yet baptized (baptism occurs only after the age of eight) to participate in communion in anticipation of baptism. Those who partake of the Sacrament promise always to remember Jesus and keep his commandments. The prayer also asks God the Father that each individual will be blessed with the Spirit of Christ.<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|20|75|79}} (see also {{lds|Moroni|moro|4|3}}, {{lds|Moroni|moro|5|2}})</ref>\n\nThe Sacrament is offered weekly and all active members are taught to prepare to partake of each opportunity. It is considered to be a weekly renewal of a member's commitment to follow Jesus Christ, and a plea for forgiveness of sins.\n\nThe Latter Day Saints do not believe in any kind of literal presence. They view the bread and water as symbolic of the body and blood of Christ. Currently [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] uses water instead of wine. Early in their history the Sacrament wine was often purchased from enemies of the church. To remove any opportunity for poisoned or unfit wine for use in the Sacrament, it is believed a revelation from the Lord was given that stated \"it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory\u2014remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.\"<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|27|2}}</ref> After this time water was permitted in place of wine, but the church continued to use wine for the sacrament until the early 20th century. As the church's prohibition on alcohol became solidified in the early 20th century, water became the liquid of choice for the Sacrament, although in situations where clean water and/or fresh bread is unavailable the closest equivalent may be used.\n\n=== Seventh-day Adventists ===\nThe [[Seventh-day Adventists]] believe that the Lord's Supper is \"a participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour.\" In the communion service \"Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people.\"<ref>[[28 Fundamentals|28 Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists]]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Origin of the Eucharist]]\n*[[Anglican Eucharistic theology]]\n*[[Eucharistic discipline]]\n*[[Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology]]\n*[[Typology (theology)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Borgen, Ole E.

It exists exclusively in [[Christianity]] and related religions, as others generally do not contain a Eucharistic ceremony.\n\nIn the [[Gospel]] accounts of Jesus' earthly ministry, a crowd of listeners challenges him regarding the rain of manna before he delivers the famous [[Bread of Life Discourse]] ({{bibleverse||John|6:22\u201359|RSV}}), and he describes himself as the \"True Bread from [[Heaven]]\".<ref>''The Gospel According to John: A Literary and Theological Commentary'' by Thomas L. Brodie 1997 {{ISBN|0-19-511811-1}} p. 266</ref> The aforementioned Bread of Life Discourse occurs in the [[Gospel of John]], {{Bibleverse-nb||John|6:30\u201359|KJV}}. Therein, Jesus promises to give His Flesh and Blood, which will give eternal life to all who receive It.  In John 6:53 (RSV), Jesus says, \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.\"  And continues, (v. 54\u201355) \"he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed and my blood is drink indeed.\"  Every year, the nation of Israel celebrated the Passover Meal, remembering and celebrating their liberation from captivity in Egypt.  It was at the Passover that Jesus Christ celebrated the Last Supper with his Apostles.\n\n[[Saint Paul (apostle)|Saint Paul]] in his [[First Letter to the Corinthians]] ({{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:23\u201326|KJV}}) and the [[Synoptic Gospels]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|26:26\u201328|KJV}}), [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|14:22\u201324|KJV}}), and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:19\u201320|KJV}}) state that Jesus, in the course of the [[Last Supper]] on the night before his [[death and resurrection of Jesus|death and resurrection]], [[Last Supper#Institution of the Eucharist|said]]: \"This is my body\", and \"This is my blood\". For instance, Matthew recounts: \"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body; And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.\" The [[Gospel of John]], on the other hand, makes no mention of this.

However, debates over Eucharistic theology in the West have centered not on the personal aspects of Christ's presence but on the metaphysical. The opposing views are summarized below.\n\n===Real presence===\n{{main article|Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist}}\n\n====Transubstantiation====\n{{Main article|Transubstantiation|Eucharist in the Catholic Church}}\nThe [[Substance theory|substance]] (fundamental reality) of the bread and wine is changed in a way beyond human comprehension into that of the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ, but the [[accident (philosophy)|accidents]] (physical traits, including chemical properties) of the bread and wine remain.  This view is taught by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], including its Eastern Rites.\n\n====Definitive change====\nEastern Orthodox Christians generally prefer not to be tied down by the specifics of the defined doctrine of transubstantiation, though they all agree with the definition's conclusion about the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]]. They prefer simply to use the term \"change\" (Greek: \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae), as in the [[epiclesis]] of the [[Divine Liturgy]], to describe the change of the bread and wine into the actual [[Body of Christ|Body]] and [[Blood of Christ]].<ref>{{Cite book|last = Ware|first = Timothy|author-link = Timothy Ware|title = The Orthodox Church|place = London|publisher = Penguin Books|year = 1964|pages = [https://archive.org/details/orthodoxchurchac00ware/page/290 290ff]|isbn = 0-14-020592-6|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/orthodoxchurchac00ware/page/290}}</ref> (See \"[[Eucharistic theology#Objective reality.2C silence about technicalities|Objective reality, silence about technicalities]]\", below.)

This view approaches the \"pious silence\" view in its unwillingness to specify how the Holy Spirit makes Christ present, but positively excludes not just symbolism but also trans- and con-substantiation.

Christ is not present in the sacrament, except in the minds and hearts of the communicants.

Bullinger]], Cornelius R. Stam, and others.\n\n==Efficacy of the rite==\n{{Main article|Ex opere operato}}\nEastern and Western eucharistic traditions generally agree with St. [[Augustine of Hippo]] in teaching that the efficacy of the sacraments as a means of divine grace does not depend on the worthiness of the priest or minister administering them. Augustine developed this concept in his controversy with the [[Donatists]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|title=A History of Christian Thought, volume 2|publisher=Nashville:Abingdon Press|year=1987|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> In traditional Christianity, the efficacy and validity of the sacrament does, however, depend on properly ordained [[bishop]]s and [[priest (Christianity)|priests]] with a lineage from the Apostles, a doctrine called \"[[apostolic succession]]\".\n\n==Theologies of different churches==\n\n\n===Roman Catholic Church===\n{{Main article|Eucharist in the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:Missa tridentina 002.jpg|270px|right|thumb|Elevation of the Eucharist at a [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]] Catholic Mass]]\n\nIn the [[Catholic Church]], the Communion bread is fervently revered in view of the Church's doctrine that, when bread and wine are consecrated during the Eucharistic celebration, they cease to be bread and wine and become the body and blood of Christ. The empirical appearances continue to exist unchanged, but the reality is changed by the power of the Holy Spirit, Who has been called down upon the bread and wine.  The separate consecrations of the bread (known as the [[sacramental bread|host]]) and of the wine symbolizes the separation of Jesus' body from his blood at Calvary. However, since He has risen, the Church teaches that His Body and Blood are no longer actually separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or other minister) says \"The Body of Christ\" when administering the host and \"The Blood of Christ\" when presenting the chalice, the [[communicant]] who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire, body and blood, soul and divinity.<ref>[http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm Council of Trent, Session XIII, canon 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211215226/http://history.hanover.edu/early/trent/ct13ce.htm |date=11 February 2008 }};[http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt1art3.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1390]; [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04175a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', Communion under Both Kinds]</ref> This belief is succinctly summarised in St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]' hymn, ''[[Adoro Te Devote]]''.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01154b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia, article \"Adoro Te Devote\"]</ref>\n\nThe mysterious<ref>The Roman Catholic Church holds that no explanation is possible about ''how'' the change from bread and wine to the body and blood of Christ is brought about, and limits itself to teaching ''what'' is changed: \"The signs of bread and wine become, ''in a way surpassing understanding'', the Body and Blood of Christ\" ([https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P3Z.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1333], emphasis added).</ref> change of the reality of the bread and wine began to be called \"transubstantiation\" in the 11th century.

Orthodox [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]] affirm the real presence in the [[Sacred Mysteries]] ([[consecrated]] bread and wine) which they believe to be the actual Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. The Eucharist is normally received in the context of the Divine Liturgy. The bread and wine are believed to become the genuine Body and Blood of Christ [[Jesus]] through the operation of the Holy Spirit. The Eastern Orthodox Church has never described exactly ''how'' this occurs, or gone into the detail that the Roman Catholic Church has with the doctrine of [[transubstantiation]]. This doctrine was formulated after the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] took place, and the Eastern Orthodox churches have never formally affirmed or denied it, preferring to state simply that it is a \"Mystery\",<ref>Ware pp. 283\u2013285</ref> while at the same time using, as in the 1672 Synod of Jerusalem, language that might look similar as to one that is used by the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>For instance, \"after the consecration of the bread and of the wine, there no longer remaineth the substance of the bread and of the wine, but the Body Itself and the Blood of the Lord, under the species and form of bread and wine; that is to say, under the accidents of the bread\" ([http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html Chapter VI of ''Acts and Decrees of the Synod of Jerusalem''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012149/http://catholicity.elcore.net/ConfessionOfDositheus.html |date=27 September 2011 }}).</ref>\n\nThe [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphora]] (Eucharistic prayer) contains an [[Anamnesis (Christianity)|anamnesis]] (lit. \"making present\") which not only recounts the historical facts of Jesus' death and resurrection, but actually makes them present, forming an undivided link to the one unique event on [[Calvary]]. The Anaphora ends with an [[epiclesis]] (\"calling down from on high\") during which the [[priest]] invokes the [[Holy Spirit]] to come and \"change\" the Gifts (elements of bread and wine) into the actual Body and Blood of Christ. The Orthodox do not link the moment the Gifts change to the [[Words of Institution]], or indeed to any one particular moment. They merely affirm that the change is ''completed'' at the Epiclesis.\n\nCommunion is given only to baptized, chrismated Orthodox Christians who have prepared by fasting, prayer, and confession (different rules apply for children, elderly, sick, pregnant, etc. and are determined on a case-by-case basis by parish priests). The priest administers the Gifts with a spoon directly into the recipient's mouth from the chalice.<ref>Ware p. 287</ref> From baptism young infants and children are carried to the chalice to receive Holy Communion.<ref>Ware p. 279</ref>\n\nThe holy gifts reserved for the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] or communion of the sick are specially consecrated as needed, especially on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]]. They are kept in an elaborately decorated [[Church tabernacle#Eastern Orthodox Church|tabernacle]], a container on the altar often in the shape of a church or of a dove. Generally, Eastern Christians do not adore the consecrated bread outside the Liturgy itself. However, they prostrate to the ground during the transfer of the Holy Gifts during the Presanctified Liturgy (the \"Entrance\"), as a sign of utmost reverence. After the Eucharist has been given to the congregation, the priest or the deacon has to consume the Holy Gifts that are left.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:Icon last supper.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian icon]] of the [[Last Supper]] (1497)]]\n\nIn the Orthodox Churches, the Eucharistic celebration is known as the Divine Liturgy and is believed to impart the actual Body and Blood of Christ to the faithful. In the act of communion, the entire Church\u2014past, present, and even future\u2014is united in eternity. In Orthodox Eucharistic theology, although many separate Divine Liturgies may be celebrated, there is only one Bread and one Cup throughout all the world and throughout all time.\n\nThe most perfect expression of the Eucharistic unity of the church is found in the Hierarchical Divine Liturgy (i.e., a Liturgy at which a [[bishop]] is the chief celebrant), for as St. [[Ignatius of Antioch]] stated, where the bishop is, surrounded by his clergy and faithful, there is the church in all of her fullness.\n\n=== Anglican Church ===\n{{Main article|Anglican Eucharistic theology}}\n\nThe historical position of the [[Church of England]] is found in the ''[[Thirty-Nine Articles]]'' of 1571, which state \"the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ\"; and likewise that \"the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ\" (Articles of Religion, Article XXVIII: Of the Lord's Supper) and that \"Transubstantiation is repugnant to Holy Writ\". However, the Articles also state that adoration, or worship ''per se,'' of the consecrated elements was not commanded by Christ. It also stated that those who receive unworthily do not actually receive Christ but rather their own condemnation.\n\nAnglicans generally and officially believe in the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in the Eucharist, but the specifics of belief regarding the manner of His presence range from a belief in the [[Anglican_eucharistic_theology#Corporeal_presence|corporeal presence]], sometimes but not always affirming Eucharistic adoration (mainly [[Anglo-Catholics]]),<ref name=\"Poulson1999\">{{cite book|last=Poulson|first=Christine|title=The Quest for the Grail: Arthurian Legend in British Art, 1840\u20131920|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0719055379|page=40|quote=By the late 1840s Anglo-Catholic interest in the revival of ritual had given new life to doctrinal debate over the nature of the Eucharist.

Of particular note here is the Church's unequivocal recognition of the anamnesis as more than just a memorial but, rather, a ''re-presentation'' of Christ Jesus:\n\n::Holy Communion is remembrance, commemoration, and memorial, but this remembrance is much more than simply intellectual recalling. \"Do this in remembrance of me\" ({{bibleverse||Luke|22:19}}; {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:24\u201325}}) is ''anamnesis'' (the biblical Greek word). This dynamic action becomes re-presentation of past gracious acts of God in the present, so powerfully as to make them truly present now.

Of the Sacraments.|Westminster Confession of Faith Ch. XXVII Sec. 7]]</ref> The elements are spiritual nourishment in Christ by faith. According to John Calvin,\n\n:The sum is, that the flesh and blood of Christ feed our souls just as bread and wine maintain and support our corporeal life. For there would be no aptitude in the sign, did not our souls find their nourishment in Christ. [...] I hold...that the sacred mystery of the Supper consists of two things\u2014the corporeal signs, which, presented to the eye, represent invisible things in a manner adapted to our weak capacity, and the spiritual truth, which is at once figured and exhibited by the signs.<ref name=\"Calvin\">Calvin, [[Institutes of the Christian Religion]], book 4, chapter 17, points 10\u201311 [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.vi.xviii.html]</ref>\n\nFollowing a phrase of Augustine, the Calvinist view is that \"no one bears away from this Sacrament more than is gathered with the vessel of faith.\" \"The flesh and blood of Christ are no less truly given to the unworthy than to God's elect believers\", Calvin said.  Faith, not a mere mental apprehension, and the work of the Holy Spirit, are necessary for the partaker to behold God incarnate, and in the same sense touch Christ with their hands; so that by eating and drinking of bread and wine Christ's actual presence penetrates to the heart of the believer more nearly than food swallowed with the mouth can enter in.<ref name =\"Calvin\"/>  The 'experience' of Eucharist, or the Lord's Supper, has traditionally been spoken of in the following way: the faithful believers are 'lifted up' by the power of the Holy Spirit to feast with Christ in heaven.  The Lord's Supper in this way is truly a 'Spiritual' experience as the Holy Spirit is directly involved in the action of 'eucharist'.\n\nThe Calvinist/Reformed view also places great emphasis on the action of the community as the Body of Christ.  As the faith community participates in the action of celebrating the Lord's Supper they are 'transformed' into the Body of Christ, or 'reformed' into the Body of Christ each time they participate in this sacrament.  In this sense it has been said that the term \"transubstantiation\" can be applied to the Faith Community (the Church) itself being transformed into the real Body and Blood of Christ truly present in the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nAlthough Calvin rejected adoration of the Eucharistic bread and wine as \"idolatry\" later Reformed Christians have argued otherwise. Leftover elements may be disposed of without ceremony (or reused in later services); they are unchanged, and as such the meal directs attention toward Christ's bodily resurrection and return.<ref name =\"Calvin\"/>\n\nChristians in the [[Presbyterian Church U.S.A.]] and some Christians in the [[United Church of Christ]] would reverently endorse this view.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nTheology in the [[Mainline Protestant|mainline]] branch of this tradition is in flux, and recent agreements between these denominations and the [[Lutheran]]s have stressed that: \"The theological diversity within our common confession provides both the complementarity needed for a full and adequate witness to the gospel (mutual affirmation) and the corrective reminder that every theological approach is a partial and incomplete witness to the Gospel (mutual admonition) (A Common Calling, p. 66).\" Hence, in seeking to come to consensus about the Real Presence, the churches have written:\n::\"During the Reformation both Reformed and Lutheran Churches exhibited an evangelical intention when they understood the Lord's Supper in the light of the saving act of God in Christ. Despite this common intention, different terms and concepts were employed which. . . led to mutual misunderstanding and misrepresentation. Properly interpreted, the differing terms and concepts were often complementary rather than contradictory (Marburg Revisited, pp. 103\u2013104);\"\n:and further:\n::\"In the Lord's Supper the risen Christ imparts himself in body and blood, given up for all, through his word of promise with bread and wine....we proclaim the death of Christ through which God has reconciled the world with himself. We proclaim the presence of the risen Lord in our midst. Rejoicing that the Lord has come to us, we await his future coming in glory....Both of our communions, we maintain, need to grow in appreciation of our diverse eucharistic traditions, finding mutual enrichment in them.

In their understanding of the Reformed tradition, the participation in this sacrament should follow the sacrament of baptism. Just as humans need food and drink for nurture and sustenance, Calvin wrote that the Holy Meal of Lord's Supper is God's way of providing for the maintenance of sinful humans during the whole course of their lives after they have been received into God's family, in what Presbyterians call \"the Covenant Community\".<ref>David McKay \u2013 [https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/covenant-community/ Covenant Community] \u2013 ''ligonier.org.''

It is a primal physical act in the Church that signifies a spiritual relationship between personal beings.  And this is what the Eucharist is in Presbyterian understanding.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nAccording to Presbyterian Eucharistic theology, there's not actual \"transubstantiation\" in the bread and wine, but that Jesus is spiritually present in the elements of the Eucharist, authentically present in the non-atom-based substance, with which they believe that he is [[Consubstantiality|con-substantial]] with God in the [[Trinity]].   They teach that Christ is genuinely there in the elements of the Lord's Supper to be received by them, and not just in their memories.    So that it is both a memorial and a presence of Christ.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nThey teach that receiving the Communion elements is taking the symbolic representation of the broken body and shed blood of Jesus into the inmost being, receiving the Jesus who died for our forgiveness and transformation. That humans depend on these elements for their very life and salvation.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nPresbyterians believe that the Word of God should be read, proclaimed and enacted in the Lord's Supper as an integral part of worship. The relationship of Word and Sacrament can be understood in the context of the Emmaus Road narrative (Luke 24:13ff). While there are various interpretations of this account, the Presbyterian Church interprets the \u201cbreaking of bread\u201d in Luke 24 as  a reference to the Lord's Supper.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\nMany Presbyterian churches use unfermented grape juice for Communion, which is of relatively recent practice, starting in the late 19th century or in the past one hundred years, out of concern for drunkenness and also because some congregants view any alcohol as \"sinful\", so to accommodate their consciences grape juice is utilized in most Presbyterian churches instead.  But  recently some individual Presbyterian churches have gone back to using actual fermented wine as Christ used and commanded.  Noting that wine in itself is not sinful, but that Christ made and drank it, etc., and that only excessive drinking of wine and actual drunkenness are wrong and sinful.<ref>Jack Lash \u2013 [https://www.gpcweb.org/why-do-we-use-wine-in-communion- Why Do We Use Wine in Communion? ] Gainsevill Presbyterian Church, PCA. Retrieved December 23, 2019.</ref>  \n\nThe Directory for Worship in the Presbyterian [[Book of Order]] encourages the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of frequent celebrations of the Lord's Supper. A few Presbyterian congregations have begun celebrations of the sacrament as often as each Lord's Day (or Sunday) and on other occasions of special significance in the life of the Christian community. And also on Presbyterian \"liturgical seasons\", such as \"Holy Week\" and \"Easter\", the Lord's Supper is especially celebrated and observed in Presbyterian churches.<ref>[https://www.presbyterianmission.org/ministries/worship/faq/faq-christianyear/ The Christian Year] - \"What are the liturgical seasons?\" ''PresbyterianMission.org.'' Retrieved January 27, 2020.</ref> But frequency alone is not the basic issue in Presbyterianism. Some believe that they need to restore the Biblical pattern of the Lord's Supper on each Sunday to provide a disciplined reminder of a divine act that will help centralize and \u201cre-focus\u201d the rhythm of people's daily lives.<ref name=\"Presbyterian Mission Communion\"/>\n\n===Baptist Churches===\n[[Reformed Baptists]], in agreement with Presbyterians and other Reformed Churches, hold to the doctrine of [[Pneumatic presence]]. The doctrine is articulated in the [[1689 Baptist Confession of Faith]] and the [[Keach's Catechism|Catechism]]. It holds that the Lord's Supper to be a means of \"spiritual nourishment and growth\", stating:<ref name=\"CrossThompson2007\"/>\n{{quote|The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches, unto the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and showing to all the world the sacrifice of himself in his death, confirmation of the faith of believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment, and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all duties which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.<ref name=\"CrossThompson2007\">{{cite book|last1=Cross|first1=Anthony R.|last2=Thompson|first2=Philip E.|title=Baptist Sacramentalism|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers|language=English|isbn=9781597527439|page=182}}</ref>}}\n\nIndependent Baptists hold to the [[Eucharist#Fundamental Independent Baptist (Hyles typology): Relational Presence|Relational Presence]]\n\nThe [[American Baptist Churches USA]], a mainline Baptist denomination, believes that \"The bread and cup that symbolize the broken body and shed blood offered by Christ remind us today of God's great love for us...\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc-usa.org/identity/bible.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417142835/http://www.abc-usa.org/identity/bible.html |archive-date=17 April 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Zwinglianism ===\n{{Main article|Memorialism}}\n\nSome Protestant groups regard the Eucharist (also called the Lord's Supper or the Lord's Table) as a symbolic meal, a [[Memorialism|memorial]] of the Last Supper and the Passion in which nothing miraculous occurs. This view is known as the Zwinglian view, after Huldrych Zwingli, a Church leader in [[Zurich, Switzerland]] during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. It is commonly associated with the United Church of Christ, Baptists, the [[Disciples of Christ]] and the [[Mennonite]]s. Elements left over from the service may be discarded without any formal ceremony, or if feasible may be retained for use in future services.\n\nThe successor of Zwingli in Zurich, [[Heinrich Bullinger]], came to an agreement theologically with John Calvin. The [https://web.archive.org/web/20091002220509/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Tigurinus/tigur-bvd.htm Consensus Tigurinus] lays out an explanation of the doctrine of the Sacraments in general, and specifically, that of Holy Communion, as the view embraced by John Calvin and leaders of the Church of Zurich who followed Zwingli. It demonstrates that at least the successors of Zwingli held to the real spiritual presence view most commonly attributed to Calvin and Reformed [[Protestantism]].\n\nThe [[Plymouth Brethren]] hold the Lord's Supper, or the Breaking of Bread, instituted in the upper room on Christ's betrayal night, to be the weekly remembrance feast enjoined on all true Christians. They celebrate the supper in utmost simplicity. Among \"closed\" Brethren assemblies usually any one of the brothers gives thanks for the loaf and the cup. In conservative \"open\" Brethren assemblies usually two different brothers give thanks, one for the loaf and the other for the cup. In liberal \"open\" Brethren assemblies (or churches/community chapels, etc.) sisters also participate with audible prayer.\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\nThe [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses]] views the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper as symbolically representing and commemorating the sinless body and blood of the [[Messiah|Messiah Jesus]], the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]].  They don't consider that the elements become supernaturally altered, or that Christ's actual physical presence is literally in the bread and wine per se, but that the elements (which they generally call \"emblems\") are commemorative and symbolic, and are consecrated for the Lord's Supper observance, and are figurative of the body and blood of Christ, as the true \"[[Passover Lamb|Lamb of God]]\" who died once for all, and view the celebration as an anti-typical fulfillment of the ancient [[Jewish Passover]] celebration, which memorialized the freeing and rescuing of God's covenant people [[Ancient Israel|Israel]] from painful bondage to sinful Egypt.   The Witnesses commemorate Christ's death as a [[ransom sacrifice|ransom]] or [[propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] by observing a Memorial annually on the evening that corresponds to the Passover,<ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 265.</ref> [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]], according to the ancient [[Jewish calendar]].<ref>''Insight On The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 392.</ref> They refer to this observance generally as \"the Lord's Evening Meal\" or the \"Memorial of Christ's Death\", taken from Jesus' words to his Apostles \"do this as a memorial of me\". (Luke 22:19)<ref>[https://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/luke/22.htm Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers \u2013 Luke 22] \"This do in remembrance of me.\u2014Literally, ''as My memorial,'' or, ''as your memorial of Me.''\" \u2013 Retrieved October 18, 2019.</ref>  They believe that this is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.<ref>\"Jehovah is a God of Covenants\", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1998, p. 8, \"Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians\u2014the Memorial of his death.\"</ref>\n\nOf those who attend the Memorial a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only [[144,000#Jehovah's Witnesses|144,000]] people will receive heavenly salvation and immortal life and thus spend eternity with God and Christ in heaven, with glorified bodies, as under-priests and co-rulers under [[Christ the King]] and [[High priest#Christianity|High Priest]], in [[God's Kingdom|Jehovah's Kingdom]]. Paralleling the [[anointing]] of kings and priests, they are referred to as the \"anointed\" class and are the only ones who should partake of the bread and wine.  They believe that the baptized \"[[other sheep]]\" of Christ's flock, or the \"[[Jehovah's Witnesses and salvation#The 'other sheep' and the 'great crowd'|great crowd]]\", also benefit from the [[ransom sacrifice]], and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord's Supper remembrance at these special meetings of Jehovah's witnesses, with hope of receiving salvation, through Christ's atoning sacrifice, which is memorialized by the Lord's Evening Meal, and with the hope of obtaining everlasting life in Paradise restored on a prophesied \"[[New Earth (Christianity)|New Earth]]\", under Christ as Redeemer and Ruler.<ref name=jwbh>{{cite book|title=What Does the Bible Really Teach?|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1102005155|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=207}}</ref>\n\nThe Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation and viewing among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread symbolizes and represents Jesus Christ's perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed at Calvary and redeems fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as \"emblems\") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]]; so not a literal presence of flesh and blood in the emblems, but that the emblems are simply sacred symbolisms and representations, denoting what was used in the first Lord's Supper, and which figuratively represent the ransom sacrifice of Jesus and sacred realities.<ref name=jwbh /><ref>\"Discerning What We Are \u2013 At Memorial Time\", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.</ref>\n\n===Quakers===\n*primary theological development from the 17th century\n*Eucharistic theology: suspension/[[Memorialism]]\n*\"The bread and wine remind us of Jesus' body and blood.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.request.org.uk/main/dowhat/communion/communion02.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=3 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316024210/http://www.request.org.uk/main/dowhat/communion/communion02.htm |archive-date=16 March 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Quakers understand all of life as being sacramental and thus do not practice baptism or holy communion. \"We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit and in communion with that Spirit.

It is viewed as a renewal of the covenant made at [[baptism]], which is to take upon oneself the name of Jesus. As such, it is considered efficacious only for baptized members in good standing. However, the unbaptized are not forbidden from communion, and it is traditional for children not yet baptized (baptism occurs only after the age of eight) to participate in communion in anticipation of baptism. Those who partake of the Sacrament promise always to remember Jesus and keep his commandments. The prayer also asks God the Father that each individual will be blessed with the Spirit of Christ.<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|20|75|79}} (see also {{lds|Moroni|moro|4|3}}, {{lds|Moroni|moro|5|2}})</ref>\n\nThe Sacrament is offered weekly and all active members are taught to prepare to partake of each opportunity. It is considered to be a weekly renewal of a member's commitment to follow Jesus Christ, and a plea for forgiveness of sins.\n\nThe Latter Day Saints do not believe in any kind of literal presence. They view the bread and water as symbolic of the body and blood of Christ. Currently [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] uses water instead of wine. Early in their history the Sacrament wine was often purchased from enemies of the church. To remove any opportunity for poisoned or unfit wine for use in the Sacrament, it is believed a revelation from the Lord was given that stated \"it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory\u2014remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.\"<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|27|2}}</ref> After this time water was permitted in place of wine, but the church continued to use wine for the sacrament until the early 20th century. As the church's prohibition on alcohol became solidified in the early 20th century, water became the liquid of choice for the Sacrament, although in situations where clean water and/or fresh bread is unavailable the closest equivalent may be used.\n\n=== Seventh-day Adventists ===\nThe [[Seventh-day Adventists]] believe that the Lord's Supper is \"a participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour.\" In the communion service \"Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people.\"<ref>[[28 Fundamentals|28 Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists]]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Origin of the Eucharist]]\n*[[Anglican Eucharistic theology]]\n*[[Eucharistic discipline]]\n*[[Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology]]\n*[[Typology (theology)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Borgen, Ole E.

As a [[Metropolitan archbishop|metropolitan]] church, it has as suffragans: Acqui, Alba, Aosta, Asti, Cuneo, Fossano, Ivrea, Mondov\u00ec, Pinerolo, Saluzzo and Susa.<ref>Diocesi di Torino, [http://www.diocesi.torino.it/diocesi/ ''Diocesi: Storia'']; retrieved: 9 July 2018. {{in lang|it}}</ref> Its [[mother church]] is the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist (Turin)|Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist]].\n\nSince 2010 the [[Archbishop]] of [[Turin]] has been [[Cesare Nosiglia]].\n\n==History==\nThe earliest bishop of Turin whose name has survived was [[Maximus of Turin|St Maximus]]. Fedele Savio, in fact, argues that Maximus was the first bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 285-286: ''Ma niuna memoria essendo rimasta di vescovi anteriori a S. Massimo e l'episcopato di questo Santo non potendosi protrarre molto in su nel secolo IV, noi incliniamo a credere che l'episcopato di Torino fosse instituto insieme con quello di Novara nel 398, oppure verso questo tempo''.</ref> Maximus, many of whose [[homily|homilies]] are extant, died between 408 and 423.<ref>Savio, pp. 283-294, at p. 293. Semeria, pp. 24-26.</ref>\n\nBishop Ursicinus (569-609) underwent captivity and loss of his property at the hands of the [[Franks]]. [[Pope Gregory I]] complained to Bishop Syagrius of Autun that someone else was made bishop in place of Ursicinus, in violation of Canon Law, and Ursicinus' diocese was taken away from him.<ref>Savio, pp. 225-226. Kehr, p. 81, no. 1. J. P. Migne, ''Patrologia Latina'' Vol 77, p. 1045 no 115.</ref> It has been inferred that the [[Diocese of Moriana]] (Maurienne) was detached from that of Turin on this occasion.{{sfn|Herbermann|1913}}\n\nDuke Garibold of Turin, who had assassinated the Lombard King Godebert in 662, was murdered in an act of revenge, in the Baptistry of S. Giovanni il Battisto in the Cathedral of Turin.<ref>Rondolino, p. 10, citing Paul the Deacon at p. 23 note 10. Semeria, p. 50.</ref>\n\nOther bishops were: [[Claudius of Turin]] (817-27), a copious and controversial writer, famous for his opposition to the veneration of images;<ref name=\"ODCC\">{{harvnb|Cross|Livingstone|1997|p=359}}</ref> Regimirus (of uncertain date, in the 9th century), who established a rule of common life among his canons; [[Amulo]] (880-98), who incurred the ill-will of the Turinese and was driven out by them; [[Gezo (bishop of Turin)|Gezo]] (1000), who founded the monastery of San Solutore in Turin; [[Landulf (bishop of Turin)|Landulf]] (1037), who founded the Abbey of [[Cavour (TO)|Cavour]] and repaired the damage inflicted on his Church by the [[Saracen]] incursions; [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080), to whom [[Peter Damian|St Peter Damian]] wrote a letter (''Epistolae'' IV.iii) exhorting him to repress the laxity of his clergy in matters of clerical celibacy; [[Boso of Sant'Anastasia|Boso]] (1122\u2013c.1127), who resigned as a cardinal to become bishop.\n\nIn 1074 Bishop [[Cunibert of Turin]] (1046\u20131080) was summoned by [[Pope Gregory VII]] to attend a synod which was announced for 30 November in that year. One of the matters to be treated was the controversy between Cunibert and Abbot Benedict of S. Michele di Chiusa.<ref>{{cite book|author=H. E. J. Cowdrey|title=Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9SG3pEWGfkC&pg=PA66|date=20 August 1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-158459-6|pages=66, 282\u2013283}} The controversy had already involved [[Pope Alexander II]], according to William of Chiusa, the biographer of Abbot Benedict: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores'' [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_1925-1933__MGH__1_Scriptores._SS_12._Historiae_Aevi_Salici__LT.pdf.html Tomus XII] (Hannover: Hahn 1856), p. 204.</ref> The Bishop claimed that the monastery was situated on allodial property of the diocese, and therefore the bishop had the right to install the abbot and collect the [[Tithe|''decima'' tax]]. On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83. Kehr, pp. 82-84, nos. 7-13.</ref>\n\n===Two episcopal 'elections'===\nIn 1243, Bishop Hugo (Uguccione) de Cagnola (1231\u20131243) abdicated the bishopric of Turin and became a [[Cistercian]]. Before he retired to a monastery (the house of the Cistercians in Genoa) though, he was required to administer his diocese until a successor was elected. On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from metropolitan obedience of Milan, and made Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism. Archbishop [[Girolamo della Rovere]], in 1566, engaged in a public disputation with the Protestants of the Piedmont and was victorious, which was greeted with great satisfaction by the Duke. In 1567, he conducted a visitation of the valley of the Stura, and preached to and conversed with many Protestants who had come into Piedmont from France, again with some success.<ref>Semeria, p. 287.</ref> During his episcopacy, [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Duke Emanuele Filiberto]] brought to Turin from his castle in Chamb\u00e9ry the Holy [[Shroud of Turin|Shroud]], the personal property of his family, and, on 29 December 1590, the body of [[St Maurice]], the martyr.<ref>Semeria, pp. 338-341.</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the wars between France and Savoy with the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559#Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis (1559)|Peace of Cateau Cambresis]] and the French withdrawal, in 1563 the permanent principal residence of the Dukes of Savoy became the city of Turin. The university was moved from Mondov\u00ec, where it had retreated during the French occupation. A Jesuit college was opened in Turin in 1567 with an annual subsidy from the Duke, and the Jesuit Collegio dei Nobili in 1572.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aldo Scaglione|title=The Liberal Arts and the Jesuit College System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dD09hNd79pIC&pg=PA138|year=1986|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|location=Amsterdam-Philadelphia|isbn=90-272-2035-2|pages=137\u2013138}}</ref> In 1577, Archbishop della Rovere began the construction of the church ''Santi Martiri'' for the Jesuits in Turin.<ref>Semeria, p. 288-289.</ref>\n\nCardinal Gerolamo della Rovere (1564-1592) had the rare honor of dying while in Conclave in Rome to elect a successor to [[Pope Innocent IX]] (Facchinetti).

At the same time the [[Risorgimento]] and the operations of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] had brought about a revolution in Rome, which drove [[Pope Pius IX]] into exile. Piedmontese policy called for a reform of the rights of the Church, especially of the regular clergy. Fransoni's vocal reaction to these events and policies helped to stimulate the already widespread anticlericalism in Italy,<ref>Manuel Borutta, \"Anti-Catholicism and the Culture War in Risorgimento Italy,\" in: {{cite book|author1=S.

Bishop Guido Canale (1319\u20131348) found it necessary to completely reconstruct the Chapel of San Michele in the Cathedral, which he endowed.<ref>Semeria, p. 195.</ref>\n\nWith the old cathedral in a state of collapse, Bishop Domenico della Rovere (1482\u20131501) had the cathedral rebuilt in the 1490s, to designs by Meo (Amadeo) del Caprina da Settignano of Florence. Demolition began in May 1491. Cardinal della Rovere visited Turin in 1496 to inspect the progress of the works.

A diploma of Emperor Henry III of 1047 attributes them to Bishop Regimir in the mid-ninth century.<ref>Savio, p. 320. Semeria, pp. 406-407. Colleges of Canons were being created at cathedrals in accordance with the French Council of Aquisgranda (816) and the Roman council of [[Pope Eugene II]] (826).</ref> The Cathedral Chapter consisted of five dignities and twenty Canons and twenty prebends. The dignities were: the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, the Archpriest, and the Primicerius (Cantor). In addition there were five officials called ''Trinitatis''.<ref>Ughelli, p. 1021.</ref> The earliest known Provost was Walpert in 890.<ref>Bosio, p. 1775, who labels Walpert a 'diacono cardinale'.</ref> The earliest known Archdeacon was Ansprand, who signed a document in 863.<ref>Bosio, p. 1784.</ref> The earliest known Archpriest was Erchempert, ''Sanctae Taurinensis Ecclesiae Archipresbyter Cardinalis''.<ref>Bosio, p. 1800.</ref> The earliest known Primicerius (Cantor) was Adalwert, who signed a document in 890 ''Sancte Taurinensis Ecclesie Diaconus Cardinalis Cantor.''<ref>Bosio, p. 1805.</ref> The Provost and Primicerius subscribe a document of Bishop Milo in 1185.<ref>Chiuso, p. 435.</ref> The office of Treasurer was established by a bull of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] of 15 January 1472.<ref>Bosio, p. 1794.</ref> In 1690 there were twenty-nine Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 370 note 1.</ref> In 1744, there were six dignities and twenty Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 395 note 1.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Cathedral Chapter, there were seven Collegiate Churches in the diocese, which had Chapters of Canons. At Carmagnola there was a Chapter of an Archpriest and nine Canons. At Chieri, at S. Maria della Scala there were an Archpriest, a Cantor, and ten Canons. In Courgn\u00e8 there was a Provost and six Canons. In Giaveno, at San Lorenzo, there was a Provost and eight Canons. In Moncalieri, at Santa Maria della Scala, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost and six Canons. At Santa Maria di Rivoli, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost, an Archpriest, a Cantor, and five Canons. At Savigliano, at S. Andrea, founded in 1028, which was in charge of four parishes, there was a college of Canons Regular; [[Pope Clement XII]] secularized the Canons, who were thereafter sixteen in number (of whom one was the Penitentiary), presided over by an Abbot, an Archpriest and a Primicerius.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 72-73</ref>\n\n===Seminary===\nThe seminary of the diocese of Turin was established by Cardinal Girolamo della Rovere on 4 June 1567, in accordance with the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]]. Since 1988, the seminary has been located in a building that once belonged to the Suore Fedele Compagne di Gesu.

Cowdrey|title=Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9SG3pEWGfkC&pg=PA66|date=20 August 1998|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-158459-6|pages=66, 282\u2013283}} The controversy had already involved [[Pope Alexander II]], according to William of Chiusa, the biographer of Abbot Benedict: ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores'' [http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/04z/z_1925-1933__MGH__1_Scriptores._SS_12._Historiae_Aevi_Salici__LT.pdf.html Tomus XII] (Hannover: Hahn 1856), p. 204.</ref> The Bishop claimed that the monastery was situated on allodial property of the diocese, and therefore the bishop had the right to install the abbot and collect the [[Tithe|''decima'' tax]]. On 12 December 1074, the Pope wrote again, in considerable anger, because Cunibert had refused to attend the synod (''venire contempsit''); the Pope further advised Cunibert that another synod was going to be held toward the end of February 1075, which he was warned he must attend, and in the meantime he was to stop disturbing the monastery. When the synod took place, Cunibert was suspended from office, and in a letter of 9 April 1075 Pope Gregory again chastised him for breaking his promise and continuing to harass the monks of S. Michele. Cunibert was given until 11 November, the next synod meeting day, to reach a peaceable settlement with Abbot Benedict, or else to put in an appearance at the synod, where his case would be given final judgement. The case dragged on, however, and on 24 November 1078, after Bishop Cunibert finally appeared at the Papal Court, the Pope gave final judgement, requiring Cunibert to return whatever he had taken from the monks, and the monks likewise, under the supervision of the Bishops of Asti and Aqui and the Abbot of Fruttuaria. If the Bishop still wished to assert that the monastery had been built on land belonging to the diocese and was under his jurisdiction, he should come to the next synod and present his proofs; otherwise, he should hold his peace.<ref>Semeria, pp. 80-83.

Before he retired to a monastery (the house of the Cistercians in Genoa) though, he was required to administer his diocese until a successor was elected. On 15 November 1243, [[Pope Innocent IV]] ordered Bishop Hugo to see to the election of the Pope's Chamberlain, Nicholas, Provost of Genoa as the next Bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, p. 372. \u00c9lie Berger, ''Les registres d'Innocent IV'', Tome premier (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1884), p. 41 no. 228.</ref> On 10 May 1244, Pope Innocent ordered the Papal Legate Gregorio de Montelongo, Papal Subdeacon and Notary, to see to the election of the Abbot of San Gennaro near Trino in the diocese of Vercelli, Giovanni Arborio, as the next bishop of Turin.<ref>Savio, pp. 372-373. Berger, p. 115, no. 675.</ref>\n\n===An episcopal election===\nThe episcopal election of 1319 is unusually well-attested. Bishop Teodisius Revelli (1301\u20131319) died in the Spring of 1319. The Cathedral Chapter met on 16 May to choose his successor. One of the electors, the Primicerius Thomas de Pellizonus, was ill and was the subject of threats on the part of some disaffected citizens of Turin, and was therefore unable to attend the meeting. He sent a notarized explanation of his absence by means of two procurators, Canon Guilelmus de Cavaglata and Canon Guido de Canalibus. The electoral assembly duly took place later that day, and Canon Guido de Canalibus was elected Bishop of Turin. An electoral statement was drawn up immediately, and carried to the home of the Primicerius Thomas, who approved and ratified the election, still on 16 May. This too was written down and properly notarized. The documents indicate that Bishop Guido was the immediate successor of the late Bishop Teodisius.<ref>Chiuso, pp. 443-445. Semeria, p. 492. These documents make it clear that there was no intermediate bishop, the alleged Thomas de Sabaudia, as indicated by Eubel, I, p. 475, repeating information from Gams, p. 824. The alleged date of Bishop Teodesius' death, October 1318, is merely the date of his latest known document.</ref>\n\nBishop Guido Canale had the unenviable task of annulling the marriage of Frederick of Saluzzo and Jacobina de Blandrata in 1333, on the grounds of affinity in the third degree. The matter needed to be repaired by papal bulls of [[Pope John XXII]].<ref>Chiuso, pp. 448-453.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Turin had a palace at Pinerolo, from which numerous surviving documents have been dated.\n\n===Creation of the archdiocese===\n\nOn 21 May 1515, during the Tenth Session of the [[Fifth Lateran Council]], [[Pope Leo X]] removed the diocese of Turin from metropolitan obedience of Milan, and made Turin an archiepiscopal see with the diocese of [[diocese of Mondov\u00ec|Mondov\u00ec]] and [[diocese of Ivrea|Ivrea]] as its suffragans, other sees being added later.<ref>Semeria, p. 265.</ref> On the same day, the Pope sent a letter to Bishop [[Giovanni Francesco della Rovere]], notifying him of his promotion to the rank of archbishop, and another to the new suffragans, notifying them of the creation of the archdiocese.<ref>Ughelli, IV, pp. 1058-1060.</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century the diocese saw the rise the [[Waldensian]] sect<ref>Semeria, pp. 161-164.</ref> and of [[Calvinism]]. It is known that, in the Spring of 1536, [[John Calvin]] himself, the famous Protestant reformer, visited Aosta as he was returning to France from Ferrara. His preaching, however, brought him to the attention of Bishop Pietro Gazino of Aosta, and he was forced to flee.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jean Mary Stone|title=Reformation and Renaissance (circa 1377-1610)|url=https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog|year=1904|publisher=Duckworth and Company|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/reformationandr00stongoog/page/n345 313]}}</ref> The [[Council of Trent]] called upon bishops everywhere to attempt to restore Roman Catholicism.

At the same time the [[Risorgimento]] and the operations of [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] had brought about a revolution in Rome, which drove [[Pope Pius IX]] into exile.

Colleges of Canons were being created at cathedrals in accordance with the French Council of Aquisgranda (816) and the Roman council of [[Pope Eugene II]] (826).</ref> The Cathedral Chapter consisted of five dignities and twenty Canons and twenty prebends.

In Courgn\u00e8 there was a Provost and six Canons. In Giaveno, at San Lorenzo, there was a Provost and eight Canons. In Moncalieri, at Santa Maria della Scala, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost and six Canons. At Santa Maria di Rivoli, there was a Chapter composed of a Provost, an Archpriest, a Cantor, and five Canons. At Savigliano, at S.
