Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton and March 1, 2013 at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center. From June 21\u201330, 2013, The Wagon Wheel Theatre from June 19\u201329 wagonwheeltheatre.org, The Grand Opera House in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] will host a production.  From July 19 - August 3, 2013, it shall presented by Minnetonka Theatre, Minnetonka, MN. On September 2, 2014, 9 to 5 opened at the [[Walnut Street Theater]] in [[Philadelphia]]. The show closed on October 19 and featured [[Dee Hoty]] as Violet, [[Amy Bodnar]] as Doralee and [[Amanda Rose]] as Judy.  In 2015, a new version of the show, scaled down for a small fringe venue, was scheduled to debut in Southampton at The Stage Door, presented in association with Music Theatre South.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Act I===\nAs the clocks ring and the workers wake up, Violet, Doralee, and Judy prepare for work (\"9 to 5\"). The workers begin another mundane and hellish day at work under Franklin Hart, Jr., president of Consolidated Industries. Judy and Violet meet for the first time and Judy reveals she does not have any work experience, but Violet states she will be proud to train her and gives her a few tips and pointers for surviving office life (\"Around Here\"). Franklin Hart, Jr., is a domineering and equally lecherous man, who lusts after his secretary, Doralee, and has no shame in making those feelings known, which discomfits Doralee (\"Here for You\"). Judy is having major issues on her first day (such as being unable to work a Xerox machine) and feels there is something more inhibiting her. All three women, in separate settings, share mutual feelings, but all feel they can overcome it and make it all work out in the end (\"I Just Might\"). A new day rises upon the begrudged workers of Consolidated and life resumes as normal. Around the lunch hour, Doralee and Judy speak for the first time as Doralee asks Judy to go to lunch with her, but Judy subtly refuses and Doralee doesn't know why. She then reflects on her whole life, about just being a pretty face and nothing much more (\"[[Backwoods Barbie]]\"). Violet is passed over for yet another promotion, which angers her since it is somebody that she personally trained. After a heated confrontation in Hart's office, Doralee finds out about Hart's rumor about their supposed 'affair', which infuriates her to the point of threatening him. All three of the women, who are now seemingly united in their contempt for Hart, go back to Violet's house and light up a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]]. Suddenly, each woman lapses into a murderous fantasy involving Mr. Hart; Judy as an unforgiving femme fatale (\"The Dance O' Death\"), Doralee as a crack rodeo star (\"Cowgirl's Revenge\"), and Violet as a deranged [[Snow White]] (\"Potion Notion\"). All of these sadistic fantasies soon culminate into a celebration of Hart's death, which is quickly nixed after Hart is discovered alive (\"Joy to the Girls\").\n\nThe next day at the office, Violet unwittingly acts out her fantasy and believes she put rat poison into Hart's coffee. They all go to the hospital in a panic but learn he was never there. Roz overheard the ladies in the bathroom and tells Hart, who concocts a plan to scare them by pretending he was actually poisoned and to threaten them with the police. After Hart leaves, Roz sings a song confessing her obsessive love and fantasies for him (\"Heart to Hart\"). Hart confronts Doralee with the information and Doralee, acting on a [[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]] instinct, rips the phones out and ties up Hart with the wires, which he seems to get a quasi-sexual pleasure from. The women are seemingly puzzled as to what to do with Hart, but Judy and Violet create a plan in which they will imprison Hart in his own house. As they are carrying out their plan, they sing to Hart their issues with him and the problems in their own lives but will begin to make the changes in their lives and have the confidence to succeed (\"Shine Like the Sun\"). The women, empowered, have restrained Hart to a mechanical harness above his bed.\n\n===Act II===\nAfter the [[Entr'acte]], in Hart's office, the three women are pondering on how they can keep the office in the dark about Hart's disappearance when Doralee's skill of being able to forge Hart's signature comes into play. Judy and Doralee both point out to Violet that she is, in a sense, the new [[CEO|Operating Officer]] of the company. Violet then lapses in fantasy and sings a song about she is now a hard-hitter like the rest of the male employees (who seems to rank above the women) (\"One of the Boys\"). Roz begins to get nosy and wonders where Hart actually is, which creates a new obstacle for the ladies to rid. Judy formulates the idea to send Roz to a one-month language seminar to learn French, which isn't necessary and is only a way to get rid of her. Roz receives the memo from Violet and is heartbroken because she believes that Hart doesn't like her and that the time she isn't at work is lonely and boring (\"5 to 9\"). As Hart is still strung up in his bedroom, he passes time by watching countless hours of [[soap operas]]. Doralee enters to give him a meal and Hart lashes out at her saying that he still has the control and will use it when he is free. Doralee brushes him off and leaves the room. Hart begins to recount how most of the men in history had \"downfalls\" by women and that he is no different, which angers him (\"Always a Woman\").\n\nBack at the office, the new changes the women have made under Hart's name have seemed to ease the workers' lives and changed their outlook on work (\"Change It\"). Joe, who has shown admiration toward Violet through the show, asking her out many times, confronts her and asks why she rebuffs him. She claims she was a \"one-man woman\" and that her husband's death three years before has prevented her from dating again. Joe tells her that it is time to move on and possibly give someone new a chance (\"Let Love Grow\"). Violet accepts as they walk out of the scene holding hands. Later on that evening, Judy's ex-husband, Dick, shows up at Hart's house and asks her to take him back (since his secretary girlfriend dumped him). She rebuffs him and states she is a changed woman who will not crawl back to someone who broke her heart, showing strength as she orders him to leave (\"Get Out and Stay Out\").\n\nThe next day, Hart storms into the office with Judy hostage, which shocks the women, who have collected evidence about Hart's \"[[creative accounting]]\" and embezzling practices to use against him. The women, seemingly defeated, prepare to submit to Hart's wishes when they learn that the CEO of Consolidated, Mr. Tinsworthy, is paying a visit. The women and Hart meet Tinsworthy, who, after noting the changes in office life, gives the credit to Hart. Violet and the others step up and say they made the changes, but are shot down. However, in a comedic twist, Tinsworthy sends Hart to manage the South American branch in Bolivia. Violet is then promoted to Hart's position as President of the company and a celebration ensues, while Roz is devastated over the loss of her obsession. The characters deliver epilogues about what happened after the events of the story (Finale: \"9 to 5\" Reprise). Hart was captured by natives in the jungles of Bolivia and was never seen or heard from again. Roz found a new love - Hart's wife. Violet and Joe have been together for the past 30 years and are very happy together. Doralee went to Nashville and became a successful country and western singer. Judy is single and loving it and wrote a bestselling book, ''Life Without Dick''.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n; Broadway Production \n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\" \u2013 Violet, Doralee, Dwayne, Judy and Ensemble\n* \"Around Here\" \u2013 Violet and Ensemble\n* \"Here for You\" \u2013 Franklin\n* \"I Just Might\" \u2013 Judy, Doralee and Violet\n* \"[[Backwoods Barbie]]\" \u2013 Doralee\n* \"The Dance of Death\" \u2020\u2020 \u2013 Judy, Franklin and Ensemble \n* \"Cowgirl's Revenge\" \u2020\u2020 \u2013 Doralee, Franklin and Ensemble\n* \"Potion Notion\" \u2013 \u2020\u2020 Violet, Franklin and Ensemble\n* \"Joy to the Girls\" \u2020\u2020 * \u2013 Judy, Doralee, Violet, Franklin and Ensemble\n* \"Heart to Hart\" \u2013 Roz and Ensemble\n* \"Shine Like the Sun\" \u2013 Doralee, Judy and Violet\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* Entr'acte \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"One of the Boys\" \u2013 Violet and Boys\n* \"5 to 9\" \u2013 Roz\n* \"Always a Woman\" *\u2020 \u2013 Franklin and Men's Ensemble\n* \"Change It\" * \u2013 Doralee, Violet, Judy and Ensemble\n* \"Let Love Grow\" \u2013 Joe and Violet\n* \"Get Out and Stay Out\" \u2013 Judy\n* \"Finale: 9 to 5\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n; West End Production \n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\" \u2013 Violet, Doralee, Dwayne, Judy and Ensemble\n* \"Around Here\" \u2013 Violet and Ensemble\n* \"Here for You\" \u2013 Franklin\n* \"[[Backwoods Barbie]]\" \u2013 Doralee\n* \"I Just Might\" \u2013 Judy, Doralee and Violet\n* \"Heart to Hart\" \u2013 Roz and Ensemble\n* \"Hey Boss\" \u2013 Violet, Doralee and Judy\n* \"Shine Like the Sun\" \u2013 Doralee, Judy and Violet\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* Entr'acte \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"One of the Boys\" \u2013 Violet and Boys\n* \"5 to 9\" \u2013 Roz\n* \"Always a Woman\" *\u2020 \u2013 Franklin and Men's Ensemble\n* \"Change It\" * \u2013 Doralee, Violet, Judy and Ensemble\n* \"Let Love Grow\" \u2013 Joe and Violet\n* \"Get Out and Stay Out\" \u2013 Judy\n* \"Finale: 9 to 5\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n; Notes\n\u2020 Removed for the US National Tour\n\n\u2020\u2020 Removed from the UK Tour and replaced with \"Hey Boss\"\n\n'''<nowiki>*</nowiki>''' Added to production after Los Angeles pre-Broadway run\n\n===Other songs===\nThe following songs were in the Los Angeles pre-Broadway run and have since been cut from the final version of the Broadway production.<ref>[http://www.centertheatregroup.org/uploadedFiles/Plays_and_Tickets/Productions/2008/9_to_5/files/9to5Program.pdf \"9 to 5\" LA Pre-Broadway Showbill, Ahmanson Theatre, pp1-16\"]<div class=\"sendToPdfFiller\" data-url=\"http://www.centertheatregroup.org/uploadedFiles/Plays_and_Tickets/Productions/2008/9_to_5/files/9to5Program.pdf\" style=\"left: 990.90625px; top: 5400.234375px;\" title=\"Open with PDFfiller\">[[chrome-extension://iagkheeockcficekiaacbhdmpolcgmnn/img/icon-fill.png|link=]]</div> {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135526/http://www.centertheatregroup.org/uploadedFiles/Plays_and_Tickets/Productions/2008/9_to_5/files/9to5Program.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}<div class=\"sendToPdfFiller\" data-url=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135526/http://www.centertheatregroup.org/uploadedFiles/Plays_and_Tickets/Productions/2008/9_to_5/files/9to5Program.pdf\" style=\"left: 969.75px; top: 5400.234375px;\" title=\"Open with PDFfiller\">[[chrome-extension://iagkheeockcficekiaacbhdmpolcgmnn/img/icon-fill.png|link=]]</div><span> July 19, 2011, at the </span>[[Wayback Machine]]<span>.</span>\nCenterTheatreGroup.org, accessed August 25, 2011</ref>\n\n* \"Out of Control\": This song took place during the scene where Judy is using the [[Xerox]] machine. The song begins after Violet leaves Judy alone with the copy machine, having instructed her on how to use it. As the song progresses, Judy begins to feel confident that she is finally doing something right. Then suddenly the machine begins to go crazy; papers flying all over the place, etc. The aforementioned is what is currently present in the musical.\n* \"Tattletales\": A song performed in the office cafeteria when Judy is eating lunch with Violet and the girls. They ask Judy to \"spill her story\" and she refuses. Kathy ([[Ann Harada]]'s originated role) urges her to tell them and the cafeteria patrons all begin to explain how they \"learned to gossip\". Doralee enters in the middle of the song, wearing Judy's scarf, and the girls continue to spread rumors.\n* \"9 to 5\" (Reprise) / \"The One I Love\": In the current and final version of the show a song called \"I Just Might\" takes place over these two songs. \"9 to 5\" (Reprise) was a small song that takes place as the Consolidated employees head home at 5PM after a long day of work. \"The One I Love\" comes shortly afterwards and involves each of the three women at home either chatting with their husbands or with their children. Judy explicates that she may still love and have feelings for her ex-husband Dick, Violet with her son, and Doralee with her husband.\n* \"I Killed the Boss!\": As Judy, Violet, and Doralee are at the hospital, they hear a doctor explaining to someone that \"he is dead\". Violet, believing that the doctor was speaking of Franklin, has become overly dramatic and thinks that she has killed Franklin by putting the rat poison in his coffee.\n* \"Mundania\" / \"Mundania\" (Reprise): The song basically has the same message as \"Always a Woman\" which replaced these songs. Franklin is \"hanging around\" bored doing nothing and is finally sick and tired of the trio of girls and attempts to escape. He finally escapes during the reprise.\n* \"Willin'\" / \"Well-Oiled Machine\": Was replaced by \"Change It\" and has the same meaning. The Consolidated employees are puzzled and concerned by all of Mr. Hart's changes and the girls urge them to continue working as a team.\n\n''9 to 5'' uses a rock combo including keyboards, guitars, bass, drums, percussion, two woodwind players, two trumpets and trombone.\n\n==Casts==\nBelow is the principal casting of all major productions of the musical.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n!

The governing philosophy seems to be that it's O.K. to leer if you wink at your own prurience... That's true of much of the show. Its broad flirtation with tastelessness reminds you of how stylishly [[Mel Brooks]] played with brazen vulgarity in ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]''.\"<ref>Brantley, Ben.[http://theater2.nytimes.com/2009/05/01/theater/reviews/01nine.html?ref=todayspaper \"'9 to 5' Sisterhood vs. Boss, On a New Battlefield\"]''The New York Times'', May 1, 2009</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', Joe Dziemianowicz rated the production three out of five stars.

But enough of them stand out.\" He thought the creative team \"has struggled to open the show up for the stage.\" In conclusion he said, \"Is ''9 to 5'' as hip as TV's ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'' or as joyously hit-filled as ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''?

[that] reveal the songwriter's authentic personality,\" and concluded, \"The pleasures of ''9 to 5'' are less guilty, but they're also less satisfying than they should be.

She has composed a set of songs, accompanied with her own lyrics, that complement the original song.

Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton and March 1, 2013 at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center. From June 21\u201330, 2013, The Wagon Wheel Theatre from June 19\u201329 wagonwheeltheatre.org, The Grand Opera House in [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]] will host a production.  From July 19 - August 3, 2013, it shall presented by Minnetonka Theatre, Minnetonka, MN. On September 2, 2014, 9 to 5 opened at the [[Walnut Street Theater]] in [[Philadelphia]]. The show closed on October 19 and featured [[Dee Hoty]] as Violet, [[Amy Bodnar]] as Doralee and [[Amanda Rose]] as Judy.  In 2015, a new version of the show, scaled down for a small fringe venue, was scheduled to debut in Southampton at The Stage Door, presented in association with Music Theatre South.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Act I===\nAs the clocks ring and the workers wake up, Violet, Doralee, and Judy prepare for work (\"9 to 5\"). The workers begin another mundane and hellish day at work under Franklin Hart, Jr., president of Consolidated Industries. Judy and Violet meet for the first time and Judy reveals she does not have any work experience, but Violet states she will be proud to train her and gives her a few tips and pointers for surviving office life (\"Around Here\"). Franklin Hart, Jr., is a domineering and equally lecherous man, who lusts after his secretary, Doralee, and has no shame in making those feelings known, which discomfits Doralee (\"Here for You\"). Judy is having major issues on her first day (such as being unable to work a Xerox machine) and feels there is something more inhibiting her. All three women, in separate settings, share mutual feelings, but all feel they can overcome it and make it all work out in the end (\"I Just Might\"). A new day rises upon the begrudged workers of Consolidated and life resumes as normal. Around the lunch hour, Doralee and Judy speak for the first time as Doralee asks Judy to go to lunch with her, but Judy subtly refuses and Doralee doesn't know why. She then reflects on her whole life, about just being a pretty face and nothing much more (\"[[Backwoods Barbie]]\"). Violet is passed over for yet another promotion, which angers her since it is somebody that she personally trained. After a heated confrontation in Hart's office, Doralee finds out about Hart's rumor about their supposed 'affair', which infuriates her to the point of threatening him. All three of the women, who are now seemingly united in their contempt for Hart, go back to Violet's house and light up a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]]. Suddenly, each woman lapses into a murderous fantasy involving Mr. Hart; Judy as an unforgiving femme fatale (\"The Dance O' Death\"), Doralee as a crack rodeo star (\"Cowgirl's Revenge\"), and Violet as a deranged [[Snow White]] (\"Potion Notion\"). All of these sadistic fantasies soon culminate into a celebration of Hart's death, which is quickly nixed after Hart is discovered alive (\"Joy to the Girls\").\n\nThe next day at the office, Violet unwittingly acts out her fantasy and believes she put rat poison into Hart's coffee. They all go to the hospital in a panic but learn he was never there. Roz overheard the ladies in the bathroom and tells Hart, who concocts a plan to scare them by pretending he was actually poisoned and to threaten them with the police. After Hart leaves, Roz sings a song confessing her obsessive love and fantasies for him (\"Heart to Hart\"). Hart confronts Doralee with the information and Doralee, acting on a [[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]] instinct, rips the phones out and ties up Hart with the wires, which he seems to get a quasi-sexual pleasure from. The women are seemingly puzzled as to what to do with Hart, but Judy and Violet create a plan in which they will imprison Hart in his own house. As they are carrying out their plan, they sing to Hart their issues with him and the problems in their own lives but will begin to make the changes in their lives and have the confidence to succeed (\"Shine Like the Sun\"). The women, empowered, have restrained Hart to a mechanical harness above his bed.\n\n===Act II===\nAfter the [[Entr'acte]], in Hart's office, the three women are pondering on how they can keep the office in the dark about Hart's disappearance when Doralee's skill of being able to forge Hart's signature comes into play. Judy and Doralee both point out to Violet that she is, in a sense, the new [[CEO|Operating Officer]] of the company. Violet then lapses in fantasy and sings a song about she is now a hard-hitter like the rest of the male employees (who seems to rank above the women) (\"One of the Boys\"). Roz begins to get nosy and wonders where Hart actually is, which creates a new obstacle for the ladies to rid. Judy formulates the idea to send Roz to a one-month language seminar to learn French, which isn't necessary and is only a way to get rid of her. Roz receives the memo from Violet and is heartbroken because she believes that Hart doesn't like her and that the time she isn't at work is lonely and boring (\"5 to 9\"). As Hart is still strung up in his bedroom, he passes time by watching countless hours of [[soap operas]]. Doralee enters to give him a meal and Hart lashes out at her saying that he still has the control and will use it when he is free. Doralee brushes him off and leaves the room. Hart begins to recount how most of the men in history had \"downfalls\" by women and that he is no different, which angers him (\"Always a Woman\").\n\nBack at the office, the new changes the women have made under Hart's name have seemed to ease the workers' lives and changed their outlook on work (\"Change It\"). Joe, who has shown admiration toward Violet through the show, asking her out many times, confronts her and asks why she rebuffs him. She claims she was a \"one-man woman\" and that her husband's death three years before has prevented her from dating again. Joe tells her that it is time to move on and possibly give someone new a chance (\"Let Love Grow\"). Violet accepts as they walk out of the scene holding hands. Later on that evening, Judy's ex-husband, Dick, shows up at Hart's house and asks her to take him back (since his secretary girlfriend dumped him). She rebuffs him and states she is a changed woman who will not crawl back to someone who broke her heart, showing strength as she orders him to leave (\"Get Out and Stay Out\").\n\nThe next day, Hart storms into the office with Judy hostage, which shocks the women, who have collected evidence about Hart's \"[[creative accounting]]\" and embezzling practices to use against him. The women, seemingly defeated, prepare to submit to Hart's wishes when they learn that the CEO of Consolidated, Mr. Tinsworthy, is paying a visit. The women and Hart meet Tinsworthy, who, after noting the changes in office life, gives the credit to Hart. Violet and the others step up and say they made the changes, but are shot down. However, in a comedic twist, Tinsworthy sends Hart to manage the South American branch in Bolivia. Violet is then promoted to Hart's position as President of the company and a celebration ensues, while Roz is devastated over the loss of her obsession. The characters deliver epilogues about what happened after the events of the story (Finale: \"9 to 5\" Reprise). Hart was captured by natives in the jungles of Bolivia and was never seen or heard from again. Roz found a new love - Hart's wife. Violet and Joe have been together for the past 30 years and are very happy together. Doralee went to Nashville and became a successful country and western singer. Judy is single and loving it and wrote a bestselling book, ''Life Without Dick''.\n\n==Musical numbers==\n; Broadway Production \n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\" \u2013 Violet, Doralee, Dwayne, Judy and Ensemble\n* \"Around Here\" \u2013 Violet and Ensemble\n* \"Here for You\" \u2013 Franklin\n* \"I Just Might\" \u2013 Judy, Doralee and Violet\n* \"[[Backwoods Barbie]]\" \u2013 Doralee\n* \"The Dance of Death\" \u2020\u2020 \u2013 Judy, Franklin and Ensemble \n* \"Cowgirl's Revenge\" \u2020\u2020 \u2013 Doralee, Franklin and Ensemble\n* \"Potion Notion\" \u2013 \u2020\u2020 Violet, Franklin and Ensemble\n* \"Joy to the Girls\" \u2020\u2020 * \u2013 Judy, Doralee, Violet, Franklin and Ensemble\n* \"Heart to Hart\" \u2013 Roz and Ensemble\n* \"Shine Like the Sun\" \u2013 Doralee, Judy and Violet\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* Entr'acte \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"One of the Boys\" \u2013 Violet and Boys\n* \"5 to 9\" \u2013 Roz\n* \"Always a Woman\" *\u2020 \u2013 Franklin and Men's Ensemble\n* \"Change It\" * \u2013 Doralee, Violet, Judy and Ensemble\n* \"Let Love Grow\" \u2013 Joe and Violet\n* \"Get Out and Stay Out\" \u2013 Judy\n* \"Finale: 9 to 5\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n; West End Production \n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act I\n* \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\" \u2013 Violet, Doralee, Dwayne, Judy and Ensemble\n* \"Around Here\" \u2013 Violet and Ensemble\n* \"Here for You\" \u2013 Franklin\n* \"[[Backwoods Barbie]]\" \u2013 Doralee\n* \"I Just Might\" \u2013 Judy, Doralee and Violet\n* \"Heart to Hart\" \u2013 Roz and Ensemble\n* \"Hey Boss\" \u2013 Violet, Doralee and Judy\n* \"Shine Like the Sun\" \u2013 Doralee, Judy and Violet\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act II\n* Entr'acte \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"One of the Boys\" \u2013 Violet and Boys\n* \"5 to 9\" \u2013 Roz\n* \"Always a Woman\" *\u2020 \u2013 Franklin and Men's Ensemble\n* \"Change It\" * \u2013 Doralee, Violet, Judy and Ensemble\n* \"Let Love Grow\" \u2013 Joe and Violet\n* \"Get Out and Stay Out\" \u2013 Judy\n* \"Finale: 9 to 5\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n; Notes\n\u2020 Removed for the US National Tour\n\n\u2020\u2020 Removed from the UK Tour and replaced with \"Hey Boss\"\n\n'''<nowiki>*</nowiki>''' Added to production after Los Angeles pre-Broadway run\n\n===Other songs===\nThe following songs were in the Los Angeles pre-Broadway run and have since been cut from the final version of the Broadway production.<ref>[http://www.centertheatregroup.org/uploadedFiles/Plays_and_Tickets/Productions/2008/9_to_5/files/9to5Program.pdf \"9 to 5\" LA Pre-Broadway Showbill, Ahmanson Theatre, pp1-16\"]<div class=\"sendToPdfFiller\" data-url=\"http://www.centertheatregroup.org/uploadedFiles/Plays_and_Tickets/Productions/2008/9_to_5/files/9to5Program.pdf\" style=\"left: 990.90625px; top: 5400.234375px;\" title=\"Open with PDFfiller\">[[chrome-extension://iagkheeockcficekiaacbhdmpolcgmnn/img/icon-fill.png|link=]]</div> {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135526/http://www.centertheatregroup.org/uploadedFiles/Plays_and_Tickets/Productions/2008/9_to_5/files/9to5Program.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}<div class=\"sendToPdfFiller\" data-url=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135526/http://www.centertheatregroup.org/uploadedFiles/Plays_and_Tickets/Productions/2008/9_to_5/files/9to5Program.pdf\" style=\"left: 969.75px; top: 5400.234375px;\" title=\"Open with PDFfiller\">[[chrome-extension://iagkheeockcficekiaacbhdmpolcgmnn/img/icon-fill.png|link=]]</div><span> July 19, 2011, at the </span>[[Wayback Machine]]<span>.</span>\nCenterTheatreGroup.org, accessed August 25, 2011</ref>\n\n* \"Out of Control\": This song took place during the scene where Judy is using the [[Xerox]] machine. The song begins after Violet leaves Judy alone with the copy machine, having instructed her on how to use it. As the song progresses, Judy begins to feel confident that she is finally doing something right. Then suddenly the machine begins to go crazy; papers flying all over the place, etc. The aforementioned is what is currently present in the musical.\n* \"Tattletales\": A song performed in the office cafeteria when Judy is eating lunch with Violet and the girls. They ask Judy to \"spill her story\" and she refuses. Kathy ([[Ann Harada]]'s originated role) urges her to tell them and the cafeteria patrons all begin to explain how they \"learned to gossip\". Doralee enters in the middle of the song, wearing Judy's scarf, and the girls continue to spread rumors.\n* \"9 to 5\" (Reprise) / \"The One I Love\": In the current and final version of the show a song called \"I Just Might\" takes place over these two songs. \"9 to 5\" (Reprise) was a small song that takes place as the Consolidated employees head home at 5PM after a long day of work. \"The One I Love\" comes shortly afterwards and involves each of the three women at home either chatting with their husbands or with their children. Judy explicates that she may still love and have feelings for her ex-husband Dick, Violet with her son, and Doralee with her husband.\n* \"I Killed the Boss!\": As Judy, Violet, and Doralee are at the hospital, they hear a doctor explaining to someone that \"he is dead\". Violet, believing that the doctor was speaking of Franklin, has become overly dramatic and thinks that she has killed Franklin by putting the rat poison in his coffee.\n* \"Mundania\" / \"Mundania\" (Reprise): The song basically has the same message as \"Always a Woman\" which replaced these songs. Franklin is \"hanging around\" bored doing nothing and is finally sick and tired of the trio of girls and attempts to escape. He finally escapes during the reprise.\n* \"Willin'\" / \"Well-Oiled Machine\": Was replaced by \"Change It\" and has the same meaning. The Consolidated employees are puzzled and concerned by all of Mr. Hart's changes and the girls urge them to continue working as a team.\n\n''9 to 5'' uses a rock combo including keyboards, guitars, bass, drums, percussion, two woodwind players, two trumpets and trombone.\n\n==Casts==\nBelow is the principal casting of all major productions of the musical.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\"\n!

The governing philosophy seems to be that it's O.K. to leer if you wink at your own prurience... That's true of much of the show.

It occurs in several well-characterized stages. The initial signal comes from tissue areas that are devoid of vasculature. The hypoxia that is noted in these areas causes the tissues to demand the presence of nutrients and oxygen that will allow the tissue to carry out metabolic activities. Because of this, parenchymal cells will secrete vascular endothelial growth factor ([[VEGF-A]]) which is a proangiogenic growth factor.<ref>Adair TH, Montani JP. Angiogenesis. San Rafael (CA): Morgan & Claypool Life Sciences; 2010. Chapter 1, Overview of Angiogenesis. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53238/</ref>  These biological signals activate [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s on [[endothelial cell]]s present in pre-existing blood vessels.  Second, the activated endothelial cells, also known as tip cells, begin to release [[enzyme]]s called [[protease]]s that degrade the [[basement membrane]] to allow endothelial cells to escape from the original (parent) vessel walls. The [[endothelial cell]]s then [[cell growth|proliferate]] into the surrounding [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] and form solid sprouts connecting neighboring vessels. The cells that are proliferating are located behind the tip cells and are known as stalk cells. The proliferation of these cells allows the capillary sprout to grow in length simultaneously.\n\nAs sprouts extend toward the source of the angiogenic stimulus, endothelial cells migrate in [[tandem]], using adhesion molecules called [[integrin]]s.  These sprouts then form loops to become a full-fledged vessel [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] as cells migrate to the site of angiogenesis. Sprouting occurs at a rate of several millimeters per day, and enables new vessels to grow across gaps in the [[vasculature]]. It is markedly different from splitting angiogenesis because it forms entirely new vessels as opposed to splitting existing vessels.\n\n===Intussusceptive angiogenesis===\n{{main|Intussusceptive angiogenesis}}\n[[Intussusceptive angiogenesis]], also known as ''splitting angiogenesis'', is the formation of a new blood vessel by splitting an existing blood vessel into two.\n\nIntussusception was first observed in [[neonatal]] rats. In this type of vessel formation, the capillary wall extends into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] to split a single vessel in two. There are four phases of intussusceptive angiogenesis. First, the two opposing capillary walls establish a zone of contact. Second, the [[endothelial]] [[cell junction]]s are reorganized and the vessel [[bilayer]] is [[perforated]] to allow [[growth factors]] and cells to penetrate into the lumen. Third, a core is formed between the 2 new vessels at the zone of contact that is filled with [[pericyte]]s and [[myofibroblast]]s. These cells begin laying [[collagen]] fibers into the core to provide an [[extracellular matrix]] for growth of the vessel lumen. Finally, the core is fleshed out with no alterations to the basic structure. Intussusception is important because it is a reorganization of existing cells. It allows a vast increase in the number of [[capillaries]] without a corresponding increase in the number of [[endothelial cell]]s. This is especially important in embryonic development as there are not enough resources to create a rich [[Microcirculation|microvasculature]] with new cells every time a new vessel develops.<ref name=\"Burri2004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Burri PH, Hlushchuk R, Djonov V | title = Intussusceptive angiogenesis: its emergence, its characteristics, and its significance | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 231 | issue = 3 | pages = 474\u201388 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15376313 | doi = 10.1002/dvdy.20184 }}</ref>\n\n==Physiology==\n\n===Mechanical stimulation===\nMechanical stimulation of angiogenesis is not well characterized.

Receptor activation gives rise to a signal transduction cascade that leads to gene activation and diverse biological responses, including cell differentiation, proliferation, and matrix dissolution, thus initiating a process of mitogenic activity critical for the growth of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells.\n'''FGF-1''', unique among all 22 members of the FGF family, can bind to all seven FGF-receptor subtypes, making it the broadest-acting member of the FGF family, and a potent mitogen for the diverse cell types needed to mount an angiogenic response in damaged (hypoxic) tissues, where upregulation of FGF-receptors occurs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Blaber M, DiSalvo J, Thomas KA | title = X-ray crystal structure of human acidic fibroblast growth factor | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 35 | issue = 7 | pages = 2086\u201394 | date = February 1996 | pmid = 8652550 | doi = 10.1021/bi9521755 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.660.7607 }}</ref> FGF-1 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of all cell types necessary for building an arterial vessel, including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells; this fact ''distinguishes FGF-1 from other pro-angiogenic growth factors'', such as [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), which primarily drives the formation of new capillaries.<ref name=\"Stegmann\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khurana R, Simons M | title = Insights from angiogenesis trials using fibroblast growth factor for advanced arteriosclerotic disease | journal = Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 116\u201322 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12691676 | doi = 10.1016/S1050-1738(02)00259-1 }}</ref>\n\nBesides FGF-1, one of the most important functions of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2 or [[bFGF]]) is the promotion of endothelial cell proliferation and the physical organization of endothelial cells into tube-like structures, thus promoting angiogenesis.

As well as stimulating blood vessel growth, aFGF (FGF-1) and bFGF (FGF-2) are important players in wound healing.

Mechanically, VEGF is upregulated with muscle contractions as a result of increased blood flow to affected areas. The increased flow also causes a large increase in the [[mRNA]] production of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The increase in receptor production means muscle contractions could cause upregulation of the signaling cascade relating to angiogenesis. As part of the angiogenic signaling cascade, NO is widely considered to be a major contributor to the angiogenic response because inhibition of NO significantly reduces the effects of angiogenic growth factors.

Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or [[metastasis]]. Single cancer cells can break away from an established solid tumor, enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given solid tumor may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] and tumor cells.

This induces a release of [[proteolytic]] enzymes from the vasculature. These enzymes target a particular point on the blood vessel and cause a pore to form. This is the point where the new blood vessel will grow from.

While [[arteriogenesis]] produces network changes that allow for a large increase in the amount of total flow in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery over a long period of time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network.

It occurs in several well-characterized stages. The initial signal comes from tissue areas that are devoid of vasculature. The hypoxia that is noted in these areas causes the tissues to demand the presence of nutrients and oxygen that will allow the tissue to carry out metabolic activities. Because of this, parenchymal cells will secrete vascular endothelial growth factor ([[VEGF-A]]) which is a proangiogenic growth factor.<ref>Adair TH, Montani JP. Angiogenesis. San Rafael (CA): Morgan & Claypool Life Sciences; 2010. Chapter 1, Overview of Angiogenesis. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53238/</ref>  These biological signals activate [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s on [[endothelial cell]]s present in pre-existing blood vessels.  Second, the activated endothelial cells, also known as tip cells, begin to release [[enzyme]]s called [[protease]]s that degrade the [[basement membrane]] to allow endothelial cells to escape from the original (parent) vessel walls. The [[endothelial cell]]s then [[cell growth|proliferate]] into the surrounding [[Matrix (biology)|matrix]] and form solid sprouts connecting neighboring vessels. The cells that are proliferating are located behind the tip cells and are known as stalk cells. The proliferation of these cells allows the capillary sprout to grow in length simultaneously.\n\nAs sprouts extend toward the source of the angiogenic stimulus, endothelial cells migrate in [[tandem]], using adhesion molecules called [[integrin]]s.  These sprouts then form loops to become a full-fledged vessel [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] as cells migrate to the site of angiogenesis. Sprouting occurs at a rate of several millimeters per day, and enables new vessels to grow across gaps in the [[vasculature]]. It is markedly different from splitting angiogenesis because it forms entirely new vessels as opposed to splitting existing vessels.\n\n===Intussusceptive angiogenesis===\n{{main|Intussusceptive angiogenesis}}\n[[Intussusceptive angiogenesis]], also known as ''splitting angiogenesis'', is the formation of a new blood vessel by splitting an existing blood vessel into two.\n\nIntussusception was first observed in [[neonatal]] rats. In this type of vessel formation, the capillary wall extends into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] to split a single vessel in two. There are four phases of intussusceptive angiogenesis. First, the two opposing capillary walls establish a zone of contact. Second, the [[endothelial]] [[cell junction]]s are reorganized and the vessel [[bilayer]] is [[perforated]] to allow [[growth factors]] and cells to penetrate into the lumen. Third, a core is formed between the 2 new vessels at the zone of contact that is filled with [[pericyte]]s and [[myofibroblast]]s. These cells begin laying [[collagen]] fibers into the core to provide an [[extracellular matrix]] for growth of the vessel lumen. Finally, the core is fleshed out with no alterations to the basic structure. Intussusception is important because it is a reorganization of existing cells. It allows a vast increase in the number of [[capillaries]] without a corresponding increase in the number of [[endothelial cell]]s. This is especially important in embryonic development as there are not enough resources to create a rich [[Microcirculation|microvasculature]] with new cells every time a new vessel develops.<ref name=\"Burri2004\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Burri PH, Hlushchuk R, Djonov V | title = Intussusceptive angiogenesis: its emergence, its characteristics, and its significance | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 231 | issue = 3 | pages = 474\u201388 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15376313 | doi = 10.1002/dvdy.20184 }}</ref>\n\n==Physiology==\n\n===Mechanical stimulation===\nMechanical stimulation of angiogenesis is not well characterized.

Mechanically, VEGF is upregulated with muscle contractions as a result of increased blood flow to affected areas. The increased flow also causes a large increase in the [[mRNA]] production of VEGF receptors 1 and 2. The increase in receptor production means muscle contractions could cause upregulation of the signaling cascade relating to angiogenesis.

The VEGF pathway is vital to the development of vasculature that in turn, helps the tumors to grow. The combined blockade of VEGF and DII4 results in the inhibition of tumor progression and angiogenesis throughout the tumor. This is due to the hindrance of signaling in endothelial cell signaling which cuts off the proliferation and sprouting of these endothelial cells. With this inhibition, the cells do not uncontrollably grow, therefore, the cancer is stopped at this point. if the blockade, however, were to be lifted, the cells would begin their proliferation once again. <ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/19420862.2016.1171432 | volume=8 | title=Simultaneous blockade of VEGF and Dll4 by HD105, a bispecific antibody, inhibits tumor progression and angiogenesis | year=2016 | journal=mAbs | pages=892\u2013904 | vauthors=Lee D, Kim D, Bin Choi Y, Kang K, Sung E-S, Ahn J-H, Goo J, Yeom D-H, Sook Jang H, Duk Moon K, Hoon Lee S, You W-K}}</ref>\n\n==== Class 3 semaphorins ====\n[[Semaphorin#Classes|Class 3 semaphorin]]s (SEMA3s) regulate angiogenesis by modulating [[endothelial cells|endothelial cell]] adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival and the recruitment of [[pericyte]]s.<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, [[semaphorin]]s can interfere with VEGF-mediated angiogenesis since both SEMA3s and [[VEGF-A]] compete for [[neuropilin]] receptor binding at endothelial cells.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Soker S, Takashima S, Miao HQ, Neufeld G, Klagsbrun M | title = Neuropilin-1 is expressed by endothelial and tumor cells as an isoform-specific receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor | journal = Cell | volume = 92 | issue = 6 | pages = 735\u201345 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9529250 | doi = 10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81402-6 }}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Herzog B, Pellet-Many C, Britton G, Hartzoulakis B, Zachary IC | title = VEGF binding to NRP1 is essential for VEGF stimulation of endothelial cell migration, complex formation between NRP1 and VEGFR2, and signaling via FAK Tyr407 phosphorylation | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 22 | issue = 15 | pages = 2766\u201376 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21653826 | pmc = 3145551 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E09-12-1061 }}</ref> The relative expression levels of SEMA3s and VEGF-A may therefore be important for angiogenesis.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Chemical inhibition===\n{{Main|Angiogenesis inhibitor}}\n\nAn [[angiogenesis inhibitor]] can be endogenous or come from outside as [[medication|drug]] or a [[diet (nutrition)|dietary component]].\n\n==Application in medicine==\n\n===Angiogenesis as a therapeutic target===\nAngiogenesis may be a target for combating diseases such as [[heart disease]] characterized by either poor vascularisation or abnormal vasculature.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferrara N, Kerbel RS | title = Angiogenesis as a therapeutic target | journal = Nature | volume = 438 | issue = 7070 | pages = 967\u201374 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16355214 | doi = 10.1038/nature04483 | bibcode = 2005Natur.438..967F }}</ref> Application of specific compounds that may inhibit or induce the creation of new [[blood vessels]] in the body may help combat such diseases.

Several diseases, such as [[ischemia|ischemic chronic wounds]], are the result of failure or insufficient blood vessel formation and may be treated by a local expansion of blood vessels, thus bringing new nutrients to the site, facilitating repair. Other diseases, such as age-related [[macular degeneration]], may be created by a local expansion of blood vessels, interfering with normal physiological processes.\n\nThe modern clinical application of the principle of angiogenesis can be divided into two main areas: anti-angiogenic therapies, which angiogenic research began with, and pro-angiogenic therapies.

Difficulties include effective integration of the therapeutic genes into the genome of target cells, reducing the risk of an undesired immune response, potential toxicity, [[immunogenicity]], inflammatory responses, and [[oncogenesis]] related to the viral vectors used in implanting genes and the sheer complexity of the genetic basis of angiogenesis. The most commonly occurring disorders in humans, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and [[Alzheimer's disease]], are most likely caused by the combined effects of variations in many genes, and, thus, injecting a single gene may not be significantly beneficial in such diseases.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn contrast, pro-angiogenic protein therapy uses well-defined, precisely structured proteins, with previously defined optimal doses of the individual protein for disease states, and with well-known biological effects.<ref name=\"Nova Science 2013 p. \"/> On the other hand, an obstacle of protein therapy is the mode of delivery. Oral, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intramuscular routes of protein administration are not always as effective, as the therapeutic protein may be metabolized or cleared before it can enter the target tissue. Cell-based pro-angiogenic therapies are still early stages of research, with many open questions regarding best cell types and dosages to use.\n\n===Tumor angiogenesis===\n[[File:Diagram showing why cancer cells need their own blood supply.svg|270px|thumb| Without angiogenesis a tumor cannot grow beyond a limited size]]\nCancer [[cell (biology)|cell]]s are cells that have lost their ability to divide in a controlled fashion. A [[malignant tumor]] consists of a population of rapidly dividing and growing cancer cells that progressively accrues [[mutation]]s.

Growth factors such as [[bFGF]] and [[VEGF]] can induce capillary growth into the tumor, which some researchers suspect supply required nutrients, allowing for tumor expansion.

In either case, angiogenesis is a necessary and required step for transition from a small harmless cluster of cells, often said to be about the size of the metal ball at the end of a ball-point pen, to a large tumor. Angiogenesis is also required for the spread of a tumor, or [[metastasis]]. Single cancer cells can break away from an established solid tumor, enter the blood vessel, and be carried to a distant site, where they can implant and begin the growth of a secondary tumor. Evidence now suggests the blood vessel in a given solid tumor may, in fact, be mosaic vessels, composed of [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] and tumor cells. This mosaicity allows for substantial shedding of tumor cells into the vasculature, possibly contributing to the appearance of [[circulating tumor cell]]s in the peripheral blood of patients with malignancies.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Allard WJ, Matera J, Miller MC, Repollet M, Connelly MC, Rao C, Tibbe AG, Uhr JW, Terstappen LW | title = Tumor cells circulate in the peripheral blood of all major carcinomas but not in healthy subjects or patients with nonmalignant diseases | journal = Clinical Cancer Research | volume = 10 | issue = 20 | pages = 6897\u2013904 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15501967 | doi = 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-04-0378 }}</ref> The subsequent growth of such metastases will also require a supply of nutrients and [[oxygen]] and a waste disposal pathway.\n\nEndothelial cells have long been considered genetically more stable than cancer cells. This genomic stability confers an advantage to targeting endothelial cells using antiangiogenic therapy, compared to [[chemotherapy]] directed at cancer cells, which rapidly mutate and acquire '[[drug resistance]]' to treatment.  For this reason, [[endothelial cells]] are thought to be an ideal target for therapies directed against them.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bagri A, Kouros-Mehr H, Leong KG, Plowman GD | title = Use of anti-VEGF adjuvant therapy in cancer: challenges and rationale | journal = Trends in Molecular Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 122\u201332 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20189876 | doi = 10.1016/j.molmed.2010.01.004 }}</ref>\n\n===Formation of tumor blood vessels===\nThe mechanism of blood vessel formation by angiogenesis is initiated by the spontaneous dividing of tumor cells due to a mutation. Angiogenic stimulators are then released by the tumor cells. These then travel to already established, nearby blood vessels and activates their endothelial cell receptors. This induces a release of [[proteolytic]] enzymes from the vasculature. These enzymes target a particular point on the blood vessel and cause a pore to form. This is the point where the new blood vessel will grow from. The reason tumour cells need a blood supply is because they cannot grow any more than 2-3 millimeters in diameter without an established blood supply which is equivalent to about 50-100 cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nishida N, Yano H, Nishida T, Kamura T, Kojiro M | title = Angiogenesis in cancer | journal = Vascular Health and Risk Management | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 213\u20139 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 17326328 | pmc = 1993983 | doi=10.2147/vhrm.2006.2.3.213}}</ref>\n\n===Angiogenesis for cardiovascular disease===\nAngiogenesis represents an excellent therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. It is a potent, physiological process that underlies the natural manner in which our bodies respond to a diminution of blood supply to vital organs, namely the production of new collateral vessels to overcome the ischemic insult.<ref name=\"Stegmann\"/> A large number of preclinical studies have been performed with protein-, gene- and cell-based therapies in animal models of cardiac ischemia, as well as models of peripheral artery disease. Reproducible and credible successes in these early animal studies led to high enthusiasm that this new therapeutic approach could be rapidly translated to a clinical benefit for millions of patients in the Western world suffering from these disorders. A decade of clinical testing both gene- and protein-based therapies designed to stimulate angiogenesis in underperfused tissues and organs, however, has led from one disappointment to another. Although all of these preclinical readouts, which offered great promise for the transition of angiogenesis therapy from animals to humans, were in one fashion or another, incorporated into early stage clinical trials, the FDA has, to date (2007), insisted that the primary endpoint for approval of an angiogenic agent must be an improvement in exercise performance of treated patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hariawala MD, Sellke FW | title = Angiogenesis and the heart: therapeutic implications | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 90 | issue = 6 | pages = 307\u201311 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9227376 | pmc = 1296305 | doi = 10.1177/014107689709000604 }}</ref>\n\nThese failures suggested that either these are the wrong molecular targets to induce neovascularization, that they can only be effectively used if formulated and administered correctly, or that their [[presentation]] in the context of the overall cellular microenvironment may play a vital role in their utility.

While [[arteriogenesis]] produces network changes that allow for a large increase in the amount of total flow in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery over a long period of time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network. This is vitally important to endurance training, because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time. However, no experimental evidence suggests that increased capillarity is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum oxygen delivery.<ref name=\"Prior2004\" />\n\n===Macular degeneration===\nOverexpression of VEGF causes increased permeability in blood vessels in addition to stimulating angiogenesis. In wet [[macular degeneration]], VEGF causes proliferation of capillaries into the retina. Since the increase in angiogenesis also causes [[edema]], blood and other retinal fluids leak into the [[retina]], causing loss of vision. Anti-angiogenic drugs targeting the VEGF pathways are now used successfully to treat this type of macular degeneration\n\n===Tissue engineered constructs===\nAngiogenesis of vessels from the host body into an implanted tissue engineered constructs is essential.
