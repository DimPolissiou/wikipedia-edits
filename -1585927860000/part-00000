Originally the knights moved into the fortress as an  ally of [[Poland]] against the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. However, after disputes over the control of the city between the Order and the [[King of Poland]]  arose, the knights murdered a number of citizens  within the city and took it as their own.

This view was shared by many Polish historians after World War II, however, B\u0142a\u017cej \u015aliwi\u0144ski's presented numerous pieces of evidence that what occurred was indeed a \"bloodbath\" with a very high number of victims, although not as high as 10,000, and more likely around 1000. Loew adds that from the source material available to historians, the definite number of casualties is impossible to establish.<ref>Peter Oliver Loew: \"Danzig\", p. 36: \"Deutsche Historiker hatten lange den Beteuerungen des Ordens gr\u00f6\u00dferes Vertrauen geschenkt und argumentiert, 10 000 Tote seien in einer Stadt, die kaum so viele Einwohner besa\u00df, schlicht unm\u00f6glich gewesen, es k\u00f6nnten h\u00f6chstens 60 bis 100 gewesen sein.

Nie\u00df says that the destruction of the city walls was in line with the order's contemporary policy of not allowing their own foundations to be substantially fortified either, and that the refusal of the town to obey to the order's demand to level their walls led to a \"policy of hardness\" being implemented on the townspeople, who had to evacuate their houses which afterward were burned down. Nie\u00df says that the procurator of the order had himself reported these proceedings to the pope, claiming the burghers evacuated and burned their houses voluntarily (which Nie\u00df strongly denies). Nie\u00df is also pointing out that in the subsequent capture of [[Tczew]] (Dirschau) by the order, the townspeople similarly had to sign an agreement to evacuate their homes, though this was not put into effect.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ulrich|last=Nie\u00df|title=Hochmeister Karl von Trier (1311-1324).

Referring to records of Danzig burghers taking residence in [[L\u00fcbeck]], Loew says it is likely that most of the former inhabitants left Danzig in 1308.<ref>{{cite book|title=Danzig|first=Peter Oliver|last=Loew|publisher=C.H.Beck|year=2010|isbn=3-406-60587-7|page=37}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Pommerellen.png|thumb|288px|right|Pomerelia (''Pommerellen'') while part of the [[monastic state of the Teutonic Knights]].]]\n\nWhen the Poles refused to accept monetary compensation for the Knights' takeover of the city, the Order resorted to conquering further towns like [[\u015awiecie]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> The local colony of merchants and artisans was specifically attacked because they competed with the Knights' town of Elbing ([[Elbl\u0105g]]), a nearby city.<ref name=\"William Urban\">William Urban: ''The Teutonic Knights: A Military History''.

In September 1309, Margrave [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Waldemar]] of Brandenburg-[[Stendal]] sold his claim to the territory to the Teutonic Order for 10,000 marks in the [[Treaty of Soldin (1309)|Treaty of Soldin]] (now [[My\u015blib\u00f3rz]]), thereby connecting the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] with that of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. While for the order, this landbridge with the empire was a major strategic improvement by connecting its Baltic territories to its German [[bailiwick]]s (''ballei''), it was at the same time a major loss for Poland who had become a [[landlocked country]].<ref>Norman Housley, ''The later Crusades, 1274\u20131580: from Lyons to Alcazar'', Oxford University Press, 1992, p.326, {{ISBN|0-19-822136-3}}</ref><ref>Brigitte J\u00e4ger-Dabek, ''Polen: Eine Nachbarschaftskunde f\u00fcr Deutsche'' 2nd edition, Ch.

Initially the new rulers tried to reduce the economic significance of Danzig by abolishing the local government and the privileges of the merchants. This was exemplified by the fact that the city council, including [[Arnold Hecht]] and [[Conrad Letzkau]], was removed and beheaded in 1411.<ref>Natalia i Waldemar Borzestowscy, \"Dlaczego zgin\u0105\u0142 burmistrz\" (\"Why did the mayor die?\"), [http://www.trojmiasto.pl/wiadomosci/news.php?id_news=17395]</ref> Later the Knights were forced to accept the fact that city defended its independence and was the largest and most important seaport of the region after overtaking Elbing. Subsequently, it flourished, benefiting from major investment and economic prosperity in the Monastic state and Poland, which stimulated trade along the [[Vistula]]. The city had become a full member of the merchant association, the [[Hanseatic League]] by 1361, but its merchants remained resentful at the barriers to trade up the Vistula river with Poland, along with the lack of political rights in a state ruled in the interest of the Order's religiously motivated knight-monks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} As a result, the city became a co-founder of the [[Prussian Confederation]] which formally petitioned [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], to incorporate Prussia, including Danzig, into the Kingdom of Poland in 1454.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n=== Lasting legacy ===\n[[File:Gda\u0144sk - Pomnik poleg\u0142ych za Polsko\u015b\u0107 Gda\u0144ska 03.JPG|thumb|right|Monument in Gda\u0144sk]]\n\nWhen the area was disputed between [[Weimar Germany]] and the [[Second Polish Republic]], the Poles recalled the massacre quoting the number of 10,000 murdered.<ref>Ministerstwo Spraw Zagranicznych, Poland, ''Dzieje miast Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej: Polska w s\u0142owie i obrazach'', Nak\u0142adem wydawn.

Loew adds that from the source material available to historians, the definite number of casualties is impossible to establish.<ref>Peter Oliver Loew: \"Danzig\", p. 36: \"Deutsche Historiker hatten lange den Beteuerungen des Ordens gr\u00f6\u00dferes Vertrauen geschenkt und argumentiert, 10 000 Tote seien in einer Stadt, die kaum so viele Einwohner besa\u00df, schlicht unm\u00f6glich gewesen, es k\u00f6nnten h\u00f6chstens 60 bis 100 gewesen sein.

Nie\u00df says that the destruction of the city walls was in line with the order's contemporary policy of not allowing their own foundations to be substantially fortified either, and that the refusal of the town to obey to the order's demand to level their walls led to a \"policy of hardness\" being implemented on the townspeople, who had to evacuate their houses which afterward were burned down. Nie\u00df says that the procurator of the order had himself reported these proceedings to the pope, claiming the burghers evacuated and burned their houses voluntarily (which Nie\u00df strongly denies). Nie\u00df is also pointing out that in the subsequent capture of [[Tczew]] (Dirschau) by the order, the townspeople similarly had to sign an agreement to evacuate their homes, though this was not put into effect.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ulrich|last=Nie\u00df|title=Hochmeister Karl von Trier (1311-1324).

Referring to records of Danzig burghers taking residence in [[L\u00fcbeck]], Loew says it is likely that most of the former inhabitants left Danzig in 1308.<ref>{{cite book|title=Danzig|first=Peter Oliver|last=Loew|publisher=C.H.Beck|year=2010|isbn=3-406-60587-7|page=37}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Pommerellen.png|thumb|288px|right|Pomerelia (''Pommerellen'') while part of the [[monastic state of the Teutonic Knights]].]]\n\nWhen the Poles refused to accept monetary compensation for the Knights' takeover of the city, the Order resorted to conquering further towns like [[\u015awiecie]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> The local colony of merchants and artisans was specifically attacked because they competed with the Knights' town of Elbing ([[Elbl\u0105g]]), a nearby city.<ref name=\"William Urban\">William Urban: ''The Teutonic Knights: A Military History''.

In September 1309, Margrave [[Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal|Waldemar]] of Brandenburg-[[Stendal]] sold his claim to the territory to the Teutonic Order for 10,000 marks in the [[Treaty of Soldin (1309)|Treaty of Soldin]] (now [[My\u015blib\u00f3rz]]), thereby connecting the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] with that of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. While for the order, this landbridge with the empire was a major strategic improvement by connecting its Baltic territories to its German [[bailiwick]]s (''ballei''), it was at the same time a major loss for Poland who had become a [[landlocked country]].<ref>Norman Housley, ''The later Crusades, 1274\u20131580: from Lyons to Alcazar'', Oxford University Press, 1992, p.326, {{ISBN|0-19-822136-3}}</ref><ref>Brigitte J\u00e4ger-Dabek, ''Polen: Eine Nachbarschaftskunde f\u00fcr Deutsche'' 2nd edition, Ch.

Some prominent brethren favoured a concession of Pomerelia in exchange for good relations with Poland, but were opposed by a majority of the knights who thought that such a concession would eventually lead to the total expulsion of the knights from their state.<ref name=Housley327>Norman Housley, ''The later Crusades, 1274\u20131580: from Lyons to Alcazar'', Oxford University Press, 1992, p.327, {{ISBN|0-19-822136-3}}</ref> These disagreements caused the abdication of Grand Master Charles of Trier in 1318 and the murder of the succeeding Grand Master Werner of Orseln in 1330.<ref name=Housley327/> The possession of Danzig and Pomerelia by the Teutonic Order was questioned consistently by the Polish kings W\u0142adys\u0142aw I and [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]] in legal suits in the papal court in 1320 and 1333.<ref name=\"Kuef\"/> Both times, as well as in 1339, the Teutonic Knights were ordered by the Pope to return Pomerelia and other lands back to Poland, but did not comply.<ref name=\"Kuef\"/> As a result, in the late 1330s, a war ensued.<ref name=\"Kuef\"/>\n\nPeace was established in the [[Treaty of Kalisz (1343)|Treaty of Kalisz in 1343]]; although the Polish kings were able to retain the title \"Duke of Pomerania\" and were recognized as titular overlords of the crusaders, the Knights retained control of Danzig.<ref name=\"Gieysztor\"/> - this time, with the permission of the papal court.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nDevelopment of the city stagnated after its capture by the Teutonic Knights. Initially the new rulers tried to reduce the economic significance of Danzig by abolishing the local government and the privileges of the merchants. This was exemplified by the fact that the city council, including [[Arnold Hecht]] and [[Conrad Letzkau]], was removed and beheaded in 1411.<ref>Natalia i Waldemar Borzestowscy, \"Dlaczego zgin\u0105\u0142 burmistrz\" (\"Why did the mayor die?\"), [http://www.trojmiasto.pl/wiadomosci/news.php?id_news=17395]</ref> Later the Knights were forced to accept the fact that city defended its independence and was the largest and most important seaport of the region after overtaking Elbing. Subsequently, it flourished, benefiting from major investment and economic prosperity in the Monastic state and Poland, which stimulated trade along the [[Vistula]]. The city had become a full member of the merchant association, the [[Hanseatic League]] by 1361, but its merchants remained resentful at the barriers to trade up the Vistula river with Poland, along with the lack of political rights in a state ruled in the interest of the Order's religiously motivated knight-monks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} As a result, the city became a co-founder of the [[Prussian Confederation]] which formally petitioned [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], to incorporate Prussia, including Danzig, into the Kingdom of Poland in 1454.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n=== Lasting legacy ===\n[[File:Gda\u0144sk - Pomnik poleg\u0142ych za Polsko\u015b\u0107 Gda\u0144ska 03.JPG|thumb|right|Monument in Gda\u0144sk]]\n\nWhen the area was disputed between [[Weimar Germany]] and the [[Second Polish Republic]], the Poles recalled the massacre quoting the number of 10,000 murdered.<ref>Ministerstwo Spraw Zagranicznych, Poland, ''Dzieje miast Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej: Polska w s\u0142owie i obrazach'', Nak\u0142adem wydawn.

Their debut album, ''[[Wonderland (Erasure album)|Wonderland]]'', was mostly recorded in 1985 and released in June 1986. Although it only made the UK Top 75, it made a sizeable mark in Germany, making the Top 20.\n\nIt was with the release of their fourth single, \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\", that Erasure finally received recognition in the UK in late 1986. The song peaked at number 2 in the UK and Germany and spent many weeks in the UK Top 40, marking the beginning of a long string of major hits for the duo.\n\nThe single's parent album, ''[[The Circus (Erasure album)|The Circus]]'', was released in March 1987 and reached number 6 and turned platinum in the UK with three additional hit singles: \"[[It Doesn't Have To Be]]\", \"[[Victim of Love (Erasure song)|Victim of Love]]\" and \"[[The Circus (song)|The Circus]]\". The album remained on the charts for over a year.\n\nErasure's third album, ''[[The Innocents (Erasure album)|The Innocents]]'', was released in April 1988. Preceded by the Top 10 single \"[[Ship of Fools (Erasure song)|Ship of Fools]]\", the album hit number 1 in the UK on its initial release and returned to the summit a year later, eventually going double platinum. It also turned platinum in the U.S., generating two Top 20 hits in \"[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]\" and \"[[A Little Respect]]\". ''The Innocents'' was the first of five consecutive number 1 albums for Erasure in the UK, including the greatest hits compilation ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]''. In November 1988, the ''[[Crackers International]]'' EP, led by the song \"Stop!\", hit number 2 in the UK singles chart. The albums ''[[Wild! (Erasure album)|Wild!]]'' (1989) and ''[[Chorus (Erasure album)|Chorus]]'' (1991) both contained four Top 20 singles and were major sellers.\n\n''[[Crackers International]]'' was bettered in 1992 by another EP, ''[[Abba-esque]]'', covering four [[ABBA]] hits, which became Erasure's first (and to-date only) number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=MTV>{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Erasure Bio|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/erasure/biography/|website=MTV Artists|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref> It featured a video of the duo dressed in ABBA outfits, and was one of the principal drivers of the ABBA revival scene in the 1990s{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}.\n\n[[Image:19920908 erasure andybell magdeburg.jpg|200px|thumb|Andy Bell in 1992]]\nAlso in 1990, Erasure contributed the song \"[[Too Darn Hot]]\" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. In 1992, a singles compilation, ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]'', also hit number 1 and went triple platinum, featuring all the band's singles released from 1985 to 1992.\n\nIn 1994, Erasure released ''[[I Say I Say I Say]]'', their fifth consecutive number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Its first single, \"[[Always (Erasure song)|Always]]\", became the band's third Top 20 hit in the United States, next its second single, \"[[Run to the Sun]]\" was released in July and became their final UK Top 10 hit until 2003. Its third and final single, \"[[I Love Saturday]]\" was released in November.\n\n===Releases 1995\u20132007===\nThe October 1995 release of the album ''[[Erasure (album)|Erasure]]'' marked a determined shift away from Erasure's signature three-minute synthpop to a more introspective and experimental sound. Nevertheless, it made the UK Top 15 and spawned two UK Top 20 singles, \"[[Stay with Me (Erasure song)|Stay with Me]]\" and \"[[Fingers & Thumbs (Cold Summer's Day)|Fingers & Thumbs]]\". A remixed version of \"[[Rock Me Gently (Erasure song)|Rock Me Gently]]\" was released only in Germany and the Czech Republic as the third single.\n\nIn spite of a return to three-minute pop songs, the 1997 album ''[[Cowboy (album)|Cowboy]]'' did not restore the success of their 1986\u20131994 era. ''Cowboy'' enjoyed a short-lived success, peaking at number 10 in the UK but lasting only two weeks in the UK Top 40. In the U.S. Billboard charts though, it was one of their most successful records. The first single \"[[In My Arms (Erasure song)|In My Arms]]\" reached number 13 in the UK and entered the Top 2 in the U.S. Dance chart.  The second single \"[[Don't Say Your Love Is Killing Me]]\" made number 23 in the UK. The third single \"[[Rain (Erasure song)|Rain]]\" was also only released in Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn October 2000, Erasure released their ninth studio album ''[[Loveboat (album)|Loveboat]]'', co-produced with [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], though only peaking at a lowly number 45. The first single was \"[[Freedom (Erasure song)|Freedom]]\", which made a brief entry into the UK Top 30. In 2001 they released a limited EP \"[[Moon & the Sky]]\" containing new versions of the title song, a cover of the song \"[[Baby Love]]\" and some acoustic versions of ''Loveboat'' songs.\n\nThe 2003 release ''[[Other People's Songs]]'' was a collection of [[cover version]]s. Its first single, a cover of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s song \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\", reached the UK Top 10.  The second single from the album was a cover of Steve Harley's \"[[Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)]]\" \u2013  it made number 14 in the UK and Erasure were invited to perform on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for the first time since March 1997.<ref>[http://www.erasureinfo.com/news/news_2003_01.html 16 Jan : Top Of The Pops Performance And Webchat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123110738/http://erasureinfo.com/news/news_2003_01.html |date=23 January 2009 }}, Erasure official site</ref>\n\nIn 2003 a new 'best of' compilation was released, called ''[[Hits!

Their debut album, ''[[Wonderland (Erasure album)|Wonderland]]'', was mostly recorded in 1985 and released in June 1986. Although it only made the UK Top 75, it made a sizeable mark in Germany, making the Top 20.\n\nIt was with the release of their fourth single, \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\", that Erasure finally received recognition in the UK in late 1986. The song peaked at number 2 in the UK and Germany and spent many weeks in the UK Top 40, marking the beginning of a long string of major hits for the duo.\n\nThe single's parent album, ''[[The Circus (Erasure album)|The Circus]]'', was released in March 1987 and reached number 6 and turned platinum in the UK with three additional hit singles: \"[[It Doesn't Have To Be]]\", \"[[Victim of Love (Erasure song)|Victim of Love]]\" and \"[[The Circus (song)|The Circus]]\". The album remained on the charts for over a year.\n\nErasure's third album, ''[[The Innocents (Erasure album)|The Innocents]]'', was released in April 1988. Preceded by the Top 10 single \"[[Ship of Fools (Erasure song)|Ship of Fools]]\", the album hit number 1 in the UK on its initial release and returned to the summit a year later, eventually going double platinum. It also turned platinum in the U.S., generating two Top 20 hits in \"[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]\" and \"[[A Little Respect]]\". ''The Innocents'' was the first of five consecutive number 1 albums for Erasure in the UK, including the greatest hits compilation ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]''. In November 1988, the ''[[Crackers International]]'' EP, led by the song \"Stop!\", hit number 2 in the UK singles chart. The albums ''[[Wild! (Erasure album)|Wild!]]'' (1989) and ''[[Chorus (Erasure album)|Chorus]]'' (1991) both contained four Top 20 singles and were major sellers.\n\n''[[Crackers International]]'' was bettered in 1992 by another EP, ''[[Abba-esque]]'', covering four [[ABBA]] hits, which became Erasure's first (and to-date only) number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=MTV>{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Erasure Bio|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/erasure/biography/|website=MTV Artists|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref> It featured a video of the duo dressed in ABBA outfits, and was one of the principal drivers of the ABBA revival scene in the 1990s{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}.\n\n[[Image:19920908 erasure andybell magdeburg.jpg|200px|thumb|Andy Bell in 1992]]\nAlso in 1990, Erasure contributed the song \"[[Too Darn Hot]]\" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. In 1992, a singles compilation, ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]'', also hit number 1 and went triple platinum, featuring all the band's singles released from 1985 to 1992.\n\nIn 1994, Erasure released ''[[I Say I Say I Say]]'', their fifth consecutive number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Its first single, \"[[Always (Erasure song)|Always]]\", became the band's third Top 20 hit in the United States, next its second single, \"[[Run to the Sun]]\" was released in July and became their final UK Top 10 hit until 2003. Its third and final single, \"[[I Love Saturday]]\" was released in November.\n\n===Releases 1995\u20132007===\nThe October 1995 release of the album ''[[Erasure (album)|Erasure]]'' marked a determined shift away from Erasure's signature three-minute synthpop to a more introspective and experimental sound. Nevertheless, it made the UK Top 15 and spawned two UK Top 20 singles, \"[[Stay with Me (Erasure song)|Stay with Me]]\" and \"[[Fingers & Thumbs (Cold Summer's Day)|Fingers & Thumbs]]\". A remixed version of \"[[Rock Me Gently (Erasure song)|Rock Me Gently]]\" was released only in Germany and the Czech Republic as the third single.\n\nIn spite of a return to three-minute pop songs, the 1997 album ''[[Cowboy (album)|Cowboy]]'' did not restore the success of their 1986\u20131994 era. ''Cowboy'' enjoyed a short-lived success, peaking at number 10 in the UK but lasting only two weeks in the UK Top 40. In the U.S. Billboard charts though, it was one of their most successful records. The first single \"[[In My Arms (Erasure song)|In My Arms]]\" reached number 13 in the UK and entered the Top 2 in the U.S. Dance chart.  The second single \"[[Don't Say Your Love Is Killing Me]]\" made number 23 in the UK. The third single \"[[Rain (Erasure song)|Rain]]\" was also only released in Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn October 2000, Erasure released their ninth studio album ''[[Loveboat (album)|Loveboat]]'', co-produced with [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], though only peaking at a lowly number 45. The first single was \"[[Freedom (Erasure song)|Freedom]]\", which made a brief entry into the UK Top 30. In 2001 they released a limited EP \"[[Moon & the Sky]]\" containing new versions of the title song, a cover of the song \"[[Baby Love]]\" and some acoustic versions of ''Loveboat'' songs.\n\nThe 2003 release ''[[Other People's Songs]]'' was a collection of [[cover version]]s. Its first single, a cover of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s song \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\", reached the UK Top 10.  The second single from the album was a cover of Steve Harley's \"[[Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)]]\" \u2013  it made number 14 in the UK and Erasure were invited to perform on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for the first time since March 1997.<ref>[http://www.erasureinfo.com/news/news_2003_01.html 16 Jan : Top Of The Pops Performance And Webchat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123110738/http://erasureinfo.com/news/news_2003_01.html |date=23 January 2009 }}, Erasure official site</ref>\n\nIn 2003 a new 'best of' compilation was released, called ''[[Hits!

It was released on December 12, 1991 in Japan, October 15, 1992 in North America, and April 2, 1993 in Europe. The Sega CD plays [[Compact disc|CD]]-based games and adds hardware functionality such as a faster [[central processing unit]] and graphic enhancements. It can also play audio CDs and [[CD+G]] discs.\n\nThe main benefit of CD technology was greater storage, which allowed for games to be nearly 320 times larger than Genesis cartridges. This benefit manifested as [[full motion video]] (FMV) games such as the controversial ''[[Night Trap]]'', which became a focus of the 1993 [[United States Congress|congressional]] hearings on issues of video game violence and ratings. Sega of Japan partnered with [[JVC]] to design the Sega CD and refused to consult with Sega of America until the project was complete. Sega of America assembled parts from various \"dummy\" units to obtain a working prototype. It was redesigned several times by Sega and licensed third-party developers.\n\nWhile the Sega CD became known for several well received games such as ''[[Sonic CD]]'' and ''[[Lunar: Eternal Blue]]'', its [[List of Sega CD games|game library]] contained many Genesis [[Port (video gaming)|ports]] and poorly received FMV games. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold by March 1996, after which Sega discontinued the system to focus on the [[Sega Saturn]]. Retrospective reception is mixed, with praise for individual games and additional functions, but criticism for its lack of deep games, high price, and support from Sega.\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nReleased in 1989, the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] (known as the Mega Drive in Europe and Japan) was Sega's entry into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation]] of video game consoles.<ref name=\"Retroinspection\"/> In mid-1990, Sega [[CEO]] [[Hayao Nakayama]] hired [[Tom Kalinske]] as CEO of Sega of America. Kalinske developed a four-point plan for sales of the Genesis: cut the console's price, develop games for the American market with a new American team, continue aggressive advertising campaigns, and ship ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' with the Genesis as a [[pack-in game]].<ref name=\"Kent_pp424_431\"/> The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan,<ref name=\"Kent_pp424_431\">{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Steven L. |authorlink=Steven L.

[[NEC]] had been the first to use CD technology in a video game console with their [[TurboGrafx-16#TurboGrafx-CD|PC Engine CD-ROM\u00b2 System]] add-on in October 1988 in Japan (launched in North America as the TurboGrafx-CD the following year), which sold 80,000 units in six months.<ref name=\"Sentinel\">{{cite news |title=CD+G to be Unveiled in May |author=Takiff, Jonathan |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:ORLB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB760D7A3006527&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0ECC86DE7A4704AD |newspaper=The Orlando Sentinel {{subscription required|via=[[NewsBank]]}} |date=April 29, 1989 |accessdate=December 21, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110080330/http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004 |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> That year, Nintendo announced a partnership with [[Sony]] to develop its own [[Super NES CD-ROM|CD-ROM peripheral]] for the SNES. [[Commodore International]] released their CD-based [[CDTV]] multimedia system in early 1991, while the [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] from [[Philips]] arrived towards the end of that year.<ref name=\"segacd\"/>\n\nShortly after the release of the Genesis, Sega's Consumer Products Research and Development Labs led by manager Tomio Takami were tasked with creating a CD-ROM add-on, which became the Sega CD. The Sega CD was originally intended to equal the capabilities of the TurboGrafx-CD, but with twice as much [[random-access memory]] (RAM), and sell for about [[Japanese yen|JP\u00a5]]20,000 (or [[United States dollar|US$]]150).<ref name=\"Takami\">{{cite journal|title=Behind the Screens at Sega of Japan|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|publisher=EGM Media, LLC.|issue=29|volume=3|date=December 1991|pages=115, 122}}</ref> In addition to relatively short loading times, Takami's team planned the device to feature [[2.5D|hardware]] [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]] and [[rotation]] similar to that of [[List of Sega arcade system boards|Sega's arcade games]], which required a dedicated [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).<ref name=\"Takami\"/><ref name=\"Siliconera\">{{cite web|publisher=Siliconera|title=Sega's Original Hardware Developer Talks About The Company's Past Consoles|author=Sato|date=September 18, 2013|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/09/18/segas-original-hardware-developer-talks-about-the-companys-past-consoles/|accessdate=December 21, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230217/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/09/18/segas-original-hardware-developer-talks-about-the-companys-past-consoles/|archivedate=December 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nHowever, two changes made later in development contributed to the final unit's higher-than-expected price.<ref name=\"Takami\" /> Because the Genesis' [[Motorola 68000]] CPU was too slow to handle the Sega CD's new graphical capabilities, an additional 68000 CPU was incorporated.<ref name=\"Takami\" /> In addition, upon hearing rumors that NEC planned a memory upgrade to the TurboGrafx-CD, which would bring its available RAM from 0.5 [[Megabit|Mbit]] to between 2 and 4 Mbit, Sega decided to increase the Sega CD's available RAM from 1 Mbit to 6 Mbit.<ref name=\"Takami\" /> This proved to be one of the greatest technical challenges since the CD's access speed was initially too slow to run programs effectively.<ref name=\"Siliconera\" /> The cost of the device was now estimated at $370, but market research convinced Sega executives that consumers would be willing to pay more for a state-of-the-art machine.<ref name=\"Takami\" /> Sega partnered with [[JVC]], which had been working with [[Warner Communications|Warner New Media]] to develop a CD player under the [[CD+G]] standard.<ref name=\"Sentinel\" /><ref name=\"economist\">{{cite news |title=Sega v Nintendo: Sonic Boom |newspaper=[[The Economist]] {{subscription required|via=[[ProQuest]]}}|date=January 25, 1992 |id={{ProQuest|224134880}} }}</ref>\n\nUntil mid-1991, Sega of America had been kept largely uninformed of the details of the project, without a functioning unit to test (although Sega of America was provided with preliminary technical documents earlier in the year).<ref>{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Ken |url=http://www.sega-16.com/2012/03/interview-scot-bayless/ |title=Interview:Scot Bayless |work=Sega-16 |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=November 11, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303233609/http://www.sega-16.com/2012/03/interview-scot-bayless/ |archivedate=March 3, 2012 }}</ref> According to former Sega of America executive producer Michael Latham, \"When you work at a multinational company, there are things that go well and there are things that don't.

Whereas [[ROM cartridge]]s of the day typically contained 8 to 16 megabits of data, a CD-ROM disc can hold more than 640 [[megabyte]]s of data, more than 320 times the storage of a Genesis cartridge.

It was released on December 12, 1991 in Japan, October 15, 1992 in North America, and April 2, 1993 in Europe. The Sega CD plays [[Compact disc|CD]]-based games and adds hardware functionality such as a faster [[central processing unit]] and graphic enhancements. It can also play audio CDs and [[CD+G]] discs.\n\nThe main benefit of CD technology was greater storage, which allowed for games to be nearly 320 times larger than Genesis cartridges. This benefit manifested as [[full motion video]] (FMV) games such as the controversial ''[[Night Trap]]'', which became a focus of the 1993 [[United States Congress|congressional]] hearings on issues of video game violence and ratings. Sega of Japan partnered with [[JVC]] to design the Sega CD and refused to consult with Sega of America until the project was complete. Sega of America assembled parts from various \"dummy\" units to obtain a working prototype. It was redesigned several times by Sega and licensed third-party developers.\n\nWhile the Sega CD became known for several well received games such as ''[[Sonic CD]]'' and ''[[Lunar: Eternal Blue]]'', its [[List of Sega CD games|game library]] contained many Genesis [[Port (video gaming)|ports]] and poorly received FMV games. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold by March 1996, after which Sega discontinued the system to focus on the [[Sega Saturn]].

When the system came out, CD-ROM technology was still in its infancy and companies had yet to get to grips with the possibilities it offered... quite simply, the Mega-CD was a console ahead of its time.\"<ref name=\"RetroGamer\" />\n\nThe poor support for the Sega CD has often been criticized as the first link in the devaluation of the Sega brand. Writing for IGN, Buchanan described an outside perspective on Sega's decision to release the Sega CD with its poor library and console support, stating, \"[T]he SEGA CD instead looked like a strange, desperate move\u2014something designed to nab some ink but without any real, thought-out strategy. Genesis owners that invested in the add-on were sorely disappointed, which undoubtedly helped sour the non-diehards on the brand.\"<ref name=\"CDFollies\" /> In reviewing for ''GamePro'', Snow commented that \"[the] Sega CD marked the first of several Sega systems that saw very poor support; something that devalued the once-popular Sega brand in the eyes of consumers, and something that would ultimately lead to the company's demise as a hardware maker.\"<ref name=\"failure\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/111822.shtml |title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time |author=Snow, Blake |date=July 30, 2007 |journal=GamePro |publisher=IDG |accessdate=May 20, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508014611/http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/111822.shtml|archivedate=May 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFormer Sega of America senior producer Scot Bayless attributes the unsuccessful market to a lack of direction from Sega with the add-on. According to Bayless, \"It was a fundamental paradigm shift with almost no thought given to consequences. I honestly don't think anyone at Sega asked the most important question: 'Why?' There's a rule I developed during my time as an engineer in the military aviation business: never fall in love with your tech. I think that's where the Mega-CD went off the rails.

However, some like [[Mase]]'s 1997 song \"Lookin' at Me\" from his album ''[[Harlem World]]'', and the most definite beginning of the distinctive \"Neptunes sound\", came with [[N.O.R.E]]'s \"Superthug\" in 1998, reaching number 36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and gaining them widespread attention for the first time.{{citation needed}}\n\n===1998\u20132004: The Neptunes===\n[[File:PHARRELL WILLIAMS by foto di matti.jpg|thumb|left|Pharrell Williams in Berlin, March 2005]]\nIn 2000, they produced the song \"[[I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)]]\" (featuring a chorus by Pharrell himself) for [[Jay Z]]'s album ''[[The Dynasty: Roc La Familia]]'', which released as the album's first single.   The song's sound and success sparked the interest of maturing pop artist\n[[Britney Spears]]. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 2001, Britney Spears released her third studio album, ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'', featuring the lead single \"[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]\", which was produced by The Neptunes.   \nThe song was a defining hit in both of their careers, and it was The Neptunes' first time having helped create an album that debuted number one in the [[Billboard 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1449404/20010928/nerd.jhtml|title=Neptunes\u2019 Pharrell Williams Rethinks R&B|work=MTV News|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> \nThe same year, [[N.E.R.D]], consisting of Williams, Hugo and Haley, released their first album, ''[[In Search Of...

The Neptunes and Williams specifically were also kept in public eye largely due to ties with [[Jay Z]], producing several hit singles for him and two tracks on his ''[[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]]''. The track \"[[Frontin']]\" was a big hit.{{citation needed}} A survey in August 2003 found the Neptunes produced almost 20 percent of songs played on British radio at the time, and a survey in the US had them at 43 percent.<ref name=Age/> The same year, the Neptunes remixed the [[Daft Punk]] song \"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\" for the duo's poorly received remix album ''[[Daft Club]]''.
