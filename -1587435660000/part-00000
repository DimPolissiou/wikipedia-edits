In practice, however, they are tightly [[coupling (computer programming)|coupled]] and rarely considered separately.\n\nIn addition to layout and rendering, a browser engine enforces the [[Content Security Policy|security policy]] between documents, handles navigation through [[hyperlink]]s and data submitted through [[form (HTML)|form]]s, and implements the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) [[data structure]] exposed to page [[scripting language|scripts]].\n\nExecuting [[JavaScript]] (JS) code is a separate matter, however, as every major web browser uses a [[JavaScript engine|dedicated engine]] for this. The JS language was originally created for use in browsers, but it is now used elsewhere too, so the implementation of JS engines is decoupled from browser engines. In a web browser, the two engines work in concert via the shared DOM data structure.\n\nBrowser engines are used in other types of programs besides web browsers. [[Email client]]s need them to display [[HTML email]].

Each style sheet is a series of rules which the browser engine interprets. For example, some rules specify [[Web typography|typography]] details, such as [[font]], color, and text size. The engine combines all relevant CSS rules to calculate precise graphical coordinates for the visual representation it will paint on the screen.<ref name=behindscene/>\n\nSome engines may begin rendering before all of a page's resources are downloaded.

His first solo novel, ''[[Tourist Season (novel)|Tourist Season]]'' (1986), featured a group of ragged eco-warriors who kidnap the [[Orange Bowl]] Queen in Miami.

This type of ''tub\u00e2'' is called ''bahal'' (for ''tub\u00e2'' aged this way for up to six months) and ''bahalina'' (for ''tub\u00e2'' aged thus for up to a year or more).

Typically the sap is collected from the cut flower of the palm tree. A container is fastened to the flower stump to collect the sap.  The white liquid that initially collects tends to be very sweet and non-[[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]ic before it is [[fermentation (food)|fermented]].  An alternative method is the falling of the entire tree.  Where this is practised, a fire is sometimes lit at the cut end to facilitate the collection of sap.\n\nPalm sap begins fermenting immediately after collection, due to natural [[yeast]]s in the air (often spurred by residual yeast left in the collecting container). Within two hours, fermentation yields an aromatic wine of up to 4% alcohol content, mildly [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicating]] and sweet. The wine may be allowed to ferment longer, up to a day, to yield a stronger, more sour and acidic taste, which some people prefer. Longer fermentation produces vinegar instead of stronger wine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0560e/x0560e09.htm|title=Fermented and vegetables. A global perspective.

In some parts of Cameroon, it is known as ''Afofo''. In parts of southern [[Ghana]] distilled palm wine is called ''[[Akpeteshie|akpeteshi]]'' or ''burukutu''.  In Togo and Benin it is called ''sodabe'', while in Tunisia it is called ''lagmi''. In coastal parts of Kenya, it is known as \"chang'aa\". Chang'aa can be applied to wounds to stop heavy bleeding{{fact|date=November 2019}} (mechanism of action not known). In Ivory Coast, it is called \"koutoukou\".\n\nIn the Philippines, the most common distilled palm liquor is ''[[lambanog]]'' which is made from aged ''[[tub\u00e2]]''. It has very high [[alcohol by volume]], at 40 to 45% [[alcohol by volume|abv]] (80 to 90 [[Proof (alcohol)|proof]]).<ref name=\"delish\">{{cite web |title=How Tuba and Bahalina, Also Known as Coconut Wine, Are Made |url=https://delishably.com/beverages/Tuba-or-Coconut-Wine-Making |website=Delishably |accessdate=21 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Sanchez\"/>\n\n==Consumption by region==\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:Refreshing palm wine.jpg|thumb|right|Palm wine is collected, fermented and stored in [[calabash]]es in [[Bandundu Province]], Democratic Republic of the Congo (c. 1990)]]\n\nIn Africa, the sap used to create palm wine is most often taken from wild [[date (fruit)|date]]palms such as the [[Phoenix sylvestris|silver date palm]] (''Phoenix sylvestris''), the [[Borassus|palmyra]], and the [[jaggery]] palm (''[[Caryota urens]]''), or from [[palm oil|oil]] palm such as the [[African Oil Palm]] (''Elaeis guineense'') or from ''[[Raffia palm]]s'', ''[[kithul]]'' palms, or ''[[Nypa fruticans|nipa]]'' palms. In part of central and western [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], palm wine is called ''malafu''. Palm wine tapping is mentioned in the novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' by the Nigerian writer [[Chinua Achebe]] and is central to the plot of the novel ''[[The Palm Wine Drinkard]]'' by Nigerian author [[Amos Tutuola]].\nPalm wine plays an important role in many ceremonies in parts of Nigeria such as among the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] peoples, and elsewhere in central and western Africa. Guests at weddings, birth celebrations, and funeral wakes are served generous quantities. Palm wine is often infused with medicinal herbs to remedy a wide variety of physical complaints. As a token of respect to deceased ancestors, many drinking sessions begin with a small amount of palm wine spilled on the ground (''Kulosa malafu'' in [[Kituba language|Kikongo ya Leta]]). Palm wine is enjoyed by men and women, although women usually drink it in less public venues.\n\nIn parts of southeastern Nigeria, namely Igboland, palm wine is locally referred to as \"mmanya ocha\" (literally, \"white drink\"), with \"ngwo\" and \"nkwu\" variants. It plays a very important role in traditional Igbo settings. In Urualla, for instance, and other \"ideator\" towns, it is the drink of choice for traditional weddings. A young man who is going for the first introduction at his in-laws\u2019 house is required to bring palm wine with him. There are varying gallons of palm wine required, depending on the customs of the different regions in Igboland. This culture can be observed in a similar fashion in the neighbouring north-western regions of Cameroon. (North West Region).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThere are four types of palm wine in the central and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. From the oil palm comes ''ngasi'', ''dibondo'' comes from the [[raffia palm]], ''cocoti'' from the coconut palm, and ''mahusu'' from a short palm which grows in the savannah areas of western [[Bandundu (province)|Bandundu]] and [[Kasai region|Kasai]] provinces.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Palm Wine Drawers 1870 India.jpg|thumb|right|Toddy drawer in India, 1870]]\n\nIn India and South Asia, [[coconut]] palms and [[Palmyra palm]]s such as the ''[[Arecaceae]]'' and ''[[Borassus]]'' are preferred. It is mainly produced from the lala palm (''[[Hyphaene coriacea]]'') by cutting the stem and collecting the sap. In some areas of India, palm wine is [[evaporation|evaporated]] to produce the unrefined sugar called [[jaggery]].{{clear left}}\n\n[[File:Toddy tapper (India).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A toddy tapper in the state of [[Telangana]] selling toddy (2014)]]\n\nIn parts of India, the unfermented sap is called ''[[neera]]'' (''pathaneer'' in [[Tamil Nadu]]) and is refrigerated, stored and distributed by semi-government agencies. A little [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] (calcium hydroxide) is added to the sap to prevent it from fermenting. ''Neera'', similar to fruit-juice products, is relatively rich in potassium.\n\nIn India, palm wine or toddy is served as either ''[[neera]]'' or ''pathaneer'' (a sweet, non-alcoholic beverage derived from fresh sap) or ''kallu'' (a sour beverage made from fermented sap, but not as strong as wine).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianwine.org/winetoddy.htm|title=WebHost4Life|website=indianwine.org|access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref> Palm sap contains natural yeasts, which perform the fermentation of glucose to alcohol, as well as [[acetobacter]], which subsequently converts the alcohol to acetic acid (vinegar). Optimal consumption time is one day after tapping, when the vinegar content is minimal; beyond this time, it becomes increasingly sour. Some palm wine drinkers prefer their beverage more sour than usual, but fermenting for too long will result in vinegar rather than wine. Refrigeration extends beverage life, as do a variety of spices, which also contribute flavor.\n\nIn India, palm wine is usually available at [[toddy shop]]s (known as ''Kallu Shaap'' in [Malayalam], ''Kallu Kadai'' in [Tamil], ''Kalitha Gadang'' in [[Tulu language|Tulu]], ''Kallu Dukanam'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], ''Kallu Angadi'' in [[Kannada]] or \"Liquor Shop\" in English). In [[Tamil Nadu]], this beverage is currently banned, though the legality fluctuates with politics. In the absence of legal toddy, [[moonshine]] distillers of arrack often sell [[methanol]]-contaminated alcohol, which can have lethal consequences. To discourage this practice, authorities have pushed for inexpensive \"[[Indian Made Foreign Liquor]]\" (IMFL).\n\nIn states of [[Telangana]], Andhra Pradesh (India), toddy is a popular drink in rural parts that is frequently consumed at the end of the day after work.\n\nThere are two main types of ''kallu'' in states of [[Telangana]] and Andhra Pradesh, namely ''[[Thadi Kallu]]'' (from Toddy Palmyra trees) and ''[[Eetha Kallu]]'' (from [[Phoenix sylvestris|silver date palms]]). ''Eetha Kallu'' is very sweet and less intoxicating, whereas ''Thati Kallu'' is stronger (sweet in the morning, becoming sour to bitter-sour in the evening) and is highly intoxicating. People enjoy ''kallu'' right at the trees where it is brought down. They drink out of leaves by holding them to their mouths while the Goud pours the ''kallu'' from the ''binki'' (''kallu'' pot). There are different types of toddy (''kallu'') according to the season: 1. ''poddathadu'', 2. ''parpudthadu'', 3. ''pandudthadu'', {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}.\n\nIn the Indian state of [[Kerala]], toddy is used in leavening (as a substitute for yeast) a local form of [[appam|hopper]] called the \"Vellayappam\". Toddy is mixed with rice dough and left overnight to aid in fermentation and expansion of the dough causing the dough to rise overnight, making the bread soft when prepared.\n\nIn Kerala, toddy is sold under a licence issued by the excise department and it is an industry having more than 50,000 employees with a welfare board under the labour department. It is also used in the preparation of a soft variety of [[Sanna (dish)|Sanna]], which is famous in the parts of [[Karnataka]] and [[Goa]] in India.\n\n===Indonesia and Malaysia===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een palmwijnverkoper en een inheemse soldaat TMnr 3728-732.jpg|thumb|upright|Lithograph of a palm wine vendor and a native [[KNIL]] soldier consuming tuak (1854)]]\n\n''Tuak'' is imbibed in [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Kalimantan]] and [[Bali]] of Indonesia and parts of Malaysia such as [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in [[East Malaysia]].

Typically the sap is collected from the cut flower of the palm tree. A container is fastened to the flower stump to collect the sap.  The white liquid that initially collects tends to be very sweet and non-[[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]ic before it is [[fermentation (food)|fermented]].  An alternative method is the falling of the entire tree.  Where this is practised, a fire is sometimes lit at the cut end to facilitate the collection of sap.\n\nPalm sap begins fermenting immediately after collection, due to natural [[yeast]]s in the air (often spurred by residual yeast left in the collecting container). Within two hours, fermentation yields an aromatic wine of up to 4% alcohol content, mildly [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicating]] and sweet. The wine may be allowed to ferment longer, up to a day, to yield a stronger, more sour and acidic taste, which some people prefer. Longer fermentation produces vinegar instead of stronger wine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0560e/x0560e09.htm|title=Fermented and vegetables. A global perspective.

In some parts of Cameroon, it is known as ''Afofo''. In parts of southern [[Ghana]] distilled palm wine is called ''[[Akpeteshie|akpeteshi]]'' or ''burukutu''.  In Togo and Benin it is called ''sodabe'', while in Tunisia it is called ''lagmi''. In coastal parts of Kenya, it is known as \"chang'aa\". Chang'aa can be applied to wounds to stop heavy bleeding{{fact|date=November 2019}} (mechanism of action not known). In Ivory Coast, it is called \"koutoukou\".\n\nIn the Philippines, the most common distilled palm liquor is ''[[lambanog]]'' which is made from aged ''[[tub\u00e2]]''. It has very high [[alcohol by volume]], at 40 to 45% [[alcohol by volume|abv]] (80 to 90 [[Proof (alcohol)|proof]]).<ref name=\"delish\">{{cite web |title=How Tuba and Bahalina, Also Known as Coconut Wine, Are Made |url=https://delishably.com/beverages/Tuba-or-Coconut-Wine-Making |website=Delishably |accessdate=21 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Sanchez\"/>\n\n==Consumption by region==\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:Refreshing palm wine.jpg|thumb|right|Palm wine is collected, fermented and stored in [[calabash]]es in [[Bandundu Province]], Democratic Republic of the Congo (c. 1990)]]\n\nIn Africa, the sap used to create palm wine is most often taken from wild [[date (fruit)|date]]palms such as the [[Phoenix sylvestris|silver date palm]] (''Phoenix sylvestris''), the [[Borassus|palmyra]], and the [[jaggery]] palm (''[[Caryota urens]]''), or from [[palm oil|oil]] palm such as the [[African Oil Palm]] (''Elaeis guineense'') or from ''[[Raffia palm]]s'', ''[[kithul]]'' palms, or ''[[Nypa fruticans|nipa]]'' palms. In part of central and western [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], palm wine is called ''malafu''. Palm wine tapping is mentioned in the novel ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' by the Nigerian writer [[Chinua Achebe]] and is central to the plot of the novel ''[[The Palm Wine Drinkard]]'' by Nigerian author [[Amos Tutuola]].\nPalm wine plays an important role in many ceremonies in parts of Nigeria such as among the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] peoples, and elsewhere in central and western Africa. Guests at weddings, birth celebrations, and funeral wakes are served generous quantities. Palm wine is often infused with medicinal herbs to remedy a wide variety of physical complaints. As a token of respect to deceased ancestors, many drinking sessions begin with a small amount of palm wine spilled on the ground (''Kulosa malafu'' in [[Kituba language|Kikongo ya Leta]]). Palm wine is enjoyed by men and women, although women usually drink it in less public venues.\n\nIn parts of southeastern Nigeria, namely Igboland, palm wine is locally referred to as \"mmanya ocha\" (literally, \"white drink\"), with \"ngwo\" and \"nkwu\" variants. It plays a very important role in traditional Igbo settings. In Urualla, for instance, and other \"ideator\" towns, it is the drink of choice for traditional weddings. A young man who is going for the first introduction at his in-laws\u2019 house is required to bring palm wine with him. There are varying gallons of palm wine required, depending on the customs of the different regions in Igboland. This culture can be observed in a similar fashion in the neighbouring north-western regions of Cameroon. (North West Region).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThere are four types of palm wine in the central and southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. From the oil palm comes ''ngasi'', ''dibondo'' comes from the [[raffia palm]], ''cocoti'' from the coconut palm, and ''mahusu'' from a short palm which grows in the savannah areas of western [[Bandundu (province)|Bandundu]] and [[Kasai region|Kasai]] provinces.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Palm Wine Drawers 1870 India.jpg|thumb|right|Toddy drawer in India, 1870]]\n\nIn India and South Asia, [[coconut]] palms and [[Palmyra palm]]s such as the ''[[Arecaceae]]'' and ''[[Borassus]]'' are preferred. It is mainly produced from the lala palm (''[[Hyphaene coriacea]]'') by cutting the stem and collecting the sap. In some areas of India, palm wine is [[evaporation|evaporated]] to produce the unrefined sugar called [[jaggery]].{{clear left}}\n\n[[File:Toddy tapper (India).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A toddy tapper in the state of [[Telangana]] selling toddy (2014)]]\n\nIn parts of India, the unfermented sap is called ''[[neera]]'' (''pathaneer'' in [[Tamil Nadu]]) and is refrigerated, stored and distributed by semi-government agencies. A little [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] (calcium hydroxide) is added to the sap to prevent it from fermenting. ''Neera'', similar to fruit-juice products, is relatively rich in potassium.\n\nIn India, palm wine or toddy is served as either ''[[neera]]'' or ''pathaneer'' (a sweet, non-alcoholic beverage derived from fresh sap) or ''kallu'' (a sour beverage made from fermented sap, but not as strong as wine).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianwine.org/winetoddy.htm|title=WebHost4Life|website=indianwine.org|access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref> Palm sap contains natural yeasts, which perform the fermentation of glucose to alcohol, as well as [[acetobacter]], which subsequently converts the alcohol to acetic acid (vinegar). Optimal consumption time is one day after tapping, when the vinegar content is minimal; beyond this time, it becomes increasingly sour. Some palm wine drinkers prefer their beverage more sour than usual, but fermenting for too long will result in vinegar rather than wine. Refrigeration extends beverage life, as do a variety of spices, which also contribute flavor.\n\nIn India, palm wine is usually available at [[toddy shop]]s (known as ''Kallu Shaap'' in [Malayalam], ''Kallu Kadai'' in [Tamil], ''Kalitha Gadang'' in [[Tulu language|Tulu]], ''Kallu Dukanam'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], ''Kallu Angadi'' in [[Kannada]] or \"Liquor Shop\" in English). In [[Tamil Nadu]], this beverage is currently banned, though the legality fluctuates with politics. In the absence of legal toddy, [[moonshine]] distillers of arrack often sell [[methanol]]-contaminated alcohol, which can have lethal consequences. To discourage this practice, authorities have pushed for inexpensive \"[[Indian Made Foreign Liquor]]\" (IMFL).\n\nIn states of [[Telangana]], Andhra Pradesh (India), toddy is a popular drink in rural parts that is frequently consumed at the end of the day after work.\n\nThere are two main types of ''kallu'' in states of [[Telangana]] and Andhra Pradesh, namely ''[[Thadi Kallu]]'' (from Toddy Palmyra trees) and ''[[Eetha Kallu]]'' (from [[Phoenix sylvestris|silver date palms]]). ''Eetha Kallu'' is very sweet and less intoxicating, whereas ''Thati Kallu'' is stronger (sweet in the morning, becoming sour to bitter-sour in the evening) and is highly intoxicating. People enjoy ''kallu'' right at the trees where it is brought down. They drink out of leaves by holding them to their mouths while the Goud pours the ''kallu'' from the ''binki'' (''kallu'' pot). There are different types of toddy (''kallu'') according to the season: 1. ''poddathadu'', 2. ''parpudthadu'', 3. ''pandudthadu'', {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}.\n\nIn the Indian state of [[Kerala]], toddy is used in leavening (as a substitute for yeast) a local form of [[appam|hopper]] called the \"Vellayappam\". Toddy is mixed with rice dough and left overnight to aid in fermentation and expansion of the dough causing the dough to rise overnight, making the bread soft when prepared.\n\nIn Kerala, toddy is sold under a licence issued by the excise department and it is an industry having more than 50,000 employees with a welfare board under the labour department. It is also used in the preparation of a soft variety of [[Sanna (dish)|Sanna]], which is famous in the parts of [[Karnataka]] and [[Goa]] in India.\n\n===Indonesia and Malaysia===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een palmwijnverkoper en een inheemse soldaat TMnr 3728-732.jpg|thumb|upright|Lithograph of a palm wine vendor and a native [[KNIL]] soldier consuming tuak (1854)]]\n\n''Tuak'' is imbibed in [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Kalimantan]] and [[Bali]] of Indonesia and parts of Malaysia such as [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in [[East Malaysia]].

They are gathered mostly from [[coconut]]s, [[nipa palm]]s, or [[kaong palm]]s. Palm wines fermented for a few days to a few weeks are generally referred to as [[tuba (wine)|tub\u00e2]]. There are two notable traditional derivations of tub\u00e2 with higher alcohol contents. The first is the ''[[lambanog]]'' of [[Luzon]] island in the northern Philippines that distilled and is milky white to clear in colour. The second, is the ''[[bahalina]]'' of the [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]] islands which is typically deep brown-orange in colour due to the use of bark extracts from the mangrove ''[[Ceriops tagal]]''.<ref name=\"delish\"/><ref name=\"Sanchez\"/>\n\nOther types of palm wines indigenous to the islands include subtypes of tub\u00e2 like ''[[tuhak]]'' or ''tub\u00e2 sa hidikup'' which is made from [[kaong palm]] sap, and ''[[tunggang]]'' which is made from [[fishtail palm]] sap.<ref name=\"Sanchez\">{{cite book |last1=Sanchez |first1=Priscilla C. |title=Philippine Fermented Foods: Principles and Technology |date=2008 |publisher=UP Press |isbn=9789715425544 |pages=151\u2013153 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=smfr-KYgtWkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT174#v=onepage}}</ref>\n\n===South America===\nProduction of palm wine may have contributed to the endangered status of the [[Jubaea|Chilean wine palm]] (''Jubaea chilensis'').<ref>C.

Karewe is boiled to reduce into a thick light brown liquid, called ''kamwaimwai'', used as sweetener and spread.\n\n==Consumption by animals==\nSome small [[pollinating]] mammals consume large amounts of fermented palm nectar as part of their diet, especially the southeast Asian [[pen-tailed treeshrew]]. The [[inflorescence]]s of the bertam palm contain populations of [[yeast]] which ferment the nectar in the flowers to up to 3.8% alcohol (average: 0.6%). The treeshrews metabolise the alcohol very efficiently and do not appear to become drunk from the fermented nectar.<ref>Frank Wiens, Annette Zitzmann, Marc-Andr\u00e9 Lachance, Michel Yegles, Fritz Pragst, Friedrich M.

The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.\n\nThe male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.\n\nThis little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es with tall vegetation such as [[cattail]]s across [[North America]]. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and [[Mexico]]. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.<ref>Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory</ref>\n\n== Foraging and diet ==\nThese birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch [[insect]]s in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s and [[snail]]s. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids  (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent. Ants and wasps were observed to be mostly eaten in the fall.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory|title=Marsh Wren|last=|first=|date=|website=All About Birds|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Beal|first=F.

The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.\n\nThe male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.\n\nThis little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es with tall vegetation such as [[cattail]]s across [[North America]]. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and [[Mexico]]. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.<ref>Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory</ref>\n\n== Foraging and diet ==\nThese birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch [[insect]]s in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s and [[snail]]s. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids  (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent. Ants and wasps were observed to be mostly eaten in the fall.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory|title=Marsh Wren|last=|first=|date=|website=All About Birds|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Beal|first=F.

The smartphone weighs {{Convert|154|g|oz}}. \n\nIt is equipped with Samsung's in-house octa-core Exynos 7870 which is clocked at a maximum of 1.6 GHz.\n\nCharging the phone's 3,000 mAh lithium-ion battery takes about 2.5 hours on its micro-USB port.\n\nThe phone comes with a single 13 MP rear camera with autofocus coupled with an LED flash. The front shooter has 8 MP also with its own front flash. The phone's cameras work well in daylight, though most criticisms point out the bad performance of the cameras in low light.\n\n==Software==\nThe Samsung Galaxy J6 2018 comes with Android 8.0 (Oreo) out of the box with Samsung Experience UI. Samsung's own Bixby is present as \"Bixby Home\" on the phone though lacks the assistant features found on the flagship S and Note series phones.\n\nIn May 2019, Samsung started rolling out its OTA software update for the Galaxy J6 to have the latest Android 9.0 (Pie) with One UI that also comes with Galaxy S10 phones. The update added features like night mode and a re-styled user interface.\n\nThe phone is secured either by PIN, pattern, password, fingerprint, or facial recognition.

Announced on May 22, 2018 and released the same day along with the [[Samsung Galaxy J4]] and the [[Samsung Galaxy J8]], the J6 is a mid-range model smartphone and a successor to the [[Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017)]]. \n\nThe Galaxy J6 is the first in the J-series phones to have a near bezel-less design and to feature a sAMOLED 18.5:9 display. \n\nIt has a similar hardware design and software features to its high-end counterpart, the [[Samsung Galaxy A6 / A6+|Galaxy A6]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_j600f_galaxy_j6-5375.php|title=Samsung J600F Galaxy J6 - Full phone specifications|work=gsmarena.com|accessdate=22 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe J6 is succeeded by the J6+ which featured a larger screen albeit switching from the sAMOLED screen found on the J6 to an LCD one.\n\n==Hardware==\n[[File: Samsung Galaxy J6 purple lavender.jpg|thumb|Rear face with fingerprint sensor of the Samsung Galaxy J6 purple lavender 4GB RAM/64GB ROM.]]\nThe Samsung Galaxy J6 features a 720p Super AMOLED display, with an 18:5:9 aspect ratio dubbed as Samsung's \u2018Infinity Display\u2019. The J6 has a 5.6-inch panel, having around ~76.5% screen-to-body ratio and 294 ppi which was much similar to previous ones in the same line up. The J6's screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/products-with-gorilla-glass/smartphones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-j6.html|title=Samsung Galaxy J6 {{!}} Samsung {{!}} Corning Gorilla Glass|website=www.corning.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nThe rear body is made out of plastic (specifically polycarbonate) with the intention to give it the same premium feel as metal-back phones.\n\nThe dimensions of the Samsung Galaxy J6 are 149.3 x 70.2 x 8.2 (height x width x thickness). The smartphone weighs {{Convert|154|g|oz}}. \n\nIt is equipped with Samsung's in-house octa-core Exynos 7870 which is clocked at a maximum of 1.6 GHz.\n\nCharging the phone's 3,000 mAh lithium-ion battery takes about 2.5 hours on its micro-USB port.\n\nThe phone comes with a single 13 MP rear camera with autofocus coupled with an LED flash. The front shooter has 8 MP also with its own front flash. The phone's cameras work well in daylight, though most criticisms point out the bad performance of the cameras in low light.\n\n==Software==\nThe Samsung Galaxy J6 2018 comes with Android 8.0 (Oreo) out of the box with Samsung Experience UI. Samsung's own Bixby is present as \"Bixby Home\" on the phone though lacks the assistant features found on the flagship S and Note series phones.\n\nIn May 2019, Samsung started rolling out its OTA software update for the Galaxy J6 to have the latest Android 9.0 (Pie) with One UI that also comes with Galaxy S10 phones. The update added features like night mode and a re-styled user interface.\n\nThe phone is secured either by PIN, pattern, password, fingerprint, or facial recognition. Using the fingerprint and/or facial recognition requires one of the three aforementioned traditional security inputs.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The Editorial Board of the ''Wall Street Journal'', is among those who feel the world would have been \"better prepared\" had the WHO declared a \"Public Health Emergency\" weeks before it did, since the virus had by then spread to other countries and had already taken on the attributes of a pandemic.<ref name=wsj-info /> Brazil's Health Minister likewise felt the WHO was too slow in declaring the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, which it did six weeks later, thereby complicating Brazil's ability to fully prepare for and curb the spread of the virus after it arrived.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/who-s-pandemic-declaration-came-too-late-brazil-says \"WHO's Pandemic Declaration Came Too Late, Brazil Says\"], 'Bloomberg'', March 11, 2020</ref> By the time it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had already spread across all continents except Antarctica, to 110 countries, leaving less time for some countries to fully prepare their emergency health organizations.<ref>[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/9/21163412/who-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-world-health-organization \"Why the WHO waited to call the coronavirus a pandemic\"], ''Vox'', March 11, 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-become-pandemic-and-why-it-matters/#close \"Coronavirus is officially a pandemic.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Sonification does not necessarily need to represent huge amounts of data in sound, but may only convey one or few data values in a sound. To give an example, imagine a light switch that, on activation would create a short sound that depends on the electric power consumed through the cable: more energy-wasting lamps would perhaps systematically result in more annoying switch sounds. This example shows that sonification aims to provide some information by using its systematic transformation into sound.\n\nThe integration of data-driven elements in interaction sound may serve different purposes: \n*  to allow the users to refine their actions via auditory feedback. Example: the sonification-enhanced drilling machine<ref>Tobias Grosshauser and Thomas Hermann, (2010). \"Multimodal closed-loop Human Machine Interaction\" Proc. Interactive Sonification Workshop, Stockholm, http://interactive-sonification.org/ISon2010/proceedings</ref> which indicates by sound when a wanted orientation to the wall is reached.\n* to create a sonic [[:wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] for the interaction which allows users to compare the detailed performance on repeated interactions: for instance rowing strokes may be sonified so that the sportsmen can better synchronize their action.\n* to enable novel functions that would otherwise be not available (e.g. a bottle that displays by sound how much fluid is poured into glasses so that the users can more easily fill the equal amount of liquid in different glasses).\n\nWithin the field of sonification, sonic interaction design acknowledges the importance of human [[interaction]] for understanding and using auditory [[feedback]].<ref>Thomas Hermann, and Andy Hunt, (2005). \"Guest Editors' Introduction: An Introduction to Interactive Sonification\".

Interactive Sonification Workshop, Stockholm, http://interactive-sonification.org/ISon2010/proceedings</ref> which indicates by sound when a wanted orientation to the wall is reached.\n* to create a sonic [[:wikt:gestalt|gestalt]] for the interaction which allows users to compare the detailed performance on repeated interactions: for instance rowing strokes may be sonified so that the sportsmen can better synchronize their action.\n* to enable novel functions that would otherwise be not available (e.g. a bottle that displays by sound how much fluid is poured into glasses so that the users can more easily fill the equal amount of liquid in different glasses).\n\nWithin the field of sonification, sonic interaction design acknowledges the importance of human [[interaction]] for understanding and using auditory [[feedback]].<ref>Thomas Hermann, and Andy Hunt, (2005). \"Guest Editors' Introduction: An Introduction to Interactive Sonification\".

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

That night, after barging into the house, when Harun went to search for items to rob, Yasin restrained Poon, and raped the woman. While Yasin was sitting on her chest as he was trying to rape her, Poon suffered fractures on her ribs and she died as a result. Her body was taken to the beach and dumped in the sea, where it was fished out by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when Harun was arrested for an unrelated case of theft, he surprised his interrogators by confessing that he was involved in the robbery. This led to Yasin's arrest and both men were charged with murder. At the end of the trial in early 1974, Harun was convicted of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was sentenced to death for murdering Poon. Although Yasin's appeal against the death sentence was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. Yasin was later charged with rape, but he denied raping the elderly woman at the trial. Yasin was eventually found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to 8 years' jail, and that sentence was ordered to run consecutively with the jail term he received for causing Poon's death.\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide any evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty of the murder of Liang Shan Shan and sentenced him to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence while he was forced to help dispose the body out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged and sentenced both of them to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. On 3 March 1997, Abdul Nasir was found guilty of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray accepted that Abdul Nasir did not make any threats on the hostages' lives and never harmed the hostages, and thus he sentenced Abdul Nasir to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should be run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

That night, after barging into the house, when Harun went to search for items to rob, Yasin restrained Poon, and raped the woman. While Yasin was sitting on her chest as he was trying to rape her, Poon suffered fractures on her ribs and she died as a result. Her body was taken to the beach and dumped in the sea, where it was fished out by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when Harun was arrested for an unrelated case of theft, he surprised his interrogators by confessing that he was involved in the robbery. This led to Yasin's arrest and both men were charged with murder. At the end of the trial in early 1974, Harun was convicted of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was sentenced to death for murdering Poon. Although Yasin's appeal against the death sentence was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. Yasin was later charged with rape, but he denied raping the elderly woman at the trial. Yasin was eventually found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to 8 years' jail, and that sentence was ordered to run consecutively with the jail term he received for causing Poon's death.\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide any evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty of the murder of Liang Shan Shan and sentenced him to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. On 3 March 1997, Abdul Nasir was found guilty of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray accepted that Abdul Nasir did not make any threats on the hostages' lives and never harmed the hostages, and thus he sentenced Abdul Nasir to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should be run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.
