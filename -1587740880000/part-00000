After losing to the man, Death declares \"Bollocks to this!\" and attacks the man with his [[scythe]]. The horror movie-themed opening credits are followed by Mike, Rick, Vyvyan and Neil carrying a coffin through a local [[cemetery]] (except Mike, who has his hand up but is not touching the coffin). The coffin is brought to a freshly-dug grave where a passing woman asks a [[spade]]-holding Neil if he digs graves, to which Neil replies, \"Yeah, they're all right.\" After encountering a drunken vicar and two gravediggers, the episode then takes a flashback to events leading up to the burial. It is bath night, and while Neil jumps into the muddy bathwater used in the three others' previous baths (inadvertently finding his long-lost [[bicycle]] in the process), Rick locks himself in his room and gets on his bed for a sneaky read of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' - only to nearly get cut in half by Vyvyan's cleverly placed circular saw. Mike and Vyvyan spend the time trying to set up the new [[VCR|video recorder]] they have secured, in order to watch a [[video nasty]]. A scene-stealing [[postman]] then arrives to deliver a human-shaped package from the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]. After falling out of the bathroom window and having his bedroom boarded up, Neil arrives downstairs wearing a dress he found in Rick's room (with Rick's name tagged in the back). Neil briefly gets the video machine to work by plugging it - but suffers a sustained electric shock in the process - and the group is shown a commercial for a [[analgesic|women's pain reliever]] set in [[Hell]].\n\nAfter the video stops working once again, the package delivered earlier has opened. This turns out to be a vampire, who claims he is really just a driving instructor from [[Johannesburg]]. The vampire chases the boys, but stops to use the toilet. Locked in the toilet, the vampire's driving instructor ruse fails when he incorrectly answers Vyvyan's ''[[The Highway Code|Highway Code]]'' question about what to do when crossing a [[humpback bridge]]. When the four realise that vampires only attack [[virgin]]s, it leads to them all unconvincingly denying their sexual purity. But when the vampire returns downstairs, he is hit by sunlight streaming through the window (as he still has his wristwatch set to South African time) - and he is placed inside a dual-purpose [[couch|sofa]]-[[coffin]]. The scene flash-forwards back to the graveyard, where Mike realises it is half-past nine. The vampire then comes out from the coffin and reveals himself to be Harry the Bastard, an employee from [[Rumbelows]] from whom they rented the video machine. Harry announces that their deadline for returning the machine has just elapsed and they now owe him \u00a3500 in late fees. As the closing line of the episode, the entire gang at the grave site turn to the camera and say, \"Well, what a complete bastard!\" The closing credits play over Death and the man from the chess match (who is now a ghost) arguing at a golf hole.\n\n==Characters==\nAs with all episodes of ''The Young Ones'', the main four characters were student flatmates Mike ([[Christopher Ryan]]); Vyvyan ([[Adrian Edmondson]]); Rick ([[Rik Mayall]]) and Neil ([[Nigel Planer]]). [[Alexei Sayle]] starred as the [[South Africa]]n [[vampire]]-slash-driving instructor. [[Monty Python]] alumnus [[Terry Jones]] makes a cameo as a drunken [[vicar]] and comedy duo [[Hale & Pace]] appear as a pair of gravediggers that the lads tell their story to. [[Arnold Brown (comedian)|Arnold Brown]] appears as the man in the opening scene playing chess against Death. [[Dawn French]] and [[Helen Atkinson-Wood]] appear in the pain reliever commercial set in Hell.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe opening scene of a man playing chess with [[Death (personification)|Death]] is a homage to the best known scene in [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s film, ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' (1957). At the grave site when the vicar says \u2019Ashes to ashes\u2019, Rick responds with \u2018Funk to funky, we all know Major Tom's a junkie\u2019, referencing lyrics from the [[David Bowie]] song \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\". Later in the episode, Rick proclaims to Neil that the bathroom is free \u2018unlike the country\u2019 and refers to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as a \u2018[[Thatcherite]] [[Military junta|Junta]]\u2019. Rick also appears to gain [[sexual gratification]] from looking at a copy of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''. Alexei Sayle's character - in a monologue about being a [[Marxist]] comedian - complains that while his comrades are selling the ''[[Socialist Worker]]'', he has to sell the ''[[TV Times]]''. Sayle continues his monologue to reassure his comrades that he has not \u2018[[selling out|sold out]]\u2019, then proceeds to do an advertisement for [[Pot Noodle]]. The episode also features [[punk rock|punk]] band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], performing ''Nasty'', a song written especially for the episode.\n\nAfter being told to shut up by Vyvyan, the postman responds, \"Little squirt!

Curing eye trouble. Wellcome M0002533.jpg|thumb|St Oswald's Well, believed to cure eye trouble. Image from Hope's book on Holy Wells.]]\n=== Saxon times ===\nThe [[Battle of Maserfield]] is thought to have been fought there in 642, between the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon kings]] [[Penda of Mercia]] and [[Oswald of Northumbria]]. Oswald was killed in this battle and was dismembered; according to legend, one of his arms was carried to an ash tree by a raven, and miracles were subsequently attributed to the tree (as Oswald was considered a saint). Thus it is believed that the name of the site is derived from a reference to \"Oswald's Tree\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThere is an alternative view that Oswestry  was named after Oswy,Oswald's brother, who fought a battle here against King Penda in 655 AD. Oswy became King of Northumbria after Oswald's death. The battle of 655 AD was fought near to a river called the Winwead, which it is believed, was the nearby River Vyrnwy. Welsh folklore has it that this battle was called the battle of Pengwern and in it their leader Cynddyllan was also killed. Oswy had Penda beheaded and no doubt placed it  on a stake or on a branch of a tree as was the practice. Hence the name ''Oswy's~tree''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe spring, Oswald's Well, is supposed to have originated where the bird dropped the arm from the tree, though one historian suggested that it was likely to have been a [[pagan]] spring, in use long before the Saxon battle. The water from the well was believed to have healing properties, particularly for curing eye trouble.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hope|first1=Robert Charles|title=The legendary lore of the holy wells of England: including rivers, lakes, fountains and springs|date=1893|publisher=Elliot Stock|location=London|pages=143-145|url=https://archive.org/stream/legendaryloreofh00hope#page/142/mode/2up/search/oswald|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> [[Offa's Dyke]] runs near the well, to the west.\n\n=== The Conquest ===\nThe [[Domesday Book]] (1086) records a castle being built by Rainald, a [[Normans|Norman]] [[High Sheriff of Shropshire|Sheriff of Shropshire]]: {{lang|fr|L'oeuvre}} ({{langnf||French|The work}}) \u2013 see [[Oswestry Castle]].\n\n[[Alan fitz Flaad]] (died c.1120), a Breton knight, was granted the feudal barony of Oswestry<ref>Burke, Messrs., John and John Bernard, ''The Royal Families of England, Scotland, and Wales, and Their Descendants'' &c., volume 2, London, 1851, p. xl.</ref> by King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] who, soon after his accession, invited Alan to England with other [[Brittany|Breton]] friends, and gave him forfeited lands in [[Norfolk]] and [[Shropshire]], including some which had previously belonged to [[Ernulf de Hesdin]] (killed at [[Antioch]] while on crusade) and [[Robert of Bell\u00eame, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|Robert of Bell\u00eame]].<ref>Ritchie, R.

The A5 continues from [[Shrewsbury]] to the north, passing the town, before turning west near [[Chirk]] and entering Wales.\n\nBus services are operated by [[Arriva Midlands]] and local independents [[Tanat Valley Coaches]], Lakeside Coaches and Owen's Travelmaster. The town has regular bus routes that link nearby villages and towns including [[Wrexham bus station|Wrexham]] and Shrewsbury.\n\nGobowen railway station is 2 miles from the northern edge of Oswestry.

Opened in 1840, the section from [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] to [[Welshpool]] (Buttington Junction), via [[Ellesmere, Shropshire|Ellesmere]], [[Whittington, Shropshire|Whittington]], Oswestry and [[Llanymynech]], closed on 18 January 1965, leaving only a short branch line  from {{stnlnk|Gobowen}} to continue to serve Oswestry \u2013 but only until 7 November 1966. This former [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) branch had once run into a separate GWR Oswestry terminus, but this has long since disappeared and the land redeveloped as a bus station and supermarket. Trains were re-routed into the main Cambrian station from 7 July 1924.\n\n[[File:Oswestry railway station geograph-2510794-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|Down stopping train at Oswestry in 1960]]\n\nThe main building of the Cambrian station is still a prominent landmark in the town centre: it once housed the headquarters of the Cambrian Railways company. After restoration, this building was reopened as the Cambrian Visitor Centre in June 2006 but closed on 11 January 2008.  It later reopened, and has since evolved into the headquarters of the [[Cambrian Heritage Railways]] (CHR) and a small catering establishment known as \"Buffers\"; other parts of the building have been converted into retail and office units to contribute to the upkeep of the building.\n\nA single railway track still runs through the station, once overgrown and rusting, it has been cleared and repaired and is the subject of an ambitious plan to reopen the line as a steam heritage railway between Oswestry and [[Llanyblodwel]] and [[Pant, Shropshire|Pant]] (to link with the restored [[Montgomery Canal]] \u2013 see above), and as a sustainable community transport rail link from Oswestry to the [[National Rail]] railway station at Gobowen.\n\nBy 2013, the main \"up\" platform at Oswestry station had been reconstructed and some new semaphore signalling installed. The branch-line track-bed from south of Gobowen to Llanyblodwel is now owned by Shropshire Council, who lease the land to CHR, a registered charity. Work is advancing in securing the transfer of the existing Transport & Works Act Order (TWAO) from [[Network Rail]] to CHR. The aim was for this transfer to be completed by 2014, and for the railway line between Gobowen and Oswestry to be fully re-instated and operational by 2017; however the legal process of the TWAO Unit administering a form of written debate between the proposer and objectors with a guided number of exchanges, was still ongoing in mid 2016. CHR purchase of the final section of the Oswestry to Gobowen railway branch line was completed in April 2016; nevertheless, other hurdles to becoming operational, such as permissions and finances to reinstate the level crossings on the main A5/A483 Trunk Roads, will also need to be overcome.\n\nImmediately to the south of Oswestry Railway Station is the Cambrian Railways Museum; while a short distance to the north are the \"listed\" Works Bridge and the former [[Cambrian Railways works]], which are now occupied by a variety of local commerce concerns and Oswestry's Community Health Centre and ambulance facility.\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Beduoins day.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Oswestry Cricket Club's pavilion, August 2010]]\nSince 2013, the town has been represented in [[Association football|football]] by [[F.C. Oswestry Town]], who are currently members of the [[North West Counties Football League]] Division One South. The former local football club, [[Oswestry Town F.C.]], was one of the few English teams to compete in the [[Welsh Premier League|League of Wales]]. It also won the [[Welsh Cup]] in 1884, 1901 and 1907.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/sieger/wal-welsh-cup/|title=Welsh Cup \" Champions|work=worldfootball.net|accessdate=17 May 2015}}</ref> The club folded due to financial difficulties in 2003 and merged with Total Network Solutions F.C. of [[Llansantffraid-ym-Mechain|Llansantffraid]], a village eight miles (13&nbsp;km) away on the Welsh side of the border. Following the takeover of the club's sponsor in 2006, the club was renamed as [[The New Saints F.C.|The New Saints]]. They moved to the redeveloped [[Park Hall (football ground)|Park Hall Stadium]] on the outskirts of the town in September 2007. The New Saints or TNS is a [[Full-time job|full-time]]-[[Professional sport|professional]] [[Association football|football]] club that play in the [[Welsh Premier League]], which they have won a record twelve times \u2013 including the past seven seasons.\n\nOswestry Lions F.C. of the Shropshire County League also play at the ground.\n\n== Recreation and leisure ==\nFrom the 1700s to 1848, there was a popular racecourse outside the town.

Curing eye trouble. Wellcome M0002533.jpg|thumb|St Oswald's Well, believed to cure eye trouble. Image from Hope's book on Holy Wells.]]\n=== Saxon times ===\nThe [[Battle of Maserfield]] is thought to have been fought there in 642, between the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon kings]] [[Penda of Mercia]] and [[Oswald of Northumbria]]. Oswald was killed in this battle and was dismembered; according to legend, one of his arms was carried to an ash tree by a raven, and miracles were subsequently attributed to the tree (as Oswald was considered a saint). Thus it is believed that the name of the site is derived from a reference to \"Oswald's Tree\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThere is an alternative view that Oswestry  was named after Oswy,Oswald's brother, who fought a battle here against King Penda in 655 AD. Oswy became King of Northumbria after Oswald's death. The battle of 655 AD was fought near to a river called the Winwead, which it is believed, was the nearby River Vyrnwy. Welsh folklore has it that this battle was called the battle of Pengwern and in it their leader Cynddyllan was also killed. Oswy had Penda beheaded and no doubt placed it  on a stake or on a branch of a tree as was the practice. Hence the name ''Oswy's~tree''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe spring, Oswald's Well, is supposed to have originated where the bird dropped the arm from the tree, though one historian suggested that it was likely to have been a [[pagan]] spring, in use long before the Saxon battle. The water from the well was believed to have healing properties, particularly for curing eye trouble.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hope|first1=Robert Charles|title=The legendary lore of the holy wells of England: including rivers, lakes, fountains and springs|date=1893|publisher=Elliot Stock|location=London|pages=143-145|url=https://archive.org/stream/legendaryloreofh00hope#page/142/mode/2up/search/oswald|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> [[Offa's Dyke]] runs near the well, to the west.\n\n=== The Conquest ===\nThe [[Domesday Book]] (1086) records a castle being built by Rainald, a [[Normans|Norman]] [[High Sheriff of Shropshire|Sheriff of Shropshire]]: {{lang|fr|L'oeuvre}} ({{langnf||French|The work}}) \u2013 see [[Oswestry Castle]].\n\n[[Alan fitz Flaad]] (died c.1120), a Breton knight, was granted the feudal barony of Oswestry<ref>Burke, Messrs., John and John Bernard, ''The Royal Families of England, Scotland, and Wales, and Their Descendants'' &c., volume 2, London, 1851, p. xl.</ref> by King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] who, soon after his accession, invited Alan to England with other [[Brittany|Breton]] friends, and gave him forfeited lands in [[Norfolk]] and [[Shropshire]], including some which had previously belonged to [[Ernulf de Hesdin]] (killed at [[Antioch]] while on crusade) and [[Robert of Bell\u00eame, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|Robert of Bell\u00eame]].<ref>Ritchie, R.

This former [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) branch had once run into a separate GWR Oswestry terminus, but this has long since disappeared and the land redeveloped as a bus station and supermarket. Trains were re-routed into the main Cambrian station from 7 July 1924.\n\n[[File:Oswestry railway station geograph-2510794-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|Down stopping train at Oswestry in 1960]]\n\nThe main building of the Cambrian station is still a prominent landmark in the town centre: it once housed the headquarters of the Cambrian Railways company. After restoration, this building was reopened as the Cambrian Visitor Centre in June 2006 but closed on 11 January 2008.  It later reopened, and has since evolved into the headquarters of the [[Cambrian Heritage Railways]] (CHR) and a small catering establishment known as \"Buffers\"; other parts of the building have been converted into retail and office units to contribute to the upkeep of the building.\n\nA single railway track still runs through the station, once overgrown and rusting, it has been cleared and repaired and is the subject of an ambitious plan to reopen the line as a steam heritage railway between Oswestry and [[Llanyblodwel]] and [[Pant, Shropshire|Pant]] (to link with the restored [[Montgomery Canal]] \u2013 see above), and as a sustainable community transport rail link from Oswestry to the [[National Rail]] railway station at Gobowen.\n\nBy 2013, the main \"up\" platform at Oswestry station had been reconstructed and some new semaphore signalling installed. The branch-line track-bed from south of Gobowen to Llanyblodwel is now owned by Shropshire Council, who lease the land to CHR, a registered charity. Work is advancing in securing the transfer of the existing Transport & Works Act Order (TWAO) from [[Network Rail]] to CHR. The aim was for this transfer to be completed by 2014, and for the railway line between Gobowen and Oswestry to be fully re-instated and operational by 2017; however the legal process of the TWAO Unit administering a form of written debate between the proposer and objectors with a guided number of exchanges, was still ongoing in mid 2016. CHR purchase of the final section of the Oswestry to Gobowen railway branch line was completed in April 2016; nevertheless, other hurdles to becoming operational, such as permissions and finances to reinstate the level crossings on the main A5/A483 Trunk Roads, will also need to be overcome.\n\nImmediately to the south of Oswestry Railway Station is the Cambrian Railways Museum; while a short distance to the north are the \"listed\" Works Bridge and the former [[Cambrian Railways works]], which are now occupied by a variety of local commerce concerns and Oswestry's Community Health Centre and ambulance facility.\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Beduoins day.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Oswestry Cricket Club's pavilion, August 2010]]\nSince 2013, the town has been represented in [[Association football|football]] by [[F.C.

It originally aired on December 4, 2002 and is rated [[TV-MA]] in the [[United States]].\n\nIn the episode, a man claiming to be [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s future self shows up to his house. Stan's future self is an unemployed drug addict, but Stan suspects that it is a hoax put on by his parents, while South Park's own little entrepreneur, [[Eric Cartman]], is at the helm of a new money-making venture, and Cartman is in the business of revenge.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe children have found a joint that has been left behind by the highschoolers. They are afraid, because according to commercials you die when you touch it and marijuana causes terrorism. Stan is not afraid and throws away the joint.\n\nThat night, in the middle of a thunderstorm, a man claiming to be an older version of Stan appears at the Marsh family's door. This future Stan has spent time in [[Youth detention center|juvenile hall]], used large amounts of drugs and alcohol, which Stan decides must have begun when he first touched the marijuana cigarette. He is convinced that the only way to safeguard his future is for his present self to avoid drugs and alcohol, do well in school, and stay motivated in life. Stan even asks [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to tutor him. While the two boys are talking, Stan discovers that Butters also has a slovenly \"Future Self\" living with him.\n\nStan finds the whole situation suspicious, and the two find an employee card in the \"future\" Stan's personal effects labelled \"Motivation Corp.\" leading them to finding out it is where parents hire actors to pose as their children's future self to make them avoid drugs and alcohol. Stan is appalled at the way these parents have all deceived their children and he and Butters decide to look in the phone book to find a place to run away to. However, they discover a \"Parental Revenge Center\" hotline with guaranteed results, which is run by Cartman who agrees to help the two. However, Cartman's revenge plan for both boys involves going to both of their houses to smear all of the walls with feces. Butters is delighted by this offer and gladly accepts it, while Stan believes that it isn't adequate payback. Cartman then tries to convince Stan by taking it up a notch and offering to [[Scott Tenorman Must Die|kill his parents and slice them into pieces]]. Stan refuses this offer as well, and decides to worm the truth out of his parents himself in order to force them to acknowledge that they lied to him.\n\nStan tries to get the truth out of his parents by pretending to cut off his own hand so that his future self's hand would also come off as a way of seeing if he really is Stan's future self, but Randy improvises by deliberately cutting off the actor's hand after doing so. Though Stan reveals that he didn't actually cut his hand off at all, Randy ends up pretending that the actor's hand has never been cut off while trying to attach it back on him, causing Stan to storm out of his home in frustration. Meanwhile, the Parental Revenge Agency does its job at Butters' house as Cartman and a group of Hispanic day workers smear feces all over the living room and bedroom of the Stotch household. Upon returning home, Chris and Linda actually acknowledge that they deserve it for lying and finally tell the truth about the \"future self\" thing and apologize to Butters.\n\nRandy and Sharon Marsh arrive and continue blatantly lying to Stan, insisting that more future selves must be coming back in time to the present, which finally causes Stan to snap and tell them that he knows all about Motivation Corp., and that he was trying to get them to admit they lied to him. Randy and Sharon come to the realization that if they just keep lying to him, he might not ever trust them again; Randy finally apologizes to Stan and gives him the whole truth about drug abuse, saying that it probably won't kill him or fund terrorism but still may ruin his future. Stan adds he really wishes they had just told him that in the first place instead of lying to him. The Stotches and Marshes then all agree that what Motivation Corp. does is wrong, and hires Cartman to smear their walls with feces. At that point, Stan thanks Cartman, saying that he really came through.\n\nCartman says that the whole experience has taught him that he should think about his own future and start taking better care of himself. Moments later, a thin and handsome man, claiming to be Cartman's future self, shows up and tells Cartman that this was the turning point in his life. From this day forward, he turns his life around, and will become the famous CEO of a time-traveling company. Cartman is not convinced, believing it to be yet another Motivation Corp. actor and immediately changes his mind, vowing to do \"[[Freak Strike|whatever I want!]]\" from then on, which includes eating unhealthy and doing drugs. As it turns out, the man really is Cartman's future self and immediately changes into a dirty, morbidly obese mechanic. Future Cartman then exclaims, \"Oh, goddamn it!\"\n\n==Theme==\nThe episode delivers a direct anti-drug message while simultaneously poking fun at all the anti-drug commercials and propaganda that were airing during most teen and young adult oriented television blocks at the time (specifically, the dubious claims many were making about the consequences of marijuana use). In the DVD commentary, Parker and Stone stated that they were inspired to do the episode after seeing an advertisement by [[The Partnership For A Drug-Free America]] which linked marijuana use to terrorism.

It originally aired on December 4, 2002 and is rated [[TV-MA]] in the [[United States]]. \n\nIn the episode, a man claiming to be [[Stan Marsh|Stan]]'s future self shows up to his house. Stan's future self is an unemployed drug addict, but Stan suspects that it is a hoax put on by his parents, while South Park's own little entrepreneur, [[Eric Cartman]], is at the helm of a new money-making venture, and Cartman is in the business of revenge.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe children have found a joint that has been left behind by the highschoolers. They are afraid, because according to commercials you die when you touch it and marijuana causes terrorism. Stan is not afraid and throws away the joint. \n\nThat night, in the middle of a thunderstorm, a man claiming to be an older version of Stan appears at the Marsh family's door. This future Stan has spent time in [[Youth detention center|juvenile hall]], used large amounts of drugs and alcohol, which Stan decides must have begun when he first touched the marijuana cigarette. He is convinced that the only way to safeguard his future is for his present self to avoid drugs and alcohol, do well in school, and stay motivated in life. Stan even asks [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] to tutor him. While the two boys are talking, Stan discovers that Butters also has a slovenly \"Future Self\" living with him.\n\nStan finds the whole situation suspicious, and the two find an employee card in the \"future\" Stan's personal effects labelled \"Motivation Corp.\" leading them to finding out it is where parents hire actors to pose as their children's future self to make them avoid drugs and alcohol. Stan is appalled at the way these parents have all deceived their children and he and Butters decide to look in the phone book to find a place to run away to. However, they discover a \"Parental Revenge Center\" hotline with guaranteed results, which is run by Cartman who agrees to help the two. However, Cartman's revenge plan for both boys involves going to both of their houses to smear all of the walls with feces. Butters is delighted by this offer and gladly accepts it, while Stan believes that it isn't adequate payback. Cartman then tries to convince Stan by taking it up a notch and offering to [[Scott Tenorman Must Die|kill his parents and slice them into pieces]]. Stan refuses this offer as well, and decides to worm the truth out of his parents himself in order to force them to acknowledge that they lied to him.\n\nStan tries to get the truth out of his parents by pretending to cut off his own hand so that his future self's hand would also come off as a way of seeing if he really is Stan's future self, but Randy improvises by deliberately cutting off the actor's hand after doing so. Though Stan reveals that he didn't actually cut his hand off at all, Randy ends up pretending that the actor's hand has never been cut off while trying to attach it back on him, causing Stan to storm out of his home in frustration. Meanwhile, the Parental Revenge Agency does its job at Butters' house as Cartman and a group of Hispanic day workers smear feces all over the living room and bedroom of the Stotch household. Upon returning home, Chris and Linda actually acknowledge that they deserve it for lying and finally tell the truth about the \"future self\" thing and apologize to Butters. \n\nRandy and Sharon Marsh arrive and continue blatantly lying to Stan, insisting that more future selves must be coming back in time to the present, which finally causes Stan to snap and tell them that he knows all about Motivation Corp., and that he was trying to get them to admit they lied to him. Randy and Sharon come to the realization that if they just keep lying to him, he might not ever trust them again; Randy finally apologizes to Stan and gives him the whole truth about drug abuse, saying that it probably won't kill him or fund terrorism but still may ruin his future. Stan adds he really wishes they had just told him that in the first place instead of lying to him. The Stotches and Marshes then all agree that what Motivation Corp. does is wrong, and hires Cartman to smear their walls with feces. At that point, Stan thanks Cartman, saying that he really came through.\n\nCartman says that the whole experience has taught him that he should think about his own future and start taking better care of himself. Moments later, a thin and handsome man, claiming to be Cartman's future self, shows up and tells Cartman that this was the turning point in his life. From this day forward, he turns his life around, and will become the famous CEO of a time-traveling company. Cartman is not convinced, believing it to be yet another Motivation Corp. actor and immediately changes his mind, vowing to do \"[[Freak Strike|whatever I want!]]\" from then on, which includes eating unhealthy and doing drugs. As it turns out, the man really is Cartman's future self and immediately changes into a dirty, morbidly obese mechanic. Future Cartman then exclaims, \"Oh, goddamn it!\"\n\n==Theme==\nThe episode delivers a direct anti-drug message while simultaneously poking fun at all the anti-drug commercials and propaganda that were airing during most teen and young adult oriented television blocks at the time (specifically, the dubious claims many were making about the consequences of marijuana use). In the DVD commentary, Parker and Stone stated that they were inspired to do the episode after seeing an advertisement by [[The Partnership For A Drug-Free America]] which linked marijuana use to terrorism. Parker stated that they had originally intended for the episode to include a spoof of the commercial but decided against it when they could not think of anything more ridiculous than saying, \"If you smoke pot, you become a terrorist\".<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2005 |title=South Park: The Complete Sixth Season: \"My Future Self 'n' Me\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD Disc|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref> \n\nButters' \"Future Self\" only watches ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', a series the young Butters finds \"stupid\".\n\n==Home release==\n\"My Future Self 'n' Me\", along with the sixteen other episodes from ''South Park'''s sixth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005.

They also decide to have a [[Mental Health Counselor|counselor]] talk to the boys to find out if the priest had been [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] them. The counselor, assuming the children were molested, asks, \"Did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt?\" Having never been abused by Father Maxi, the boys are completely baffled about the question's meaning. [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] has a \"brilliant\" idea, reasoning she meant it could be possible that eating food through the rectum can cause defecation through the mouth. The other boys (especially [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]) think it is stupid and disgusting, and Cartman bets him $20 it will work. While the counselor is questioning the boys, all the parents decide to become [[atheism|atheists]], as the [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sexual molestation scandals]] have destroyed their faith in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and [[God]].\n\nCartman ultimately does defecate out of his mouth, winning the bet and continually boasts the fact to Kyle, who becomes increasingly angered by it. News of this spreads, and it is concluded nationwide that this method of eating is much healthier than the traditional method (with the surgeon general basing that on \"absolutely nothing\"). The adults of South Park immediately adopt the new method of eating, calling it ''interorectogestion'' and even start passing trash cans around at social situations to openly collect the waste (literally \"spewing crap from their mouths\"), completely disregarding the previously long-held custom that defecation should occur in private.\n\nMeanwhile, Maxi has gathered a meeting of Catholic priests in Colorado to discuss the problem of child molestation. Maxi is appalled by such behavior and wants it to cease entirely, but to Maxi's horror, all of the other priests there have molested their altar boys. Maxi decides he has to go to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]]. Once there, he quickly finds the same: priests from all over the world (and from other worlds, specifically an alien race known as the Gelgameks) are molesting children and claim [[Catholic sex abuse cases#Celibacy theory|they need to continue the practice to receive gratification]]. They claim the \"Holy Document of Vatican Law\" does not prohibit the behavior, so Maxi wants to change the canon law to outlaw sodomy, as well as to [[clerical marriage|allow sex with women]]. The Cardinal tells him that the Document cannot be changed as no one knows where it is. Maxi decides to try to find it. Meanwhile, Kyle has lost his patience with Cartman's incessant boasting and tells Cartman that he accepts the fact that he beat him fairly. This angers Cartman, as he wanted to hold the victorious bet over Kyle's head indefinitely.\n\nMaxi searches through the lower levels of the Vatican, and goes through a gauntlet in the style of ''[[Pitfall!]]'' in order to reach the Holy Document. But the [[Pope John Paul II|Pope]] says they must first consult the highest power. He summons the \"Queen Spider\", which has for centuries been responsible for the pedophilia in the church, and declares that the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed. Angered by this, Maxi finally snaps and tears the Document in two, and [[St. Peter's Basilica|the building]] begins to crumble. Maxi stands in front of the ruins, and tells everyone that Catholicism is not about the Holy Document of Vatican Law, molestation, or Queen Spiders, but about being a good person. He says by clouding the moral lessons of the [[Bible]] with needless ceremony and so many literal translations, the Vatican has caused people to reject religion and argues that \"when they have no mythology to live their lives by, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths\". The parents, watching this on TV, regain their faith in God, deciding to stop shoving food up their rectum and to start going to church again, wanting to reconcile with [[God]] and their religion. Randy then vomits up another bowel movement.\n\n==Production==\nIn the DVD commentary for this episode, [[Matt Stone|Stone]] and Parker refer to their irritation towards arguments from more socially liberal/atheistic/secular minded types of people, as well as from socially religious conservatives.  The scene where the parents discuss atheism while crapping out their mouths is based on Parker's annoyance with atheists.

The software was previously called '''Konfabulator''', but after being acquired by computer services company [[Yahoo]] on July 25, 2005 it was rebranded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/timeline.cfm |title=Yahoo!

The engine uses a [[JavaScript]] [[run-time system|runtime]] environment combined with an [[XML]] interpreter to run small applications referred to as [[GUI widget|widget]]s, and hence is part of a class of [[Computer software|software]] applications called [[widget engine]]s. On February 27, 2012 Yahoo updated the License agreement stating that as of April 3, 2012 Yahoo! Widgets will continue to be available for download but support & Development would stop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/konfabulator/enginenwidgetsterms/enginenwidgetsterms-1821.html|title=Yahoo Terms Center|website=info.yahoo.com|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nYahoo Widget Engine includes some default widgets to get users started, including a weather widget, a digital clock, and a calendar among other things.  Some of the most downloaded ones include a world timezone clock,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/world-clock-pro |title=World Clock Pro - Yahoo Widgets |publisher=Widgets.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  dedicated countdown timers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/generic-countdown-timer |title=Generic Countdown Timer - Yahoo Widgets |publisher=Widgets.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  simple [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feed readers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/newsstand |title=NewsStand - Yahoo Widgets |publisher=Widgets.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  and [[webcam]] viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/webimages |title=WebImages - Yahoo Widgets |publisher=Widgets.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>\n\nEach widget runs in its own [[Process (computing)|system process]], separate from other types of widgets and the main Konfabulator system process itself, thus improving the stability of the software application as a whole.  Should a problem occur with a Konfabulator widget requiring it to be shut down, that particular widget can be shut down without affecting other widgets or the main Konfabulator application.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manual.widgets.yahoo.com/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=Konfabulator_HTML&file=Advanced_WidgetRuntime.html|title=Widget Runtime}}</ref>  A disadvantage of doing this was the [[Random access memory|computer memory]] needed for each process to run, which was possibly a potential problem on the computers of the time that were typically equipped with only 512mb-2gb RAM. This was a minor issue compared to the RAM consumed by the graphical nature of the widgets which could make them more RAM intensive than traditional square shaped desktop apps.\n\n===Heads-Up Display/Konspos\u00e9===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Yahoo Widget Engine.PNG|thumbnail|right|Yahoo Widgets running under Windows XP with 'Heads Up' enabled.]] -->\nYahoo Widgets provides a feature that can quickly bring all open widgets to the top of the [[Desktop environment|desktop]]. It can be activated by pressing a [[hotkey]] (set by the user). This causes all widgets to be brought to the foreground, and all other applications to be dimmed. Widgets can also be set to be Konspos\u00e9-only, meaning that they will only appear when Konspos\u00e9 is activated. Initially called Konspos\u00e9 (alluding to [[Mission Control (macOS)|Mac OS X's Expos\u00e9]]), it was renamed to \"Heads-Up Display\" with the release of Yahoo Widget Engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/widgets/widget/general/general-07.html |title=What does Heads Up Display mode do? - Widgets |publisher=Help.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===(The) Dock===\n[[File:KonfabulatorDockIconsScreenShot - 2 Aug 2007.png|right|Yahoo Widget]]\nWith the introduction of Yahoo Widget Engine 4.0, the engine has included a feature called the dock. The dock shows all widgets with representative icons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=25 |title=Yahoo Widgets Blog - Current Events in Developer Town|publisher=Widgets.yahoo.net |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  Widgets that do not specify images are either provided with their screen-shot from the [http://widgets.yahoo.com/gallery official widget gallery] or the default widget icon, both shown on the right.  When rolled over with the mouse, the dock helps users manage their widgets with buttons to close a widget, show a widget's preferences, and reveal a widget from the [[head-up display]].  For users who prefer not to have a dock visible all the time, the dock has options to auto-hide when not active, or even close entirely.\n\n===Developer/API features===\nThe Yahoo Widget Engine (Konfabulator) has a very flexible [[application programming interface]] (API) based on [[JavaScript]] with many features useful to developers.  A few basic features include items such as text-areas, images, and timers.  Other features include the ability to download webpages from the Internet, as well as file [[input/output]], and animator objects to aid in visual effects.  A built in interface allows widget developers to run OS specific code such as shell scripts and [[Component Object Model|COM]] applications on Windows, and [[AppleScript]] on Mac.\n\nAs of Yahoo Widget Engine 4.0, [[SQLite]] has been included in the engine, allowing developers to create and modify databases. Also included with 4.0 is the Canvas class, which allows vector drawing. Canvas \"images\" can be saved to either a JPG or PNG image file.  With the introduction of the dock, widgets can set their own dock icons.  Dock icons support a small subset of the engine's features, so they have the ability to display multiple images and text. This is useful to widgets designed to be such things as a clock, or a weather forecaster.  Also added to text objects is support for simple [[CSS]] styles for formatting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=20 |title=Yahoo Widgets Blog - It's Here!|publisher=Widgets.yahoo.net |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  Another new feature included in version 4.0 is the ability to automatically check gallery downloaded widgets for updates.  Previously only available to official Yahoo Widgets, this feature was enabled for all third-party widget authors on August 17, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.konfabulator.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=20009 |title=Widget Update Check Activated For Everyone - Konfabulator Forums |publisher=konfabulator.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>\n\nYahoo Widgets 4.5, released on November 29, 2007, introduced support for both [[WebKit]] and [[Adobe Flash]], allowing development of widgets using [[XML]], [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]] as well as the capabilities of Flash.  The WebKit support does not include plugins, so Flash is supported through the use of a separate native object.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=31 |title=Yahoo Widgets Blog - Yahoo Widgets 4.5 is Here!|publisher=Widgets.yahoo.net |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=32 |title=Yahoo Widgets Blog - Konfabulator 4.5: Cool Developer Features|publisher=Widgets.yahoo.net |date=2007-12-14 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2009}}\n\n===Initial development===\nYahoo Widgets was originally developed as Konfabulator, by a core development team consisting of Arlo Rose, Perry Clarke, and Ed Voas. Originally released on February 10, 2003 as a Mac OS X only application which cost [[USD|$]]24.95 (and later, with the release of version 2.0, US$19.95), its Windows version was released on November 8, 2004 with the release of version Konfabulator 1.8, and made freeware with the release of Konfabulator 2.1 on July 25, 2005, when it was sold to [[Yahoo]]. Shortly prior to this, [[Apple Computer|Apple]] released a similar widget engine, [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]], as part of its Mac OS X [[Mac OS X v10.4|Tiger]] operating system. Konfabulator's main commercial competitor on the Windows platform is [[DesktopX]], developed by [[Stardock]]. Other programs offering similar functionality include [[Kapsules]] and [[AveDesk]] (for Windows), [[gDesklets]] (for [[GNOME]]), and [[SuperKaramba]] (for [[KDE]]).\n\nThe JavaScript engine used by Konfabulator uses the [[Mozilla]] [[SpiderMonkey]] implementation, and conforms to the Mozilla JavaScript version 1.5 standards (equivalent to [[ECMAScript]] 262 edition 3, with Mozilla extensions).\n\nThe idea of Konfabulator originated in 1998, when Arlo Rose saw how he could [[Skin (computing)|skin]] the [[MP3]] media player running on his computer. His idea was to \"skin any information you wanted to see on your desktop.\"<ref name=\"comic1\">[http://www.konfabulator.com/cartoon/partOne.html \"Konfabulator's History\"] on Konfabultor's web site, as illustrated by [[Vera Brosgol]]</ref>\n\nPrior to this, he had experience with Kaleidoscope, a skinning program for the [[Apple Macintosh]] operating systems, akin to [[WindowBlinds]]. He coined the term \"Konfabulator\" to describe his idea, and then tried pitching his idea to other [[Programmer|software programmers]]. He was unsuccessful until the year 2002, when Perry Clarke (who would later become one of the core developers of Konfabulator) heard about his idea and agreed to work with him on the project.\n\nOn February 10, 2003, Rose and Clarke launched version 1.0 of Konfabulator. Before the launch, Rose created a teaser web site asking visitors what Konfabulator is, while it was still in development. When it was finally released, users of Konfabulator were highly impressed with the idea of widgets, and its popularity soared as a result, something which surprised the developers of Konfabulator. Due to its popularity, Rose and Clarke had to quit their jobs to work on Konfabulator full-time.\n\nIn July 2003, Rose and Clarke started working on a Windows version with another software programmer, but internal differences broke them up and they were forced to scrap the work already done. Later, Rose persuaded Ed Voas (who was then a friend of Rose and had 10 years of software programming experience at [[Apple Computer]], and would later become the third member of Konfabulator's core development team) to develop a Windows version for them. Initially he declined, but later he created a working [[prototype]] and presented it to the Konfabulator development team within two days.\n\nIn November 2004, Konfabulator 1.8, the first [[cross-platform]] version of Konfabulator, was released. The Windows version was capable of seamlessly running most Konfabulator widgets written for the Mac OS X operating system on Windows machines, and vice versa. Some widgets developed later were, however, platform-specific.\n\nA few months later, on May 18, 2005, the first major release of Konfabulator since version 1.0, Konfabulator 2.0 (sometimes shortened to ''K:2''), was released, along with a visual overhaul of widgets, improved functionality, and a marked down price of US$19.95 from the previous US$24.95 (this was after many users, especially Windows users used to the idea of freeware and other cheaper widget engines, complained about the high price). The popularity of Konfabulator accelerated soon after that, and companies were seeking to use Konfabulator in their projects. In response to the demand for Konfabulator, and to provide a proper information source for widget developers (some of whom were [[Screen scraping|scraping]] web sites for information for their widgets), the Konfabulator development team decided to sell Konfabulator to Yahoo.\n\n===Yahoo acquires Konfabulator===\nOn July 25, 2005 Konfabulator was acquired by Yahoo, and Yahoo released Konfabulator for free. While the Konfabulator framework was renamed Yahoo Widgets, the underlying engine continued to be branded as Konfabulator until December 2005.\n\nYahoo said the reason they purchased Konfabulator was that they wanted an easy way to open up its [[Application programming interface|API]]s to the widget developer community and allow them easy access to the information on the Yahoo Web site. In doing this, widgets could be built without having to scrape or search web sites in order to get information regarding the APIs for widgets and the Konfabulator framework.\n\nOn May 23, 2006, the [[Universal binary]] of the Yahoo Widget Engine, version 3.1.4, was made available to users of Intel-based Macintosh computers.\n\nIn August 2006, Perry Clarke, the original engineer of the Mac version of the widget engine, left the Yahoo Widgets team,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130516192050/http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=4 Yahoo Widgets Blog -  \t\t\tWe're baa-aack!]</ref> followed later by Arlo Rose himself. In August 2008, Ed Voas, who developed the first Windows version of Konfabulator, also left the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.konfabulator.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=24083 |work=Konfabulator forum |title=Leaving the Fold |last=Voas |first=Ed |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2009-01-26 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127195833/http://www2.konfabulator.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=24083 |archivedate=2013-01-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Yahoo Closes Yahoo Desktop Widgets===\n\nOn March 2, 2012 it was announced that Yahoo would be closing down support for the Yahoo Widget Engine and closing the Yahoo Widget Gallery altogether. The announcement was made on the front page of the [http://widgets.yahoo.com/misc/eol Yahoo gallery] and on the [https://www2.konfabulator.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=31978 Konfabulator forum]. Yahoo claimed that the reason for closure was twofold - the cost of replacing the older servers that supported the gallery and the refocussing of human resources on the development of the [[Yahoo! Connected TV]] widget platform.\n\n===Current Technical Status===\n\n'''Windows''' - The Yahoo Widget engine operates on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, 8 and 10. On XP the widget has full functionality. On NT6 systems (Vista +) the sound control functionality is limited as [[User Account Control|Windows UAC]] does not give widget apps the right to modify the system sound control without administrator access, all other functions operate as designed.\n\n'''Mac OSX'''  - As of 10.11 El Capitan, the Yahoo widget dock no longer functions correctly. However, the dock can be disabled by editing the relevant .plist configuration file and the widgets then become accessible via the menu. Despite this relatively minor limitation, the widgets still operate as expected in previous versions of OSX.\n\n'''Linux''' - The Yahoo widget engine was ported to Ubuntu Linux 10.10 and modified to become the [[Yahoo! Connected TV|Yahoo! Connected TV engine]]. The linux version is not designed as a standalone widget engine for running widgets on desktop linux but instead uses Ubuntu as the host for an embedded o/s in television sets. However, it is possible to run Ubuntu linux 10.10 on a normal PC and run the Yahoo! Connected TV engine locally for development/testing purposes.\n\nOn March 30, 2018 - fifteen years after Konfabulator debuted, Yahoo (now under Verizon ownership) stopped allowing \"Kon\" apps to be published to the Yahoo! Connected TV engine, encouraging developers instead to offer HTML5 connector apps. This marks the final discontinuation of the last continuing branch of Konfabulator.<ref>https://smarttv.yahoo.com/#second-item</ref>\n\n===Yahoo's Weather Widget Feed Disrupted===\nAs of May 2016 the popular yahoo weather widget has stopped functioning. The weather widget was one of Yahoo's most popular widgets as it provided free access to Yahoo's weather feed. Yahoo has modified the manner in which the weather feed is accessed breaking not only the weather widget but all others programs and sites that attempt to use it. Yahoo's updated documentation stated: ''\"To increase the security measure and better serving our YDN customers, weather data source will enforce OAuth 1 starting March 15, 2016.

The software was previously called '''Konfabulator''', but after being acquired by computer services company [[Yahoo]] on July 25, 2005 it was rebranded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yhoo.client.shareholder.com/press/timeline.cfm |title=Yahoo!

The engine uses a [[JavaScript]] [[run-time system|runtime]] environment combined with an [[XML]] interpreter to run small applications referred to as [[GUI widget|widget]]s, and hence is part of a class of [[Computer software|software]] applications called [[widget engine]]s. On February 27, 2012 Yahoo updated the License agreement stating that as of April 3, 2012 Yahoo! Widgets will continue to be available for download but support & Development would stop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/konfabulator/enginenwidgetsterms/enginenwidgetsterms-1821.html|title=Yahoo Terms Center|website=info.yahoo.com|access-date=2016-08-26}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nYahoo Widget Engine includes some default widgets to get users started, including a weather widget, a digital clock, and a calendar among other things.  Some of the most downloaded ones include a world timezone clock,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/world-clock-pro |title=World Clock Pro - Yahoo Widgets |publisher=Widgets.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  dedicated countdown timers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/generic-countdown-timer |title=Generic Countdown Timer - Yahoo Widgets |publisher=Widgets.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  simple [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] feed readers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/newsstand |title=NewsStand - Yahoo Widgets |publisher=Widgets.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  and [[webcam]] viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.com/widgets/webimages |title=WebImages - Yahoo Widgets |publisher=Widgets.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>\n\nEach widget runs in its own [[Process (computing)|system process]], separate from other types of widgets and the main Konfabulator system process itself, thus improving the stability of the software application as a whole.  Should a problem occur with a Konfabulator widget requiring it to be shut down, that particular widget can be shut down without affecting other widgets or the main Konfabulator application.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manual.widgets.yahoo.com/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=Konfabulator_HTML&file=Advanced_WidgetRuntime.html|title=Widget Runtime}}</ref>  A disadvantage of doing this was the [[Random access memory|computer memory]] needed for each process to run, which was possibly a potential problem on the computers of the time that were typically equipped with only 512mb-2gb RAM. This was a minor issue compared to the RAM consumed by the graphical nature of the widgets which could make them more RAM intensive than traditional square shaped desktop apps.\n\n===Heads-Up Display/Konspos\u00e9===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Yahoo Widget Engine.PNG|thumbnail|right|Yahoo Widgets running under Windows XP with 'Heads Up' enabled.]] -->\nYahoo Widgets provides a feature that can quickly bring all open widgets to the top of the [[Desktop environment|desktop]]. It can be activated by pressing a [[hotkey]] (set by the user). This causes all widgets to be brought to the foreground, and all other applications to be dimmed. Widgets can also be set to be Konspos\u00e9-only, meaning that they will only appear when Konspos\u00e9 is activated. Initially called Konspos\u00e9 (alluding to [[Mission Control (macOS)|Mac OS X's Expos\u00e9]]), it was renamed to \"Heads-Up Display\" with the release of Yahoo Widget Engine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/widgets/widget/general/general-07.html |title=What does Heads Up Display mode do? - Widgets |publisher=Help.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>\n\n===(The) Dock===\n[[File:KonfabulatorDockIconsScreenShot - 2 Aug 2007.png|right|Yahoo Widget]]\nWith the introduction of Yahoo Widget Engine 4.0, the engine has included a feature called the dock. The dock shows all widgets with representative icons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=25 |title=Yahoo Widgets Blog - Current Events in Developer Town|publisher=Widgets.yahoo.net |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  Widgets that do not specify images are either provided with their screen-shot from the [http://widgets.yahoo.com/gallery official widget gallery] or the default widget icon, both shown on the right.  When rolled over with the mouse, the dock helps users manage their widgets with buttons to close a widget, show a widget's preferences, and reveal a widget from the [[head-up display]].  For users who prefer not to have a dock visible all the time, the dock has options to auto-hide when not active, or even close entirely.\n\n===Developer/API features===\nThe Yahoo Widget Engine (Konfabulator) has a very flexible [[application programming interface]] (API) based on [[JavaScript]] with many features useful to developers.  A few basic features include items such as text-areas, images, and timers.  Other features include the ability to download webpages from the Internet, as well as file [[input/output]], and animator objects to aid in visual effects.  A built in interface allows widget developers to run OS specific code such as shell scripts and [[Component Object Model|COM]] applications on Windows, and [[AppleScript]] on Mac.\n\nAs of Yahoo Widget Engine 4.0, [[SQLite]] has been included in the engine, allowing developers to create and modify databases. Also included with 4.0 is the Canvas class, which allows vector drawing. Canvas \"images\" can be saved to either a JPG or PNG image file.  With the introduction of the dock, widgets can set their own dock icons.  Dock icons support a small subset of the engine's features, so they have the ability to display multiple images and text. This is useful to widgets designed to be such things as a clock, or a weather forecaster.  Also added to text objects is support for simple [[CSS]] styles for formatting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=20 |title=Yahoo Widgets Blog - It's Here!|publisher=Widgets.yahoo.net |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>  Another new feature included in version 4.0 is the ability to automatically check gallery downloaded widgets for updates.  Previously only available to official Yahoo Widgets, this feature was enabled for all third-party widget authors on August 17, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.konfabulator.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=20009 |title=Widget Update Check Activated For Everyone - Konfabulator Forums |publisher=konfabulator.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>\n\nYahoo Widgets 4.5, released on November 29, 2007, introduced support for both [[WebKit]] and [[Adobe Flash]], allowing development of widgets using [[XML]], [[HTML]] and [[JavaScript]] as well as the capabilities of Flash.  The WebKit support does not include plugins, so Flash is supported through the use of a separate native object.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=31 |title=Yahoo Widgets Blog - Yahoo Widgets 4.5 is Here!|publisher=Widgets.yahoo.net |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=32 |title=Yahoo Widgets Blog - Konfabulator 4.5: Cool Developer Features|publisher=Widgets.yahoo.net |date=2007-12-14 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2009}}\n\n===Initial development===\nYahoo Widgets was originally developed as Konfabulator, by a core development team consisting of Arlo Rose, Perry Clarke, and Ed Voas. Originally released on February 10, 2003 as a Mac OS X only application which cost [[USD|$]]24.95 (and later, with the release of version 2.0, US$19.95), its Windows version was released on November 8, 2004 with the release of version Konfabulator 1.8, and made freeware with the release of Konfabulator 2.1 on July 25, 2005, when it was sold to [[Yahoo]]. Shortly prior to this, [[Apple Computer|Apple]] released a similar widget engine, [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]], as part of its Mac OS X [[Mac OS X v10.4|Tiger]] operating system. Konfabulator's main commercial competitor on the Windows platform is [[DesktopX]], developed by [[Stardock]]. Other programs offering similar functionality include [[Kapsules]] and [[AveDesk]] (for Windows), [[gDesklets]] (for [[GNOME]]), and [[SuperKaramba]] (for [[KDE]]).\n\nThe JavaScript engine used by Konfabulator uses the [[Mozilla]] [[SpiderMonkey]] implementation, and conforms to the Mozilla JavaScript version 1.5 standards (equivalent to [[ECMAScript]] 262 edition 3, with Mozilla extensions).\n\nThe idea of Konfabulator originated in 1998, when Arlo Rose saw how he could [[Skin (computing)|skin]] the [[MP3]] media player running on his computer. His idea was to \"skin any information you wanted to see on your desktop.\"<ref name=\"comic1\">[http://www.konfabulator.com/cartoon/partOne.html \"Konfabulator's History\"] on Konfabultor's web site, as illustrated by [[Vera Brosgol]]</ref>\n\nPrior to this, he had experience with Kaleidoscope, a skinning program for the [[Apple Macintosh]] operating systems, akin to [[WindowBlinds]]. He coined the term \"Konfabulator\" to describe his idea, and then tried pitching his idea to other [[Programmer|software programmers]]. He was unsuccessful until the year 2002, when Perry Clarke (who would later become one of the core developers of Konfabulator) heard about his idea and agreed to work with him on the project.\n\nOn February 10, 2003, Rose and Clarke launched version 1.0 of Konfabulator. Before the launch, Rose created a teaser web site asking visitors what Konfabulator is, while it was still in development. When it was finally released, users of Konfabulator were highly impressed with the idea of widgets, and its popularity soared as a result, something which surprised the developers of Konfabulator. Due to its popularity, Rose and Clarke had to quit their jobs to work on Konfabulator full-time.\n\nIn July 2003, Rose and Clarke started working on a Windows version with another software programmer, but internal differences broke them up and they were forced to scrap the work already done. Later, Rose persuaded Ed Voas (who was then a friend of Rose and had 10 years of software programming experience at [[Apple Computer]], and would later become the third member of Konfabulator's core development team) to develop a Windows version for them. Initially he declined, but later he created a working [[prototype]] and presented it to the Konfabulator development team within two days.\n\nIn November 2004, Konfabulator 1.8, the first [[cross-platform]] version of Konfabulator, was released. The Windows version was capable of seamlessly running most Konfabulator widgets written for the Mac OS X operating system on Windows machines, and vice versa. Some widgets developed later were, however, platform-specific.\n\nA few months later, on May 18, 2005, the first major release of Konfabulator since version 1.0, Konfabulator 2.0 (sometimes shortened to ''K:2''), was released, along with a visual overhaul of widgets, improved functionality, and a marked down price of US$19.95 from the previous US$24.95 (this was after many users, especially Windows users used to the idea of freeware and other cheaper widget engines, complained about the high price). The popularity of Konfabulator accelerated soon after that, and companies were seeking to use Konfabulator in their projects. In response to the demand for Konfabulator, and to provide a proper information source for widget developers (some of whom were [[Screen scraping|scraping]] web sites for information for their widgets), the Konfabulator development team decided to sell Konfabulator to Yahoo.\n\n===Yahoo acquires Konfabulator===\nOn July 25, 2005 Konfabulator was acquired by Yahoo, and Yahoo released Konfabulator for free. While the Konfabulator framework was renamed Yahoo Widgets, the underlying engine continued to be branded as Konfabulator until December 2005.\n\nYahoo said the reason they purchased Konfabulator was that they wanted an easy way to open up its [[Application programming interface|API]]s to the widget developer community and allow them easy access to the information on the Yahoo Web site. In doing this, widgets could be built without having to scrape or search web sites in order to get information regarding the APIs for widgets and the Konfabulator framework.\n\nOn May 23, 2006, the [[Universal binary]] of the Yahoo Widget Engine, version 3.1.4, was made available to users of Intel-based Macintosh computers.\n\nIn August 2006, Perry Clarke, the original engineer of the Mac version of the widget engine, left the Yahoo Widgets team,<ref>[http://widgets.yahoo.net/blog/?p=4 Yahoo Widgets Blog -  \t\t\tWe're baa-aack!]</ref> followed later by Arlo Rose himself. In August 2008, Ed Voas, who developed the first Windows version of Konfabulator, also left the team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.konfabulator.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=24083 |work=Konfabulator forum |title=Leaving the Fold |last=Voas |first=Ed |date=2008-08-07 |accessdate=2009-01-26 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130127195833/http://www2.konfabulator.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=24083 |archivedate=2013-01-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Yahoo Closes Yahoo Desktop Widgets===\n\nOn March 2, 2012 it was announced that Yahoo would be closing down support for the Yahoo Widget Engine and closing the Yahoo Widget Gallery altogether. The announcement was made on the front page of the [http://widgets.yahoo.com/misc/eol Yahoo gallery] and on the [https://www2.konfabulator.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=31978 Konfabulator forum]. Yahoo claimed that the reason for closure was twofold - the cost of replacing the older servers that supported the gallery and the refocussing of human resources on the development of the [[Yahoo! Connected TV]] widget platform.\n\n===Current Technical Status===\n\n'''Windows''' - The Yahoo Widget engine operates on Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, 8 and 10. On XP the widget has full functionality. On NT6 systems (Vista +) the sound control functionality is limited as [[User Account Control|Windows UAC]] does not give widget apps the right to modify the system sound control without administrator access, all other functions operate as designed.\n\n'''Mac OSX'''  - As of 10.11 El Capitan, the Yahoo widget dock no longer functions correctly. However, the dock can be disabled by editing the relevant .plist configuration file and the widgets then become accessible via the menu. Despite this relatively minor limitation, the widgets still operate as expected in previous versions of OSX.\n\n'''Linux''' - The Yahoo widget engine was ported to Ubuntu Linux 10.10 and modified to become the [[Yahoo! Connected TV|Yahoo! Connected TV engine]]. The linux version is not designed as a standalone widget engine for running widgets on desktop linux but instead uses Ubuntu as the host for an embedded o/s in television sets. However, it is possible to run Ubuntu linux 10.10 on a normal PC and run the Yahoo! Connected TV engine locally for development/testing purposes.\n\nOn March 30, 2018 - fifteen years after Konfabulator debuted, Yahoo (now under Verizon ownership) stopped allowing \"Kon\" apps to be published to the Yahoo! Connected TV engine, encouraging developers instead to offer HTML5 connector apps. This marks the final discontinuation of the last continuing branch of Konfabulator.<ref>https://smarttv.yahoo.com/#second-item</ref>\n\n===Yahoo's Weather Widget Feed Disrupted===\nAs of May 2016 the popular yahoo weather widget has stopped functioning. The weather widget was one of Yahoo's most popular widgets as it provided free access to Yahoo's weather feed. Yahoo has modified the manner in which the weather feed is accessed breaking not only the weather widget but all others programs and sites that attempt to use it. Yahoo's updated documentation stated: ''\"To increase the security measure and better serving our YDN customers, weather data source will enforce OAuth 1 starting March 15, 2016. Please update your API calls with OAuth 1 enabled (via the OAuth /v1/yql end point if using YQL) using your Yahoo App key and secret.\"''\n\nAs the weather widget is no longer supported, changes to fix the widget will not be carried out by Yahoo employees. However, as all widgets can be decompiled to their original JavaScript source code, the widget could be modified by developers to correspond to Yahoo's modified authorisation requirements or to obtain the data from an alternate weather source. Other widgets have been modified in this manner and already obtain the source data from such alternative feeds as https://aviationweather.gov/adds/dataserver.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3526351 Why Yahoo Bought Konfabulator]\n* [http://www.joeuser.com/index.asp?AID=34276 DesktopX/Konfabulator comparison]\n* [http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10217972-1.html Yahoo Widgets hands-on review] [[CNET Networks]]\n* [http://yahoowidgeteers.deviantart.com/ Yahoo Widgets Gallery at DeviantArt]\n* [http://yereverluvinuncleber.deviantart.com/journal/Guide-to-converting-Yahoo-Widgets-to-Xwidget-Pt1-677100991 Guide to converting a Yahoo widget to a supported engine]\n\n===Dashboard and Konfabulator comparisons===\n*[https://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2005/04/macosx-10-4.ars/17 Comparison of Dashboard and Konfabulator] from John Siracusa's review of Mac OS X v10.4 for Ars Technica\n*[http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/dashboard_vs_konfabulator Comparison of Dashboard and Konfabulator] from Daring Fireball's John Gruber\n\n{{Widget engine}}\n{{Yahoo!

The title is a pun on the saying, \"Ready, willing, and able.\"\n\n==Plot summary==\nAt a local [[fundraiser]] organized by [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], a masked thief (with a mask of [[Jimmy Carter]] similar to ''[[Point Break]]'') steals the proceeds. [[Joe Swanson]] chases after him and recovers the money, but fails to catch the thief. Depressed by his own failure, Joe quits the [[police force]] and retreats to his sleeping room. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] instructs [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to talk to him. When Peter does, an ad announcing the [[Special Olympics|Special People's Games]] coming to Quahog is shown on television, and Peter encourages Joe to enter the Games, offering himself as a personal coach.\n\nPeter subjects Joe to harsh physical training. As the Games commence, Joe's primary rival is an athlete strongly resembling [[Stephen Hawking]], who repeatedly insults Joe using a [[voice synthesizer]]. Joe heads the competition until he performs poorly in the [[long jump]]. Realizing Joe must win the last competition, a running race, Peter [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|drugs]] Joe's water with [[anabolic steroid|steroids]].\n\nJoe then proceeds to win the Games, earning a gold medal, leaving triumphantly (with some of the drink spilling onto the ground, and a ladybug drinking it and promptly growing as big as a car, then it plucks a boy out of the audience and flies away), and becoming a notable public figure alongside his trainer Peter. Shortly into his newfound fame, an agent (Jim Kaplan the [[Confidence trick|Con Man]]) approaches Joe and offers him a contract. Joe then appears in advertisements on his own and is awarded his own TV movie. Upon seeing the movie, Peter becomes infuriated, as it contradicts the actual events and portrays Peter as a discouraging female antagonist (played by [[Bea Arthur]]). Brian explains to Peter how Joe is rightfully being praised, since his disability makes his story inspirational. Peter then decides to fake his own disability, produces video footage of an accident in which he is [[paralyzed]], and runs into Quahog's TV station demanding he is honoured with advertisements and TV movies as well. However, [[Tom Tucker (Family Guy)|Tom Tucker]] quickly sees through Peter's alleged \"footage\" (in which he runs over a scarecrow dressed in his clothes alleging this is how he was injured and it turns out the real Peter is the one driving it) and escorts him out.\n\nSome time later, Joe is publicly honored in front of a large crowd by Quahog's mayor, and as Joe fails to acknowledge Peter's part in his success, Peter reveals to everyone that Joe used Steroids to win the Special Games. Joe denies Peter's accusation, but Peter reveals that he spiked Joe's water with steroids. Disgraced, Joe surrenders his gold medal and sinks back into depression.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], Chris and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] discover a clip of $26 at Chris' fundraiser. The siblings engage in a long-dragging conflict over who is to keep the money, even after Joe tells them of their legal obligation to look for the money's original owner first. Their conflict leads [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], as the neutral party, to act as the money-keeper, but he eventually grows tired of the sibling's paranoia over the money and leaves it with them. Once again, the three have a lengthy fight over the money, only to end when Brian lets in a man claiming to be the money's original owner. As the man leaves with the money, Joe recognizes him as the thief stealing the proceeds at the fundraiser and chases him, this time successfully. Joe regains his confidence and re-enlists with the police force. However he unintentionally severs the thief's spine in the chase, killing him.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Family Guy/Season 3#Ready, Willing, and Disabled|Ready, Willing, and Disabled}}\n{{Portal|Television}}\n* {{IMDb episode|0576960}}\n* {{Tv.com episode|101316}}\n\n{{Family Guy (season 3)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ready, Willing, And Disabled}}\n[[Category:Family Guy (season 3) episodes]]\n[[Category:2001 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Special Olympics]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John Lennon]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about disability]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=March 2009}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title =Ready, Willing, and Disabled\n| series =Family Guy\n| image =\n| caption =\n| season =3\n| episode =15\n| airdate =December 20, 2001\n| production =3ACX07\n| director =Andi Klein\n| writer =Alex Barnow<br />Marc Firek<ref>{{cite web |url=https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910756986902121 |title=Family guy.

[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] instructs [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to talk to him. When Peter does, an ad announcing the [[Special Olympics|Special People's Games]] coming to Quahog is shown on television, and Peter encourages Joe to enter the Games, offering himself as a personal coach.\n\nPeter subjects Joe to harsh physical training. As the Games commence, Joe's primary rival is an athlete strongly resembling [[Stephen Hawking]], who repeatedly insults Joe using a [[voice synthesizer]]. Joe heads the competition until he performs poorly in the [[long jump]]. Realizing Joe must win the last competition, a running race, Peter [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|drugs]] Joe's water with [[anabolic steroid|steroids]].\n\nJoe then proceeds to win the Games, earning a gold medal, leaving triumphantly (with some of the drink spilling onto the ground, and a ladybug drinking it and promptly growing as big as a car, then it plucks a boy out of the audience and flies away), and becoming a notable public figure alongside his trainer Peter. Shortly into his newfound fame, an agent (Jim Kaplan the [[Confidence trick|Con Man]]) approaches Joe and offers him a contract. Joe then appears in advertisements on his own and is awarded his own TV movie. Upon seeing the movie, Peter becomes infuriated, as it contradicts the actual events and portrays Peter as a discouraging female antagonist (played by [[Bea Arthur]]). Brian explains to Peter how Joe is rightfully being praised, since his disability makes his story inspirational. Peter then decides to fake his own disability, produces video footage of an accident in which he is [[paralyzed]], and runs into Quahog's TV station demanding he is honoured with advertisements and TV movies as well. However, [[Tom Tucker (Family Guy)|Tom Tucker]] quickly sees through Peter's alleged \"footage\" (in which he runs over a scarecrow dressed in his clothes alleging this is how he was injured and it turns out the real Peter is the one driving it) and escorts him out.\n\nSome time later, Joe is publicly honored in front of a large crowd by Quahog's mayor, and as Joe fails to acknowledge Peter's part in his success, Peter reveals to everyone that Joe used Steroids to win the Special Games. Joe denies Peter's accusation, but Peter reveals that he spiked Joe's water with steroids. Disgraced, Joe surrenders his gold medal and sinks back into depression.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], Chris and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] discover a clip of $26 at Chris' fundraiser. The siblings engage in a long-dragging conflict over who is to keep the money, even after Joe tells them of their legal obligation to look for the money's original owner first. Their conflict leads [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], as the neutral party, to act as the money-keeper, but he eventually grows tired of the sibling's paranoia over the money and leaves it with them. Once again, the three have a lengthy fight over the money, only to end when Brian lets in a man claiming to be the money's original owner. As the man leaves with the money, Joe recognizes him as the thief stealing the proceeds at the fundraiser and chases him, this time successfully. Joe regains his confidence and re-enlists with the police force. However he unintentionally severs the thief's spine in the chase, killing him.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Family Guy/Season 3#Ready, Willing, and Disabled|Ready, Willing, and Disabled}}\n{{Portal|Television}}\n* {{IMDb episode|0576960}}\n* {{Tv.com episode|101316}}\n\n{{Family Guy (season 3)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ready, Willing, And Disabled}}\n[[Category:Family Guy (season 3) episodes]]\n[[Category:2001 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Special Olympics]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John Lennon]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about disability]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready,_Willing,_and_Disabled"}

It originally aired on April 7, 1999 and  is the 32nd episode overall. This episode features [[Jennifer Aniston]] providing the voice for Miss Stevens. The episode criticizes the American Movement to Save the Rain Forest and, in typical tongue-in-cheek fashion, mocks the manner in which the country of [[Costa Rica]] is perceived, and often portrayed (e.g. in domestic entertainment media), by Americans. The episode's title includes a [[shm-reduplication]].\n\nThis episode was inspired by [[Trey Parker]]'s personal intense distaste towards rainforests, which he formed after a visit to [[Costa Rica]]. Parker explains on the DVD commentary that, at the suggestion of [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], Parker and his girlfriend went to Costa Rica and hated the area, and that everything [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] says about the rainforests during the episode is how he (Parker) personally feels.<ref>South Park: Season 3 DVD Boxset Episode Commentary</ref>\n\nThe episode is also filled with famous environmentalist clich\u00e9s, such as, \"[[Leave No Trace|We must take only photos and leave only footprints]]\", \"It's more afraid of us than we are of it\", and \"We have to respect mother nature and she will respect us\".\n\n==Plot==\nMiss Stevens (voiced by [[Jennifer Aniston]]), the leader of the \"Getting Gay With Kids\" environmentalist choir tour, visits South Park Elementary, trying to recruit more kids to the group. The boys get themselves into trouble after calling the choir names and belittling their cause. They are sent to the office, where [[List of South Park Elementary staff#Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey]] punishes the boys by forcing them to join the choir, since he happens to be on the board of directors. [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] is the only one who is happy about it, since he has developed a crush on a girl in the choir named Kelly.\n\nThe choir goes to [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]], to tour, where Miss Stevens tells [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] that she plans on changing his views on third-world countries. Upon arriving, Cartman immediately starts to make trouble, including yelling at Costa Ricans, directing everyone's attention to prostitutes and commenting that San Jose \"smells like ass.\" The children get to meet the Costa Rican President and do a preview dance routine for some citizens of San Jose (with a pre-recorded song for the kids to lip-sync to), but Miss Stevens is dismayed by [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s lack of coordination.  Cartman offers the opinion that Kyle cannot dance because he is Jewish, and \"Jewish people don't have any rhythm.\"  Kyle angrily denies this as a [[stereotype]], but [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] wonders if it is true, making Kyle fear that it is.\n\nThe children then take a tour to see the \"wonders\" of the rainforest. Cartman starts hitting the animals that live in their natural habitats, irritating Miss Stevens. Eventually, their tour guide is killed, eaten, and excreted by a [[coral snake]], all surprisingly in the space of less than a minute, leaving Miss Stevens and the children on their own in the jungle. Cartman hits the snake on the head, which causes it to temporarily chase him, likely to try and do the same thing to him as it did to their tour guide.  They run into a group of guerrilla rebels and try to convince them to help them get back to San Jos\u00e9, but the leader merely criticizes and insults them. When government troops arrive, the choir has to run away. After more time spent wandering lost, Cartman announces that he is leaving the \"[[hippie]]\" group. Only moments later, he finds a friendly crew of construction workers [[deforestation|tearing down trees]] and tells them all about the group getting lost, though not before asking for food. Meanwhile, Kelly takes Kenny to one side and admits her feelings for him, but tries to stop herself from going too far, which annoys Kenny, as she lives on the other side of the USA and cannot manage a [[long-distance relationship]].\n\nBack in San Jos\u00e9, the concert is about an hour away from starting, and the President stalls for time by telling poorly-thought-out \"[[Poles|Polak]]\" jokes. Miss Stevens and the remaining children are captured by a tribe of tiny natives called the Yanagapa (a phonetic parody of the South American indigenous demonym [[Yanomama]]), who offer up Miss Stevens, now dressed in a [[Stanford University|Stanford]]-looking cheerleading outfit, as an offering to a giant native, with Kelly voicing that this offering is more than likely that of a sexual nature.  At this point, Miss Stevens changes her mind and decides that the rainforest is not such a good place, after all. She screams profanities about everything rainforest-related, much to the shock of the natives (and to the boys' annoyance over how long it had taken for her to \"get it\"). Just then, Cartman and the construction workers arrive to destroy the village and save the children. Just as Kelly is making arrangements with Kenny over maintaining a long-distance relationship, he is immediately struck and nearly killed by a bolt of lightning. Afterwards, Kyle and Stan say their usual lines, but Kelly asks them who \"they\" are, since Kenny was struck by lightning, not people.  Kyle and Stan are unable to answer her, claiming: \"You know, They. They're bastards.\" Frustrated, Kelly asks them to help Kenny, but the two are fulfilling their usual role on the show, outraging Kelly even more. She then desperately attempts [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] and successfully saves Kenny, to the amazement of Stan and Kyle.  With this result, Kenny has successfully survived an entire episode for the second time (the first time being \"[[Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo]]\").\n\nWhen the group escapes the forest, Miss Stevens and the children are so happy to leave the jungle that they change their tune: different lyrics are applied to the original song, which now rebukes the rainforest rather than praises it. It meets with a positive response from the audience, as if they were still singing rainforest activism. The episode ends with a message telling people about the dangers of the rainforest and to help stop it.\n\n==Controversy==\nDespite the episode airing in 1999 in the U.S. and a few years later in Latin America, the episode caused some controversy in February 2007 over the comments that Cartman made about Costa Rica saying that the town of San Jose \"smells like ass\" and the way the creators show the country full of \"prostitutes, [[shantytown]]s, and trash.\" The Costa Rican Government was reportedly \"not amused\" with this episode. \n<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110717225625/http://vivirlatino.com/2007/02/21/costa-rica-steamed-over-south-park-episode.php Costa Rica steamed over South Park episode \u00bb VivirLatino<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nAndy Patrizio of [[IGN]] wrote \"Rainforest Shmainforest, is one of my favorites [of the third season]...Hearing [guest voice Jennifer Aniston] lose it at the end, with Stan's line \"Now she gets it\" was just a hoot.\"<ref>http://au.ign.com/articles/2003/12/17/south-park-the-complete-third-season</ref> DVD Verdict wrote \"''Rainforest Schmainforest'' is a hilarious take on [[Up with People]], ecological activists, and foreign cultures\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/southparkseason3.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901020210/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/southparkseason3.php |archivedate=2014-09-01 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s03e01-rainforest-shmainforest Rainforest Shmainforest] Full Episode at South Park Studios\n* [http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/episodes/s03e01-rainforest-shmainforest Rainforest Shmainforest] Episode Guide at South Park Studios\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0705955/ Rainforest Shmainforest] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]\n\n{{South Park episodes|3}}\n\n[[Category:1999 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Costa Rica in fiction]]\n[[Category:Deforestation]]\n[[Category:Jungles in fiction]]\n[[Category:South Park (season 3) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Rainforest Shmainforest\n| series       = South Park\n| image        =\n| caption      = The Getting Gay with Kids Choir runs from rainforest natives\n| season       = 3\n| episode      = 1\n| airdate      = April 7, 1999\n| production   = 301\n| writer       = Trey Parker<br>[[Matt Stone]]\n| director     = [[Trey Parker]]\n| guests       = *[[Jennifer Aniston]] as Miss Stevens\n| season_article = South Park (season 3)\n| episode_list = List of South Park episodes\n| season_list  =\n| prev         = [[Prehistoric Ice Man]]\n| next         = [[Spontaneous Combustion (South Park)|Spontaneous Combustion]]\n}}\n\"'''Rainforest Shmainforest'''\" is the [[South Park (season 3)|third season]] premiere of [[Comedy Central]]'s [[List of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[South Park]]''.
