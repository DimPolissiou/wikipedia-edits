In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ can become [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n! Unround ||Round\n!Round\n|- \n! align=\"left\" | [[Close vowel|Close]] (High)\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|i}} <nowiki><i></nowiki>\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|y}} <nowiki><u></nowiki>\n| align=\"center\" | \n|-\n! align=\"left\" | [[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|e}} <e>\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|\u00f8}} <\u00f6>\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|o}} <o>\n|-\n! align=\"left\" | [[Open vowel|Open]] (Low)\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|a}} <a>\n| align=\"center\" | \n| align=\"center\" | \n|}\nVowel nasalisation occurs on diphthongs only; the few which are not nasalised all end in /i/.\n\n==== Vowel Alternations <ref name=\":0\" />====\n\n* [i] alternates with [\u026a] in unstressed syllables if the vowel in the vowel in the following syllable is [i]. E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare: /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non-compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold; for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories is stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, ''xi\u02bc'' nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix /-xi\u02bc/) and non-''xi\u02bc'' nouns. ''Xi\u02bc'' nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.) Mao 'ina.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p\n\n'I went.'\n\n(b ii.) *Mao 'ina wata'.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p emph:1s\n\n'I went.'\n\nA verb can have up to four arguments, but it is uncommon to express more than one at a time. Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence \u2013 or a variable in the sentence \u2013 a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.'

In Oro Nao, this has been analysed as an [[allophone]] of /t/ that only occurs before /o/ and /y/, although not in every [[Idiolect|idolect]]. In some dialects it is a separate phoneme; however, only about 24 words contain the sound, some of which are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]]. It also is used more by older speakers of the language.\n\n==== Consonant Alternations <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Everett, Daniel L.|title=Wari : the Pacaas Novos Language of Western Brazil.|isbn=978-0-203-19332-7|oclc=1048248320}}</ref>====\n\n* /t\u0361\u0283/ can become [\u0283], with a tendency to surface as [\u0283] more before unrounded vowels than rounded ones: ''xaxi' na'' 'he is thin' can be [t\u0361\u0283a\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u0294 na] or [\u0283a\u02c8\u0283i\u0294 na].\n* [m] alternates with [m<sup><small>b</small></sup>] (a sequence of the bilabial nasal followed by the voiced bilabial stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'its filth' <homiri> can be [homi\u02c8\u027ei] or [hom<sup><small>b</small></sup>i\u02c8\u027ei].\n* [n] alternates with [n<small><sup>d</sup></small>] (a sequence of the voiced alveolar nasal followed the voiced alveolar stop) syllable initially, most frequently before /a/ but also before other vowels. The tendency to realise it as a sequence is greater if the syllable is stressed. E.g. 'my head' <wina> can be either [wi\u02c8na] or [wi\u02c8n<small><sup>d</sup></small>a].\n* [j] alternates with [\u0292] before /i/. E.g. 'let's go!' <maji> can be [ma\u02c8ji] or [ma\u02c8\u0292i].\n* [\u0294j] alternates with [\u0294d\u0361\u0292] word initially. E.g. 'I am afraid' <jin' 'ina> can be [\u02c8\u0294jin\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna] or [\u02c8\u0294d\u0361\u0292in\u0294 \u0294i\u02ccna].\n\n===Vowels===\nWari\u02bc has one of the world's most asymmetrical vowel systems.  Vowels are generally expected to be somewhat evenly distributed in vowel space, not bunched into a corner.  Additionally, vowels are expected to be [[rounded vowel|unrounded]] when front and rounded when back until \"gaps\" in the vowel system have been filled. Although Wari\u02bc has only six vowels, four of these are close/close-mid front vowels, of which two are rounded (although {{IPA|/\u00f8/}} is uncommon). Non-native speakers have marked difficulty in distinguishing these front vowels, that contrast with only a single back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"| \n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:80%\" \n!

E.g. 'it is rocking' <piquirim na> can be [piki\u02c8\u027eim na] or [p\u026ak\u026a\u02c8\u027eim na].\n* /e/ becomes [\u025b] before all stops other than [\u0294], and in unstressed syllables in harmony with /e/ becoming [\u025b] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'day' <xec> is [t\u0361\u0283\u025bk] because of the [k], and 'they went out.' <hwerehwet mama' nana> is [h\u02b7\u025b\u027e\u025b\u02cch\u02b7\u025bt ma\u02c8ma\u0294 na\u02ccna] because the [t] in the stressed syllable causes /e/ to become [\u025b] and the preceding ones change in harmony.\n* /e/ becomes [\u026a] before nasals, and in harmony with a /e/ becoming [\u026a] in the stressed syllable. E.g. 'it is numb' <teteren na> is [t\u026at\u026a\u02c8\u027e\u026an na].\n* [o] alternates with [\u028a] in unstressed syllables when the vowel in the stressed syllable is not [o]. E.g. 'its seed' <tocoi> can be [to\u02c8k\u02b7i] or [t\u028a\u02c8k\u02b7i].\n* [\u00f8] is a rare segment and for some speakers is evolving into [e] in open syllables and [y] in closed ones.\n\n=== Syllables ===\nThe basic syllable in Wari' is CV(C), but suffixes can be of the form VC, VCVC or V. Only stops and nasals can occur in syllable [[Coda (syllable)|codas]]. Consonant clusters are rare: /n/ is the only first segment found, and /t/, /k/ and /t\u0361\u0283/ are the only second segments found in non-compound words.\n\nWari\u02bc has words ending in the consonant clusters {{IPA|/m\u0294/}} and {{IPA|/n\u0294/}}. These have been analysed as single sounds, but apparently only to avoid complicating Wari\u02bc syllable structure. If these are separate phonemes, they only occur word finally.\n\nIn the Oro Nao dialect, many consonants alternate with [\u0294C] at the beginning of monosyllabic words, and [\u0294] always precedes word initial semivowels ([j] and [w]), including in polysyllabic words. There is a correlation between words that begin [\u0294C] in Oro Nao and words that begin [\u0294aC] in other dialects. For example, 'water' is <com''>'' [\u0294kom] in Oro Nao and <'acom''>'' [\u0294a\u02c8kom] in other dialects. Loss of this initial syllable is a potential explanation of why these words have variants that break the [[Phonotactics|phonotactic]] rules. However, these generalisations do not always hold; for instance 'thorn' <pi> [\u0294pi] is pronounced the same in all dialects.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe final syllable of words in major lexical categories is stressed. The verb tends to take the primary stress, with secondary stress on the others. However, emphasis of a particular word can cause transfer of the primary stress.\n\n== Morphology ==\nWari\u02bc is a largely [[Analytic language|analytic]] language, which has almost no verbal inflection but lots of [[Morphological derivation|derivational processes]]. \n\n=== Possession ===\nWari\u02bc has two main classes of nouns, ''xi\u02bc'' nouns (named as such because their citation form ends with the suffix /-xi\u02bc/) and non-''xi\u02bc'' nouns. ''Xi\u02bc'' nouns are [[Inalienable possession|inalienably possessed]], and therefore have a [[Morphology (linguistics)|paradigm]] of possession marking suffixes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | -0\n!Inclusive\n!Exclusive\n|-\n| -xi\u02bc\n| -xut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n| -m\n| colspan=\"2\" | -hu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n| -con\n| colspan=\"2\" | -cocon\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n| -cam\n| colspan=\"2\" | -camam\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n| -in\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\nSome forms have [[Allomorph|allomorphs]], especially when following stems that ends in the vowel [e], for instance -con becomes -cun and -cam becomes -quem.\n\nThere is also a paradigm of [[Nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] inflectional [[Clitic|clitics]] that inflect for person, number and third person gender. These are used to show possession of a non-xi\u02bc noun.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Singular\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural \n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |'''First'''\n| rowspan=\"2\" |ne\n![[Clusivity|Inclusive]]\n!Exclusive\n|-\n|nexi\u02bc\n|nuxut\n|-\n!'''Second'''\n|nem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nuhu\u02bc\n|-\n!'''Third Masculine'''\n|nucun\n| colspan=\"2\" |nucucun\n|-\n!'''Third Feminine'''\n|nequem\n| colspan=\"2\" |nequequem\n|-\n!'''Third Neuter'''\n|nein\n| colspan=\"2\" |N/A*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Only nouns referring to humans trigger number agreement.\n\nMost xi\u02bc nouns have alternate forms which cannot be possessed. To signify possession of these forms, you must use the inalienable xi\u02bc counterparts. \n\nE.g. (a) 'aracon\n\nbone-3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n(b) *'at nucun\n\nbone poss:3sm\n\n'his bone or leg'\n\n=== Reduplication ===\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThere is no [[affixation]] at all on verbs, but [[reduplication]] is used to mark aspect. Plural forms are derived by partial reduplication of the CV from the [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] syllable. This can either be a CV(CV) pattern, (where the second is optional) usually for [[Transitive verb|transitive verbs]], or a CVrV pattern, usually for [[Intransitive verb|intransitive verbs]]. About a third of plural forms are derived by each of these types of reduplication, and the final third by [[suppletion]].\n\nE.g. (a) wac 'cut' (singular), wawac 'cut' (plural)\n\n(b) cao' 'eat' (singular), cacacao' 'eat' (plural)\n\n(c) cat 'break' (singular), caracat 'break' (plural)\n\n==== Nouns ====\nReduplication of nouns can derive names or descriptive terms.\n\nE.g. (a) capija capija\n\nmouth-1s mouth-1s\n\n'talker'\n\n(b) Towira Towira\n\ntesticles-1s testicles-1s\n\n'legendary character who has enlarged testicles'\n\n=== Clitics ===\nWari\u02bc has both verbal and nominal inflectional clitics, which are analysed as such and not affixes for a few reasons. Verbal inflectional clitics can occur as whole utterances as responses, as the referent is clear from the previous statement. They also do not undergo the phonological processes that you would expect if they were suffixes to the main verb, for instance they do not take the primary stress, which the possessive suffixes do when they attach to xi\u02bc nouns.\n\nVerbal inflectional clitics are inflected for person, number, tense, third person gender (only if tenseless), voice, and contain both the subject and the object of the verb. Where there is more than one object, the clitic represents one object based on the [[semantic role|semantic roles]] present in the following hierarchy: <small>GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>LOCATION>TIME.</small>\n\n=== [[Morphophonology|Morphophonological]] Processes ===\nWari\u02bc has three types of [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilatory]] process - regressive (or anticipatory), progressive (or preservative) and coalescent. This mainly occurs across word-initial morpheme boundaries.\n\nRegressive assimilation occurs at morpheme boundaries involving consonants, where the consonant of the suffix causes a change in the consonant of the stem. This happens when xi\u02bc nouns with stems that end in -ji inflect for third person masculine or feminine, as the /k/ in the suffix causes the /y/ in the stem to become /ts/. E.g. tara'''j'''i- 'ear' + -'''c'''on '3sm' = tara'''x'''i'''c'''on 'his ear' \n\nProgressive assimilation occurs over morpheme boundaries between nasal consonants or diphthongs and voiceless stops. This type of assimilation is optional but common in normal speech, however does not seem to appear in careful speech. E.g. Mon te? 'Where is my father?' can be pronounced as either [mon'de] or [mon'te].\n\nCoalescence is the most common assimilatory process, which is often accompanied by regressive [[vowel harmony]]. There are three principles which guide the output of vowel coalescence. \n\n# If one of the two vowels is a back vowel, the output vowel will be a back vowel. (E.g. xiri- 'house' + -u '1s' = xuru 'my house')\n# The output vowel will have the height of the highest vowel of the two input vowels. (E.g. toco- 'eye' + -um '2s' = tucum 'their eyes')\n# If the input vowels are identical, the output vowel is identical (this only occurs with /i/+/i/ in the corpus collected by Everett and Kern (1996)).\n\n== Syntax ==\nBasic [[Word order|constituent order]] in Wari\u02bc is deemed to be VOS, although it is uncommon to have multiple expressed [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]]. Often [[Argument (linguistics)|arguments]] to the verb are indicated by the agreement affixes which form the verbal inflectional clitics, where the subject affix precedes the one for the object. A third person object or subject can either be overtly marked or just referenced in the inflectional clitic, first and second person can only be marked by the clitic.\n\nE.g. (a i.) Mao na Orowao.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p m:name\n\n'Orowao went.'\n\n(a ii.) Mao na.\n\ngo:s 3s:rp/p\n\n'He went.'\n\n(b i.) Mao 'ina.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p\n\n'I went.'\n\n(b ii.) *Mao 'ina wata'.\n\ngo:s 1s:rp/p emph:1s\n\n'I went.'\n\nA verb can have up to four arguments, but it is uncommon to express more than one at a time. Instances of three or more arguments being expressed usually only come from elicited examples.\n\n==== COMP sentences ====\nCOMP sentences are referred to as such by Everett and Kern (1996) because their initial position is occupied by what they refer to as a COMP or [[complementizer]] word. These give the sentence - or a variable in the sentence - a particular interpretation. \n\nFor a sentence to be a COMP sentence, it must have a COMP word in the initial position, an inflectional morpheme closely following which gives information about tense, mood, and sometimes gender, and a tenseless verbal inflectional clitic following the verb.\n\nHere is a list of the COMP words found in the Oro Nao dialect.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!COMP word\n!Morphological composition\n!Function\n!Example sentence\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that:prox:hearer'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Ma'''' co tomi' na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:m/frp/p speak 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''Who''' is speaking?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mon\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-on '3sm object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (masculine)\n|'''Mon''' tarama' co mao nain Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' man INFL:m/frp/p go:s 3s:rp/p-3n place:name\n|-\n|''''Which''' man went to Guajar\u00e1?\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mam\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-m '3sf object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (feminine)\n|'''Mam''' narima co xain na?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' woman INFL:m/frp/p hot 3srp/p\n|-\n|''''Which''' woman has a fever?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |main\n| rowspan=\"3\" |ma'+-in '3n object'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation (neuter) \n|'''Main''' ca mao ca?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm\n|-\n|''''Where''' did he go?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'om\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to not exist'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |negation\n|'''<nowiki/>'Om''' ca mao ca.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sm.\n|-\n|'He '''did not''' go.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |mo\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'list presentation'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |condition\n|'''Mo''' xi pi'am cacama.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:irr sleep 3pf\n|-\n|''''If''' they slept.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ac\n| rowspan=\"3\" |preverbal modifier 'like'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |indication of resemblance\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ac''' ca mao cama na.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p go:s 3sf 3s:rp/p\n|-\n|''''It seems like''' she went.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |je\n| rowspan=\"3\" |emphatic pronoun '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |affirmation/interrogation\n|'''Je''' 'i ca' ca tomi' cocon Xijam.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' n this:n INFL:nrp/p speak 3sm-3pm m:name\n|-\n|'This is what Xijam said to them.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'ane\n| rowspan=\"3\" |verb 'to be different'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[https://glossary.sil.org/term/concession-relation contraexpectation]\n|'''<nowiki/>'Ane''' ca wari' 'iri' ca' ne.\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p person 1pincl this:n rec:past\n|-\n|''''But/because''' we are people.'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |cain' \n| rowspan=\"3\" |demonstrative 'that neuter distal'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |interrogation\n|'''Cain'''' ca tomi' cama?\n|-\n|'''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p speak 3sf\n|-\n|''''What''' did she say?'\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |pain\n| rowspan=\"3\" |prepostition '3n'\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Subordination (linguistics)|subordination]]\n|Tomi' xaxa' 'urut '''pain''' ca cono' cacama xuruxut pane.\n|-\n|speak distractedly 1pexcl:rp/p '''COMP''' INFL:nrp/p die:p 3pf siblings-1pexcl rem:past\n|-\n|'We are sad '''because''' our brothers died.'\n|}\n\n==== Copular Sentences ====\nWari\u02bc does not have a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] verb, so sentences that would use this instead have what would be the adjective become the verb.\n\nE.g. (a) Tarama' na pije'.\n\nman 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The baby is male.' (literally 'The baby mans.')\n\n(b) Wijimain na xirim.\n\nsmallness-3n 3s:rp/p house\n\n'The house is small.' (literally 'The house smalls.')\n\n(c) Hwap na pije'.\n\nfast:s 3s:rp/p child\n\n'The child is fast.' (literally 'The child fasts.')\n\n==== Definiteness ====\nWari\u02bc does not have any articles. [[Definiteness]] or indefiniteness can can be expressed by either the use of [[Demonstrative|demonstratives]] or verbal inflectional clitics containing the object. However this latter option does not always distinguish definiteness, as indefinite objects can also be marked in the inflectional clitics.\n\n(a) Cao' 'ina hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p fish\n\n'I ate fish.' (Indefinite)\n\n(b) Cao' 'inon hwam.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm hwam.\n\n'I ate (the) fish.' (Ambiguous)\n\n(c) Cao' 'inon hwam cwa'.\n\neat 1s:rp/p-3sm fish this:m/f\n\n'I ate this fish.'

The Grimm story, which is commonly referred to as \"Snow White\",<ref name=bartels/> should not be confused with the story of \"[[Snow-White and Rose-Red]]\" (in German \"''Schneewei\u00dfchen und Rosenrot''\"), another fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm.\n\nIn the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification systems|Aarne\u2013Thompson folklore classification]], tales of this kind are grouped together as type 709, Snow White. Others of this kind include \"[[Bella Venezia]]\", \"[[Myrsina]]\", \"[[Nourie Hadig]]\", \"[[Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree]]\",<ref name=surla/> \"[[The Young Slave]]\", and \"[[La petite Toute-Belle]]\".\n\n==Story==\n[[File:Makart hans das schlafende schneewittchen.jpg|left|thumb|The fable's antagonist the [[Evil Queen]] with the protagonist Snow White as depicted in ''The Sleeping Snow White'' by [[Hans Makart]] (1872)]]\n\nAt the beginning of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the freshly fallen white snow on the black windowsill. Then, she says to herself, \"How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as night.\" Some time later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth a short while later.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nA year later, Snow White's father, [[King (Snow White)|the king]], marries again. His new wife is very beautiful, but she is a vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. [[Evil Queen|The new queen]] possesses a [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|magic mirror]], which she asks every morning, \"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that, because the magic mirror never lies. But as Snow White grows up, she becomes more beautiful each day and even more beautiful than her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/>\n\nThis gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders [[Huntsman (Snow White)|a huntsman]] to take Snow White into the forest to be killed. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen demands that he returns with her lungs and liver, which she will consume in order to become as beautiful as Snow White. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his knife he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White finds out about her stepmother's plan, she tearfully begs, \"Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!\" The huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the lungs and liver of a boar instead.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nAfter wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of [[Seven Dwarfs|seven dwarfs]]. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there is a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for housekeeping. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nMeanwhile, the queen, believing that Snow White is dead, asks her mirror once again: \"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror tells her that Snow White is still the fairest in the land.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/> The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White is still alive, and decides to kill the girl herself. She appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky [[bodice|laced bodices]] as a present; the queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints. The dwarfs return just in time, and Snow White revives when the dwarfs loosen the laces.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/> Upon hearing from her Magic Mirror that Snow White still lives, the queen dresses as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she brushes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl faints again, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. The Magic Mirror informs the queen that her plan has failed again and Snow White is not dead, so the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White. The girl eagerly takes a bite and falls down unconscious. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White. Assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass casket.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/>\n\nThree days later, [[Prince Charming|a prince]] stumbles upon Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the seven dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place. While Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, reviving her. In the first edition, Snow White is carried to the palace without mishap, but later a servant, frustrated by the inconvenience caused by the prince's fawning over her, hits the body and dislodges the apple.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grimm|first1=Jacob|last2=Grimm|first2=Wilhelm|editor1-last=Zipes|editor1-first=Jack|title=The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: the complete first edition.|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn= 9780691160597|oclc=879662315}}, I pp. 184-85.</ref> The prince is overjoyed, and declares his love for Snow White. Snow White agrees to marry him.\n\nSnow White and the prince invite everyone to their wedding party, including Snow White's stepmother.\n\nThe queen, still believing that Snow White is dead, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that the prince's bride is the fairest. Not knowing that the bride is her stepdaughter, the queen arrives at the wedding to investigate. Frozen with rage and fear, she tries to sow chaos but the prince recognizes her as a threat. He orders that she wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and dance in them until she drops dead for the attempted murder of Snow White.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Franz J\u00fcttner's illustrations from ''Sneewittchen'' (1905)\">\nFile:Franz J\u00fcttner Schneewittchen 1.jpg|1.

In 1994, a German historian named Eckhard Sander published ''Schneewittchen: M\u00e4rchen oder Wahrheit?'' (''Snow White: Fairy Tale or Truth?''), claiming he had uncovered an account that may have inspired the story that first appeared in [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|''Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales'']]. According to Sander, the character of Snow White was based on the life of [[Margaretha von Waldeck]], a German countess born to [[Philipp IV, Count of Waldeck|Philip IV]] in 1533. At the age of 16, Margarete was forced by her stepmother, Katharina of Hatzfeld, to move away to [[Brussels]]. There, Margarete fell in love with a prince who would later become [[Philip II of Spain]]. Margarete's father and stepmother disapproved of the relationship as it was \u2018politically inconvenient\u2019. Margarete mysteriously died at the age of 21, apparently having been poisoned. Historical accounts point to the King of Spain who, in opposing the romance, may have dispatched Spanish agents to murder Margarete.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Schneewittchen: Marchen oder Wahrheit? : ein lokaler Bezug zum Kellerwald|last = Sander|first = Eckhard|year = 1994|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nScholar Graham Anderson compares the story of Snow White to the Roman legend of [[Daedalion#Mythology|Chione]], recorded in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. The name ''Chione'' means \"Snow\" in Greek and, in the story, she is described as the most beautiful woman in the land, so beautiful that the gods [[Apollo]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] both fell in love with her. Mercury put her to sleep with the touch of his [[caduceus]] and raped her in her sleep. Then Apollo, disguised as an old crone, approached her and raped her again. These affections led Chione to openly boast that she was more beautiful than the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] herself, resulting in Diana shooting her through the tongue with an arrow.<ref>[[Ovid]], Metamorphoses, Book XI, 289</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the ancient world |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|url= https://books.google.com/?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world+rhodopis&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Fairytale%20in%20the%20ancient%20world%20rhodopis&f=false|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nKarlheinz Bartels, a pharmacist and scholar from [[Lohr am Main]], a town in northwestern [[Bavaria]], found evidence that Snow White was Maria Sophia Margarethe Catharina, Baroness von und zu Erthal, who was born in Lohr on June 25, 1725.<ref>{{cite book |url= |title=Schneewittchen \u2013 Zur Fabulologie des Spessarts |last=Bartels|first=Karlheinz |publisher=Geschichts- und Museumsverein Lohr a.

Disney's variation of Snow White gave the [[List of names of the Seven Dwarfs|dwarfs names]] and included a singing [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]. The Disney film also is the only version in which Snow White and her prince meet before she bites the apple; in fact, it is this meeting that sets the plot in motion. Instead of her lungs and liver, as written in the original, the huntsman is asked by [[Evil Queen (Disney)|the queen]] to bring back Snow White's heart. While the heart is mentioned, it is never shown in the box. Snow White is much more mature (an adolescent). And she is discovered by the dwarfs after ''cleaning'' the house, not vandalizing it. Furthermore, in the Disney movie the evil queen tries only once to kill Snow White (by a poisoned apple) and fails (this was likely to save time). She then dies by falling down a cliff and being crushed by a boulder, after the dwarfs had chased her through the forest. In the original, the queen is forced to dance to death.<ref>Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales, p 194, {{ISBN|978-1-60710-313-4}}</ref>\n\nMany later versions omit the Queen's attempted [[cannibalism]], eating what she believed to be the lungs and liver of Snow White. This may be a reference to old [[Slavic mythology]] which includes tales of witches eating human [[heart]]s.\n\n==In other traditions==\nMany other variations of the story exist across and outside Europe. In some of these variations the dwarfs are robbers, while the magic mirror is a dialogue with the sun or moon.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n* In a version from Albania, collected by [[Johann Georg von Hahn]],<ref name=\"hahn\" /> the main character lives with 40 dragons, and her sleep is caused by a ring. The beginning of the story has a twist, in that a teacher urges the heroine to kill her evil stepmother so that she would take her place. The origin of this tale is debated; it is likely no older than the Middle Ages. In fact, there are possibly two Albanian versions of Snow White: one in which her stepmother tries to kill her, and another in which her two jealous sisters try to kill her.\n* \"The Jealous Sisters\" is another Albanian fairy tale.

For example, the huntsman, who was ordered to kill Snow White, describes her as a \"pretty child\" and lets her go, which carries over to when the seven dwarfs decide not to cast her out when they find Snow White in their home. Even when the Queen devises the poison apple and kills Snow White, she is saved by the Prince because he finds her to be \"the fairest of them all.\" The Queen dies at the end of the story while Snow White lives happily ever after with the Prince, implying that the Queen's cunning was not enough to counter the power of Snow White's elegance. This suggests that the moral of the story is that beauty is more desirable than intelligence. Despite the modern connotations of this concept, one must consider the time period at which the story was written; Snow White as told by the Brothers Grimm was first published in 1812, where at the time, it was arguably common place for people to live according to traditional gender roles.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature|Germany}}\n*[[Sne\u017eana]], a Slavic female name meaning \"snow woman\" with a similar connotation to \"Snow White\"\n* \"[[Snow-White-Fire-Red]]\", an Italian fairy tale\n* \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\"\n*\"[[The Glass Coffin]]\"\n*\"[[Udea and her Seven Brothers]]\" \n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=multiple2>Jacob Grimm & Wilhelm Grimm: ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen''; Band 1, 7.

The [[Brothers Grimm]] published it in 1812 in the first edition of their collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]''. It was titled in German: ''Sneewittchen'' (in modern orthography ''Schneewittchen'') and numbered as Tale 53. The name ''Sneewittchen'' was [[Low German]] and in the first version it was translated with ''Schneewei\u00dfchen''. The Grimms completed their final revision of the story in 1854.<ref name=multiple2/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qr3BAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Snow+White%22+is+a+German+fairy+tale+known+across+much+of+Europe+and+is+today+one+of+the+most+famous+fairy+tales+worldwide#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: The Complete First ... |author1=Jacob Grimm |author2=Wilhelm Grimm |website=Books.google.co.in |date=2014-10-19 |accessdate=2016-04-05|isbn=9781400851898 }}</ref>\n\nThe fairy tale features such elements as the [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|magic mirror]], the poisoned apple, the glass coffin, and the characters of the [[Evil Queen]] and the [[Seven Dwarfs]]. The seven dwarfs were first given individual names in the 1912 Broadway play ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1912 play)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and then given [[List of names of the Seven Dwarfs|different names]] in [[Walt Disney]]'s 1937 film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. The Grimm story, which is commonly referred to as \"Snow White\",<ref name=bartels/> should not be confused with the story of \"[[Snow-White and Rose-Red]]\" (in German \"''Schneewei\u00dfchen und Rosenrot''\"), another fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm.\n\nIn the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification systems|Aarne\u2013Thompson folklore classification]], tales of this kind are grouped together as type 709, Snow White. Others of this kind include \"[[Bella Venezia]]\", \"[[Myrsina]]\", \"[[Nourie Hadig]]\", \"[[Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree]]\",<ref name=surla/> \"[[The Young Slave]]\", and \"[[La petite Toute-Belle]]\".\n\n==Story==\n[[File:Makart hans das schlafende schneewittchen.jpg|left|thumb|The fable's antagonist the [[Evil Queen]] with the protagonist Snow White as depicted in ''The Sleeping Snow White'' by [[Hans Makart]] (1872)]]\n\nAt the beginning of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the freshly fallen white snow on the black windowsill. Then, she says to herself, \"How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as night.\" Some time later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth a short while later.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nA year later, Snow White's father, [[King (Snow White)|the king]], marries again. His new wife is very beautiful, but she is a vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. [[Evil Queen|The new queen]] possesses a [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|magic mirror]], which she asks every morning, \"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that, because the magic mirror never lies. But as Snow White grows up, she becomes more beautiful each day and even more beautiful than her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/>\n\nThis gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders [[Huntsman (Snow White)|a huntsman]] to take Snow White into the forest to be killed. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen demands that he returns with her lungs and liver, which she will consume in order to become as beautiful as Snow White. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his knife he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White finds out about her stepmother's plan, she tearfully begs, \"Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!\" The huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the lungs and liver of a boar instead.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nAfter wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of [[Seven Dwarfs|seven dwarfs]]. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there is a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for housekeeping. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nMeanwhile, the queen, believing that Snow White is dead, asks her mirror once again: \"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror tells her that Snow White is still the fairest in the land.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/> The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White is still alive, and decides to kill the girl herself. She appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky [[bodice|laced bodices]] as a present; the queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints. The dwarfs return just in time, and Snow White revives when the dwarfs loosen the laces.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/> Upon hearing from her Magic Mirror that Snow White still lives, the queen dresses as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she brushes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl faints again, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. The Magic Mirror informs the queen that her plan has failed again and Snow White is not dead, so the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White. The girl eagerly takes a bite and falls down unconscious. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White. Assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass casket.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/>\n\nThree days later, [[Prince Charming|a prince]] stumbles upon Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the seven dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place. While Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, reviving her. In the first edition, Snow White is carried to the palace without mishap, but later a servant, frustrated by the inconvenience caused by the prince's fawning over her, hits the body and dislodges the apple.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grimm|first1=Jacob|last2=Grimm|first2=Wilhelm|editor1-last=Zipes|editor1-first=Jack|title=The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: the complete first edition.|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn= 9780691160597|oclc=879662315}}, I pp. 184-85.</ref> The prince is overjoyed, and declares his love for Snow White. Snow White agrees to marry him.\n\nSnow White and the prince invite everyone to their wedding party, including Snow White's stepmother.\n\nThe queen, still believing that Snow White is dead, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that the prince's bride is the fairest. Not knowing that the bride is her stepdaughter, the queen arrives at the wedding to investigate. Frozen with rage and fear, she tries to sow chaos but the prince recognizes her as a threat. He orders that she wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and dance in them until she drops dead for the attempted murder of Snow White.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Franz J\u00fcttner's illustrations from ''Sneewittchen'' (1905)\">\nFile:Franz J\u00fcttner Schneewittchen 1.jpg|1.

In 1994, a German historian named Eckhard Sander published ''Schneewittchen: M\u00e4rchen oder Wahrheit?'' (''Snow White: Fairy Tale or Truth?''), claiming he had uncovered an account that may have inspired the story that first appeared in [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|''Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales'']]. According to Sander, the character of Snow White was based on the life of [[Margaretha von Waldeck]], a German countess born to [[Philipp IV, Count of Waldeck|Philip IV]] in 1533. At the age of 16, Margarete was forced by her stepmother, Katharina of Hatzfeld, to move away to [[Brussels]].

The name ''Chione'' means \"Snow\" in Greek and, in the story, she is described as the most beautiful woman in the land, so beautiful that the gods [[Apollo]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] both fell in love with her. Mercury put her to sleep with the touch of his [[caduceus]] and raped her in her sleep. Then Apollo, disguised as an old crone, approached her and raped her again.

Disney's variation of Snow White gave the [[List of names of the Seven Dwarfs|dwarfs names]] and included a singing [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]. The Disney film also is the only version in which Snow White and her prince meet before she bites the apple; in fact, it is this meeting that sets the plot in motion. Instead of her lungs and liver, as written in the original, the huntsman is asked by [[Evil Queen (Disney)|the queen]] to bring back Snow White's heart. While the heart is mentioned, it is never shown in the box. Snow White is much more mature (an adolescent). And she is discovered by the dwarfs after ''cleaning'' the house, not vandalizing it. Furthermore, in the Disney movie the evil queen tries only once to kill Snow White (by a poisoned apple) and fails (this was likely to save time). She then dies by falling down a cliff and being crushed by a boulder, after the dwarfs had chased her through the forest. In the original, the queen is forced to dance to death.<ref>Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales, p 194, {{ISBN|978-1-60710-313-4}}</ref>\n\nMany later versions omit the Queen's attempted [[cannibalism]], eating what she believed to be the lungs and liver of Snow White. This may be a reference to old [[Slavic mythology]] which includes tales of witches eating human [[heart]]s.\n\n==In other traditions==\nMany other variations of the story exist across and outside Europe. In some of these variations the dwarfs are robbers, while the magic mirror is a dialogue with the sun or moon.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n* In a version from Albania, collected by [[Johann Georg von Hahn]],<ref name=\"hahn\" /> the main character lives with 40 dragons, and her sleep is caused by a ring. The beginning of the story has a twist, in that a teacher urges the heroine to kill her evil stepmother so that she would take her place. The origin of this tale is debated; it is likely no older than the Middle Ages. In fact, there are possibly two Albanian versions of Snow White: one in which her stepmother tries to kill her, and another in which her two jealous sisters try to kill her.\n* \"The Jealous Sisters\" is another Albanian fairy tale.

For example, the huntsman, who was ordered to kill Snow White, describes her as a \"pretty child\" and lets her go, which carries over to when the seven dwarfs decide not to cast her out when they find Snow White in their home. Even when the Queen devises the poison apple and kills Snow White, she is saved by the Prince because he finds her to be \"the fairest of them all.\" The Queen dies at the end of the story while Snow White lives happily ever after with the Prince, implying that the Queen's cunning was not enough to counter the power of Snow White's elegance. This suggests that the moral of the story is that beauty is more desirable than intelligence. Despite the modern connotations of this concept, one must consider the time period at which the story was written; Snow White as told by the Brothers Grimm was first published in 1812, where at the time, it was arguably common place for people to live according to traditional gender roles.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature|Germany}}\n*[[Sne\u017eana]], a Slavic female name meaning \"snow woman\" with a similar connotation to \"Snow White\"\n* \"[[Snow-White-Fire-Red]]\", an Italian fairy tale\n* \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\"\n*\"[[The Glass Coffin]]\"\n*\"[[Udea and her Seven Brothers]]\" \n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=multiple2>Jacob Grimm & Wilhelm Grimm: ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen''; Band 1, 7.
