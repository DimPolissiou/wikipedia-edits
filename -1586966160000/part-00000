The novel tells the story of three children, [[Violet Baudelaire|Violet]], [[Klaus Baudelaire|Klaus]], and [[Sunny Baudelaire]], who become orphans following a fire and are sent to live with [[Count Olaf]], who attempts to steal their inheritance.\n\nThe book was published on September 30, 1999, by Scholastic Inc. and illustrated by [[Brett Helquist]]. An audiobook was released in 2003, several special editions of the book have been made and the book has been translated into many different languages.\n\n==Synopsis==\nViolet Baudelaire is fourteen years old and loves creating amazing inventions; Klaus Baudelaire is twelve and an obsessive reader; Sunny Baudelaire is a baby and uses words only her siblings and parents understand and has several surprisingly large and sharp buckteeth. The children are told by a family friend, Mr. Poe, that their parents have died in a fire that destroyed their home. They are placed in the care of Count Olaf, said to be a distant relative although the children had never heard of him before. Olaf's ramshackle house is filthy and covered in disconcerting eye images; it has a tower which the Baudelaires are forbidden from entering. Count Olaf is unpleasant, easily angered, and forces the children to perform odious chores. It becomes clear that Count Olaf is scheming to collect the Baudelaire's fortune.\n\nOne day, the Baudelaires are set the task of making dinner for Olaf and his theater troupe. They make puttanesca, but when Olaf arrives, he demands roast beef. The children remind him that he never asked them to make roast beef, and Olaf becomes angry, lifting Sunny into the air and striking Klaus across the face after Klaus tells everyone Count Olaf has given them only one bed.\n\nOlaf demands that the children perform in his new play in which Violet will marry Olaf. The children realize something is amiss and use the library of their friendly but credulous and inept neighbor, Justice Strauss, to research law. Klaus learns that the marriage in the play will be legally binding, meaning Olaf will gain control of their fortune. He confronts Olaf, who gets one of his associates to put Sunny in a birdcage, dangling from outside the window of his tower. He threatens to kill her if Klaus and Violet do not follow his plan. Violet constructs a makeshift grappling hook and uses it to climb the tower. She finds the hook-handed man (a member of Olaf's theater troupe) waiting to capture her. Klaus is brought up to the tower and they are locked together in the room until the play begins.\n\nAfter Violet signs the marriage document, Olaf interrupts to tell the audience that their wedding was legally binding. Justice Strauss and Mr. Poe both object, but concede that the law requires them to hand over the Baudelaire fortune to Olaf. Violet interrupts to proclaim that the marriage was not legally binding, as she signed with her left hand despite being right-handed. Justice Strauss agrees that this invalidates the marriage. Before Olaf can be arrested for locking up Sunny, one of his associates turns the lights in the theater off and he is able to escape. Justice Strauss tells the Baudelaires that she is willing to adopt them; however, Mr. Poe says that this would go against their parents' will, as Justice Strauss is not their relative. He takes them back to his household until he can find another guardian for them.\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn 2012, ''[[School Library Journal]]'' named ''The Bad Beginning'' the 48th best children's novel.<ref>{{cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Bird|url=http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/05/28/top-100-childrens-novels-48-the-bad-beginning-by-lemony-snicket|title=Top 100 Children's Novels #48: The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket|work=[[School Library Journal]]|date=May 28, 2012|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' noted the uncomfortably macabre tone of the novel, warning that because \"the Baudelaire children are truly sympathetic characters\", the novel is \"not for the squeamish\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/adult/lemony-snicket/the-bad-begninning|title=Review from ''Kirkus Reviews''|date=July 15, 1999|work=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref> Catherine Pelosi of ''Kids' Book Review'' responded positively to ''The Bad Beginning'', describing it as \"exciting, humorous and appropriately dark\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kids-bookreview.com/2011/08/review-series-of-unfortunate-events-bad.html|title=Review: A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning|work=Kids' Book Review|last=Pelosi|first=Catherine|date=August 9, 2011|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Special editions==\n\n===''The Bad Beginning: Rare Edition''===\n''The Bad Beginning: Rare Edition'' ({{ISBN|0-06-051828-6}}) was published by [[HarperCollins]] on September 23, 2003.

The novel tells the story of three children, [[Violet Baudelaire|Violet]], [[Klaus Baudelaire|Klaus]], and [[Sunny Baudelaire]], who become orphans following a fire and are sent to live with [[Count Olaf]], who attempts to steal their inheritance.\n\nThe book was published on September 30, 1999, by Scholastic Inc. and illustrated by [[Brett Helquist]]. An audiobook was released in 2003, several special editions of the book have been made and the book has been translated into many different languages.\n\n==Synopsis==\nViolet Baudelaire is fourteen years old and loves creating amazing inventions; Klaus Baudelaire is twelve and an obsessive reader; Sunny Baudelaire is a baby and uses words only her siblings and parents understand and has several surprisingly large and sharp buckteeth. The children are told by a family friend, Mr. Poe, that their parents have died in a fire that destroyed their home. They are placed in the care of Count Olaf, said to be a distant relative although the children had never heard of him before. Olaf's ramshackle house is filthy and covered in disconcerting eye images; it has a tower which the Baudelaires are forbidden from entering. Count Olaf is unpleasant, easily angered, and forces the children to perform odious chores. It becomes clear that Count Olaf is scheming to collect the Baudelaire's fortune.\n\nOne day, the Baudelaires are set the task of making dinner for Olaf and his theater troupe. They make puttanesca, but when Olaf arrives, he demands roast beef. The children remind him that he never asked them to make roast beef, and Olaf becomes angry, lifting Sunny into the air and striking Klaus across the face after Klaus tells everyone Count Olaf has given them only one bed.\n\nOlaf demands that the children perform in his new play in which Violet will marry Olaf. The children realize something is amiss and use the library of their friendly but credulous and inept neighbor, Justice Strauss, to research law. Klaus learns that the marriage in the play will be legally binding, meaning Olaf will gain control of their fortune. He confronts Olaf, who gets one of his associates to put Sunny in a birdcage, dangling from outside the window of his tower. He threatens to kill her if Klaus and Violet do not follow his plan. Violet constructs a makeshift grappling hook and uses it to climb the tower. She finds the hook-handed man (a member of Olaf's theater troupe) waiting to capture her. Klaus is brought up to the tower and they are locked together in the room until the play begins.\n\nAfter Violet signs the marriage document, Olaf interrupts to tell the audience that their wedding was legally binding. Justice Strauss and Mr. Poe both object, but concede that the law requires them to hand over the Baudelaire fortune to Olaf. Violet interrupts to proclaim that the marriage was not legally binding, as she signed with her left hand despite being right-handed. Justice Strauss agrees that this invalidates the marriage. Before Olaf can be arrested for locking up Sunny, one of his associates turns the lights in the theater off and he is able to escape. Justice Strauss tells the Baudelaires that she is willing to adopt them; however, Mr. Poe says that this would go against their parents' will, as Justice Strauss is not their relative. He takes them back to his household until he can find another guardian for them.\n\n==Critical reception==\nIn 2012, ''[[School Library Journal]]'' named ''The Bad Beginning'' the 48th best children's novel.<ref>{{cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Bird|url=http://blog.schoollibraryjournal.com/afuse8production/2012/05/28/top-100-childrens-novels-48-the-bad-beginning-by-lemony-snicket|title=Top 100 Children's Novels #48: The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket|work=[[School Library Journal]]|date=May 28, 2012|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref> ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' noted the uncomfortably macabre tone of the novel, warning that because \"the Baudelaire children are truly sympathetic characters\", the novel is \"not for the squeamish\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/adult/lemony-snicket/the-bad-begninning|title=Review from ''Kirkus Reviews''|date=July 15, 1999|work=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref> Catherine Pelosi of ''Kids' Book Review'' responded positively to ''The Bad Beginning'', describing it as \"exciting, humorous and appropriately dark\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kids-bookreview.com/2011/08/review-series-of-unfortunate-events-bad.html|title=Review: A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Bad Beginning|work=Kids' Book Review|last=Pelosi|first=Catherine|date=August 9, 2011|accessdate=July 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Special editions==\n\n===''The Bad Beginning: Rare Edition''===\n''The Bad Beginning: Rare Edition'' ({{ISBN|0-06-051828-6}}) was published by [[HarperCollins]] on September 23, 2003.

After this recording failed commercially, it was cut by [[Elvis Presley]]<nowiki/> with [[Music producer|producer]] [[Chips Moman]], becoming a No.1 song in 1969, and one of the most notable hits of Presley's career.\n\n\"Suspicious Minds\" was one of the singles that revived Presley's chart success in the U.S., following his ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]]''.  It was his eighteenth and last [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1969 (USA)|No.1]] single in the United States. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked it No. 91 on their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407 |title=The RS 500 Greatest Songs of All Time |access-date=October 25, 2017 |date=April 7, 2011}}</ref> Session guitarist [[Reggie Young]] played on both the James and Presley versions.\n\n==The song==\nThe song is about a  mistrusting and dysfunctional relationship, and the need of the characters to overcome their issues in order to maintain it.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuMJcOMDt0UC&pg=PA290&dq=We%27re+caught+in+a+trap+Suspicious+Minds |title=The Chicana/o Cultural Studies Reader - Google Boeken |isbn=9780415235167 |accessdate=May 10, 2014|last1=Chabram-Dernersesian |first1=Angie |year=2006 }}</ref> Written in 1968 by [[Mark James (songwriter)|Mark James]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82bp1aEC_DIC&pg=PA58&dq=We%27re+caught+in+a+trap+Suspicious+Minds |title=Awful Gestures - Adrienne Weiss - Google Boeken |isbn=9781897414798 |accessdate=May 10, 2014|last1=Weiss |first1=Adrienne |year=2009 }}</ref> who was also co-writer of \"[[Always on My Mind]]\" (which Presley would later record), the song was first recorded and released by James on [[Scepter Records]] in 1968. [[Chips Moman]] had asked James to come to Memphis to write songs for [[American Sound Studio]].  At the time, James was residing in [[Houston]]. He had written three songs that became No.1 hits in the [[Southern United States]]. American Sound Studio was gaining a reputation in the industry, as the [[Box Tops]] had just recorded \"[[The Letter (The Box Tops song)|The Letter]]\" there, so James relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].\n\nJames said that late one night, he was fooling around on his Fender guitar and using his Hammond organ pedals for a bass line and came up with what he thought was a catchy melody. At the time, he was married to his first wife but still had feelings for his childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston. James's wife had suspicions about his feelings.  He felt it was a confusing time for him and that all three were \"caught in this trap that they could not walk out of\". At the recording session, James sang the lead vocals, and the studio band backed him; Moman produced. The horns, strings, and vocals of the Holladay Sisters were later overdubbed.  After the tape was mixed, James and Moman flew to New York, where James's manager had contacts with Scepter Records. The label loved the song and put it out, but Scepter did not have the money to promote new artists, and the song did not make the charts.\n\nLater that year, Don Crews, Moman's partner, told James that Presley had booked their studio to record what would become the ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' album. Crews kept asking James if he had any songs that would be right for Presley. James felt Presley needed a mature rock 'n' roll song to bring him back, as [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] was a hot artist at the time. Crews and James thought of \"Suspicious Minds\" and James began urging others to get Presley to hear it.<ref name=\"marcmyerstwsj\">{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Marc |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444506004577615490161185870 |title=Caught in a Trap: Elvis Presley's Last No. 1 Hit, Suspicious Minds &#124; Anatomy of a Song - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=August 30, 2012 |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref>  Even though James's recording had not been commercially successful, upon reviewing the song, Presley decided he could turn it into a hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=410 |title=Suspicious Minds by Elvis Presley Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A_xtSKdVGpQC&pg=PA53&dq=Mark+James+suspicious+minds |title=1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets ... - Toby Creswell - Google Boeken |isbn=9781560259152 |accessdate=May 10, 2014|last1=Creswell |first1=Toby |year=2005 }}</ref>\n\n==Elvis' recording==\n\n===Background===\nPresley's 1969 recordings at [[American Sound Studio]] were a direct consequence of the [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]], that interested [[Chips Moman]] in producing recordings in Presley's new style; he was making his comeback to the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] musical scene by recording [[Rock music|rock]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Country music|country]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[Soul music|soul]]. Marty Lacker, a close friend of Elvis, suggested he record at the studio. These sessions produced the album ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]''.<ref name=\"marcmyerstwsj\"/>\n\n===American Sound Studio session===\n\"Suspicious Minds\" was a product of a January 23, 1969 session, that took place between 4 am and 7 am. Interestingly, it took just eight takes to get it right, with harmony vocal tracks and trumpets [[overdubbed]] by Presley himself in the same session.<ref>[http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/22/04704720/0470472022.pdf Introducing Elvis \u2013 IT Chapter 1 page 21 \u2013 media.wiley \u2013]</ref>  James was in Memphis, but he was not at the recording session. A few days earlier, he had walked into the recording studio during a session and sensed that Elvis was uncomfortable with his presence. James did not want to jinx the song so he stayed away.  When he heard the track the day after it was recorded, he initially thought it sounded too slow.  When he later heard the embellished version, he said he was blown away.  In later years, whenever Elvis saw James he would cross the room to say hello.<ref name=\"marcmyerstwsj\"/>\n\nProduction of the song was nearly scuttled over a copyright dispute.  Elvis's [[Hill & Range|business people]] said they wanted half of Moman's publishing rights.  Moman accused them of stealing and threatened to halt the recording session.  Harry Jenkins of [[RCA]] agreed with Moman because he sensed that \"the song would be a big hit and there would be plenty to go around\".<ref name=\"marcmyerstwsj\"/>\nThe songs \"I'll Hold You In My Heart (Till I Can Hold You In My Arms)\", \"Without Love (There Is Nothing)\", and \"I'll Be There\" were recorded in the same session.  On August 7, \"Suspicious Minds\" was again overdubbed to [[stereo]] and [[Monaural|mono]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where the final master was produced.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oldies.about.com/od/elvispresleyhistory/a/suspiciousminds.htm| title=Solid Gold Spotlight: Suspicious Minds | publisher=About.com| accessdate = November 9, 2010}}</ref>  The song is noted for its change of time signature in the bridge section, from 4/4 to a slower 6/8 and back again to the faster 4/4 rhythm.  The instrumental arrangement uses an electric guitar, bass guitar, organ, strings, trumpets, trombones, and drums. \n\nRCA staff producer [[Felton Jarvis]] made the unusual decision to add a [[fade-out]] to the song starting at 3:36 and lasting for nearly 15 seconds before fading back into the song. The first verse then continues repeatedly until the song completely fades out. In a 2012 interview with [[Marc Myers]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Moman disclosed that Jarvis was never happy with Elvis recording at American Sound Studio, saying \"it was a control thing\". Moman added, \"So when Jarvis took the tape of 'Suspicious Minds,' he added this crazy 15-second fade toward the end, like the song was ending, and brought it back by overdubbing to extend it. I have no idea why he did that, but he messed it up. It was like a scar in the song - a scar not too well-liked. Not that it mattered, though - soon after the song was released, Elvis was back on top of the charts.\"\n\nFuture [[Grateful Dead]] vocalist [[Donna Jean Godchaux]] sang backing vocals on the track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deaddisc.com/GDFD_Donna_Godchaux.htm |title=Grateful Dead Family Discography: Donna Jean Godchaux Discography |publisher=Deaddisc.com |date= |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe song was later included on the legacy edition of ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' and the follow that dream reissue of ''[[Back In Memphis]]''.\n\n===Personnel===\n{{col-begin}}\n* [[Elvis Presley]] \u2013 lead and harmony vocals\n* Glen Spreen \u2013 String and horn arrangements \n* [[Reggie Young]] \u2013 electric guitar\n* [[Bobby Emmons]] \u2013 [[Hammond organ]]\n* [[Mike Leech]] \u2013 bass guitar<ref>Jones, Ruben, Memphis Boys:The Story of American Studios, University Press of Mississippi,  Jackson,  2010 p.213</ref>\n* [[Gene Chrisman]] \u2013 drums\n\n;Overdubbed:\n* [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]], [[Dick Steff]], [[R.F.

[[Chips Moman]] had asked James to come to Memphis to write songs for [[American Sound Studio]].  At the time, James was residing in [[Houston]]. He had written three songs that became No.1 hits in the [[Southern United States]]. American Sound Studio was gaining a reputation in the industry, as the [[Box Tops]] had just recorded \"[[The Letter (The Box Tops song)|The Letter]]\" there, so James relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].\n\nJames said that late one night, he was fooling around on his Fender guitar and using his Hammond organ pedals for a bass line and came up with what he thought was a catchy melody. At the time, he was married to his first wife but still had feelings for his childhood sweetheart, who was married back in Houston. James's wife had suspicions about his feelings.  He felt it was a confusing time for him and that all three were \"caught in this trap that they could not walk out of\". At the recording session, James sang the lead vocals, and the studio band backed him; Moman produced. The horns, strings, and vocals of the Holladay Sisters were later overdubbed.  After the tape was mixed, James and Moman flew to New York, where James's manager had contacts with Scepter Records. The label loved the song and put it out, but Scepter did not have the money to promote new artists, and the song did not make the charts.\n\nLater that year, Don Crews, Moman's partner, told James that Presley had booked their studio to record what would become the ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' album. Crews kept asking James if he had any songs that would be right for Presley. James felt Presley needed a mature rock 'n' roll song to bring him back, as [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] was a hot artist at the time. Crews and James thought of \"Suspicious Minds\" and James began urging others to get Presley to hear it.<ref name=\"marcmyerstwsj\">{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Marc |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444506004577615490161185870 |title=Caught in a Trap: Elvis Presley's Last No. 1 Hit, Suspicious Minds &#124; Anatomy of a Song - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=August 30, 2012 |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref>  Even though James's recording had not been commercially successful, upon reviewing the song, Presley decided he could turn it into a hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=410 |title=Suspicious Minds by Elvis Presley Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A_xtSKdVGpQC&pg=PA53&dq=Mark+James+suspicious+minds |title=1001 Songs: The Great Songs of All Time and the Artists, Stories and Secrets ... - Toby Creswell - Google Boeken |isbn=9781560259152 |accessdate=May 10, 2014|last1=Creswell |first1=Toby |year=2005 }}</ref>\n\n==Elvis' recording==\n\n===Background===\nPresley's 1969 recordings at [[American Sound Studio]] were a direct consequence of the [[Elvis (1968 TV program)|'68 Comeback Special]], that interested [[Chips Moman]] in producing recordings in Presley's new style; he was making his comeback to the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] musical scene by recording [[Rock music|rock]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Country music|country]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[Soul music|soul]].

When he heard the track the day after it was recorded, he initially thought it sounded too slow.  When he later heard the embellished version, he said he was blown away.  In later years, whenever Elvis saw James he would cross the room to say hello.<ref name=\"marcmyerstwsj\"/>\n\nProduction of the song was nearly scuttled over a copyright dispute.  Elvis's [[Hill & Range|business people]] said they wanted half of Moman's publishing rights.  Moman accused them of stealing and threatened to halt the recording session.  Harry Jenkins of [[RCA]] agreed with Moman because he sensed that \"the song would be a big hit and there would be plenty to go around\".<ref name=\"marcmyerstwsj\"/>\nThe songs \"I'll Hold You In My Heart (Till I Can Hold You In My Arms)\", \"Without Love (There Is Nothing)\", and \"I'll Be There\" were recorded in the same session.  On August 7, \"Suspicious Minds\" was again overdubbed to [[stereo]] and [[Monaural|mono]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], where the final master was produced.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://oldies.about.com/od/elvispresleyhistory/a/suspiciousminds.htm| title=Solid Gold Spotlight: Suspicious Minds | publisher=About.com| accessdate = November 9, 2010}}</ref>  The song is noted for its change of time signature in the bridge section, from 4/4 to a slower 6/8 and back again to the faster 4/4 rhythm.  The instrumental arrangement uses an electric guitar, bass guitar, organ, strings, trumpets, trombones, and drums. \n\nRCA staff producer [[Felton Jarvis]] made the unusual decision to add a [[fade-out]] to the song starting at 3:36 and lasting for nearly 15 seconds before fading back into the song. The first verse then continues repeatedly until the song completely fades out. In a 2012 interview with [[Marc Myers]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Moman disclosed that Jarvis was never happy with Elvis recording at American Sound Studio, saying \"it was a control thing\". Moman added, \"So when Jarvis took the tape of 'Suspicious Minds,' he added this crazy 15-second fade toward the end, like the song was ending, and brought it back by overdubbing to extend it. I have no idea why he did that, but he messed it up. It was like a scar in the song - a scar not too well-liked. Not that it mattered, though - soon after the song was released, Elvis was back on top of the charts.\"\n\nFuture [[Grateful Dead]] vocalist [[Donna Jean Godchaux]] sang backing vocals on the track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deaddisc.com/GDFD_Donna_Godchaux.htm |title=Grateful Dead Family Discography: Donna Jean Godchaux Discography |publisher=Deaddisc.com |date= |accessdate=April 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe song was later included on the legacy edition of ''[[From Elvis in Memphis]]'' and the follow that dream reissue of ''[[Back In Memphis]]''.\n\n===Personnel===\n{{col-begin}}\n* [[Elvis Presley]] \u2013 lead and harmony vocals\n* Glen Spreen \u2013 String and horn arrangements \n* [[Reggie Young]] \u2013 electric guitar\n* [[Bobby Emmons]] \u2013 [[Hammond organ]]\n* [[Mike Leech]] \u2013 bass guitar<ref>Jones, Ruben, Memphis Boys:The Story of American Studios, University Press of Mississippi,  Jackson,  2010 p.213</ref>\n* [[Gene Chrisman]] \u2013 drums\n\n;Overdubbed:\n* [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]], [[Dick Steff]], [[R.F.
