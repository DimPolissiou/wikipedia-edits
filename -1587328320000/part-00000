The championship has always been played on a regional basis, whereby the respective champions from the Mid, North, South and West championships contest the county series of games. However, in recent years, the championship has followed the same system as the senior grade in Tipperary. Currently (2018) there are 21 teams in the county championship divided up into 6 groups (3 groups with 4 teams, 3 groups with 3 teams). The top 2 teams of each group qualify for the knock out phase of the championship along with the 4 divisional winners. It is quite common for clubs to progress from their group and also win their respective divisional championship.\n\nThe Tipperary County Championship is an integral part of the wider [[Munster Intermediate Club Hurling Championship|Munster GAA Intermediate Club Hurling Championship]]. The winners of the Tipperary county final join the champions of the other hurling counties to contest the provincial championship.\n\nThe title has been won at least once by 31 different clubs.\n\n[[St Mary's Clonmel]] are the current (2017) title-holders, having beaten [[Gortnahoe-Glengoole GAA|Gortnahoe-Glengoole]] in the final.\n\n==Roll of honour==\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"background:silver;\" |\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Team'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winner'''\n! style=\"background:silver;\" | '''Winning Years'''\n!Runners Up\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1\n| [[Newport GAA|Newport]]\n| 3\n| 1989, 2002, 2016\n|2000,\n2008\n|-\n| [[Silvermines GAA|Silvermines]]\n| 3\n| 1972, 1999, 2012<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|title=Redemption for Silvermines as Ballina lament poor start champions|date=20 October 2012|publisher=The Nationalist|accessdate=22 September 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130619220137/http://www.nenaghguardian.ie/sport-detail.php?article=KSAM3V|archivedate=19 June 2013}}</ref>\n|1987,\n1994\n|-\n|\n| [[Moyne-Templetuohy GAA|Moyne-Templetuohy]]\n| 2\n| 1983, 2014\n|2001,\n2004,\n\n2013\n|-\n|\n|[[Burgess GAA|Burgess]]\n| 2\n| 1993, 2005\n|1992,\n2003\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2\n|[[Templederry Kenyons GAA|Templederry Kenyons]]\n| 2\n| 2000, 2008\n|1999\n|-\n|[[Borrisokane GAA|Borrisokane]]\n| 2\n| 1982, 2010\n|\n|-\n| [[\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty GAA|\u00c9ire \u00d3g Annacarty]]\n| 2\n| 1994, 2006\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"26\" |3\n|[[Thurles Sarsfields GAA|Thurles Sarsfields]]\n|1\n|2018\n|1989,\n\n2014,\n\n2015,\n\n2016\n|-\n| [[Kildangan GAA (Tipperary)|Kildangan]]\n| 1\n| 2004\n|1980,\n2002,\n\n2019\n|-\n|[[Arravale Rovers GAA|Arravale Rovers]]\n| 1\n| 1997\n|1988,\n1991,\n\n2009\n|-\n|[[Gortnahoe-Glengoole GAA|Gortnahoe-Glengoole]]\n| 1\n| 1988\n|2010,\n2011,\n\n2017\n|-\n|[[J.K.

In the United States, the game series is simply known as '''''Initial D'''''.\n\n== Premise ==\nIn ''Initial D Arcade Stage'', players race against different opponents through various mountain passes featured in the manga. Vehicles that are prominently featured in the game are mostly licensed Japanese cars such as the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]], [[Mazda RX-7]], [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]], [[Honda Civic]], as well as the [[Toyota AE86]]. Using the optional magnetic card system, players can save a customized car and their progress for future sessions; otherwise, game progress is lost. Players can continue progress with their cards on another ''Initial D'' cabinet of the same version. However, the card must be renewed every 50 plays.\n\nNote that resuming from another version is subject to the following conditions:\n*There is no backwards compatibility (i.e. a version 2 card cannot be used on version 1 machine).\n*Upgrading the card to a more recent machine is permanent.\n*When upgrading from one version to another, remaining plays will be carried over and 50 plays will be credited to the card.\n\nThere are 12 games in the series so far: 9 for arcades and 3 for home consoles.\n\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.1'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3'' (Arcade)\n* ''[[Initial D Arcade Stage 4]]'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Special Stage'' ([[PlayStation 2]])\n* ''Initial D Street Stage'' ([[PlayStation Portable|PSP]])\n* ''[[Initial D Extreme Stage]]'' ([[PlayStation 3|PS3]])\n\n==Game modes==\n;Legend of the Streets\n:In the main story mode, players race with opponents from the manga. Opponents increase in difficulty with progression in the game. In the English versions of the game until ''Arcade Stage 4'', their names are derived from the Tokyopop manga.\n\n;Time attack\n:Players race against time to rank against other players at the current machine or online. From ''Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' to ''Arcade Stage 6 AA'', players could change stages' weather conditions. This feature was removed from ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''.\n\n;Bunta Challenge\n:First started in ''Arcade Stage Ver.2'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' the player races against Bunta Fujiwara, the legendary street racer. Each time Bunta is defeated, the player will gain a level and difficulty increases. In ''Arcade Stage Ver.3'', the player loses 1000 points upon defeat. Regardless, the end credits still roll if you win or lose to Bunta. Bunta's car differs across levels. Level 1-6: AE86 Trueno, Level 7-11: AE86 Trueno w/TRD 20-Valve 4AGE Racing Engine, Level 12-15: GC8V Subaru Impreza WRX STi Version V. This mode was discontinued and removed in ''Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'' though Bunta appeared as a final boss in Akina. It later returned in ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' (Only in Legend mode after clearing Rebirth mode).\n\n;Online Battle\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'', which allowed the players race against others located in Japan and some areas Asia.\n\n;Racer's Event\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 5'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. 2 modes are only included such as online battle and time attack.\n\n;Tag Battle\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 6 AA'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. It allows players in the same location to team up. One player drives uphill and the other downhill to race with rivals. Matches are made based on past racing results, pitting drivers with similar levels against each other. When there is a difference in the level with your tag partner, stronger driver will match with strong, and weaker driver with the weak. Get the A(Ace) panel on the course. High score when you get the same color panel at the same section. Team with highest score wins.\n\n;Project Kanto's Fastest/Operation Kanto\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'', this mode is similar to tag battle mode, where players race against the rival characters based in the manga from Gunma to Kanagawa area. In races against Project.D's Ace, courses are random. In ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity'', new rivals include Tohru and Atsuro in Momiji Line, Sakamoto and Wataru in Sadamine Rain, and The Lan Evo Teams in Tsuchisaka.\n\n==Games==\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.1''===\nJapanese version: late 1999 / English version late 1996\n\nBeginning with 4 courses such as Myogi (Night Kids' home course), Usui (Impact Blue's home course), Akina (Takumi's home course) and Happogahara (Todo School's first home course).\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''===\nJapanese version: late 2000 / English version Mid-late 2001\n\nWith 2 new courses such as Akagi, Takahashi brothers/Akagi Red Suns' home course and Irohazaka, Emperor's home course.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''===\nJapanese version: late 2004 / English version early 2003 / Cycraft simulator version mid 2002\n\nNew courses such as Akina Snow (only night), Shomaru, which was originally an exclusive for ''Special Stage'' and Tsuchisaka, The Lan Evo Team's home course.

Unlike the first three versions of the game, ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4'' runs on the [[Sega Lindbergh]] hardware, uses a new card system and features a new physics system. This arcade game also become the last game in Western before going to the next arcade game (Japanese language only). Only 2 new rivals such as God Hand and God Foot. Rivals from previous games such as Miki, the Tsucisaka Lan Evo team, Sakamoto, Nobuhiko Akiyama, and Tohru Suetsugu have been removed. New courses such as Lake Akina, Myogi (new layout with 4 sections) and Tsukuba Fruit Line. Some cars featured in previous games such as the Lancer Evolution VII and [[Toyota Celica]] have been removed.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 5''===\nReleased in 2008, '''''Initial D Arcade Stage 5''''' (return to the Japanese version) is the fifth release in the ''Initial D Arcade Stage'' series. Released for the previous hardware for the second time (The screen is mostly like Sega's RingEdge). A few notable differences include heavy physics changes. Compared to ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'', which used \"drifting\" physics, ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'' featured more realistic driving physics which included tire and brake wear down. Although the tire and brake wear are not displayed anywhere in the game, experienced players can notice the difference in the change in physics as they progress in races.\n\nNew characters that appeared for the first time in the game are Kobayakawa, Satoshi Omiya, Imposter Project D, Kai Kogashiwa (R.T. Katagiri S.V.), and Hideo Minagawa.\nNew courses such as Happogahara, which used from ''Arcade Stage Ver.1'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' (only daytime used is night) and only ''Extreme Stage'' appeared with full daytimes between day and night and Nagao, R.T. Katagiri S.V.'s homecourse.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA''''' was released in June 2012.\n\nA new mode, Tag Battle, was introduced. Unlike its predecessor, it was released for the [[Sega RingEdge]] hardware for the first time. The game saw a change in its driving physics. Unlike ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'', a drift gauge and an updated tachometer was introduced to help inform players when they were drifting. The 'Legend of the Street' mode also introduced a \"Rolling Start\" for the first time since the story mode in ''Initial D Special Stage''. The tachometer now informed players whether or not their speed was below the gear range. Online network was extended to support regions in which earlier versions of the game was known to be popular in, finally achieving both national wide and international matches. New cars and courses were added to the game through online updates without upgrade kits like IDAS4 1.5. The game also added a mileage system to show players their total driven mileage. Mileages could be used to redeem exclusive cars that were later available in updates. New characters that appeared for the first time in the game include Ryuji Ikeda, Hiroya Okuyama, Go Hojo and Rin Hojo.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} New course such as Usui, which used from ''Arcade Stage Ver.1'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' appeared with new layout, Tsubaki Line, Sadamine and Akina Snow, also appeared before in ''Arcade Stage Ver.3'' which daytime is night change into day.\n\nNote: AA = Double Ace\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX''===\n[[File:ID7AA.jpg|thumb|right|An arcade installed with two ''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' games]]\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX''''', was released for Sega RingEdge in January 2013. Like its predecessor, the legend of the streets mode from Original and Another mode are exactly the same as the previous one (''Arcade Stage 6 AA'') with Rebirth mode. The game is mostly a carry-over from ''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA'', including updates. New characters include Shinji Inui to complete the Sidewinder battles of Project D, also ''Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage''/''Arcade Stage Ver.3'' characters such as Nobuhiko Akiyama (Rebirth), Sakamoto and Tohru Suetsugu (only in Legend) appeared in this game and rewind of Keisuke, from Project.D using Kyoko's FD. New cars include the Toyota Sprinter Trueno 2door and the new Toyota 86 GT (to replace the FT-86 prototype from the previous game). A new class of vehicles is introduced in this game called \"Complete Cars\". These include pre-tuned cars from several tuning shops in Japan, such as [[RE Amemiya]]. Online battles now include tag battles, allowing two in-store machines linking together and with internet access to battle against two other players in tag battles. New courses such as Tsuchisaka, which previously used in ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' also appeared and Nanamagari, Team Spiral's home course. In this game, there are 3 songs which also used from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' and only a song from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' with new songs. The ending theme of this game is Gamble Rumble (7th Stage Version) by m.o.v.e., the opening theme remix of ''Initial D Third Stage'', ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' and ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity \u221e''''' was released March 6, 2015. Like its predecessor, this game carries over all game modes from the previous version with a notable addition of Initial D Factory and D Coins. In Story Mode, the players can play the Team Side or Rival Side to see Driving Training Curriculum or what mission is for each story. The game added a new feature \"1 Day 1 Time Continue\" to allow players to have a free continue per day without inserting credits. New courses such as Momiji Line, for the first time in ''Special Stage'', also appeared with new layout and Hakone, the place for battle between Ryosuke's FC and Rin Hojo's R32. ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' characters such as Miki, Atsuro Kawai and The Lan Evo Teams also return. This is the last game with Japanese voice actors before ''Arcade Stage Zero'', which does not feature voice anymore.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero''''' was released for the Sega Nu2 [[arcade system board]] in October 9, 2018. Unlike its predecessors, this game now uses a 6-speed gear shifter (similar to the ones found in the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games) as opposed to the sequential ones. The character designs are taken from ''[[New Initial D the Movie]]'' with entirely new BGMs that are rock songs from the films such as Backdraft Smiths, Clutcho, The Hug Me, The Valves, and Gekkou Green. A small number of Eurobeat songs from previous games are also featured, but have to be unlocked. Also, the vehicles have been reduced by original ones featured in previous games, with the exception of the [[Toyota 86]] which was featured in the films. However, more vehicles were added through free updates later in the year.\n\n===''Initial D Special Stage''===\n'''''Initial D Special Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) was released on June 26, 2003 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and was re-released on February 26, 2004 under the \"PlayStation 2 the Best\" label. ''Initial D Special Stage'' is based on ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2'' with additional Japanese voices for the first time and contains many features exclusive to this game. ''Initial D Special Stage'' is also the first home-console Initial D game published by Sega.\n\n''Initial D Special Stage'' contains a story mode that allows the player to reenact racing scenes from the ''Initial D'' manga series (up to Vol. 25 at the time of publication), as well as several new courses then not seen in the arcade versions of the game. In one of these courses, Shomaru went on to appear in ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage''. Real Myogi was later added back in ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage''. Momiji Line would not return until ''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. Bunta's Challenge is noticeably absent in the game. Additional features including replays for saved time-attack records and Iketani's car introduction.\n\nDue to [[PlayStation 2]]'s hardware limitations, the graphics of the game was downgraded from its arcade counterpart. The game is compatible with Logitech's Driving Force wheel series and other wheel controllers made for [[PlayStation 2]]. Sega also balanced all the cars in game due to the overpowering Integra DC2 from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''.\n\n===''Initial D Street Stage''===\n'''''Initial D Street Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8 \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) is a PSP-exclusive game based on ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''. This game features Dogfight by M.o.v.e. as it's intro theme which also used as the first opening theme of ''Initial D Fourth Stage''. The legend of the street mode which pits players against the rival characters are exactly the same as the arcade game but Akina (Snow) is removed, meaning the battle with Miki is also removed, although his theme can be found in the game's BGM files.\n\n===''Initial D Extreme Stage''===\n{{Main|Initial D Extreme Stage}}\n'''''Initial D Extreme Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0 \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) is a [[PlayStation 3]] game based on ''[[Initial D Arcade Stage 4]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n''Initial D Arcade Stage'' (2001) sold 2,534 hardware units in Japan up until 2004.<ref name=\"sega_sep04\">{{cite web|title=First Half Business Results (April\u2013September 2004)|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/settlement/2005/e_200503_2q_pre.pdf#page=4|publisher=[[Sega Sammy Holdings]]|accessdate=17 May 2012|page=4|date=11 November 2004}}</ref> ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver. 3'' sold 673 units between April 2004 and March 2005.<ref name=\"sega_mar05\">{{cite web|title=FY2004 Financial Results (for the year ended March 31, 2005)|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/settlement/2005/e_200503_4q_pre.pdf#page=11|publisher=[[Sega Sammy Holdings]]|page=11|accessdate=17 May 2012|location=Tokyo|date=25 May 2005}}</ref> Combined, both versions of the game sold approximately {{formatnum:{{#expr:2534+673}}|}} units up until March 2005.

This mode was discontinued and removed in ''Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'' though Bunta appeared as a final boss in Akina. It later returned in ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' (Only in Legend mode after clearing Rebirth mode).\n\n;Online Battle\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'', which allowed the players race against others located in Japan and some areas Asia.\n\n;Racer's Event\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 5'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. 2 modes are only included such as online battle and time attack.\n\n;Tag Battle\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 6 AA'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. It allows players in the same location to team up. One player drives uphill and the other downhill to race with rivals. Matches are made based on past racing results, pitting drivers with similar levels against each other. When there is a difference in the level with your tag partner, stronger driver will match with strong, and weaker driver with the weak. Get the A(Ace) panel on the course. High score when you get the same color panel at the same section. Team with highest score wins.\n\n;Project Kanto's Fastest/Operation Kanto\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'', this mode is similar to tag battle mode, where players race against the rival characters based in the manga from Gunma to Kanagawa area. In races against Project.D's Ace, courses are random. In ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity'', new rivals include Tohru and Atsuro in Momiji Line, Sakamoto and Wataru in Sadamine Rain, and The Lan Evo Teams in Tsuchisaka.\n\n==Games==\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.1''===\nJapanese version: late 1999 / English version late 1996\n\nBeginning with 4 courses such as Myogi (Night Kids' home course), Usui (Impact Blue's home course), Akina (Takumi's home course) and Happogahara (Todo School's first home course).\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''===\nJapanese version: late 2000 / English version Mid-late 2001\n\nWith 2 new courses such as Akagi, Takahashi brothers/Akagi Red Suns' home course and Irohazaka, Emperor's home course.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''===\nJapanese version: late 2004 / English version early 2003 / Cycraft simulator version mid 2002\n\nNew courses such as Akina Snow (only night), Shomaru, which was originally an exclusive for ''Special Stage'' and Tsuchisaka, The Lan Evo Team's home course. Also, new opponents in the game are Tohru Suetsugu, Atsuro Kawai, Miki, and the Tsucisaka Lan Evo team. New cars featured in the game are the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution V, Lancer Evolution VI T.M. Edition, [[Mazda RX-8]], and the  Nissan Skyline 25GT-T. The game features original Eurobeat songs from artists including Matt Land, Powerful T., Ace Warrior, and Marco Polo.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''===\n{{Main|Initial D Arcade Stage 4}}\nJapanese Version: Late 2005/English Version Late 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\n\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''''', also known in update version (Version 1.50) as '''''Initial D Arcade Stage 4 Kai''''' is the fourth release in the ''Initial D Arcade Stage'' series. Unlike the first three versions of the game, ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4'' runs on the [[Sega Lindbergh]] hardware, uses a new card system, and features a new physics system. This arcade game also become the last game in Western before going to the next arcade game (Japanese language only). Only 2 new rivals such as God Hand and God Foot. Rivals from previous games such as Miki, the Tsucisaka Lan Evo team, Sakamoto, Nobuhiko Akiyama, and Tohru Suetsugu have been removed. New courses such as Lake Akina, Myogi (new layout with 4 sections) and Tsukuba Fruit Line. Some cars featured in previous games such as the Lancer Evolution VII and [[Toyota Celica]] have been removed.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 5''===\nReleased in 2008, '''''Initial D Arcade Stage 5''''' (return to Japanese version) is the fifth release in the ''Initial D Arcade Stage'' series. Released for the previous hardware for the second time (The screen is mostly like Sega's RingEdge). A few notable differences include heavy physics changes. Compared to ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'', which used \"drifting\" physics, ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'' featured more realistic driving physics which included tire and brake wear down. Although the tire and brake wear are not displayed anywhere in game, experienced players can notice the difference in the change in physics as they progress in races.\n\nNew characters that appeared for the first time in the game are: Kobayakawa, Satoshi Omiya, Imposter Project D, Kai Kogashiwa (R.T. Katagiri S.V.), and Hideo Minagawa.\nNew courses such as Happogahara, which used from ''Arcade Stage Ver.1'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' (only daytime used is night) and only ''Extreme Stage'' appeared with full daytimes between day and night and Nagao, R.T. Katagiri S.V.'s homecourse.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA''''' was released in June 2012.\n\nA new mode, Tag Battle, was introduced. Unlike its predecessor, it was released for the [[Sega RingEdge]] hardware for the first time. The game saw a change in its driving physics. Unlike ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'', a drift gauge and an updated tachometer was introduced to help inform players when they were drifting. The 'Legend of the Street' mode also introduced a \"Rolling Start\" for the first time since the story mode in ''Initial D Special Stage''. The tachometer now informed players whether or not their speed was below the gear range. Online network was extended to support regions in which earlier versions of the game was known to be popular in, finally achieving both national wide and international matches. New cars and courses were added to the game through online updates without upgrade kits like IDAS4 1.5. The game also added a mileage system to show players their total driven mileage. Mileages could be used to redeem exclusive cars that were later available in updates. New characters that appeared for the first time in the game include: Ryuji Ikeda, Hiroya Okuyama, Go Hojo and Rin Hojo.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} New course such as Usui, which used from ''Arcade Stage Ver.1'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' appeared with new layout, Tsubaki Line, Sadamine and Akina Snow, also appeared before in ''Arcade Stage Ver.3'' which daytime is night change into day.\n\nNote: AA = Double Ace\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX''===\n[[File:ID7AA.jpg|thumb|right|An arcade installed with two ''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' games]]\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX''''', was released for Sega RingEdge in January 2013. Like its predecessor, the legend of the streets mode from Original and Another mode are exactly the same as the previous one (''Arcade Stage 6 AA'') with Rebirth mode. The game is mostly a carry-over from ''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA'', including updates. New characters include Shinji Inui to complete the Sidewinder battles of Project D, also ''Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage''/''Arcade Stage Ver.3'' characters such as Nobuhiko Akiyama (Rebirth), Sakamoto and Tohru Suetsugu (only in Legend) appeared in this game and rewind of Keisuke, from Project.D using Kyoko's FD. New cars include the Toyota Sprinter Trueno 2door and the new Toyota 86 GT (to replace the FT-86 prototype from the previous game). A new class of vehicles is introduced in this game called \"Complete Cars\". These include pre-tuned cars from several tuning shops in Japan, such as [[RE Amemiya]]. Online battles now include tag battles, allowing two in-store machines linking together and with internet access to battle against two other players in tag battles. New courses such as Tsuchisaka, which previously used in ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' also appeared and Nanamagari, Team Spiral's home course. In this game, there are 3 songs which also used from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' and only a song from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' with new songs. The ending theme of this game is Gamble Rumble (7th Stage Version) by m.o.v.e., the opening theme remix of ''Initial D Third Stage'', ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' and ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity \u221e''''' was released March 6, 2015. Like its predecessor, this game carries over all game modes from the previous version with a notable addition of Initial D Factory and D Coins. In Story Mode, the players can play the Team Side or Rival Side to see Driving Training Curriculum or what mission is for each story. The game added a new feature \"1 Day 1 Time Continue\" to allow players to have a free continue per day without inserting credits. New courses such as Momiji Line, for the first time in ''Special Stage'', also appeared with new layout and Hakone, the place for battle between Ryosuke's FC and Rin Hojo's R32. ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' characters such as Miki, Atsuro Kawai and The Lan Evo Teams also return. This is the last game with Japanese voice actors before ''Arcade Stage Zero'', which does not feature voice anymore.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero''''' was released for the Sega Nu2 [[arcade system board]] in October 9, 2018. Unlike its predecessors, this game now uses a 6-speed gear shifter (similar to the ones found in the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games) as opposed to the sequential ones. The character designs are taken from ''[[New Initial D the Movie]]'' with entirely new BGMs that are rock songs from the films such as Backdraft Smiths, Clutcho, The Hug Me, The Valves, and Gekkou Green. A small number of Eurobeat songs from previous games are also featured, but have to be unlocked. Also, the vehicles have been reduced by original ones featured in previous games, with the exception of the [[Toyota 86]] which was featured in the films. However, more vehicles were added through free updates later in the year.\n\n===''Initial D Special Stage''===\n'''''Initial D Special Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) was released on June 26, 2003 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and was re-released on February 26, 2004 under the \"PlayStation 2 the Best\" label. ''Initial D Special Stage'' is based on ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2'' with additional Japanese voices for the first time and contains many features exclusive to this game. ''Initial D Special Stage'' is also the first home-console Initial D game published by Sega.\n\n''Initial D Special Stage'' contains a story mode that allows the player to reenact racing scenes from the ''Initial D'' manga series (up to Vol. 25 at the time of publication), as well as several new courses then not seen in the arcade versions of the game. In one of these courses, Shomaru went on to appear in ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage''. Real Myogi was later added back in ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage''. Momiji Line would not return until ''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. Bunta's Challenge is noticeably absent in the game. Additional features including replays for saved time-attack records and Iketani's car introduction.\n\nDue to [[PlayStation 2]]'s hardware limitations, the graphics of the game was downgraded from its arcade counterpart. The game is compatible with Logitech's Driving Force wheel series and other wheel controllers made for [[PlayStation 2]]. Sega also balanced all the cars in game due to the overpowering Integra DC2 from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''.\n\n===''Initial D Street Stage''===\n'''''Initial D Street Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8 \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) is a PSP-exclusive game based on ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''. This game features Dogfight by M.o.v.e. as it's intro theme which also used as the first opening theme of ''Initial D Fourth Stage''. The legend of the street mode which pits players against the rival characters are exactly the same as the arcade game but Akina (Snow) is removed, meaning the battle with Miki is also removed, although his theme can be found in the game's BGM files.\n\n===''Initial D Extreme Stage''===\n{{Main|Initial D Extreme Stage}}\n'''''Initial D Extreme Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0 \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) is a [[PlayStation 3]] game based on ''[[Initial D Arcade Stage 4]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n''Initial D Arcade Stage'' (2001) sold 2,534 hardware units in Japan up until 2004.<ref name=\"sega_sep04\">{{cite web|title=First Half Business Results (April\u2013September 2004)|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/settlement/2005/e_200503_2q_pre.pdf#page=4|publisher=[[Sega Sammy Holdings]]|accessdate=17 May 2012|page=4|date=11 November 2004}}</ref> ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver. 3'' sold 673 units between April 2004 and March 2005.<ref name=\"sega_mar05\">{{cite web|title=FY2004 Financial Results (for the year ended March 31, 2005)|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/settlement/2005/e_200503_4q_pre.pdf#page=11|publisher=[[Sega Sammy Holdings]]|page=11|accessdate=17 May 2012|location=Tokyo|date=25 May 2005}}</ref> Combined, both versions of the game sold approximately {{formatnum:{{#expr:2534+673}}|}} units up until March 2005.

A disk with a picture on each side is attached to two pieces of string. When the strings are twirled quickly between the fingers the two pictures appear to blend into one due to the [[persistence of vision]].\n\nExamples of common thaumatrope pictures include a bare tree on one side of the disk, and its leaves on the other, or a bird on one side and a cage on the other. Many classic thaumatropes also included riddles or short poems, with one line on each side.\n\nThaumatropes can provide an illusion of motion with the two sides of the disc each depicting a different phase of the motion, but no examples are known to have been produced until long after the introduction of the first widespread animation device: the [[phenakistoscope|ph\u00e9nakistiscope]].\n\nThaumatropes are often seen as important antecedents of [[motion pictures]] and in particular of [[animation]]. This is partly due to many film historians' belief that the associated theory of persistence of vision explains the physiological basis for movies, although this was disproved in 1912.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe coined name translates roughly as \"wonder turner\", from {{lang-grc|\u03b8\u03b1\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1}} \"wonder\" and \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \"turn\".\n\n==Invention==\n\nA 2012 paper<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last1=Az\u00e9ma\n|first1=Marc\n|last2=Riv\u00e8re |first2=Florent\n|date=2012\n|title=Animation in Palaeolithic art: a pre-echo of cinema\n|journal=Antiquity\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|volume=86\n|issue=332\n|pages=316\u2013324\n|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00062785\n}}\n</ref> argues that a prehistoric bone disk found in the Laugerie-Basse rockshelter is a thaumatrope, designed to be spun using leather thongs threaded through the central perforation.\n\nThe invention of the thaumatrope is usually credited to British physician [[John Ayrton Paris]]. He described the device in his 1827 educational book for children ''Philosophy in Sport Made Science in Earnest'', with an illustration by George Cruikshank.\n\nBritish mathematician [[Charles Babbage]] recalled in 1864 that the thaumatrope was invented by the geologist [[William Henry Fitton]]. Babbage had told Fitton how the astronomer [[John Herschel]] had challenged him to show both sides of a shilling at once. Babbage held the coin in front of a mirror, but Herschel showed how both sides were visible when the coin was spun on the table. A few days later Fitton brought Babbage a new illustration of the principle, consisting of a round disc of card suspended between two pieces of sewing silk. This disc had a parrot on one side and a cage at the other side. Babbage and Fitton made several different designs and amused some friends with them for a short while. They forgot about it until some months later they heard about the \"wonderful invention of Dr. Paris\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Babbage |first=Charles |title=Passages from the Life of a Philosopher |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, & Green |year=1864 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fa1JAAAAMAAJ/page/n206 189] |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fa1JAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nFrench artist [[Antoine Claudet]] stated in 1867 that he had heard that Paris had once been present when Herschel demonstrated his rotating coin trick to his children and subsequently got the idea for the thaumatrope.<ref name=Claudet/> \n\nClaudet also noted in 1867 that the thaumatrope could create a three-dimensional illusion. A spinning rectangular thaumatrope with the alternating letters of the name \"Victoria\" on each side, showed the full word with the letters at two different distances from the observer's eye. If the two strings of the thaumatrope are attached to the same side of the card the thickness of the card accounts for a small difference in the distances when each side is visible.<ref name=Claudet>{{cite publication|title=A new fact relating to Binocular Vision|year=1867|last=Claudet|first=Antoine|url=http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/15/424.full.pdf+html}}</ref>\n\n\u2013\u0426\u0426\u0426\u0426\u0445<ref><ref></ref></ref>==Commercial production==\n\nThe first commercial thaumatrope was registered at Stationers' Hall on April 2, 1825 and published by W. Phillips in London as ''The Thaumatrope; being Rounds of Amusement or How to Please and Surprise By Turns'', sold in boxes of 12 or 18 discs. It included a sheet with mottoes or riddles for each disc, often with a political meaning. Paris was widely regarded as the author, but wasn't mentioned on the product or its packaging and he later claimed in a letter to [[Michael Faraday]] \"I was first induced to publish it, at the earnest desire of my late friend Wm Phillips. (...) I may add that I never put my name to it\".<ref name=\"Herbert\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/thaumatropeTEXT1.htm |last=Herbert |first=Stephen |title=Wheel of Life \u2013 The Taumatrope}}</ref>\n\nThe steep price of a set (seven shilling for 12 discs or half a guinea for 18) was criticized, half a guinea would have been about a week's pay for an average worker.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/> It was also defended: its inventor should be able to earn something from his invention while it was new, before it was widely copied as seen before with the [[kaleidoscope]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4UUFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA513&lpg=PA513&dq=Literary+Report,+New+Monthly+Magazine+1825#v=onepage&q=thaumatrope&f=false |title=The New monthly magazine |year=1825 |pages=177}}</ref> \nParis later claimed he gained \u00a3150,- from its sales in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/>\n\nAs expected, pirate copies soon became common and were much cheaper. For instance the 'Thaumatropical Amusement' was available in boxes of six discs for one shilling.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/>\n\nAlthough the toy became very popular, original copies are now very rare; only one set produced by W. Phillips is currently known to be in the collection of Richard Balzer and one single disc is at the Cinematheque Francaise.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/>\n\nOther early publishers across the continent included [[Alphonse Giroux]] & Compagnie in France and Trentsensky in Austria. In 1833 these companies would be the very first publishers of the next big \"philosophical toy\" craze: the Ph\u00e9nakisticope.\n\n==Animation==\nIn the first 1827 edition of \"Philosophy in Sport\" John Ayrton Paris described a version with a circular frame around the disc through which the strings were threaded. A little tug on the strings would cause a minor change in the axis of rotation and thus a slight shift in the position of the images while revolving. An adapted version of the standard horse and jockey thaumatrope could thus first show the jockey on the horse before being thrown over its head.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paris|first=John Ayrton|title=Philosophy in Sport made Science in Earnest |volume=3|year=1827|pages=22\u201325|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Vu44AAAAMAAJ&vq=thaumatrope&dq=%22philosophy%20in%20sport%22&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In a new 1833 edition of the book this example was replaced with a version without a ring but with an elastic string added to change the axis by pulling it. This version showed a drinking man lowering and raising a bottle to and from his mouth, with an illustration of the different sides of the disc and the different states of the resulting image. Several other examples were described in the book. The balls of a juggler could appear as in motion and the two painted balls could be seen as three or four when the axis of rotation was shifted. A tailor in a pulpit next to a pond with a goose fluttering in the water would have the tailor falling into the water and the goose taking his place in the pulpit.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0zF-O1N9QvsC|quote=philosophy in sport.|last=paris | first=john ayrton|title=Philosophy in Sport made Science in Earnest \u2013 A new edition |publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert, & Piper|year=1833 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0zF-O1N9QvsC/page/n373 352]\u2013354}}</ref> No commercially produced versions with these techniques are known.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/> \n\nOn November 26, 1869 the Rev. Richard Pilkington received \"Useful Registered Design Number 5074\" for his ''Pedemascope''.<ref>http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C14036963</ref> This was a variation of the thaumatrope. It had a card with pictures \"painted in two different positions on both sides\". This card was placed in the two-part mahogany holder with a handle and a brass pin that would semi-rotate the card when it was twirled (a bit of iron preventing full rotation). Transparent or cut-out variations were suggested for use with the magic lantern.<ref>https://archive.org/details/populareducatorc06londuoft</ref> \n\nIn 1892 mechanical engineer Thomas E.

A disk with a picture on each side is attached to two pieces of string. When the strings are twirled quickly between the fingers the two pictures appear to blend into one due to the [[persistence of vision]].\n\nExamples of common thaumatrope pictures include a bare tree on one side of the disk, and its leaves on the other, or a bird on one side and a cage on the other. Many classic thaumatropes also included riddles or short poems, with one line on each side.\n\nThaumatropes can provide an illusion of motion with the two sides of the disc each depicting a different phase of the motion, but no examples are known to have been produced until long after the introduction of the first widespread animation device: the [[phenakistoscope|ph\u00e9nakistiscope]].\n\nThaumatropes are often seen as important antecedents of [[motion pictures]] and in particular of [[animation]]. This is partly due to many film historians' belief that the associated theory of persistence of vision explains the physiological basis for movies, although this was disproved in 1912.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe coined name translates roughly as \"wonder turner\", from {{lang-grc|\u03b8\u03b1\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b1}} \"wonder\" and \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \"turn\".\n\n==Invention==\n\nA 2012 paper<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last1=Az\u00e9ma\n|first1=Marc\n|last2=Riv\u00e8re |first2=Florent\n|date=2012\n|title=Animation in Palaeolithic art: a pre-echo of cinema\n|journal=Antiquity\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|volume=86\n|issue=332\n|pages=316\u2013324\n|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00062785\n}}\n</ref> argues that a prehistoric bone disk found in the Laugerie-Basse rockshelter is a thaumatrope, designed to be spun using leather thongs threaded through the central perforation.\n\nThe invention of the thaumatrope is usually credited to British physician [[John Ayrton Paris]]. He described the device in his 1827 educational book for children ''Philosophy in Sport Made Science in Earnest'', with an illustration by George Cruikshank.\n\nBritish mathematician [[Charles Babbage]] recalled in 1864 that the thaumatrope was invented by the geologist [[William Henry Fitton]]. Babbage had told Fitton how the astronomer [[John Herschel]] had challenged him to show both sides of a shilling at once. Babbage held the coin in front of a mirror, but Herschel showed how both sides were visible when the coin was spun on the table. A few days later Fitton brought Babbage a new illustration of the principle, consisting of a round disc of card suspended between two pieces of sewing silk. This disc had a parrot on one side and a cage at the other side. Babbage and Fitton made several different designs and amused some friends with them for a short while. They forgot about it until some months later they heard about the \"wonderful invention of Dr. Paris\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Babbage |first=Charles |title=Passages from the Life of a Philosopher |publisher=Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, & Green |year=1864 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fa1JAAAAMAAJ/page/n206 189] |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fa1JAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nFrench artist [[Antoine Claudet]] stated in 1867 that he had heard that Paris had once been present when Herschel demonstrated his rotating coin trick to his children and subsequently got the idea for the thaumatrope.<ref name=Claudet/> \n\nClaudet also noted in 1867 that the thaumatrope could create a three-dimensional illusion. A spinning rectangular thaumatrope with the alternating letters of the name \"Victoria\" on each side, showed the full word with the letters at two different distances from the observer's eye. If the two strings of the thaumatrope are attached to the same side of the card the thickness of the card accounts for a small difference in the distances when each side is visible.<ref name=Claudet>{{cite publication|title=A new fact relating to Binocular Vision|year=1867|last=Claudet|first=Antoine|url=http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/15/424.full.pdf+html}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial production==\n\nThe first commercial thaumatrope was registered at Stationers' Hall on April 2, 1825 and published by W. Phillips in London as ''The Thaumatrope; being Rounds of Amusement or How to Please and Surprise By Turns'', sold in boxes of 12 or 18 discs. It included a sheet with mottoes or riddles for each disc, often with a political meaning. Paris was widely regarded as the author, but wasn't mentioned on the product or its packaging and he later claimed in a letter to [[Michael Faraday]] \"I was first induced to publish it, at the earnest desire of my late friend Wm Phillips. (...) I may add that I never put my name to it\".<ref name=\"Herbert\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/thaumatropeTEXT1.htm |last=Herbert |first=Stephen |title=Wheel of Life \u2013 The Taumatrope}}</ref>\n\nThe steep price of a set (seven shilling for 12 discs or half a guinea for 18) was criticized, half a guinea would have been about a week's pay for an average worker.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/> It was also defended: its inventor should be able to earn something from his invention while it was new, before it was widely copied as seen before with the [[kaleidoscope]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4UUFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA513&lpg=PA513&dq=Literary+Report,+New+Monthly+Magazine+1825#v=onepage&q=thaumatrope&f=false |title=The New monthly magazine |year=1825 |pages=177}}</ref> \nParis later claimed he gained \u00a3150,- from its sales in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/>\n\nAs expected, pirate copies soon became common and were much cheaper. For instance the 'Thaumatropical Amusement' was available in boxes of six discs for one shilling.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/>\n\nAlthough the toy became very popular, original copies are now very rare; only one set produced by W. Phillips is currently known to be in the collection of Richard Balzer and one single disc is at the Cinematheque Francaise.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/>\n\nOther early publishers across the continent included [[Alphonse Giroux]] & Compagnie in France and Trentsensky in Austria. In 1833 these companies would be the very first publishers of the next big \"philosophical toy\" craze: the Ph\u00e9nakisticope.\n\n==Animation==\nIn the first 1827 edition of \"Philosophy in Sport\" John Ayrton Paris described a version with a circular frame around the disc through which the strings were threaded. A little tug on the strings would cause a minor change in the axis of rotation and thus a slight shift in the position of the images while revolving. An adapted version of the standard horse and jockey thaumatrope could thus first show the jockey on the horse before being thrown over its head.<ref>{{cite book|last=Paris|first=John Ayrton|title=Philosophy in Sport made Science in Earnest |volume=3|year=1827|pages=22\u201325|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Vu44AAAAMAAJ&vq=thaumatrope&dq=%22philosophy%20in%20sport%22&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> In a new 1833 edition of the book this example was replaced with a version without a ring but with an elastic string added to change the axis by pulling it. This version showed a drinking man lowering and raising a bottle to and from his mouth, with an illustration of the different sides of the disc and the different states of the resulting image. Several other examples were described in the book. The balls of a juggler could appear as in motion and the two painted balls could be seen as three or four when the axis of rotation was shifted. A tailor in a pulpit next to a pond with a goose fluttering in the water would have the tailor falling into the water and the goose taking his place in the pulpit.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0zF-O1N9QvsC|quote=philosophy in sport.|last=paris | first=john ayrton|title=Philosophy in Sport made Science in Earnest \u2013 A new edition |publisher=Sherwood, Gilbert, & Piper|year=1833 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0zF-O1N9QvsC/page/n373 352]\u2013354}}</ref> No commercially produced versions with these techniques are known.<ref name=\"Herbert\"/> \n\nOn November 26, 1869 the Rev.

It had a card with pictures \"painted in two different positions on both sides\". This card was placed in the two-part mahogany holder with a handle and a brass pin that would semi-rotate the card when it was twirled (a bit of iron preventing full rotation). Transparent or cut-out variations were suggested for use with the magic lantern.<ref>https://archive.org/details/populareducatorc06londuoft</ref> \n\nIn 1892 mechanical engineer Thomas E.

In August 1906, 23 cages and concrete bear enclosures were built with another $3,628 thanks to the head of the Commission, Col. Robert Galloway.<ref name=history/>\n\nGalloway Hall, the Memphis Zoo's first building, was finished in 1907. It was named in honor of Col. Galloway, but was later demolished to make room for newer exhibits.<ref name=history/>\n\nThe Carnivora Building was constructed in 1909 to house the first cats at the zoo.<ref name=history/>  It was later replaced by ''Cat Country'', and converted into an inner-zoo restaurant.\n\nThe Elephant House opened in 1910.<ref name=history/>  The building is still used as the main building of the zoo's educational department, but the elephants were moved to the ''African Veldt'' exhibit.\n\nIn 1916, the Botanical Display Building opened.  It was later converted into the Tropical Bird House.<ref name=history/>\n\nThe Memphis Zoo acquired a round barn from the Memphis Police Department in 1923, who used the building as their stable for the mounted horse patrol in the early 1900s.  The zoo's round barn exhibit is a collection of exotic hoofstock and birds.\n\nIn 1936, the zoo's first primate exhibit, ''Monkey Island'', was built.<ref name=history/>  It was replaced in 1995 by ''Primate Canyon''.\n\n;Mid-1900s\n\nThe ''[[Aquarium]]'' was completed in 1959.<ref name=history/>  It is one of the oldest exhibits at the Memphis Zoo.

A new animal hospital was also finished in 1998,<ref name=history/> with separate holding and quarantine wings built on opposite ends of the building. The sick wing separates sick or injured animals from others and allows for proper recovery time. The quarantine wing is used for newly acquired animals, which are quarantined for at least 30 days upon arrival at the zoo before being introduced to their new homes. On September 18, 1998, two plaques were dedicated in memory of musician [[Jeff Buckley]] in the Memphis Zoo's [[Sumatran tiger]] exhibit. His mother chose that location because of his great love of the Memphis Zoo and the tigers in particular. Jeff frequently visited the zoo, had plans to become a volunteer in 1997 and, according to his mother, never left the zoo without visiting the ''[[Butterfly|Butterflies]]: In Living Color'' exhibit, which also opened early in 1998. The exhibit was replaced by \"Birds and Bees\" in late May, 2009.\n\nIn April 2003, the Memphis Zoo became one of only four U.S. zoos to exhibit the giant panda.

In recent years, the January 4 show, held annually since 1992, had been suffering from a drop in both interest and attendance and while the 2006 show drew 31,000 fans to the Tokyo Dome, only around 10,000 of them paid for their ticket. The show, however, was still considered a success due to high merchandise sales, allowing NJPW to keep the tradition alive for another year. NJPW had previously had success promoting interpromotional shows with [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), and decided to partner with them again for the 2007 Tokyo Dome show in an effort to boost attendance numbers.<ref name=WON011507>{{cite magazine | last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = January 15, 2007 | title = Wrestling Observer Newsletter | magazine = [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | pages=6\u20137}}</ref> The partnership was officially announced in a press conference on November 15, 2006. AJPW had recently partnered with [[Yuke's]], the owners of NJPW, for the video game ''[[Wrestle Kingdom (video game)|Wrestle Kingdom]]''.

While NJPW announced an attendance number of 28,000, Meltzer claimed that there were actually only 18,000 fans in attendance with \"just over 10,000 paid\". Remembering the two sold-out shows that a NJPW versus AJPW program had provided six years earlier, Meltzer wrote that now \"the combination of interpromotional matches and the annual tradition meant

In recent years, the January 4 show, held annually since 1992, had been suffering from a drop in both interest and attendance and while the 2006 show drew 31,000 fans to the Tokyo Dome, only around 10,000 of them paid for their ticket. The show, however, was still considered a success due to high merchandise sales, allowing NJPW to keep the tradition alive for another year. NJPW had previously had success promoting interpromotional shows with [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), and decided to partner with them again for the 2007 Tokyo Dome show in an effort to boost attendance numbers.<ref name=WON011507>{{cite magazine | last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = January 15, 2007 | title = Wrestling Observer Newsletter | magazine = [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | pages=6\u20137}}</ref> The partnership was officially announced in a press conference on November 15, 2006. AJPW had recently partnered with [[Yuke's]], the owners of NJPW, for the video game ''[[Wrestle Kingdom (video game)|Wrestle Kingdom]]''. As a result, the 2007 January 4 Tokyo Dome show was dubbed \"Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo Dome\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.njpw.co.jp/32473 | script-title=ja:\u300c\u30ec\u30c3\u30b9\u30eb\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c0\u30e0 in \u6771\u4eac\u30c9\u30fc\u30e0\u300d\u306b\u5168\u65e5\u672c\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9\u52e2\u304c\u53c2\u6226\uff01 | date=November 15, 2006 | accessdate=August 26, 2017 | work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> The name stuck and the annual January 4 Tokyo Dome show has been known as Wrestle Kingdom ever since.<ref name=DailyDome/>\n\n[[File:Keiji Mutoh 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keiji Mutoh]], who was part of the \"Super Dream Tag Match\"]]\nThe main event of the show was booked as a tribute to [[Shinya Hashimoto]], who had died from [[cerebral hemorrhage]] on July 11, 2005.

Both teams had actually disbanded years earlier due to Mutoh and Kojima having jumped from NJPW to AJPW at the start of 2002, but Kojima and Tenzan had recently reunited for AJPW's [[2006 Real World Tag League]].

They defeated [[Tencozy]], a tag team made up of NJPW wrestler Hiroyoshi Tenzan and AJPW wrestler Satoshi Kojima.

While NJPW announced an attendance number of 28,000, Meltzer claimed that there were actually only 18,000 fans in attendance with \"just over 10,000 paid\". Remembering the two sold-out shows that a NJPW versus AJPW program had provided six years earlier, Meltzer wrote that now \"the combination of interpromotional matches and the annual tradition meant almost nothing\".<ref name=WON011507/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nDespite the fact that the match between Minoru Suzuki and Yuji Nagata at the inaugural Wrestle Kingdom was pushed as the final match in the

Service continues to provide through the southern portion of Alexandria, when [[Van Dorn Street station]] opened in 1991. In 1994, the service was extended to the high-technology industrial areas of [[suburb]]an [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]] and [[Herndon, Virginia|Herndon]], located between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].  Along [[State Route 267 (Virginia)|State Route 267]] (the Dulles Toll Road), express buses carry commuters from free park-and-ride lots to the [[Washington Metro]] system. In 1999, the Herndon-Monroe Park & Ride and the\nTysons Westpark Transit Station opened, extending its operation within the county.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAfter having many buses running on pure diesel, The Connector ordered buses that runs in Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel\nfuel in 2002. These bus upgrades can retrofitting the fleet with Green Diesel technology, so the county can go environmentally friendly. More bus stations continues to increase, with the opening of the Lorton Park-and-Ride in 2003, and the Gambrill Road Park-and-Ride in 2005. The Connector began installing the SmarTrip Fare Card technology, so that passengers can pay their fare using WMATA's SmarTrip. In June 2009, service was transitioned from the Metrobus 2W, 12-, and 20-series routes to the Connector in the Centreville, Chantilly, and Oakton areas along I-66 and near [[Vienna station (Washington Metro)|Vienna/Fairfax-GMU Station]].\n\nOn July 1, 2009 [[MV Transportation]] took over from [[Veolia Transport]] as the operator.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190520052709/https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/fairfax-county-to-sign-200m-connector-bus-service-contract Fairfax County to sign $200M Connector bus service contract] ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' March 30, 2009</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\nMajor changes began in 2010, when the Reston East Park-and-Ride closed to make way for the [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Silver Line]] construction.

This area continues to be the core of the system, and is noted for the number of residents in the Richmond Highway area who use the service at all times of the day. It had 10 routes, and many routes serves through [[Huntington station (Washington Metro)|Huntington Station]]. These first 10 routes were previously served by Metrobus. In 1988, The Connector began to operate express routes, to connect to [[Pentagon station]]. It also expanded through the southeastern portion of Fairfax.<ref name=\"connector info\">{{Cite web| title = Fairfax County Transit Development Plan Fiscal Year 2016 \u2013 Fiscal Year 2022| accessdate = 2019-03-31| url = http://www.drpt.virginia.gov/media/1907/fairfax-county-tdp-2016.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1990, The Connector took over the operation of the RIBS (Reston Internal Bus Service). Service continues to provide through the southern portion of Alexandria, when [[Van Dorn Street station]] opened in 1991. In 1994, the service was extended to the high-technology industrial areas of [[suburb]]an [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]] and [[Herndon, Virginia|Herndon]], located between [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].  Along [[State Route 267 (Virginia)|State Route 267]] (the Dulles Toll Road), express buses carry commuters from free park-and-ride lots to the [[Washington Metro]] system. In 1999, the Herndon-Monroe Park & Ride and the\nTysons Westpark Transit Station opened, extending its operation within the county.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nAfter having many buses running on pure diesel, The Connector ordered buses that runs in Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel\nfuel in 2002. These bus upgrades can retrofitting the fleet with Green Diesel technology, so the county can go environmentally friendly. More bus stations continues to increase, with the opening of the Lorton Park-and-Ride in 2003, and the Gambrill Road Park-and-Ride in 2005. The Connector began installing the SmarTrip Fare Card technology, so that passengers can pay their fare using WMATA's SmarTrip. In June 2009, service was transitioned from the Metrobus 2W, 12-, and 20-series routes to the Connector in the Centreville, Chantilly, and Oakton areas along I-66 and near [[Vienna station (Washington Metro)|Vienna/Fairfax-GMU Station]].\n\nOn July 1, 2009 [[MV Transportation]] took over from [[Veolia Transport]] as the operator.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190520052709/https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/fairfax-county-to-sign-200m-connector-bus-service-contract Fairfax County to sign $200M Connector bus service contract] ''[[Washington Examiner]]'' March 30, 2009</ref>\n\n=== 2010s ===\nMajor changes began in 2010, when the Reston East Park-and-Ride closed to make way for the [[Silver Line (Washington Metro)|Silver Line]] construction.
