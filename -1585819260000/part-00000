Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as [[primary care provider]]s and [[nurse]]s, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child's immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child that he or she has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. [[Anatomically correct doll]]s are sometimes used to help explain what happened, although some researchers consider the dolls too explicit and overstimulating, which might contribute to non-abused children behaving with the dolls in one or more ways that suggest they were sexually abused.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book|authors=Daniel L.

Which course is used depends on a variety of factors that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For instance, treatment of young children generally requires strong parental involvement and can benefit from family therapy. Adolescents tend to be more independent; they can benefit from individual or group therapy. The modality also shifts during the course of treatment; for example, group therapy is rarely used in the initial stages, as the subject matter is very personal and/or embarrassing.<ref name=NCCAN/>\n\nMajor factors that affect both the pathology and response to treatment include the type and severity of the sexual act, its frequency, the age at which it occurred, and the child's family of origin.  Roland C. Summit, a medical doctor, defined the different stages the victims of child sexual abuse go through, called [[child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome]]. He suggested that children who are victims of sexual abuse display a range of symptoms that include secrecy, helplessness, entrapment, accommodation, delayed and conflicted disclosure and recantation.<ref name=\"Summit\">{{cite journal|last=Summit|first=Roland C.|title=The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|date=January 1983|volume=7|issue=22|pmid=6605796|url=|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(83)90070-4|pages=177\u201393}}</ref>\n\n===Adults===\nAdults who have been sexually abused as children often present for treatment with a secondary mental health issue, which can include [[substance abuse]], [[eating disorders]], [[personality disorders]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and conflict in romantic or interpersonal relationships.<ref name=\"Swaby-\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Swaby | first1 = AN. | last2 = Morgan | first2 = KA. | title = The relationship between childhood sexual abuse and sexual dysfunction in Jamaican adults | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 247\u201366 | year =  2009| doi =  10.1080/10538710902902679| pmid = 19856732 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the approach is to focus on the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person's specific issues. For instance, a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. However, there is often an emphasis on [[cognitive restructuring]] due to the deep-seated nature of the trauma. Some newer techniques such as [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] (EMDR) have been shown to be effective.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Edmond | first1 = T. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = A. | title = Assessing the long-term effects of EMDR: results from an 18-month follow-up study with adult female survivors of CSA | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 69\u201386 | year = 2004 | doi =  10.1300/J070v13n01_04| pmid = 15353377 }}</ref>\n\nSexual abuse is associated with many sub-clinical behavioral issues as well, including [[re-victimization]] in the teenage years, a bipolar-like switching between sexual compulsion and shut-down, and [[cognitive distortion|distorted thinking]] on the subject of sexual abuse (for instance, that it is common and happens to everyone).  When first presenting for treatment, the patient can be fully aware of their abuse as an event, but their ''appraisal'' of it is often distorted, such as believing that the event was unremarkable (a form of [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]]). Frequently, victims do not make the connection between their abuse and their present pathology.\n\n==Prevention==\nChild sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s.

One may hope that unlike in the past, this rediscovery of child sexual abuse that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia. The institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers, national and international societies, and a host of research studies (in which the United States continues to lead the world) offers grounds for cautious optimism. Nevertheless, as Judith Herman argues cogently, 'The systematic study of psychological trauma...depends on the support of a political movement.'\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: A Psychology and Law Perspective|author=B.J.

Some states have enacted specific [[laws]] lengthening the applicable [[statutes of limitations]] so as to allow victims of child sexual abuse to file suit sometimes years after they have reached the age of majority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/state-civil-statutes-of-limitations-in-child-sexua.aspx|title=State Civil Statutes of Limitations in Child Sexual Abuse Cases|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref>  Such lawsuits can be brought where a person or entity, such as a school, church or youth organization, or daycare was charged with supervising the child but failed to do so with child sexual abuse resulting, making the individual or institution liable.  In the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]] the various [[Roman Catholic]] Diocese in the [[United States]] have paid out approximately $1 billion settling hundreds of such lawsuits since the early 1990s.  There have also been lawsuits involving the American [[Christian right|Religious Right]].  Crimes have allegedly gone unreported and victims were pressured into silence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/25/1211671/-The-Church-Child-Sex-Abuse-Scandal-Widens-and-Deepens|title=The Church Child Sex Abuse Scandal Widens and Deepens|work=dailykos.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\nAs lawsuits can involve demanding procedures there is a concern that [[children]] or adults who file suit will be re-victimized by defendants through the [[legal process]], much as [[rape]] victims can be re-victimized by the accused in [[criminal]] rape trials.  The child sexual abuse plaintiff's attorney [[Thomas A. Cifarelli]] has written that children involved in the legal system, particularly victims of sexual abuse and molestation, should be afforded certain procedural safeguards to protect them from harassment during the legal process.<ref>Cifarelli, T.A.,''Shielding Minors'', Los Angeles Daily Journal, (October 10, 2001).</ref>\n\nIn June 2008 in [[Zambia]] the issue of teacher-student sexual abuse and sexual assault was brought to the attention of the High Court of Zambia where a landmark case decision, with presiding Judge Philip Musonda, awarded $45million Zambian kwacha (US$13,000) to the plaintiff, a 13-year-old girl for sexual abuse and rape by her school teacher. This claim was brought against her teacher as a \"person of authority\" who, as Judge Musonda stated, \"had a moral superiority (responsibility) over his students\" at the time.<ref>[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/08/11/rapecasezambia-articl804/ \"When A Girl Student Stands Up and Wins\"], ''Women News Network'' \u2013 WNN, August 11, 2008</ref>\n\nA 2000 World Health Organization \u2013 Geneva report, \u201cWorld Report on Violence and Health (Chap 6 \u2013 Sexual Violence)\u201d states, \u201cAction in schools is vital for reducing sexual and other forms of violence. In many countries a sexual relation between a teacher and a pupil is not a serious disciplinary offence and policies on sexual harassment in schools either do not exist or are not implemented. In recent years, though, some countries have introduced laws prohibiting sexual relations between teachers and pupils. Such measures are important in helping eradicate sexual harassment in schools. At the same time, a wider range of actions is also needed, including changes to teacher training and recruitment and reforms of curricula, so as to transform gender relations in schools.\u201d<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf World Health Organization Report on Sexual Violence], 2002</ref>\n\n==See

Recommendations for healthcare workers, such as [[primary care provider]]s and [[nurse]]s, who are often suited to encounter suspected abuse are advised to firstly determine the child's immediate need for safety. A private environment away from suspected abusers is desired for interviewing and examining. Leading statements that can distort the story are avoided. As disclosing abuse can be distressing and sometimes even shameful, reassuring the child that he or she has done the right thing by telling and that they are not bad and that the abuse was not their fault helps in disclosing more information. [[Anatomically correct doll]]s are sometimes used to help explain what happened, although some researchers consider the dolls too explicit and overstimulating, which might contribute to non-abused children behaving with the dolls in one or more ways that suggest they were sexually abused.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book|authors=Daniel L.

Which course is used depends on a variety of factors that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. For instance, treatment of young children generally requires strong parental involvement and can benefit from family therapy. Adolescents tend to be more independent; they can benefit from individual or group therapy. The modality also shifts during the course of treatment; for example, group therapy is rarely used in the initial stages, as the subject matter is very personal and/or embarrassing.<ref name=NCCAN/>\n\nMajor factors that affect both the pathology and response to treatment include the type and severity of the sexual act, its frequency, the age at which it occurred, and the child's family of origin.  Roland C. Summit, a medical doctor, defined the different stages the victims of child sexual abuse go through, called [[child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome]]. He suggested that children who are victims of sexual abuse display a range of symptoms that include secrecy, helplessness, entrapment, accommodation, delayed and conflicted disclosure and recantation.<ref name=\"Summit\">{{cite journal|last=Summit|first=Roland C.|title=The child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome|journal=Child Abuse & Neglect|date=January 1983|volume=7|issue=22|pmid=6605796|url=|doi=10.1016/0145-2134(83)90070-4|pages=177\u201393}}</ref>\n\n===Adults===\nAdults who have been sexually abused as children often present for treatment with a secondary mental health issue, which can include [[substance abuse]], [[eating disorders]], [[personality disorders]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and conflict in romantic or interpersonal relationships.<ref name=\"Swaby-\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Swaby | first1 = AN. | last2 = Morgan | first2 = KA. | title = The relationship between childhood sexual abuse and sexual dysfunction in Jamaican adults | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 247\u201366 | year =  2009| doi =  10.1080/10538710902902679| pmid = 19856732 }}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the approach is to focus on the present problem, rather than the abuse itself. Treatment is highly varied and depends on the person's specific issues. For instance, a person with a history of sexual abuse suffering from severe depression would be treated for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. However, there is often an emphasis on [[cognitive restructuring]] due to the deep-seated nature of the trauma. Some newer techniques such as [[eye movement desensitization and reprocessing]] (EMDR) have been shown to be effective.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Edmond | first1 = T. | last2 = Rubin | first2 = A. | title = Assessing the long-term effects of EMDR: results from an 18-month follow-up study with adult female survivors of CSA | journal = J Child Sex Abuse | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 69\u201386 | year = 2004 | doi =  10.1300/J070v13n01_04| pmid = 15353377 }}</ref>\n\nSexual abuse is associated with many sub-clinical behavioral issues as well, including [[re-victimization]] in the teenage years, a bipolar-like switching between sexual compulsion and shut-down, and [[cognitive distortion|distorted thinking]] on the subject of sexual abuse (for instance, that it is common and happens to everyone).  When first presenting for treatment, the patient can be fully aware of their abuse as an event, but their ''appraisal'' of it is often distorted, such as believing that the event was unremarkable (a form of [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]]). Frequently, victims do not make the connection between their abuse and their present pathology.\n\n==Prevention==\nChild sexual abuse prevention programmes were developed in the United States of America during the 1970s.

One may hope that unlike in the past, this rediscovery of child sexual abuse that began in the 70s will not again be followed by collective amnesia. The institutionalization of child maltreatment interventions in federally funded centers, national and international societies, and a host of research studies (in which the United States continues to lead the world) offers grounds for cautious optimism. Nevertheless, as Judith Herman argues cogently, 'The systematic study of psychological trauma...depends on the support of a political movement.'\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sexualized Violence Against Women and Children: A Psychology and Law Perspective|author=B.J.

Some states have enacted specific [[laws]] lengthening the applicable [[statutes of limitations]] so as to allow victims of child sexual abuse to file suit sometimes years after they have reached the age of majority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/state-civil-statutes-of-limitations-in-child-sexua.aspx|title=State Civil Statutes of Limitations in Child Sexual Abuse Cases|last=Legislatures|first=National Conference of State|website=www.ncsl.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref>  Such lawsuits can be brought where a person or entity, such as a school, church or youth organization, or daycare was charged with supervising the child but failed to do so with child sexual abuse resulting, making the individual or institution liable.  In the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]] the various [[Roman Catholic]] Diocese in the [[United States]] have paid out approximately $1 billion settling hundreds of such lawsuits since the early 1990s.  There have also been lawsuits involving the American [[Christian right|Religious Right]].  Crimes have allegedly gone unreported and victims were pressured into silence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/05/25/1211671/-The-Church-Child-Sex-Abuse-Scandal-Widens-and-Deepens|title=The Church Child Sex Abuse Scandal Widens and Deepens|work=dailykos.com|accessdate=23 March 2015}}</ref>\nAs lawsuits can involve demanding procedures there is a concern that [[children]] or adults who file suit will be re-victimized by defendants through the [[legal process]], much as [[rape]] victims can be re-victimized by the accused in [[criminal]] rape trials.  The child sexual abuse plaintiff's attorney [[Thomas A. Cifarelli]] has written that children involved in the legal system, particularly victims of sexual abuse and molestation, should be afforded certain procedural safeguards to protect them from harassment during the legal process.<ref>Cifarelli, T.A.,''Shielding Minors'', Los Angeles Daily Journal, (October 10, 2001).</ref>\n\nIn June 2008 in [[Zambia]] the issue of teacher-student sexual abuse and sexual assault was brought to the attention of the High Court of Zambia where a landmark case decision, with presiding Judge Philip Musonda, awarded $45million Zambian kwacha (US$13,000) to the plaintiff, a 13-year-old girl for sexual abuse and rape by her school teacher. This claim was brought against her teacher as a \"person of authority\" who, as Judge Musonda stated, \"had a moral superiority (responsibility) over his students\" at the time.<ref>[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/08/11/rapecasezambia-articl804/ \"When A Girl Student Stands Up and Wins\"], ''Women News Network'' \u2013 WNN, August 11, 2008</ref>\n\nA 2000 World Health Organization \u2013 Geneva report, \u201cWorld Report on Violence and Health (Chap 6 \u2013 Sexual Violence)\u201d states, \u201cAction in schools is vital for reducing sexual and other forms of violence. In many countries a sexual relation between a teacher and a pupil is not a serious disciplinary offence and policies on sexual harassment in schools either do not exist or are not implemented. In recent years, though, some countries have introduced laws prohibiting sexual relations between teachers and pupils. Such measures are important in helping eradicate sexual harassment in schools. At the same time, a wider range of actions is also needed, including changes to teacher training and recruitment and reforms of curricula, so as to transform gender relations in schools.\u201d<ref>[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2002/9241545615_chap6_eng.pdf World Health Organization Report on Sexual Violence], 2002</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Abusive power and control]]\n*[[Joseph Calasanz#Disgrace and Death|17th-century sexual molestation at Naples school]]\n*[[Bacha Bazi]]\n*[[Betrayal Trauma]]\n*[[List of child abuse cases featuring long-term detention#Cases of children imprisoned by relatives|Cases of children imprisoned by relatives]]\n*[[Catholic Church sex abuse cases]]\n*[[Child erotica]]\n*[[Child Exploitation Tracking System]] (CETS)\n*[[Child marriage]]\n*[[Child-on-child sexual abuse]]\n*[[Child pornography]]\n*[[Child sex tourism]]\n*[[Child sexual abuse in Nigeria]]\n*[[Child welfare]]\n*[[United States Children's Bureau|Children's Bureau]]\n*[[Commercial sexual exploitation of children]]\n*[[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder]]\n*[[False allegation of child sexual abuse]]\n*[[Institutional abuse]]\n*[[Isolation to facilitate abuse]]\n*The [[International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children]] (ICMEC) combats child sexual exploitation, child pornography, and child abduction.\n*[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]] \u2013 a UK organisation set up to combat child abuse, gained controversy in the 1980s\u20131990s over its dealings with [[Satanic ritual abuse]] amongst children.\n*[[Online predator]]\n*[[Penn State child sex abuse scandal]]\n*[[Prostitution of children]]\n*[[Protect (political organization)|Protect]]\n*[[Sexual harassment in education#Sexual harassment and abuse of students by teachers|Sexual harassment and abuse of students by teachers]]\n*[[Statutory rape]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |author=Lew, Mike |title=Victims No Longer: The Classic Guide for Men Recovering from Sexual Child Abuse |edition=2nd |publisher=Perennial Currents |location= |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=978-0-06-053026-6 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://archive.org/details/victimsnolongerc00lewm }}\n*{{Cite book|author=Cynthia Crosson-Tower |title=Understanding child abuse and neglect |publisher=Pearson/Allyn & Bacon |location=Boston |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-205-50326-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}\n*{{Cite journal|author=Asa Don Brown |title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in childhood|url=http://family-marriage-counseling.com/mentalhealth/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-childhood.htm |publisher=Family and Marriage Counseling, FMC |location=New Orleans |year=2009}}\n*{{Cite journal| last = Lascaratos | first = J |author2=Ascaratos J |author3=Poulakou-Rebelakou, E | year = 2000 | title = Child Sexual abuse: Historical cases in the Byzantine Empire (324\u20131453 A.D.) | journal = Child Abuse & Neglect | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1085\u20131090 | doi = 10.1016/S0145-2134(00)00156-3 | pmid = 10983818 }}\n*{{Cite journal| last = Durkin | first = KF |author2=Clifton DB | year = 1999 | title = Propagandizing pederasty: A thematic analysis of the on-line exculpatory accounts of unrepentant pedophiles | journal = Deviant Behavior | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 103\u2013127 | doi = 10.1080/016396299266524}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Zimring, Franklin E. |title=An American Travesty: Legal Responses to Adolescent Sexual Offending |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=978-0-226-98358-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Child sexual abuse}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/facts_for_families/09_child_sexual_abuse.pdf|title=American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Facts for Families: Child Sexual Abuse|publisher=American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11368470|title=Men who molest their sexually immature daughters: Is a special explanation required?|publisher=Research Gate}}\n*{{curlie|Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family/Child_Abuse/Sexual_Abuse/|Child Abuse: Sexual Abuse}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.d2l.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all_statistics_20150619.pdf|title=Child sexual abuse statistics|publisher=Darkness to Light}}\n* [https://youniquefoundation.org/learn-the-facts/ Learn the Facts of Child Sexual Abuse] The Younique Foundation\n* [https://defendinnocence.org/get-the-facts/ Get the Facts] Defend Innocence\n\n{{Sexual ethics}}\n{{Sexual abuse}}\n{{abuse}}\n{{Pedophilia}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Child Sexual Abuse}}\n[[Category:Child sexual abuse| ]]\n[[Category:Human sexuality]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePosttraumatic stress disorder:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse"}

He concluded that sugar gliders had been brought to [[Launceston, Tasmania]] as pets from Port Phillip, Australia (now [[Melbourne]]) soon after the founding of the port in 1834.  Some sugar gliders had escaped and quickly became established in the area.<ref name=Gunn(1846)/><ref name=Gunn(1851)/> The species has been identified as a threat to the survival of the [[swift parrot]], which breeds only in Tasmania. Reduction in mature forest cover has left swift parrot nests highly vulnerable to predation by sugar gliders, and it is estimated that the parrot could be extinct by 2031.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-26/research-shows-swift-parrot-in-danger-of-extinction/6350564 \"Tasmania's swift parrot in danger of extinction, calls to list the bird as critically endangered\"], ABC News, 2015-03-26</ref>\n\n===In captivity===\n\nIn captivity, the sugar glider can suffer from [[calcium]] deficiencies if not fed an adequate diet.

The line occupied a point where the routes into Tunisia from the south converged, leading toward Mareth, with the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east and a sand sea on the other.\n\nThe line ran north of Wadi Zigzaou for about {{cvt|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-westwards from the [[Gulf of Gab\u00e8s]] to Cheguimi and the Djebel (mountain) Matmata on the Dahar plateau between the [[Grand Erg Oriental|Great Eastern Sand Sea]] and the [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]] hills. The [[Tebaga Gap]], between the Mareth line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938.\n\nTunisia was occupied by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces after [[Operation Torch]] in 1942 and the line was used by the Axis to defend against the British and Allied [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]], which had conquered Libya early in 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\n===French strategy===\nIn 1930s the defence of the [[French colonial empire]] (French Indochina, Pacific Islands, West Indies, African colonies and Syria\u2013Lebanon) was left to the [[French Foreign Legion]], colonial and \"native\" units, the {{lang|fr|[[Marine nationale]]}} (Navy) and the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]}} (Air Force). By the late 1930s, the Navy had only one aircraft carrier and the {{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}} could spare only second-rate aircraft. [[French Algeria|Algeria]], [[French Protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] and Tunisia provided much of the manpower of the {{lang|fr|[[Troupes coloniales|Arm\u00e9e coloniale]]}} and Tunisia, with the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] to the east, was excepted from the priority given to the defence of metropolitan France.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaufmann|1a2=Kaufmann|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Jackson|2y=2000|2pp=332\u2013333}}\n\nFrench plans for defence of Tunisia assumed that Italy would launch an overwhelming assault that France could not easily oppose. Italy was expected to launch attacks on [[Egypt]] and Tunisia as soon as war was declared, with the Italian Navy securing supply and blocking any substantial Anglo-French relief. With a force of six divisions, a fortress division and a cavalry division to defend Tunisia, the French army considered the construction of a \"[[Maginot Line]] in the desert\" ({{lang|fr|ligne Maginot du d\u00e9sert}}).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=92}}\n\n===Geography===\n\nThe geography of central Tunisia is dominated by the [[Atlas Mountains]], while the northern and southern portions are largely flat. The primary feature in the south is the Matmata Hills, a range running north-south roughly parallel to the Mediterranean coast. West of the hills, the land is the inhospitable [[Jebel Dahar]] then the Dehar region of desert to the west, making the region between the hills and the coast the only easily traversed approach to northern Tunisia.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=46}} A smaller line of hills runs east\u2013west along the northern edge of the Matmata range, further complicating this approach. At the far northern end of the Matmata Hills is the [[Tebaga Gap]].\n\n===Plans===\n\n[[File:Tunisia Topography.png|thumb|upright=.75|{{center|Topographic map of Tunisia}}]]\nIn January 1934 planning began on the new fortifications; Infantry officers selected the sites for strongpoints to dominate the ground in front with overlapping fields of fire. In 1936, the French government provided funds for construction after Italy formed the [[Axis powers|Rome\u2013Berlin Axis]] with Germany, creating a greater threat to French security in North Africa.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}{{efn|The cost of the Mareth Line and its forward defences was similar to that of {{lang|fr|ouvrage of St Agnes}} in the Alps.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}}} The casemates designed for the line had much less concrete than comparable examples in France and had no {{lang|fr|[[wkt:fosse|foss\u00e9]]}} (gap) rather a stable door, in case the lower part was blocked by d\u00e9bris. In September 1936, during a meeting with General [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|Joseph Georges]], it was agreed that the fortification of the Mareth Line, Bizerte, Medenine, Ben Gardane and Foum Tathouine must be completed.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nMedenine, Ben Gardane to the west and Foum Tathouine to the east, were south of the proposed line, Foum Tathouine being the place where the routes to Mareth passed through the bottleneck between the Matmata Mountains and the sea. The line was divided into eastern and western sectors with a main line of resistance and a reserve line about {{cvt|1.5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} back. A {{lang|fr|secteur d\u00e9fensif}} (SD) was to be built on the rocky Dahar Plateau, which later became part of an SD across the Matmata Hills to [[Kebili]] on the edge of the [[Chott el Djerid]]. The chott and Chott El Fedjaj drained across Tunisia into Wadi Akarit, across Tunisia but Wadi Akarit was only sketchily fortified, the French concentrating on the Mareth Line {{cvt|50|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south, to cover Gabes.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}} The gap between the Mareth Line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938. General [[Georges Catroux]] and Colonel Gautsch surveyed the area and in their assessment predicted that three divisions could advance from the Libyan border to Ksar (fortified village) el Hallouf and Bir (well) Soltane in six days and then advance into the gaps either side of Djebel Melab and those between Djebel Tebaga and the Matmata Hills. {{sfnm|1a1=Kaufmann|1a2=Kaufmann|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Playfair|2y=2004|2p=333}}\n\n==The Mareth Line==\n\n[[File:Mareth Line Panel.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Mareth Line Panel}}]]\nThe Mareth Line consisted of casemates surrounded by barbed wire and built for all-round defence in the main and reserve lines, the obstacles being doubled on the fronts and sides. The strongpoints in the main line included flanking machine-gun casemates and anti-tank gun positions; in the reserve line artillery emplacements provided covering fire in the gaps between the strongpoints in the main line. Some of the flanking casemates for machine-guns covering the gaps were connected by galleries; strongpoints on the plain and in hills had anti-tank positions. An anti-tank obstacle of vertical rails was built along the front of the line and the sides of Wadi Zigzaou were steepened. Eight artillery casemates, forty infantry casemates or blockhouses and fifteen command posts were built. The eastern sector had twelve strongpoints in the main line and eleven in the reserve line. The western sector had eleven strongpoints in the main line and seven in the reserve line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nIn the Matmata hills, Ksar el Hallouf covered an anti-tank ditch which continued the position beyond the main line which ended on the foothills. An infantry position was dug into the Matmata hills at Ksar-el-Hallouf and in the Dahar beyond, a strongpoint at Bir Soltane had two 75 mm turrets, removed from [[Char 2C]] tanks built in 1918. At Ben Gardane an advanced position was built consisting of a square redoubt inside an anti-tank ditch with casemates on the flanks and concrete infantry shelters. Small triangular strongpoints at the corners were surrounded by anti-tank rail obstacles that continued around the position. The Mareth line was equipped with obsolescent 47 mm naval guns for anti-tank defence and some new [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|25 mm anti-tank guns]] and infantry small-arms. The artillery casemates with 75 mm guns and most of the blockhouses and casemates had embrasures for automatic weapons. In 1938 work the Mareth line was so important that work on coast defences was stopped and in 1939 the line was occupied by colonial divisions and some locally-raised units. After the outbreak of the war, a line of advanced positions ({{lang|fr|avant-postes}}) was built on high ground at Aram {{cvt|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of the main line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\n==Second World War==\n\nThe [[Second World War]] began in 1939 but the Mareth Line saw no use from 1939\u20131940, as Italy remained neutral until a few days before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], after which, the line was demilitarised by an Italo-German commission. In November 1942, the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] ([[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]) defeated {{lang|de|[[Panzer Army Africa|Panzerarmee Afrika]]}} at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] landed in French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Axis forces occupied Tunisia in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and from November 1942 to March 1943, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} conducted a fighting retreat through Egypt and Libya, pursued by the Eighth Army. Axis engineers refurbished the Mareth Line for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.  In March 1943, the Eighth Army reached the Libya\u2013Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis forces were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and attempted a spoiling attack, {{lang|de|[[Operation Capri|Unternehmen Capri]]}} (Operation Capri). The attack failed and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line, to await the British attack.{{efn|The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]], [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]], [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]], [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]], [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]], [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light ''Afrika'' Division]] and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks. In reserve were the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] with 110 operational tanks. The line from Djebel Tebaga\u2013Djebel Melab was held by the {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}}.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}}} The British survey of the Mareth Line was assisted by General Rime-Bruneau, a former Chief of Staff of the Tunisian garrison and Captain Paul Mezan, the Garrison Engineer of the Mareth Line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\n\n===Battle of the Mareth Line===\n{{Main article|Battle of the Mareth Line}}\n\n[[File:Mareth line object.jpg|thumb|{{center|Infantry bunker of the Mareth Line}}]]\nOn 19 March 1943, the Eighth Army, made a frontal assault against the Mareth Line in Operation Pugilist. The [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Northumbrian Infantry Division]] penetrated the Line near [[Zarat, Tunisia|Zarat]] but was driven back by the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the{{lang|it|Giovani Fascisti}} on 22 March.<ref>[https://adviceandresearch.blogspot.com/2019/06/division-giovani-fascisti-in-1943.html Giovani Fascisti division at Mareth]</ref> Earlier reconnaissance by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] had shown that the Line could be outflanked. A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and pass on to the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line. At the same time as Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the Tebaga Gap from 21 to 24 March. Montgomery sent the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] ([[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]]) to reinforce the attack at the Tebaga Gap. The British attacked again in [[Battle of the Mareth Line#Operation Supercharge II|Operation Supercharge II]] on 26 March and broke through the gap the next day. This success, combined with a fresh frontal assault, made the Mareth Line untenable but the Italian 1st Army escaped encirclement when the 1st Armoured Division was held up at El Hamma and the Axis forces retreated to [[Wadi Akarit]], {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip}} to the north.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to World War II |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2001 |editor-first=I.

The line occupied a point where the routes into Tunisia from the south converged, leading toward Mareth, with the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the east and a sand sea on the other.\n\nThe line ran north of Wadi Zigzaou for about {{cvt|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-westwards from the [[Gulf of Gab\u00e8s]] to Cheguimi and the Djebel (mountain) Matmata on the Dahar plateau between the [[Grand Erg Oriental|Great Eastern Sand Sea]] and the [[Matmata, Tunisia|Matmata]] hills. The [[Tebaga Gap]], between the Mareth line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938.\n\nTunisia was occupied by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces after [[Operation Torch]] in 1942 and the line was used by the Axis to defend against the British and Allied [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]], which had conquered Libya early in 1943.\n\n==Background==\n\n===French strategy===\nIn 1930s the defence of the [[French colonial empire]] (French Indochina, Pacific Islands, West Indies, African colonies and Syria\u2013Lebanon) was left to the [[French Foreign Legion]], colonial and \"native\" units, the {{lang|fr|[[Marine nationale]]}} (Navy) and the {{lang|fr|[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]}} (Air Force). By the late 1930s, the Navy had only one aircraft carrier and the {{lang|fr|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air}} could spare only second-rate aircraft. [[French Algeria|Algeria]], [[French Protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]] and Tunisia provided much of the manpower of the {{lang|fr|[[Troupes coloniales|Arm\u00e9e coloniale]]}} and Tunisia, with the Italian colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] to the east, was excepted from the priority given to the defence of metropolitan France.{{sfnm|1a1=Kaufmann|1a2=Kaufmann|1y=2006|1p=89|2a1=Jackson|2y=2000|2pp=332\u2013333}}\n\nFrench plans for defence of Tunisia assumed that Italy would launch an overwhelming assault that France could not easily oppose. Italy was expected to launch attacks on [[Egypt]] and Tunisia as soon as war was declared, with the Italian Navy securing supply and blocking any substantial Anglo-French relief. With a force of six divisions, a fortress division and a cavalry division to defend Tunisia, the French army considered the construction of a \"[[Maginot Line]] in the desert\" ({{lang|fr|ligne Maginot du d\u00e9sert}}).{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=92}}\n\n===Geography===\n\nThe geography of central Tunisia is dominated by the [[Atlas Mountains]], while the northern and southern portions are largely flat. The primary feature in the south is the Matmata Hills, a range running north-south roughly parallel to the Mediterranean coast. West of the hills, the land is the inhospitable [[Jebel Dahar]] then the Dehar region of desert to the west, making the region between the hills and the coast the only easily traversed approach to northern Tunisia.{{sfn|Ford|2012|p=46}} A smaller line of hills runs east\u2013west along the northern edge of the Matmata range, further complicating this approach. At the far northern end of the Matmata Hills is the [[Tebaga Gap]].\n\n===Plans===\n\n[[File:Tunisia Topography.png|thumb|upright=.75|{{center|Topographic map of Tunisia}}]]\nIn January 1934 planning began on the new fortifications; Infantry officers selected the sites for strongpoints to dominate the ground in front with overlapping fields of fire. In 1936, the French government provided funds for construction after Italy formed the [[Axis powers|Rome\u2013Berlin Axis]] with Germany, creating a greater threat to French security in North Africa.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}{{efn|The cost of the Mareth Line and its forward defences was similar to that of {{lang|fr|ouvrage of St Agnes}} in the Alps.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}}} The casemates designed for the line had much less concrete than comparable examples in France and had no {{lang|fr|[[wkt:fosse|foss\u00e9]]}} (gap) rather a stable door, in case the lower part was blocked by d\u00e9bris. In September 1936, during a meeting with General [[Alphonse Joseph Georges|Joseph Georges]], it was agreed that the fortification of the Mareth Line, Bizerte, Medenine, Ben Gardane and Foum Tathouine must be completed.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nMedenine, Ben Gardane to the west and Foum Tathouine to the east, were south of the proposed line, Foum Tathouine being the place where the routes to Mareth passed through the bottleneck between the Matmata Mountains and the sea. The line was divided into eastern and western sectors with a main line of resistance and a reserve line about {{cvt|1.5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} back. A {{lang|fr|secteur d\u00e9fensif}} (SD) was to be built on the rocky Dahar Plateau, which later became part of an SD across the Matmata Hills to [[Kebili]] on the edge of the [[Chott el Djerid]]. The chott and Chott El Fedjaj drained across Tunisia into Wadi Akarit, across Tunisia but Wadi Akarit was only sketchily fortified, the French concentrating on the Mareth Line {{cvt|50|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south, to cover Gabes.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}} The gap between the Mareth Line and the Great Eastern Sand Sea, a potential route by which an invader could outflank the Mareth line, was not given consideration until 1938. General [[Georges Catroux]] and Colonel Gautsch surveyed the area and in their assessment predicted that three divisions could advance from the Libyan border to Ksar (fortified village) el Hallouf and Bir (well) Soltane in six days and then advance into the gaps either side of Djebel Melab and those between Djebel Tebaga and the Matmata Hills. {{sfnm|1a1=Kaufmann|1a2=Kaufmann|1y2006|1p=89|2a1=Playfair|2y=2004|2p=333}}\n\n==The Mareth Line==\n\n[[File:Mareth Line Panel.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Mareth Line Panel}}]]\nThe Mareth Line consisted of casemates surrounded by barbed wire and built for all-round defence in the main and reserve lines, the obstacles being doubled on the fronts and sides. The strongpoints in the main line included flanking machine-gun casemates and anti-tank gun positions; in the reserve line artillery emplacements provided covering fire in the gaps between the strongpoints in the main line. Some of the flanking casemates for machine-guns covering the gaps were connected by galleries; strongpoints on the plain and in hills had anti-tank positions. An anti-tank obstacle of vertical rails was built along the front of the line and the sides of Wadi Zigzaou were steepened. Eight artillery casemates, forty infantry casemates or blockhouses and fifteen command posts were built. The eastern sector had twelve strongpoints in the main line and eleven in the reserve line. The western sector had eleven strongpoints in the main line and seven in the reserve line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\nIn the Matmata hills, Ksar el Hallouf covered an anti-tank ditch which continued the position beyond the main line which ended on the foothills. An infantry position was dug into the Matmata hills at Ksar-el-Hallouf and in the Dahar beyond, a strongpoint at Bir Soltane had two 75 mm turrets, removed from [[Char 2C]] tanks built in 1918. At Ben Gardane an advanced position was built consisting of a square redoubt inside an anti-tank ditch with casemates on the flanks and concrete infantry shelters. Small triangular strongpoints at the corners were surrounded by anti-tank rail obstacles that continued around the position. The Mareth line was equipped with obsolescent 47 mm naval guns for anti-tank defence and some new [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|25 mm anti-tank guns]] and infantry small-arms. The artillery casemates with 75 mm guns and most of the blockhouses and casemates had embrasures for automatic weapons. In 1938 work the Mareth line was so important that work on coast defences was stopped and in 1939 the line was occupied by colonial divisions and some locally-raised units. After the outbreak of the war, a line of advanced positions ({{lang|fr|avant-postes}}) was built on high ground at Aram {{cvt|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of the main line.{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2006|p=90}}\n\n==Second World War==\n\nThe [[Second World War]] began in 1939 but the Mareth Line saw no use from 1939\u20131940, as Italy remained neutral until a few days before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]], after which, the line was demilitarised by an Italo-German commission. In November 1942, the British [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] ([[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]) defeated {{lang|de|[[Panzer Army Africa|Panzerarmee Afrika]]}} at the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]] and the British [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] landed in French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]]. Axis forces occupied Tunisia in the [[Tunisia Campaign]] and from November 1942 to March 1943, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} conducted a fighting retreat through Egypt and Libya, pursued by the Eighth Army. Axis engineers refurbished the Mareth Line for occupation by the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} and by March 1943, more than {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} of [[barbed wire]], 100,000 anti-tank mines and 70,000 anti-personnel mines had been laid, bunkers had been reinforced with concrete and armed with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.  In March 1943, the Eighth Army reached the Libya\u2013Tunisia border and paused at Medenine to prepare to attack the Mareth Line. Axis forces were renamed the [[First Army (Italy)|Italian 1st Army]] (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and attempted a spoiling attack, {{lang|de|[[Operation Capri|Unternehmen Capri]]}} (Operation Capri). The attack failed and the Axis troops withdrew to the Mareth Line, to await the British attack.{{efn|The Mareth Line was garrisoned by the [[136th Infantry Division Giovani Fascisti|136th Infantry Division \"Giovani Fascisti\"]], [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|101st Motorised Division \"Trieste\"]], [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]], [[80th Infantry Division La Spezia (Airlanding)|80th Infantry Division \"La Spezia\"]], [[16th Motorised Division Pistoia|16th Motorised Division \"Pistoia\"]], [[164th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|164th Light ''Afrika'' Division]] and the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] with 32 operational tanks. In reserve were the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] and the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] with 110 operational tanks. The line from Djebel Tebaga\u2013Djebel Melab was held by the {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Sahariano}}.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=333}}}} The British survey of the Mareth Line was assisted by General Rime-Bruneau, a former Chief of Staff of the Tunisian garrison and Captain Paul Mezan, the Garrison Engineer of the Mareth Line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=332}}\n\n===Battle of the Mareth Line===\n{{Main article|Battle of the Mareth Line}}\n\n[[File:Mareth line object.jpg|thumb|{{center|Infantry bunker of the Mareth Line}}]]\nOn 19 March 1943, the Eighth Army, made a frontal assault against the Mareth Line in Operation Pugilist. The [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division|50th Northumbrian Infantry Division]] penetrated the Line near [[Zarat, Tunisia|Zarat]] but was driven back by the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and the{{lang|it|Giovani Fascisti}} on 22 March.<ref>[https://adviceandresearch.blogspot.com/2019/06/division-giovani-fascisti-in-1943.html Giovani Fascisti division at Mareth]</ref> Earlier reconnaissance by the [[Long Range Desert Group]] had shown that the Line could be outflanked. A force could pass through the southern Matmata Hills, reach the Tebaga Gap from the west and pass on to the coastal plain behind the Mareth Line. At the same time as Pugilist, Montgomery had sent the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] around the Matmata Hills but its attack was contained at the Tebaga Gap from 21 to 24 March. Montgomery sent the [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|1st Armoured Division]] ([[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]]) to reinforce the attack at the Tebaga Gap. The British attacked again in [[Battle of the Mareth Line#Operation Supercharge II|Operation Supercharge II]] on 26 March and broke through the gap the next day. This success, combined with a fresh frontal assault, made the Mareth Line untenable but the Italian 1st Army escaped encirclement when the 1st Armoured Division was held up at El Hamma and the Axis forces retreated to [[Wadi Akarit]], {{convert|60|km|mi|order=flip}} to the north.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to World War II |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2001 |editor-first=I.
