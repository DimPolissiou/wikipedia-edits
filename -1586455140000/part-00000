In addition, the UNHRD network offers services and knowledge that allow various humanitarian partners to fulfill their missions rapidly and effectively.\n\n==Background==\n\nToday's UNHRD Network dates back to an initiative by the Italian government in the mid-80s: to pre-position relief items and support equipment for humanitarian operations at its military airport facilities. Expanding on the success of this method and envisioning a global network, WFP transformed the humanitarian depot into a logistic hub for emergency preparedness and response. In line with the [[Reform of the United Nations|United Nations Reforms]] for better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures, UNHRD enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian assistance, with the specific mandate to \u2018assist the population living in countries affected by natural disasters or complex emergencies, through a prepositioning of relief and survival items and their rapid demobilization to the affected countries.\u2019\n\n== History ==\nThe original UNHRD depot was inaugurated in Brindisi in the year 2000 to replace the United Nations Supply Depot (UNSD) in Pisa, then managed by the [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA). Upon decision of the Inter Agency Standing Committee (IASC) the mandate to provide rapid and accessible stockpiling and demobilisation services to partners inside and outside the United Nations was transferred from OCHA to WFP.
