Aravindan]] followed [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan|Adoor]]'s lead with his ''[[Uttarayanam]]'' in 1974. [[K. P. Kumaran]]'s ''Adhithi'' (1974) was another film which was acclaimed by the critics. [[National Film Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematographers who won the National Award]] for their work on Malayalam films in the 1970s were [[Mankada Ravi Varma]] for ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), [[P.

G. Soman]], [[Sukumaran]] and [[Sudheer (Malayalam actor)|Sudheer]] in the lead followed by the emergence of a new genre of pure action-themed films, in a movement led by action star [[Jayan]] who is usually considered the first genuine commercial superstar of Malayalam cinema. However, this was short-lived, and almost ended with Jayan's untimely death while performing a [[stunt]] in ''[[Kolilakkam]]'' (1980).\n\n== Socially Relevant Cinema ==\nThere has been many malayalam movies that are reflective of social issues. [[Ozhimuri]] unveils many subtle emotions, the importance of the freedom from a marriage for a woman and history behind the matrilineal marriage system and the period of transition to patriarchy. [[Virus_(2019_film)]] a medical thriller depicts how Kerala handled a Nipah outbreak. In the post Covid-19 world, this could be a great case study. [[Kumbalangi Nights]] vibrantly portrays men in different shades bringing out toxic masculinity and abuse to simple humanity.[[unda]]movie shows modern indias maoists  structure and how cops handling that.\n\n==Modern Era==\n[[File:Priyadarshan at a press conference for \u2018Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal\u2019 (cropped).jpg|thumb|120px|[[Priyadarshan]]]]\nThe Malayalam cinema of this period was characterised by detailed [[screenplay]]s dealing with everyday life with a lucid narration of plot intermingling with humour and melancholy. This was aided by the [[cinematography]] and lighting. The films had warm background music. In 1981 Fazil directed Manjil Virinja Pookal the film also introduced superstar [[Mohanlal]] to the world. [[K. G. George]] released films including  ''[[Yavanika]]'' (1982), and ''[[Adaminte Vaariyellu]]'' (1984).\n\nThis was the period during which script writer [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] started teaming up with director [[Hariharan (director)|Hariharan]] to produce works like ''[[Panchagni]]'', ''[[Nakhakshathangal]]'', ''[[Aranyakam]]'' and ''[[Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha]]''.

The growth of the film society movement in Kerala introduced the works of the French and Italian New Wave directors to the discerning Malayali film enthusiasts. [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan]]'s first film, ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), brought Malayalam cinema to the international film arena. In 1973 [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], who was by then recognized as an important author in Malayalam, directed his first film, ''[[Nirmalyam]]'', which won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film]].\n\n[[G. Aravindan]] followed [[Adoor Gopalakrishnan|Adoor]]'s lead with his ''[[Uttarayanam]]'' in 1974. [[K. P. Kumaran]]'s ''Adhithi'' (1974) was another film which was acclaimed by the critics. [[National Film Award for Best Cinematography|Cinematographers who won the National Award]] for their work on Malayalam films in the 1970s were [[Mankada Ravi Varma]] for ''[[Swayamvaram (1972 film)|Swayamvaram]]'' (1972), [[P.

Viswambharan]] with his debut film ''Ozhukinethire'' and mythical film ''Sathyavan Savithri'', which was well accepted.\n\nAlso, commercial cinema in this period saw several worker-class themed films which mostly had [[M. G. Soman]], [[Sukumaran]] and [[Sudheer (Malayalam actor)|Sudheer]] in the lead followed by the emergence of a new genre of pure action-themed films, in a movement led by action star [[Jayan]] who is usually considered the first genuine commercial superstar of Malayalam cinema. However, this was short-lived, and almost ended with Jayan's untimely death while performing a [[stunt]] in ''[[Kolilakkam]]'' (1980).\n\n== Socially Relevant Cinema ==\nThere has been many malayalam movies that are reflective of social issues. [[Ozhimuri]] unveils many subtle emotions, the importance of the freedom from a marriage for a woman and history behind the matrilineal marriage system and the period of transition to patriarchy. [[Virus_(2019_film)]] a medical thriller depicts how Kerala handled a Nipah outbreak. In the post Covid-19 world, this could be a great case study. [[Kumbalangi Nights]] vibrantly portrays men in different shades bringing out toxic masculinity and abuse to simple humanity. \n\n==Modern Era==\n[[File:Priyadarshan at a press conference for \u2018Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal\u2019 (cropped).jpg|thumb|120px|[[Priyadarshan]]]]\nThe Malayalam cinema of this period was characterised by detailed [[screenplay]]s dealing with everyday life with a lucid narration of plot intermingling with humour and melancholy. This was aided by the [[cinematography]] and lighting. The films had warm background music. In 1981 Fazil directed Manjil Virinja Pookal the film also introduced superstar [[Mohanlal]] to the world.

chromosome haplogroups}}\nPrior to 2002, there were in academic literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely. The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c63;\"|'''YCC 2002/2008 (Shorthand)'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b1)'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b2)'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b3)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b4)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b5)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b6)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96\"|'''(\u03b7)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96\"|'''YCC 2002 (Longhand)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c96;\"|'''YCC 2005 (Longhand)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c96;\"|'''YCC 2008 (Longhand)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c96;\"|'''YCC 2010r (Longhand)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2006'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2007'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2008'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2009'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2010'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2011'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2012'''\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-LLY22g (Y-DNA)|N-LLY22g]]||12||VIII||1U||25||Eu16||H5||F||N*||N||N1||N1||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-M128 (Y-DNA)|N-M128]]||12||VIII||1U||25||Eu16||H5||F||N1||N1||N1a||N1a||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-P63 (Y-DNA)|N-P63]]||12||VIII||1U||25||Eu16||H5||F||N2||N2a||N1b1||N1b1||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-TAT (Y-DNA)|N-TAT]]||12||VIII||1I||26||Eu13||H5||F||N3*||N3||N1c||N1c||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-M178 (Y-DNA)|N-M178]]||16||VIII||1I||26||Eu14||H5||F||N3a*||M178||N1c1||N1c1||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-P21 (Y-DNA)|N-P21]]||16||VIII||1I||26||Eu14||H5||F||N3a1||N3a1||N1c1a||N1c1a||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Sources'''\nThe following research teams per their publications were represented in the creation of the YCC Tree.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* '''\u03b1''' {{harvnb|Jobling and Tyler-Smith|2000}} and {{harvnb|Kaladjieva|2001}}\n* '''\u03b2''' {{harvnb|Underhill|2000}}\n* '''\u03b3''' {{harvnb|Hammer|2001}}\n* '''\u03b4''' {{harvnb|Karafet|2001}}\n* '''\u03b5''' {{harvnb|Semino|2000}}\n* '''\u03b6''' {{harvnb|Su|1999}}\n* '''\u03b7''' {{harvnb|Capelli|2001}}\n}}\n\n'''Unreliable mutations (SNPs and UEPs)'''\n\nThe b2/b3 deletion in the AZFc region of the Y-chromosome appears to have occurred independently on at least four different occasions.

chromosome haplogroups}}\nPrior to 2002, there were in academic literature at least seven naming systems for the Y-Chromosome Phylogenetic tree. This led to considerable confusion. In 2002, the major research groups came together and formed the Y-Chromosome Consortium (YCC). They published a joint paper that created a single new tree that all agreed to use. Later, a group of citizen scientists with an interest in population genetics and genetic genealogy formed a working group to create an amateur tree aiming at being above all timely. The table below brings together all of these works at the point of the landmark 2002 YCC Tree. This allows a researcher reviewing older published literature to quickly move between nomenclatures.\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c63;\"|'''YCC 2002/2008 (Shorthand)'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b1)'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b2)'''\n! align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b3)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b4)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b5)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96;\"|'''(\u03b6)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96\"|'''(\u03b7)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f96\"|'''YCC 2002 (Longhand)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c96;\"|'''YCC 2005 (Longhand)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c96;\"|'''YCC 2008 (Longhand)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#c96;\"|'''YCC 2010r (Longhand)'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2006'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2007'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2008'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2009'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2010'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2011'''\n|align=\"center\" style=\"background:#ff9;\"|'''ISOGG 2012'''\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-LLY22g (Y-DNA)|N-LLY22g]]||12||VIII||1U||25||Eu16||H5||F||N*||N||N1||N1||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-M128 (Y-DNA)|N-M128]]||12||VIII||1U||25||Eu16||H5||F||N1||N1||N1a||N1a||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-P63 (Y-DNA)|N-P63]]||12||VIII||1U||25||Eu16||H5||F||N2||N2a||N1b1||N1b1||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-TAT (Y-DNA)|N-TAT]]||12||VIII||1I||26||Eu13||H5||F||N3*||N3||N1c||N1c||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-M178 (Y-DNA)|N-M178]]||16||VIII||1I||26||Eu14||H5||F||N3a*||M178||N1c1||N1c1||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n| [[Haplogroup N-P21 (Y-DNA)|N-P21]]||16||VIII||1I||26||Eu14||H5||F||N3a1||N3a1||N1c1a||N1c1a||-||-||-||-||-||-||-\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Sources'''\nThe following research teams per their publications were represented in the creation of the YCC Tree.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* '''\u03b1''' {{harvnb|Jobling and Tyler-Smith|2000}} and {{harvnb|Kaladjieva|2001}}\n* '''\u03b2''' {{harvnb|Underhill|2000}}\n* '''\u03b3''' {{harvnb|Hammer|2001}}\n* '''\u03b4''' {{harvnb|Karafet|2001}}\n* '''\u03b5''' {{harvnb|Semino|2000}}\n* '''\u03b6''' {{harvnb|Su|1999}}\n* '''\u03b7''' {{harvnb|Capelli|2001}}\n}}\n\n'''Unreliable mutations (SNPs and UEPs)'''\n\nThe b2/b3 deletion in the AZFc region of the Y-chromosome appears to have occurred independently on at least four different occasions.

During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce \"cattleo\"<ref name=\"Halbert2007\" /> (today called \"[[beefalo]]\") Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. Wisent-American bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in Germany (and found to be fully fertile) and a herd of such animals is maintained in Russia. A herd of cattle-wisent crossbreeds ([[zubron]]) is maintained in Poland. First-generation crosses do not occur naturally, requiring caesarean delivery. First-generation males are infertile. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics that prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species. In the United States, many ranchers are now using DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%.<ref name=Halbert2007/><ref name=Polziehn/>\n\nThere are also remnant purebred American bison herds on public lands in North America.

During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce \"cattleo\"<ref name=\"Halbert2007\" /> (today called \"[[beefalo]]\") Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. Wisent-American bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in Germany (and found to be fully fertile) and a herd of such animals is maintained in Russia. A herd of cattle-wisent crossbreeds ([[zubron]]) is maintained in Poland. First-generation crosses do not occur naturally, requiring caesarean delivery. First-generation males are infertile. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics that prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species. In the United States, many ranchers are now using DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%.<ref name=Halbert2007/><ref name=Polziehn/>\n\nThere are also remnant purebred American bison herds on public lands in North America. Herds of importance are found in [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Wind Cave National Park]] in [[South Dakota]], [[Blue Mounds State Park]] in [[Minnesota]], [[Elk Island National Park]] in [[Alberta]], and [[Grasslands National Park]] in [[Saskatchewan]].

The dance can also be enjoyed as an uplifting group experience or as part of a [[meditation]]. Circle dances are choreographed to many different [[music genres|styles of music]] and rhythms.\n\nUnlike [[line dancing]], circle dancers are in physical contact with each other; the [[connection (dance)|connection]] is made by [[handhold (dance)|hand-to-hand]], finger-to-finger or hands-on-shoulders. It is a type of dance where anyone can join in without the need of [[partner dance|partner]]s. Generally, the participants follow a leader around the dance floor while holding the hand of the dancers beside them. The dance can be gentle or energetic.\n\nModern circle dance mixes traditional [[folk dance]]s, mainly from European or [[Near East]]ern sources, with recently choreographed ones to a variety of music both ancient and modern.

The dance originated from the medieval times, which survived only in the Faroe Islands, while in other European countries it was banned by the church, due to its [[pagan]] origin. The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing  around in various wobbles within the circle. The dance in itself only consists in holding each other's hands, while the dancers form a circle, dancing two steps to the left and one to the right without crossing the legs.

It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ({{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d}}) at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The lawweeh is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step, and when the singers finish their song the lawweeh breaks from the semicircle to dance on their own. The lawweeh is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sourat.com/dabke.htm |title=Dabke: The Dance of the Lebanese Village |publisher=Sourat |accessdate=2010-10-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918072739/http://www.sourat.com/dabke.htm |archivedate=2012-09-18 }}</ref>\n\n====Khigga====\n[[File:Assyriankhigga.jpg|thumb|[[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] dancing khigga at a festival]]\n\n[[Khigga]] is the one of main styles of [[Assyrian folk dance]] in which multiple dancers hold each other's hands and form a line or a circle.

Circle dancing is probably the oldest known dance formation and was part of community life from when people first started to dance.\n\nDancing in a circle is an ancient [[traditional dance|tradition]] common to many cultures for marking [[Ceremony|special occasions]], [[ritual]]s, strengthening community and encouraging [[Solidarity|togetherness]]. The dance can also be enjoyed as an uplifting group experience or as part of a [[meditation]]. Circle dances are choreographed to many different [[music genres|styles of music]] and rhythms.\n\nUnlike [[line dancing]], circle dancers are in physical contact with each other; the [[connection (dance)|connection]] is made by [[handhold (dance)|hand-to-hand]], finger-to-finger or hands-on-shoulders. It is a type of dance where anyone can join in without the need of [[partner dance|partner]]s. Generally, the participants follow a leader around the dance floor while holding the hand of the dancers beside them. The dance can be gentle or energetic.\n\nModern circle dance mixes traditional [[folk dance]]s, mainly from European or [[Near East]]ern sources, with recently choreographed ones to a variety of music both ancient and modern. There is also a growing repertoire of new circle dances to [[classical music]] and [[pop music|contemporary songs]].<ref name=gilbert>International Folk Dance at a Glance. Second Edition.

The dance originated from the medieval times, which survived only in the Faroe Islands, while in other European countries it was banned by the church, due to its [[pagan]] origin. The dance is danced traditionally in a circle, but when a lot of people take part in the dance they usually let it swing  around in various wobbles within the circle. The dance in itself only consists in holding each other's hands, while the dancers form a circle, dancing two steps to the left and one to the right without crossing the legs. When more and more dancers join the dance ring, the circle starts to bend and forms a new one within itself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Faroese Chain Dance |url=https://www.faroeislands.fo/arts-culture/customs/chain-dance/ |publisher=Faroe Islands.fo |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Sacred Circle Dance====\n{{further|Sacred dance}}\n\nThe Sacred Circle Dance was brought to the [[Findhorn Foundation]] community in [[Scotland]] by [[Bernhard Wosien]]; he presented traditional circle dances that he had gathered from across [[Eastern Europe]].<ref>Watts, 2006. pages 6\u201310</ref> \nColin Harrison and David Roberts and Janet Rowan Scott took the dances to other parts of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] where they started regular groups in south east [[England]] and [[Somerset]], then across [[Europe]], the US and elsewhere. The network extends also to [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]] and [[South America]] and [[India]]. A small centrepiece of flowers or other objects is often placed at the centre of the circle to help focus the dancers and maintain the circular shape.

It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ({{lang|ar|\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d}}) at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The lawweeh is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step, and when the singers finish their song the lawweeh breaks from the semicircle to dance on their own.

More modern forms of Kochari have added a \"[[tremolo]] step,\" which involves shaking the whole body. In [[Azerbaijan]], the dance consists of slow and rapid parts, and is of three variants.

Firstly they take three steps forwards, tap their left feet on the ground, and step forward to stand on the left foot; then they tale three small steps back and repeat the actions a little faster. Like most Anatolian folk dances, Tamzara is done with a large group of people with interlocked little fingers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1904&Itemid=63 |title=PontosWorld |website=pontosworld.com |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[International folk dance]]\n* [[Circumambulation]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n\n===Books===\n\n* B.
