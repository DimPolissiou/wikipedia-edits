The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Woody (Toy Story)|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theatres in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|title=Toy Story|work=The Numbers|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316140137/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]]\u2014the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy\u2014sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. They manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and begin to help, but RC's batteries become depleted before he reaches the truck. Realizing that Sid's rocket is still strapped to Buzz's back, Woody ignites it, hurtling them towards the truck. Woody throws RC into the truck before he and Buzz soar into the air; Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket just before it explodes, and he glides with Woody to safety inside a box in the Davis's van, right next to Andy, who concludes they were in the car all along.\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] at their new home, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals; one of the toys is Mrs. Potato Head, to Mr. Potato Head's delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{{Main|List of Toy Story characters}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Sheriff Woody|Sheriff Woody Pride]], a [[pull-string]] [[cowboy]] doll who is Andy's favourite toy.\n* [[Tim Allen]] as [[Buzz Lightyear]], a space ranger [[action figure]] and Woody's rival, who later becomes his best friend.\n* [[Don Rickles]] as [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr. Potato Head]], a cynical potato-shaped doll with put-together pieces on his body.\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Slinky Dog]], a [[dachshund]] [[slinky]] toy.\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Rex, a nervous green [[Tyrannosaurus]] figurine.\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Hamm, a smart-talking [[piggy bank]].\n* [[Annie Potts]] as [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], a [[Bisque doll|porcelain]] shepherdess doll and Woody's love interest.\n* [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]] as [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], Woody and Buzz's owner.\n* [[Erik von Detten]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Sid Phillips|Sid Phillips]], Andy's next door neighbor, who tortures toys for his own amusement.\n* [[Laurie Metcalf]] as [[List of Toy Story characters#Mrs. Davis|Mrs. Davis]], Andy's mother.\n* [[R.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=122}} Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\"BizWeekBOX\" /> It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film.

Katzenberg wanted primarily to add \"more edginess\" to the two main characters.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Disney wanted the film to appeal to both children and adults, and they asked for adult references to be added to the film.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> After many rounds of notes from Katzenberg and other Disney executives, the general consensus was that Woody had been stripped of almost all charm.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=129}} Hanks, while recording the dialogue for the story reels, exclaimed at one point that the character was a jerk.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=207}} Lasseter and his Pixar team had the first half of the movie ready to screen, so they brought it down to Burbank to show to Katzenberg and other Disney executives on November 19, 1993\u2014an event they later dubbed the \"Black Friday Incident\".<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\">{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|title=Toy' Wonder|date=December 8, 1995|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205204251/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897,00.html|archive-date=December 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The results were disastrous.

Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader.

Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces.

Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks.

The [[feature film]] directorial debut of [[John Lasseter]], it was the first entirely computer-animated feature film, as well as the first feature film from Pixar. The screenplay was written by [[Joss Whedon]], [[Andrew Stanton]], [[Joel Cohen (writer)|Joel Cohen]], and [[Alec Sokolow]] from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, [[Pete Docter]], and [[Joe Ranft]]. The film features music by [[Randy Newman]], was produced by [[Bonnie Arnold]] and [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and was executive-produced by [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Edwin Catmull]]. It features the voices of [[Tom Hanks]], [[Tim Allen]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Wallace Shawn]], [[John Ratzenberger]], [[Jim Varney]], [[Annie Potts]], [[R. Lee Ermey]], [[John Morris (actor)|John Morris]], [[Laurie Metcalf]], and [[Erik von Detten]].\n\nTaking place in a world where anthropomorphic toys come to life when humans are not present, the plot focuses on the relationship between an old-fashioned pull-string cowboy doll named [[Woody (Toy Story)|Woody]] and an astronaut action figure, [[Buzz Lightyear]], as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections of their owner [[Andy Davis (Toy Story)|Andy Davis]], to friends who work together to be reunited with him after being separated from him.\n\nFollowing the success of Pixar's 1988 short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'', the company was approached by Disney to produce a computer-animated feature film told from a small toy's perspective. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter wrote early story treatments, which were rejected by Disney, who wanted the film's tone to be \"edgier\". After several disastrous [[story reel]]s, production was halted and the script was rewritten to better reflect the tone and theme Pixar desired: \"toys deeply want children to play with them, and [...] this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions\". The studio, then consisting of a relatively small number of employees, produced the film under only minor financial constraints.\n\n''Toy Story'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, on November 19, 1995, and was released in theatres in North America on November 22, 1995. It was the highest-grossing film during its opening weekend,<ref name=\"numbers\">{{cite web|url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|title=Toy Story|work=The Numbers|accessdate=March 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316140137/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1995/0TYST.php|archive-date=March 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> eventually earning over $373 million at the worldwide [[box office]].

Andy's toys\u2014including [[Bo Peep (Toy Story)|Bo Peep]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the [[piggy bank]] and [[Slinky]] Dog\u2014fear they will be replaced by new toys that Andy receives during the party. To ease the situation, [[Sheriff Woody]]\u2014the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy\u2014sends out [[army men]], led by Sarge, to spy on the party and report the gift arrivals to the other toys via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end without any of them being supplanted by newer toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift: a [[Buzz Lightyear]] action figure.\n\nBuzz thinks he is a real space ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.  Buzz quickly impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, which makes Woody feel rejected compared to the newer, sleeker and more advanced Buzz. Two days before the move, Andy's mother tells him that he can only bring one toy to a family outing at the Pizza Planet restaurant. Knowing that Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk but ends up knocking him out of the window, causing most of the other toys (except Slinky and Bo) to accuse Woody of \"murdering\" Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy arrives and, after failing to find Buzz, takes Woody instead.\n\nWhen the family stops for [[Gasoline|gas]], Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. The two fight, falling out of the van in the process, and the family drives away, stranding them. They manage to reach Pizza Planet by hitching a ride on a delivery truck. Buzz, still believing he is a real space ranger despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a [[crane game]] full of alien toys, where they are retrieved by Andy's sadistic, toy-destroying neighbor, Sid Phillips. At Sid's house, the two watch in horror as Sid steals his younger sister Hannah's doll, claiming the doll is sick, and then performs \"surgery\" to replace the doll's head with that of a [[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]].\n\nWhile attempting to escape, Buzz sees a television commercial for a Buzz Lightyear action figure and, after failing to fly out a window (breaking his arm off in the process), realizes he is just a toy and becomes despondent. Woody attempts to signal Andy's toys for help, but they misunderstand his gesture and ignore him. Sid's mutant toys fix Buzz's arm, and Woody restores Buzz's confidence by telling him about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy. The next morning, as Sid is about to launch Buzz on a firework rocket, Woody and the mutant toys come to life in front of Sid, terrifying him into no longer mistreating toys. Woody bids the mutant toys farewell and escapes with Buzz\u2014only to see Andy and his family departing for their new home.\n\nThe duo try to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog Scud sees them and gives chase. Buzz saves Woody from Scud but is left behind, so Woody attempts to rescue him with Andy's remote-controlled car, RC. Thinking that Woody is \"killing\" RC as well, the other toys attack and toss him off the truck. Buzz and RC retrieve Woody; the other toys realize their mistake and begin to help, but RC's batteries become depleted before he reaches the truck.

In 1986, Pixar was purchased by entrepreneur and [[Apple Inc.]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]].{{sfn|Paik|2007|p=41}} At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the [[Pixar Image Computer]]'s capabilities. In 1988 Lasseter produced the short film ''[[Tin Toy]]'' told from the perspective of a toy and referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys. ''Tin Toy'' won the [[60th Academy Awards|1988 Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], the [[Timeline of computer animation in film and television|first computer-generated film to do so]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}}\n\n''Tin Toy'' gained Disney's attention, and the new team at [[The Walt Disney Company]]\u2014CEO [[Michael Eisner]] and chairman [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] in [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|the film division]]\u2014began a quest to get Lasseter to come back.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Lasseter, grateful for Jobs' faith in him, felt compelled to stay with Pixar, telling co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], \"I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Katzenberg realized he could not lure Lasseter back to Disney and therefore set plans into motion to ink a production deal with Pixar to produce a film.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=181}} Disney had always made all their movies in-house and refused to change this. But when [[Tim Burton]], who used to work at Disney, wanted to buy back the rights to ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', Disney struck a deal allowing him to make it as a Disney movie outside the studio. This opened the door for Pixar to make their movies outside Disney.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|title=How Pixar became the world's greatest animation company|website=www.telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=July 8, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625215743/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/what-to-watch/pixar-history-good-dinosaur-toy-story/|archive-date=June 25, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth sides were willing.

They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=118}} After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called ''A Tin Toy Christmas''. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}}\n\nThey met with Katzenberg at a conference table in the [[Team Disney]] building at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Catmull and Smith considered it would be difficult to keep Katzenberg interested in working with the company over time. They considered it even more difficult to sell Lasseter and the junior animators on the idea of working with Disney, who had a bad reputation for how they treated their animators, and Katzenberg, who had built a reputation as a micromanaging tyrant.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} Katzenberg asserted this himself in the meeting: \"Everybody thinks I'm a tyrant. I ''am'' a tyrant. But I'm usually right.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} He threw out the idea of a half-hour special and eyed Lasseter as the key talent in the room: \"John, since you won't come work for me, I'm going to make it work this way.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}}{{sfn|Price|2008|p=119}} He invited the six visitors to mingle with the animators\u2014\"ask them anything at all\"\u2014and the men did so, finding they all backed up Katzenberg's statements. Lasseter felt he would be able to work with Disney and the two companies began negotiations.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} Pixar at this time was on the verge of bankruptcy and needed a deal with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Katzenberg insisted that Disney be given the rights to Pixar's proprietary technology for making 3-D animation, but Jobs refused.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=120}} In another case, Jobs demanded Pixar would have part ownership of the film and its characters, sharing control of both video rights and sequels, but Katzenberg refused.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=206}} Disney and Pixar reached accord on contract terms in an agreement dated May 3, 1991, and signed on in early July.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=122}} Eventually, the deal specified that Disney would own the picture and its characters outright, have creative control, and pay Pixar about 12.5% of the ticket revenues.{{sfn|Kanfer|2000|p=229}}<ref name=\"BizWeekBOX\" /> It had the option (but not the obligation) to do Pixar's next two films and the right to make (with or without Pixar) sequels using the characters in the film.

Lasseter decided Tinny was \"too antiquated\"; the character was first changed to a military action figure and then given a space theme. Tinny's name changed to Lunar Larry, then Tempus from Morph, and eventually Buzz Lightyear (after astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]).{{sfn|Price|2008|p=125}} Lightyear's design was modeled on the suits worn by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] astronauts as well as [[G.I.

However, character designer [[Bud Luckey]] suggested that Woody could be changed to a cowboy ventriloquist dummy.

The crew shifted to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter attempted to keep morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was \"a very scary time,\" recalled story department manager BZ Petroff.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">{{cite AV media|title=Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition) \u2013 (Filmmakers Reflect)|medium=DVD|publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment|date=September 6, 2005}}</ref> Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and went over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=124}} Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists then drew the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with the revision, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=131}} When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on ''Toy Story'', Jobs funded the project personally. Jobs did not insert himself into the creative process, but instead managed the relationship with Disney.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}\n\nThe Pixar team came back with a new script three months later, with the character of Woody altered from being the tyrannical boss of Andy's toys to being their wise and caring leader. It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than the juvenile group discussion that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed \"to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\" /> Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach and, by February 1994, the film was back in production.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers.<ref name=ew7 />{{sfn|Price|2008|p=133}} In comparison, ''[[The Lion King]]'', released in 1994, required a budget of $45&nbsp;million and a staff of 800.<ref name=ew7>{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |title='Toy Story': The Inside Buzz |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 8, 1995 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67q27oVus?url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299897_7,00.html |archive-date=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17 million production budget proved inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy. Jobs demanded more funds to complete the film and insisted that Disney was liable for the cost overruns.

Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was first either created out of [[Modelling clay|clay]] or modeled from a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer-animated design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\">{{cite news|last=Snider|first=Burr|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|title=The Toy Story Story|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|pages=1\u20136|date=December 1995|accessdate=March 13, 2009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131017031124/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.12/toy.story.html|archive-date=October 17, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Once the animators had a model, its articulation and motion controls were coded; this allowed each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /> Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\">{{cite journal|last=Henne |first=Mark |last2=Hickel |first2=Hal |last3=Johnson |first3=Ewan |last4=Konishi |first4=Sonoks |title=The Making of Toy Story |journal=CompCon '96.

Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or Venetian blind shadows falling across Andy's room.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=126}}\n\nEvery shot in the film passed through the hands of eight different teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting the location of the virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and [[Ash Brannon]], each shot went from Layout to the animation department. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or \"[[keyframe]]s\") was created, the software built poses for the frames in-between.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=135}} To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" />\n\nAfterward, the animators compiled the scenes and developed a new storyboard with the computer-animated characters. They then added shading, lighting, visual effects, and finally used 300 computer processors to render the film to its final design.<ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" /> Under [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Tom Porter]], the shading team used RenderMan's shader language to create shader programs for each of a model's surfaces. A few surfaces in ''Toy Story'' came from real objects: a shader for the curtain fabric in Andy's room used a scan of actual cloth.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=136}} Under Galyn Susman and [[Sharon Calahan]], the lighting team orchestrated the final lighting of the shot after animation and shading. Each completed shot then went into rendering on a \"render farm\" of 117 [[Sun Microsystems]] computers that ran 24 hours a day.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} Finished animation emerged in a steady drip of around three minutes a week.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Depending on its complexity, each frame took from 45 minutes up to 30 hours to render. The film required 800,000 machine hours and 114,240 frames of animation in total.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /><ref name=\"WiredMakingof\" /><ref name=\"CNN110animators\" /> There are over 77 minutes of animation spread across 1,561 shots.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=134}} A camera team, aided by [[David DiFrancesco]], recorded the frames onto [[film stock]]. To fit a 1.85:1 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], ''Toy Story'' was rendered at a mere 1,536 by 922 pixels, with each of them corresponding to roughly a quarter-inch of screen area on a typical cinema screen.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=137}} During post-production, the film was sent to [[Skywalker Sound]], where the sound effects were mixed with the music score.<ref name=\"HenneMakingOf\" />\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Toy Story (soundtrack)}}\n\nDisney was concerned with Lasseter's position on the use of music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a [[buddy film]] featuring \"real toys.\" [[Joss Whedon]] agreed, saying, \"It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming \"Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. It takes some of the onus off what they're asking for.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in ''Toy Story'' would not break into song, but the film would use [[Diegesis#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] songs over the action, as in ''[[The Graduate]]'', to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=128}} Disney and Lasseter tapped [[Randy Newman]] to compose the film. The edited ''Toy Story'' was due to Newman and [[Gary Rydstrom]] in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\nLasseter said, \"His songs are touching, witty, and satirical, and he would deliver the emotional underpinning for every scene.\"<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> Newman wrote three original songs for the film, developing the film's signature song \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" in one day.<ref name=\"EWToyWonder\" /> The soundtrack for ''Toy Story'' was produced by [[Walt Disney Records]] and was released on November 22, 1995, the week of the film's release.\n\n=== Editing and pre-release ===\nIt was difficult for crew members to perceive the film's quality during much of the production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially but felt animators and animation fans would find it interesting.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=138}} According to [[Lee Unkrich]], one of the original editors of ''Toy Story'', a scene cut out of the original final edit featured Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently; Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the movie's creators thought the audience would love Buzz and Woody by that point.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Toy Story Deleted Scenes (Toy Story 10th Anniversary Edition) |last=Lasseter |first=John |publisher=[[Disney]] |year = 2005}}</ref> Another scene, in which Woody tried to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie.<ref name=\"Deleted Scenes\" /> Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and he announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}}\n\nSources indicate that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked confidence in the film during its production, and he had been talking to various companies, ranging from [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] to [[Microsoft]], about selling Pixar.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Price|2008|pp=139\u2013142}} However, as the film progressed, Jobs became increasingly excited about it, feeling that he might be on the verge of transforming the movie industry.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of ''Toy Story'' that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public.{{sfn|Isaacson|2011|p=208}} A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}} The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.{{sfn|Price|2008|p=149}}\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:El Capitan Theatre, Hollywood, California (2997200450).jpg|thumb|The [[El Capitan Theatre]] in Los Angeles, where ''Toy Story''{{'}}s Los Angeles, California's premiere took place on November 19, 1995.|alt=Exterior shot of the El Capitan Theatre.]]\n\nThere were two premieres of ''Toy Story'' in November 1995.

Studied [[Civil Engineering]] at the [[National University of Colombia]] and at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he graduated in 1943,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.presidencia.gov.co/asiescolombia/presidentes/64.htm |title=Virgilio Barco Vargas |publisher=Presidency of the Republic of Colombia |date=June 2013 |access-date=2014-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031195108/http://web.presidencia.gov.co/asiescolombia/presidentes/64.htm |archive-date=2013-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He entered politics in 1943 when he became a city council member in the town of Durania for the Liberal Party. He was then elected to the lower house of Congress, but went into exile to the USA in 1950, because of violence between liberals and conservatives. His daughter, [[Carolina Barco Isakson]] (who would later become a Colombian politician herself) was born there. He obtained an M.A. in economics in MIT, where he took classes under Nobel prize winners Robert Solow and Paul Samuelson, in 1952 and obtained a PhD in economics in Boston University in 1954.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cidob.org/es/content/pdf/1810}}</ref>\n\nBarco is the grandson of Colombian General [[Virgilio Barco M.]], who developed one of the country's largest oil concessions in 1905.\n\n==Political career==\nBarco returned to Colombia in 1954 to help negotiate the peace process which allowed the formation of the [[History of Colombia#The National Front|National Front]] between liberals and conservatives, which lasted two decades. He became a member of the [[Colombian Senate|Senate]], the upper house of [[Colombian Congress|Congress]] in 1958, left to become the ambassador to [[UK|Britain]] in 1961, and returned  to Colombia in 1962. He served another term in the Senate until 1966, when he was elected [[mayor]] of Colombia's capital, [[Bogot\u00e1]]. He served in that position until 1969, when he became a director of the [[World Bank]] until 1974. He then served as ambassador to the United States from 1977 until 1980.\n\n==Presidency==\nBarco was elected [[President (government title)|president]] of Colombia with 58% of the vote in 1986. He supported [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]]s, renewed dialogue with [[Colombian guerrilla|leftist guerillas]] and fought drug traffickers. Though he was popular within the international community, he became less popular in Colombia because the drug traffickers became more violent after he started to move against them.  His restrictive economic policies at first doomed the country. After two years of this, The Economic Openness program was initiated by his administration, which would open Colombian markets to the world and recharge the country's economy. He served one 4-year term. \n\n==After the Presidency==\nWhen he left the Presidency in 1990, he served as ambassador to Britain again until 1992.\n\nBarco was diagnosed with cancer and he died on May 20, 1997, in [[Bogot\u00e1]] when he was 75. He is now buried at [[Central Cemetery of Bogot\u00e1]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*

was a Colombian politician and civil engineer who served as the [[List of Presidents of Colombia|27th President of Colombia]] serving from 7 August 1986 to 7 August 1990.\n\n==Early life==\nBarco was born in [[C\u00facuta]], [[Norte de Santander Department]], in the home of Jorge Enrique Barco Maldonaldo and Julieta Vargas Dur\u00e1n lived in north-eastern Colombia. Studied [[Civil Engineering]] at the [[National University of Colombia]] and at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he graduated in 1943,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.presidencia.gov.co/asiescolombia/presidentes/64.htm |title=Virgilio Barco Vargas |publisher=Presidency of the Republic of Colombia |date=June 2013 |access-date=2014-01-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031195108/http://web.presidencia.gov.co/asiescolombia/presidentes/64.htm |archive-date=2013-10-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He entered politics in 1943 when he became a city council member in the town of Durania for the Liberal Party. He was then elected to the lower house of Congress, but went into exile to the USA in 1950, because of violence between liberals and conservatives. His daughter, [[Carolina Barco Isakson]] (who would later become a Colombian politician herself) was born there. He obtained an M.A. in economics in MIT, where he took classes under Nobel prize winners Robert Solow and Paul Samuelson, in 1952 and obtained a PhD in economics in Boston University in 1954.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cidob.org/es/content/pdf/1810}}</ref>\n\nBarco is the grandson of Colombian General [[Virgilio Barco M.]], who developed one of the country's largest oil concessions in 1905.\n\n==Political career==\nBarco returned to Colombia in 1954 to help negotiate the peace process which allowed the formation of the [[History of Colombia#The National Front|National Front]] between liberals and conservatives, which lasted two decades. He became a member of the [[Colombian Senate|Senate]], the upper house of [[Colombian Congress|Congress]] in 1958, left to become the ambassador to [[UK|Britain]] in 1961, and returned  to Colombia in 1962. He served another term in the Senate until 1966, when he was elected [[mayor]] of Colombia's capital, [[Bogot\u00e1]]. He served in that position until 1969, when he became a director of the [[World Bank]] until 1974. He then served as ambassador to the United States from 1977 until 1980.\n\n==Presidency==\nBarco was elected [[President (government title)|president]] of Colombia with 58% of the vote in 1986. He supported [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]]s, renewed dialogue with [[Colombian guerrilla|leftist guerillas]] and fought drug traffickers. Though he was popular within the international community, he became less popular in Colombia because the drug traffickers became more violent after he started to move against them.  His restrictive economic policies at first doomed the country. After two years of this, The Economic Openness program was initiated by his administration, which would open Colombian markets to the world and recharge the country's economy. He served one 4-year term. \n\n==After the Presidency==\nWhen he left the Presidency in 1990, he served as ambassador to Britain again until 1992.\n\nBarco was diagnosed with cancer and he died on May 20, 1997, in [[Bogot\u00e1]] when he was 75. He is now buried at [[Central Cemetery of Bogot\u00e1]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cidob.org/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/colombia/virgilio_barco_vargas Biography and tenure of Virgilio Barco by CIDOB]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box\n| before = [[Belisario Betancur Cuartas]]\n| title = [[President of Colombia]]\n| years = 1986\u20131990\n| after = [[C\u00e9sar Gaviria Trujillo]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{heads of state of Colombia}}\n{{Mayor of Bogot\u00e1}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barco Vargas, Virgilio}}\n[[Category:1921 births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n[[Category:Barco family|Virgilio]]\n[[Category:People from C\u00facuta]]\n[[Category:Colombian people of Spanish descent]]\n[[Category:National University of Colombia alumni]]\n[[Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni]]\n[[Category:Boston University alumni]]\n[[Category:Colombian civil engineers]]\n[[Category:Colombian Liberal Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Colombian Ministers of Public Works]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Colombia to the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Ministers of Finance and Public Credit of Colombia]]\n[[Category:Colombian Ministers of Agriculture]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Bogot\u00e1]]\n[[Category:Ambassadors of Colombia to the United States]]\n[[Category:Presidents of Colombia]]\n[[Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease]]\n[[Category:Burials at Central Cemetery of Bogot\u00e1]]\n", "name_user": "Epatarroyo", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgilio_Barco_Vargas"}
