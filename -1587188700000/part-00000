In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is produced by the [[BBC]]. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''Master Chef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9 to 12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format and style of the show has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''Master Chef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants, and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===Grossman's departure and 2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the program asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA|Master Chef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''Master Chef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although they do not address the viewer's directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voice over by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programs, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final. Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''Master Chef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''Master Chef Live''==\n''Master Chef Live'' is an extension of the television program. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theater, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity Master Chef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity Master Chef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''Master Chef Goes Large''.

She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available. Many commentators (who did not realize what the competition was about), particularly from Malaysia and Indonesia, pointed out that rendang is usually cooked as a stew and is not crispy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title='I would rendang his head': UK MasterChef judges stir up a storm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/i-would-rendang-his-head-uk-masterchef-judges-stir-up-a-storm|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The judges failed to differentiate between \"crispy\" and \"under cooked\".

competitive cooking show produced by [[Endemol Shine Group]] and is broadcasted in 60 countries around the world. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is produced by the [[BBC]]. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9 to 12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format and style of the show has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants, and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===Grossman's departure and 2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available.

It is divided into [[Municipalities of Sonora|72 municipalities]]; the capital city is [[Hermosillo]].\nSonora is bordered by the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] to the east, [[Baja California]] to the northwest and [[Sinaloa]] to the south. To the north, it shares the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S.\u2013Mexico border]] primarily with the state of [[Arizona]] with a small length with [[New Mexico]], and on the west has a significant share of the coastline of the [[Gulf of California]].\n\nSonora's natural geography is divided into three parts: the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] in the east of the state; plains and rolling hills in the center; and the coast on the Gulf of California. It is primarily arid or semiarid deserts and grasslands, with only the highest elevations having sufficient rainfall to support other types of vegetation.\n\nSonora is home to eight indigenous peoples, including the [[Mayo people|Mayo]], the [[O\u2019odham]], the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]], and [[Seri people|Seri]]. It has been economically important for its agriculture, livestock (especially beef), and mining since the colonial period, and for its status as a border state since the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. With the [[Gadsden Purchase]], Sonora lost more than a quarter of its territory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sonora, Navojoa |url=http://modulodeplaneacionestrategica.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/sonora-navojoa.pdf|publisher=Modulo de Planeacion Estrategica |accessdate=April 7, 2010}}</ref> From the 20th century to the present, industry, tourism, and [[agribusiness]] have dominated the economy, attracting migration from other parts of Mexico.\n\n==Etymology==\nSeveral theories exist as to the origin of the name \"Sonora\". One theory states that the name was derived from ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora'', the name given to the territory when Diego de Guzm\u00e1n crossed the [[Yaqui River]] on the day of ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario'' (\"[[Our Lady of the Rosary]]\"), which falls on {{nowrap|October 7}} with the pronunciation possibly changing because none of the indigenous languages of the area have the ''\u00f1'' sound. Another theory states that [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]] and his companions, who had wrecked off the Florida coast and made their way across the continent, were forced to cross the arid state from north to south, carrying an image of ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Angustias'' (\"Our Lady of Anguish\") on a cloth. They encountered the [[Opata people|Opata]], who could not pronounce ''Se\u00f1ora'', instead saying ''Senora'' or ''Sonora''. A third theory, written by Father Crist\u00f3bal de Ca\u00f1as in 1730, states that the name comes from the word for a natural water well, ''sonot'', which the Spaniards eventually modified to \"''Sonora''\".  The first record of the name Sonora comes from explorer [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]], who passed through the state in 1540 and called part of the area the ''Valle de la Sonora''. [[Francisco de Ibarra]] also traveled through the area in 1567 and referred to the ''Valles de Se\u00f1ora''.<ref name=\"nomenclatura\">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_sonora |title= Nomenclatura |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de M\u00e9xico Estado de Sonora |publisher= Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Nomenclature |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> The literal meaning of \"sonora\" in Spanish is \"sonorous\" or \"loud.\"\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Sonora}}\n\n===Pre-Hispanic period===\n[[File:Knight Gomphotherium.jpg|thumb|[[Gomphothere]]s (reconstructed) were hunted in Sonora by ancient Clovis hunters.]]\n\nEvidence of human existence in the state dates back over 10,000 years, with some of the best-known remains at the [[San Dieguito Complex]] in the [[El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve|El Pinacate Desert]].

The lowland central coast, however, seems never truly to have adopted agriculture.<ref name=\"gorenstein243\"/> Because Sonora and much of the northwest does not share many of the cultural traits of that area, it is not considered part of [[Mesoamerica]]. Though evidence exists of trade between the peoples of Sonora and Mesoamerica, [[Guasave, Sinaloa|Guasave]] in [[Sinaloa]] is  the most north-westerly point considered Mesoamerican.<ref name=\"gorenstein150\">Foster, p. 150</ref>\n\nThree archaeological cultures developed in the low, flat areas of the state near the coast: the [[Trincheras tradition]], the [[Huatabampo tradition]], and the [[Central Coast tradition]]. The Trincheras tradition is dated to between 750 and 1450 CE and mostly known from sites in the Altar, Magdalena, and Concepci\u00f3n valleys, but its range extended from the Gulf of California into northern Sonora. The tradition is named after trenches found in a number of sites, the best known of which is the Cerro de Trincheras. The Huatabampo tradition is centered south of the Trincheras along the coast, with sites along extinct lagoons, estuaries, and river valleys. This tradition has a distinctive ceramic complex. Huatabampo culture shows similarities with the [[Chametla]] to the south and the [[Hohokam]] to the north. This probably ended around 1000&nbsp;CE. Unlike the other two traditions, the Central Coast remained a hunter-gatherer culture, as the area lacks the resources for agriculture.<ref name=\"gorenstein18\">Foster, p. 18</ref>\n\nThe higher elevations of the state were dominated by the [[Casas Grandes]] and [[R\u00edo Sonora tradition]]. The R\u00edo Sonora culture is located in central Sonora from the border area to modern Sinaloa. A beginning date for this culture has not been determined but it probably disappeared by the early 14th century. The Casas Grandes tradition in Sonora was an extension of the R\u00edo Sonora tradition based in the modern state of Chihuahua, which exterted its influence down to parts of the Sonoran coast.<ref name=\"gorenstein19\">Foster, p. 19</ref><ref name=\"gorenstein251\">Foster, p. 251</ref>\n\nClimatic changes in the middle of the 15th century resulted in the increased [[desertification]] of northwest Mexico in general. This is the probable cause for the drastic decrease in the number and size of settlements starting around this time. The peoples that remained in the area reverted to a less complex social organization and lifestyle.<ref name=\"gorenstein252\">Foster, p. 252</ref> Whatever socially complex organization existed in Sonora before the Spaniards was long gone by the 16th century.<ref name=\"gorenstein251\"/>\n\n===European period===\nLittle reliable information remains about the area in the 16th century following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]]. Some state that the first Spanish settlement was founded by \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca in 1530, near [[Hu\u00e9pac]].

Originally, these missionaries worked out a peaceful compromise with the 30,000 Yaquis allowing for the establishment of more than fifty mission settlements in the Sonora river valleys. This broke down when the Jesuits opposed the native [[shaman]]ic religious tradition. The Opata were more receptive to the missionaries and allied with them. After this, the Jesuits began to move into [[Pima people|Pima]] and [[Tohono O'odham]] territories.<ref name=\"hamnett105\"/> Spanish exploration and missionary work was sufficient to consider the territory part of [[New Spain]]. An agreement between General [[Pedro de Perea]] and the [[viceroy]] of New Spain resulted in the general shaping of the province, initially called ''Nueva Navarra'' in 1637, but renamed ''Sonora'' in 1648.<ref name=\"rincones37\"/>\n\nThe most famous missionary of Sonora, as well as much of what is now the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]], was [[Eusebio Kino]].<ref name=\"turhistoria\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sonoraturismo.gob.mx/conoce-sonora/historia-de-sonora/ |title=Historia de Sonora |publisher=Government of Sonora |location=Sonora Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of Sonora |accessdate=February 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202081817/http://www.sonoraturismo.gob.mx/conoce-sonora/historia-de-sonora/ |archivedate=February 2, 2011 }}</ref> He arrived in Sonora in 1687 and started missionary work in the [[Pimer\u00eda Alta]] area of Sonora and Arizona. He began his first mission at Cucurpe, then established churches and missions in other villages such as [[Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert|Los Remedios, Imuris, Magdalena, Coc\u00f3spera, San Ignacio, Tubutama and Caborca]]. To develop an economy for the natives, Father Kino also taught them European farming techniques.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/><ref name=\"rincones38\">Gonzalez, p. 38</ref>\n\nThe initial attraction of Sonora for the Spaniards was its fertile farmlands along the river valleys<ref name=\"yetman4\"/> and its position as part of a corridor linking the central Mexican highlands around [[Mexico City]] up the Pacific coast and on into Arizona and points north. This corridor still exists in the form of [[Mexican Federal Highway 15|Federal Highway 15]].<ref name=\"gorenstein139\">Foster, p. 139</ref> After the establishment of the mission system, Spanish colonists followed. Indigenous response was a mixture of accommodation and violence, as different strategies were employed by different groups at different times. The sporadic violence, which would continue throughout the colonial period, resulted in the Spanish building [[presidio]]s and other fortifications to protect missions and Spanish settlements.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/><ref name=\"hamnett105\"/> While the colonization process was not especially violent, the impact on the indigenous of the area was severe, as it almost completely disrupted their formerly very independent lives, forcing them to conform to an alien centralized system. One consequence of this was alcoholism among the native peoples.<ref name=\"rincones37\"/>\n\nIn 1691, what are now the states of Sonora and Sinaloa were joined into an entity called the ''Provincias de Sonora, Ostimuri, y Sinaloa''. They would remain as such through the rest of the colonial period until 1823.<ref name=\"rincones38\"/> At this time, about 1,300 Spanish settlers were in the area.<ref name=\"hamnett107\">Hamnett, p. 107</ref> Colonization increased in the 18th century, especially from 1700 to 1767, when mineral deposits were discovered, especially in [[\u00c1lamos]]. This led to the establishment of a number of royally controlled mining camps, forcing many natives off their agricultural lands. Loss of said lands along the [[Yaqui River|Yaqui]] and [[Mayo River (Mexico)|Mayo River]]s led to native uprisings during this time.<ref name=\"rincones37\"/> A major [[Seri people|Seri]] rebellion took place on the coast area in 1725\u20131726, but the largest uprising was by the Yaquis and Mayos from 1740 to 1742 with the goal of expelling the Spaniards. Part of the reason for the rebellion was that the Jesuits, as well as the secular Spaniards, were exploiting the indigenous. This rebellion destroyed the reputation of the Jesuit mission system. Another Seri rebellion occurred in 1748, with Pima and Tohono O\u2019otham support and lasted into the 1750s. This kept the settlement situation in disarray. With population of the Mexican  split half indigenous and half Spanish, about one-quarter of the indigenous population lived in Sonora alone.<ref name=\"hamnett108\">Hamnett, p. 108</ref> In 1767, the king of Spain expelled the Jesuits from Spanish-controlled territories, ending the mission system.<ref name=\"rincones3738\">Gonzalez, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\n===Independence===\nIn 1821, the colonial era in Sonora was ended by the [[Mexican War of Independence]], which started in 1810. Without being directly involved in the war, Sonora became part of an independent Mexico, which allowed for economic development. The former province of ''Sonora, Ostimuri, y Sinaloa'' was divided in 1823 to form the states of Sonora and Sinaloa, with the Sonoran capital in [[Ures]].<ref name=\"rincones38\"/> They were reunited in 1824<ref name=\"turhistoria\"/> but became separate again in 1831, when Sonora wrote its first state constitution, which put the capital in [[Hermosillo]]. In 1832, the capital was moved to [[Arizpe]].<ref name=\"rincones38\"/>\n\nIn 1835, the government of Sonora put a bounty on the [[Apache]] which, over time, evolved into a payment by the government of 100 pesos for each [[Scalping|scalp]] of a male 14 or more years old. [[James L. Haley]] wrote: \"In 1835, Don Ignacio Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, who was the long-time commander of the presidios of northern Sonora, asserted that since 1820 the Apaches had killed at least five thousand settlers, which convinced another four thousand to flee, forced the abandonment of over one hundred settlements, and caused the virtual depopulation of the interior frontier. ... The state of Sonora resorted to paying a bounty on Apache scalps in 1835.\"<ref>James L. Haley (1981). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RAfJwmMeq5IC&pg=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f Apaches: A History and Culture Portrait]''\".

In 1835, a centralist government was instituted based on what were called the ''Bases Constitucionales'' (\"Constitutional Bases\"). They were followed by the ''Siete Leyes Constitucionales'' (\"Seven Constitutional Laws\"), which remained in effect until 1837. But in December of the same year, General [[Jos\u00e9 de Urrea]] proclaimed in Arizpe the re-establishment of the Constitution of 1824, initially supported by then Governor [[Manuel G\u00e1ndara]]. However, for the rest of the century, G\u00e1ndara and succeeding governors would support a centralized government, leading to political instability in the state.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/><ref name=\"rincones38\"/> In 1838, the capital was moved back to Ures.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nThe fertile lands of the Mayo and Yaquis continued to attract outsiders during the 19th century. These were now Mexicans rather than Spaniards, and later in the century, it was a major draw for North Americans.<ref name=\"yetman4\"/> By the end of the 19th century, however, the area received large numbers of immigrants from [[Europe]], especially from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Russia]], the [[Middle East]], mainly [[Lebanon]] or [[Syria]], and even [[China]],<ref name=\"leerob92\">Lee, p. 92</ref> who brought new forms of agriculture, mining, livestock, industrial processes, ironwork, and textiles.<ref name=\"turhistoria\"/>\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War]] resulted in only one major military confrontation between Mexican and United States forces, but its consequences were severe for the state. In October 1847, the warship [[USS Cyane (1837)|USS ''Cyane'']] laid siege to [[Guaymas]] Bay, resulting in United States control of this part of the coast until 1848.<ref name=\"rincones38\"/><ref name=\"acercapuerto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.puertodeguaymas.com/acerca-del-puerto |title= Acerca del puerto |publisher= Administraction Portuaria Integral de Guaymas, SA de C V |location=Guaymas, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=About the Port |accessdate=January 13, 2011}}</ref> When the war ended, Sonora lost 339,370 hectares (13,200 square miles) of its territory to the United States through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Additionally, the war ruined the state's economy.<ref name=\"rincones38\"/> Sonora lost more territory in the 1850s, through the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. Before the war, Sonora was the largest State in Mexico. The State lost more than 29,000 square miles to the United States as a result of the 1853 Gadsden Purchase. The majority of the area is today's Arizona south of the [[Gila River]] and a part of the present-day southwestern New Mexico.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> The area's political vulnerability immediately after the war made it susceptible to buccaneers such as [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]], [[Gaston de Raousset-Boulbon]], and [[Henry Alexander Crabb]], who attacked Sonoran ports such as Guaymas and [[Caborca]]. However, most attacks were repelled.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> The economy did not begin to recover from the war until the late 1850s, when [[Ignacio Pesqueira]] became governor and attracted foreign investment to the state, especially in the mining sector, as well as worked to create markets abroad for agricultural products.<ref name=\"rincones38\"/>\n\nDuring the [[French intervention in Mexico]], Sonora was invaded by French troops as part of the effort to install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as a monarch in Mexico. The port of Guaymas was attacked by forces under Armando Castagny, forcing Mexican forces under Pesqueira and General Patoni to retreat north of the city. French troops attacked the Mexicans again at a place called ''La Pasi\u00f3n'', again resulting in defeat for the Mexican resistance. The French were not defeated in the state until the [[Battle of Llanos de Ures]] in 1866 by Pesqueira, Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Morales and \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez.<ref name=\"turhistoria\"/><ref name=\"rincones39\">Gonzalez, p. 39</ref> Shortly after this, the state's current constitution was written in 1871, and its capital was permanently moved to Hermosillo.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/><ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\n[[File:Cajeme2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cajem\u00e9]], Yaqui resistance leader]]\n\nDuring the regime of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] from the late 19th century to the 20th century, major economic changes occurred. These changes promoted rapid economic growth, which had far-reaching social and political consequences. Sonora and the rest of the northern states rapidly increased in economic importance. Development of a rail system integrated the state's economy into the national, and also allowed greater federal control over all of Mexico's territory. After 1880, this rail system was extended north into the United States, making it an important part of binational economic relations to this day.<ref name=\"hamnett184\">Hamnett, p. 184</ref> However, the changes also permitted foreigners and certain Mexicans to take over very large tracts of land in Mexico. In Sonora, [[Guillermo Andrade]] controlled {{Convert|1,570,000|ha|km2 sqmi}}, [[Manuel Peniche]] and American [[William Cornell Green]] about {{Convert|500,000|ha|km2 sqmi}}. Foreign industry owners also tended to bring in Asian and European workers.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> [[Chinese immigration to Mexico|Chinese immigration]] into Sonora would begin at this time, and the Chinese soon became an economic force as they built small businesses that spread wherever economic development occurred.<ref name=\"leerob8992\">Lee, pp. 89\u201392</ref>\n\nThe appropriation of land for both agriculture and mining placed renewed pressure on the Yaquis and other native peoples of Sonora. Previously, active resistance had given the Yaqui fairly autonomous control of a portion of the state and kept their agricultural system along the Yaqui River. Encroachment on this land led to uprisings and guerilla warfare by the Yaquis after 1887. By 1895, the federal and state governments began to violently repress the Yaquis and forcefully relocate captured Yaquis to the plantations in Mexico's tropical south, especially the [[henequen]] plantations in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. The Yaqui resistance continued into the 20th century, with the expulsions reaching a peak between 1904 and 1908, by which time about one quarter of this population had been deported. Still more were forced to flee into Arizona.<ref name=\"hamnett191\">Hamnett, p. 191</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Cananea.jpg|thumb|The Cananea miners' strike 1906]]\nThe policies of the D\u00edaz government caused resentment not only among the Yaquis, but also throughout the country.<ref name=\"hamnett192\">Hamnett, p. 192</ref> One of the preludes to the [[Mexican Revolution]] was the [[Cananea strike|1906 Cananea miner's strike]]. Approximately 2,000 strikers sought negotiations with American mine owner William Greene, but he refused to meet with them. The strike quickly turned violent when the miners tried to take control of the mine and gunfire was exchanged. Greene requested help from federal troops, but when it was obvious they could not arrive in time, he appealed to the governments of Arizona and Sonora to allow Arizona volunteers to assist him. This increased the scale of the violence. When Mexican federal troops arrived two days later, they put everything to a brutal end, with the suspected leaders of the strike executed. The heavy-handed way in which D\u00edaz had handled the strike made resentment against Diaz grow, with more strikes beginning in other areas.<ref name=\"kirkwood127\">{{cite book |last= Kirkwood |first= Burton |title= History of Mexico |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofmexico00burt |url-access= registration |year=2000 |publisher= Greenwood Press |location= Westport, CT, USA |isbn= 978-1-4039-6258-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmexico00burt/page/127 127]}}</ref><ref name=\"rincones3940\">Gonzalez, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nIn late 1910, the Mexican Revolution began in earnest, and D\u00edaz was quickly deposed. The governor of [[Coahuila]], [[Venustiano Carranza]], sought refuge in Sonora, and became one of the principal political leaders during the rest of the war, with his main base of operations in Hermosillo. A number of the revolutionary leaders who joined Carranza in Sonora did not come from peasant backgrounds, but rather the lower middle class of hacienda-managers, shopkeepers, mill-workers, or schoolteachers, who opposed large-scale landowners and the Porfirian elite.<ref name=\"hamnett220\">Hamnett, p. 220</ref> After D\u00edaz was deposed, Carranza competed for power against [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] and others.<ref name=\"rincones3940\"/> The Yaquis joined with \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n's forces after 1913.<ref name=\"hamnett192\"/>\n\nBy 1920, Carranza had become president of Mexico, but found himself opposed by Obreg\u00f3n and others.

These plains are between {{Convert|50|km|mi}} and {{Convert|120|km|mi}} wide, wedged between the Sierra Madre and the Gulf of California, which began to form between 5.5 and 6 million years ago. Climate patterns bring moisture east from the Pacific Ocean, forming rivers and streams that cross the plains area and empty into the gulf. These rivers have brought down sediment from the volcanic rock of the Sierra Madre and eventually buried most of the mountains and hills of the center of the state, smoothing them into plains.

However, there are plants in flower at one time or another throughout the year.<ref name=\"yetman12\">Yetman, p. 12</ref> Coastal plants receive less water stress due to lower evaporation rates, and substantial moisture from dew, especially in the cooler months.<ref name=\"yetman11\">Yetman, p. 11</ref>\n[[File:Infiernillo Tiburon Island.JPG|thumb|View of Isla Tibur\u00f3n across the Infiernillo Channel]]\nMost forests are located in the northeast of the state, covering about 6.4% of the state. This is the area with the coolest temperatures.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> Deforestation has been a significant problem, especially after 1980, because the rate of cutting trees has increased. In central Sonora, the area covered by [[Madrean evergreen woodland]] and Sonoran Desert scrub decreased 28% and 31%, respectively, between 1973 and 1992 (ValdezZamudio et al. 2000). During this same period,<ref name=\"cartron70\">Cartron, p. 70</ref> For example, much of the forests of [[mesquite]] trees in the lower elevations of the state have disappeared because of the demand for local fuels and the market for mesquite charcoal in Mexico and the United States<ref name=\"cartron64\">Cartron, p. 64</ref>\n\nMost of northern Mexico suffers from one of the world's highest rates of [[desertification]] due to [[land degradation]] in arid and semi arid areas, with the loss of biological and/or economic productivity, but the process is most severe Sonora as neighboring [[Sinaloa]]. Land degradation occurs because of clearing land for agriculture, the planting of non-native buffelgrass for grazing, the cutting of forests, overgrazing of natural vegetation and soil salinization from irrigation. A study by Balling in 1998 showed higher soil and air temperatures in areas that have been overgrazed, deforested and otherwise cleared land, likely due to the lack of shading vegetation, which leads to higher soil evaporation and desert conditions. Studies have also indicated that warming trends are higher in Sonora than in neighboring Arizona, into which the Sonora Desert also extends.<ref name=\"cartron70\"/>\n\nThe state contains 139 species and subspecies of native mammals, with the most important being white tailed deer, [[mule deer]], wild sheep, bats, hares, squirrels, [[mole (animal)|moles]], [[beaver]]s, [[coyote]]s, wolves, foxes, [[jaguar]]s, and [[mountain lion]]s. Amphibians and reptiles include frogs and toads, [[desert tortoise]]s, [[chameleon]]s, [[gila monster]]s, [[rattlesnake]]s and other types of snakes.

This cools the air masses, leading to rain and occasionally snow in the higher elevations. While most of the rain falls in the mountainous areas, much of this water finds its way back to the western coastal plains in the form of rivers and streams that empty into the Gulf of California and fill underground [[aquifer]]s.<ref name=\"yetman15\"/> Most of the year's precipitation falls during the rainy season, which is locally called \u201clas aguas\u201d (the waters). These last from July to mid September, when [[monsoon]] winds bring moist air from southerly tropical waters. Most of this is from the Pacific Ocean west of [[Central America]] but can also come from [[Gulf of Mexico]] as well. This moister flow results in nearly daily afternoon thunderstorms. After the las aguas, there may be additional moisture brought in by hurricanes, which generally move west along the Pacific coast of Mexico and occasionally come inland, especially in southern Sonora. However, these storms tend to drop large quantities of rain in a short time, causing flooding and destruction.<ref name=\"yetman11\"/>\n\nIn the winter, from November to February, there are light rains called ''equipatas'' (\"horse hoofs\", named after the sound the rain makes). These rains come in from the north from the southern extensions of frontal storms that originate in the northern Pacific Ocean. These end by March or April when the fronts are no longer strong enough to reach this far south. They end even earlier in the extreme south of the state as the storm systems retreat, with the dry season lasting eight or nine months in this part of the state. In the north these rains support a wide variety of spring annuals and wildflowers, but the water they supply in the south of the state is still important to help replenish wells.<ref name=\"yetman11\"/>\n\n===Hydrology===\n[[File:ColoradoRiverDelta ISS009-E-09839.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo of the [[Colorado River delta]] in Sonora]]\nWith the exception of the [[Colorado River]], river and aquifer systems in Sonora are a result of rains from incoming clouds rising above the Sierra Madre Occidental.

From east to west these at [[Agua Prieta]], [[Naco, Sonora|Naco]], Nogales, [[Sasabe Port of Entry|Sasabe]], [[Sonoyta]] and [[San Luis R\u00edo Colorado]].

Interaction between the peoples on both sides is a part of both the culture and the economy. In the 1980s, an international [[volleyball]] game was regularly held near Naco, with the chain link border fence serving as the net. Much of Arizona and Sonora share a cuisine based on the wheat, cheese and beef that was introduced to the region by the Spaniards, with wheat [[tortilla]]s being especially large on both sides of the border. This diet is reinforced by the vaquero/cowboy tradition which continues in both states.<ref name=\"griffith\"/> The six border crossings are essential to the existence and extent of the communities that surround them, as most of them function as ports for the passage of goods between the two countries.<ref name=\"eller\">{{cite web |url= http://ebr.eller.arizona.edu/arizona_border_region/AZ_demographic.asp |title= Arizona-Sonora Region \u2013 Population |publisher= Eller College of Management University of Arizona  |year=2011 |location=Tucson, AZ |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> People regularly shop and work on the other side, taking advantage of opportunities there.<ref name=\"griffith\"/> The economic opportunities of the border are not equal on both sides. Most of the population along this border lives on the Sonoran side, many of which have moved here for the opportunities created by the maquiladoras and other businesses. These are lacking on the Arizona side.<ref name=\"eller\"/>\n\nThe border has separated the region's indigenous populations, such as the [[Tohono O\u2019odham]]. While members of the Tohono O\u2019odham have special border crossing privileges, these have become endangered as Mexican farmers encroach on tribal lands in Sonora, which are vulnerable to drug smugglers. Yaquis in Arizona travel south to the [[Yaqui River]] area for festival, especially [[Holy Week in Mexico|Holy Week]], and Yaquis travel north to Arizona for cultural reasons as well. When [[Father Kino]] arrived in this area, he named much of it the Pimer\u00eda Alta, as Pima territory extends from the highlands of eastern Sonora up towards [[Tucson]].<ref name=\"griffith\"/>\n\nAuthorities on each side work to keep out from the other that which is undesirable. For the United States, this mostly involves drugs and illegal immigrants. For Mexico, this mostly involves struggling against the importation of untaxed goods, especially automobiles. Smuggling people and drugs into the United States is big business in Mexico, but while it affects everyone living on the border, it is generally not seen, except for occasional newspaper headlines, occasional violent crime and religious articles geared to those in the trade. Illegal crossings taking place through tunnels, hidden cars and trucks or most commonly, simply passing through a gap in the fence, especially in the more remote areas. In 1990, a tunnel linking two warehouses in Agua Prieta and [[Douglas, AZ]] was discovered. It was sophisticated with hydraulic equipment and means to move large quantities of goods. At least three [[corrido]]s have been written about this tunnel.<ref name=\"griffith\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote =\n|1895<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/subspop/mx-pop.aspx |title=Mexico: extended population list |publisher=GeoHive |accessdate=2011-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311141056/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/subspop/mx-pop.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-11 }}</ref> | 192721\n|1900 | 221682\n|1910 | 265383\n|1921 | 275127\n|1930 | 316271\n|1940 | 364176\n|1950 | 510607\n|1960 | 783378\n|1970 | 1098720\n|1980 | 1513731\n|1990 | 1823606\n|1995 | 2085536 \n|2000 |  2216969\n|2005 | 2394861\n|2010 | 2662480 \n|2015<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic_2015_presentacion.pdf |title=Encuesta Intercensal 2015 |publisher=INEGI |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> | 2850330\n}}\n\n===General population===\n[[File:Farlninios01.jpg|thumb|Sonoran children visiting the Office of Sonora State Deputy]]\nEconomic growth in the state since the [[Mexican Revolution]] has led to steady population growth.

This includes non-traditional crops such as fruits, nuts and winter vegetables such as tomatoes, especially since [[NAFTA]].<ref name=\"cartron59\"/>\n\nIrrigation is essential for reliable agriculture on the coastal lowlands of the state,<ref name=\"yetman7\">Yetman, p. 7</ref> and large scale irrigation infrastruction is needed for large scale production. After the [[Mexican Revolution]], the federal government took control of Sonora's irrigation infrastructure and after [[World War II]], began extensive dam and reservoir construction. From the 1940s to the 1970s, advanced in agricultural techniques were pioneered by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) based in [[Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n]]. This combined new varieties of wheat, with irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides to greatly increase production. Mexico went from a wheat importer in the 1940s to a wheat exporter in the 1960s.<ref name=\"cartron59\"/>\n\nHowever, such intensive agriculture in such an arid area has had a significant negative impact on water supplies. Eighty-eight percent of all water taken from above and below the surface is used for agriculture. One third of [[aquifer]]s are overdrafted, especially in [[Caborca]], [[Guaymas]], and the coast near [[Hermosillo]].<ref name=\"randall347\">{{cite book |editor1-first= Laura |editor1-last= Randall |title= Changing Structure of Mexico : Political, Social, and Economic Prospects |year=2006 |publisher= M.E.

For this reason, the area under cultivation dropped by more than 24% during the last quarter of the 20th century.<ref name=\"cartron59\"/>\n\nThe state still maintains its traditional livestock industry, especially in beef cattle, which has a national reputation for quality. In 2001, the state produced 1,477,686 heads of cattle, 1,229,297 pigs, 38,933 sheep, 33,033 goats, 83,260 horses and 11,988,552 heads of domestic fowl.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> The availability of relatively inexpensive semiarid land, along with proximity to United States markets, concentrates livestock production in Sonora and other northern states.<ref name=\"cartron60\">Cartron, p. 60</ref>\n\n===Fishing===\nSonora is a major producer of seafood in Mexico with a developed fishing infrastructure.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> The Gulf of California contains a large quantity of fish and shellfish, but major fishing did not begin in Sonora and neighboring [[Sinaloa]] until the mid 20th century.

Two species which have been particularly hard hit are sharks and [[manta ray]]s. In addition, shrimp trawling catches a large amount of non target species, which are discarded, and have destroyed large areas of the Gulf's seafloor. All this has led to rapidly declining harvests.<ref name=\"cartron67\"/>\n\n===Industry and mining===\n[[File:Cananea mine.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of mines in Cananea]]\nMost of the industry of the state is related to agriculture and fishing, in food processing and packing.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> In the 1980s, the state gained a large number of industrial plants called \"[[maquiladora]]s\", mostly situated along the border and in the capital of [[Hermosillo]].<ref name=\"actecon\"/> These are assembly plants run by mostly United States companies, which have certain duty and tax breaks. By the end of the 20th century, these enterprises had a large influence on the expansion and modernization of the border area, including Sonora. They not only introduced new sources of employment, their United States management styles have had influence on business in the state and the rest of the north. However, maquiladoras peaked in 2001, and now many United States companies are moving production facilities to China. The number of maquiladoras has declined, but the value of their output has increased as those that remain shift to higher value-added goods and automation. In addition, many of the plants abandoned by United States companies have been taken over by Mexican firms. Despite the decline of maquiladoras, exports from them have risen 40%.<ref name=\"malat28\">{{cite book |editor1-first= Randy |editor1-last= Malat |others= Szerlip, Barbara (Editor). |title= Passport Mexico : Your Pocket Guide to Mexican Business, Customs and Etiquette (3rd Edition) |year= 2008 |publisher= World Trade Press |location= Petaluma, CA, USA |isbn= 978-1-885073-91-4 |page= [https://archive.org/details/passportmexicoyo0000mala/page/28 28] |url= https://archive.org/details/passportmexicoyo0000mala/page/28 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to livestock, mining is another traditional element of Sonora's economy, beginning with a major find near the city of [[\u00c1lamos]]. While the silver of that area has mostly been depleted, Sonora still plays a large part in Mexico's standing as one of the top fifteen producers of minerals in the world, leading in silver, [[celestite]] and [[bismuth]]. Sonora is the leading producer of gold, copper, [[graphite]], [[molybdenum]], and [[wollastonite]]. There are still deposits of silver in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Sonora also has one of the largest coal reserves in the country.<ref name=\"cartron56\">Cartron, p. 56</ref> The state has the largest mining surface in Mexico,<ref name=\"cartron56\"/> and three of the country's largest mines: La Caridad, Cananea and Mineria Mar\u00eda.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the government forced out most foreign interests in Mexican mining, beginning with the increasing restriction of ownership in Mexican mining companies.<ref name=\"cartron56\"/> These restrictions were relaxed starting in 1992, with the only restriction that the operating company be Mexican. Within three years of the change, more than seventy foreign companies, mostly United States and Canadian enterprises, opened offices in Hermosillo.<ref name=\"cartron57\"/>\n\nMajor mining operations have had severe environmental impact, especially in the areas surrounding it, with Cananea as the primary example. Mining has been functioning here for over a century, with mining and smelter wastes polluting the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro]] and [[Sonora River]]s near the mine, threatening both watersheds. Mining operations also destroy nearby forests due to the demand for building materials and fuel. Few old trees stand near the city of [[Cananea]] and the town of [[San Javier, Sonora|San Javier]] in central Sonora.<ref name=\"cartron57\"/>\n\n===Tourism===\nBusiness and leisure visitors to the state primarily come from Mexico (over 60%), with the majority of foreign visitors coming from the United States, especially the states of Arizona, California and New Mexico. The four most important destinations in the state for leisure and business travelers include [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]], [[Hermosillo]], [[Guaymas]] and [[Puerto Pe\u00f1asco]], with beach destinations preferred by most leisure travelers. One advantage that Sonora has is its proximity to the United States, from which come most of the world's travelers. In second place are tourists from Canada, many of whom visit as part of cruises. United States tourists mostly visit Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, [[San Carlos Nuevo Guaymas|San Carlos]] and Navajoa and prefer areas they consider friendly, with no \u201canti-U.S.\u201d sentiment. Leisure visitors from the United States tend to be between 40 and 65 years of age, married or in a relationship, educated at the university level or higher, with about thirty days of vacation time, and they and primarily research travel options on the Internet. Most visit to relax and experience another culture. Most domestic visitors also use the Internet, with about half having a university education or higher and about half are married or with a partner. Most domestic visitors are on vacation with their families. The busiest domestic travel times are [[Holy Week]], summer and Christmas, with the overall busiest months being January, April, July, August and December.<ref name=\"sustenible\">{{Cite report |title= Plan Estrat\u00e9gico de Desarrollo Tur\u00edstico Sustenible del Estado de Sonora |url=http://www.sonoraturismo.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/Plan-Estrategico-de-Desarrollo-Turistico-Sustentable-del-Estado-de-Sonora.pdf |author= Gobierno del Estado de Sonora, Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo de Contenidos and Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey |publisher=2010\u20132015 |accessdate=February 15, 2011 |docket=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the state received more than seven million visitors, who spent more than 20 billion pesos to the economy.

Just over half of tourists in the state arrive to their destinations by private automobile, followed by airplane and commercial bus.<ref name=\"sustenible\"/>\n\nDuring the 2000s, Sonora has increased its tourism infrastructure. In the last half of the 2000s, Sonora has increased its network of highways from {{Convert|3,600|km|mi}} to {{Convert|4,500|km|mi}}, accounting for 6.7% of all highways in Mexico. It ranks second in four-lane highways, surpassed only by Chihuahua. From 2003 to 2009 the number of hotels in the state has increased from 321 to 410 and the number of rooms from 13,226 to 15,806, over 20%. Most of these hotels and rooms are in Hermosillo (57 hotels/3232 rooms) followed by Puerto Pe\u00f1asco (40/3158), [[Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n]] (41/1671), Guaymas/San Carlos (28/1590), Nogales (24/1185), Navojoa (15/637) and [[Magdalena de Kino]] (10/284).<ref name=\"sustenible\"/> The cities of Hermosillo, Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n, Guaymas, Nogales, [[San Luis R\u00edo Colorado]], Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, [[Bah\u00eda Kino]] and [[\u00c1lamos]] all have 5-star hotels.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> There are 2,577 restaurants in the state with 1288 in Hermosillo.<ref name=\"sustenible\"/>\n\nHotel occupation went from 45% in 2003 to 57.7% in 2006 but dropped to 36% in 2009. The state's tourism suffered in 2008 and 2009, mostly due to the economic downturn and the [[H1N1]] \"swine flu\" influenza crisis, which brought hotel occupancy rates down about 30%.<ref name=\"sustenible\"/>\n\nSonora's major tourist attraction is its beaches, especially San Carlos, Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, Bah\u00eda Kino and the Gulf of Santa Clara in San Luis R\u00edo Colorado.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> San Carlos has a large variety of sea life off its shores, making it popular for sports fishing and scuba diving. One of its main attractions is the Playa de los Algodones, called such because its sand dunes look like cotton balls. On one of hills behind it, there is a lookout point which allows for views of the area. A number of Yaquis, Seris and Guaimas on and around the Tetakawi Hill, making a living from fishing. Puerto Pe\u00f1asco has recently experienced large scale development along its {{Convert|110|km|mi}} of beaches, which have calm seas. It is located extreme northwest of the state. Some of the available activities include jet skiing, boating, sailing, sports fishing, scuba diving and snorkeling. It is located near [[Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve|El Pinacate biosphere reserve]]. There is also an aquarium called the [[Acuario de Cer-Mar]], which is a research center open to the public. The aquarium has a number of species such as marine turtles, octopus, [[seahorse]]s and many varieties of fish. Bah\u00eda Kino is named after the Jesuit missionary, who visited the area in the 17th century. In the 1930s, a group of fishermen established a village in what is now known as Kino Viejo. This bay's beaches have white sand, with warm calm waters off of them. For this reason, Kino Viejo calls itself ''la perla del Mar de Cort\u00e9s'' (the pearl of the Gulf of California). Available activities include horseback riding, scuba diving and sports fishing. The [[Isla Tibur\u00f3n]] is {{Convert|28|km|mi}} from Bahia Kino in the Gulf of California. It is the largest island of Mexico, measuring {{Convert|50|by|20|km|mi}}. It has been declared an ecological reserve to protect its flora and fauna, such as the wild rams and deer that live here.<ref name=\"79playas\"/>\n[[File:Cocospera2-1-.jpg|thumb|Mission at Coc\u00f3spera founded by Padre Kino]]\n\nTo enhance tourism in areas away from the primary beaches, the state of Sonora has set up several tourist routes for promotion as well as gained \"[[Pueblo M\u00e1gico]]\" status for one of its smaller cities. The Ruta de las Missiones (\"Missions Route\") covers the principle stops of [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Eusebio Kino]], as the worked to establish the many religious institutions which are part of the state's identity.

Counting traffic going both north and south, the Nogales port handles about three quarters of all border crossing between Sonora and Arizona. Nogales is a major port of entry for Mexican agricultural products heading to the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"redesigning\">{{cite news |title= Arizona Studies Options for Redesigning Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales |first=Paola |last=Banchero |newspaper= Knight Ridder Tribune Business News |date=March 1, 2002 |page=1}}</ref> In 2005, 268,163 commercial trucks moved through the port, up from 242,435 in 2004,<ref name=\"clogged\"/> handling about 7.6% of all United States-Mexico truck traffic. Most of the merchandise that passes through Sonora on its way to the United States winds up in western states such as Arizona, [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]], as well as into Canada.<ref name=\"redesigning\"/>\n\nThe volume of traffic, along with new security measures which have been put into place since 2001, create traffic jams of trucks and other vehicles, especially during the winter when demand for products grown in Mexico's warm climates peaks. These jams can result in lines about eight miles long. For trucks moving into Sonora and south, inspection stations at [[V\u00edcam]] and near the Sinaloa border also cause delays. Delays in shipping causes more produce to rot before it can get to the consumer.<ref name=\"clogged\"/>\n\nThe last reason for the importance of the border is the [[maquiladora]] industries, which have made areas such as Nogales grow significantly.<ref name=\"freetrade\"/> Many of Sonora's incoming migrants from other parts of Mexico come to work at these factories.<ref name=\"cartron52\"/>\n\n===Handcrafts===\n[[File:MAPElNorte026.JPG|thumb|Corita basket on display at the [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City]] ]]\nThere are a number of different crafts made in the state, which are often distinguished by the use of certain materials and of certain designs. The best known of these is the [[Mexican ironwood carvings|carving of figures from ironwood (''palo fierro'' in Spanish)]], which is a very dense, almost black wood that sinks in water. This wood was often used in braziers in the past because it would burn for a very long time. This carving is the specialty of the [[Yaqui people|Yaquis]] and the [[Seri people|Seris]]. Before it can be carved, this wood must be dried thoroughly, a process that can take up to five years. If this is not done, the wood takes on an [[ochre]] color, rather than its characteristic shiny near black. Objects made from this wood are almost always decorative in nature in a wide variety of shapes such as sahuaro and other cacti, eagles, turtles, dolphins and other flora and fauna of the state, along with crosses. The last is popular among indigenous groups as it is believed that such guard against the envy of others and other ills. Objects made of this wood are very much in demand on the international market, but indigenous craftsmen cannot compete with factory made pieces.<ref name=\"rincones4849\">Gonzalez, pp. 48\u201349</ref>\n\nThe higher elevations of the state and riverbanks contain large quantities of trees. [[Aconchi]] is one of the villages of the state with a well-established tradition of making furniture, with almost forty workshops. Many of these are in rustic or colonial style. In [[Arizpe]] and [[\u00c1lamos]], they specialize in a type of chair made by bending and combining long flexible branches of willow and \u201cgu\u00e1sima\u201d ([[Guazuma ulmifolia]]) In the town of [[Tubutama]], they make clocks of [[mesquite]] wood.<ref name=\"rincones49\">Gonzalez, p. 49</ref>\n[[Basketmaking]] is still widely practiced in the state, with hand made wares available in local markets such as in [[Bah\u00eda Kino]], [[Punta Chueca]] and [[El Desemboque]]. Those made near the ocean often have marine designs. Baskets made of reeds are made in [[Ures]] along with hats. In Aconchi, palm fronds are used to make hats and baskets called guaris, used for food storage. In various locations, a basket variety called \u201c[[corita (basket)|caritas]]\" are made in a globe shape and have a lid. This is a specialty of the Seris. These are typically made by women, with small baskets taking a month to make. Larger ones can take up to two years. Most coritas are bought by foreigners as the work needed to create them makes them expensive.<ref name=\"rincones49\"/>\n\nLeather goods such as belts, shoes, jackets, wallets and more in made in locations such as [[N\u00e1cori Chico]], [[Moctezuma, Sonora|Moctezuma]], [[Pitiquito]], [[Bacoachi]], [[Ban\u00e1michi]], [[Hu\u00e1sbas]], [[Arivechi]] and [[Ures]]. This craft is a result of the state's history of cattle ranching. The mining industry gave rise to the working of metals, especially copper in [[Cananea]]. Items include pots, pans, plates and decorative items. [[\u00c1lamos]] is known for items made in brass and wrought iron.<ref name=\"rincones50\">Gonzalez, p. 50</ref>\nJewelry such as necklaces, bracelets and earrings are often made using materials from the sea such as various types of shells and spines from marine animals. This is a specialty in [[Puerto Pe\u00f1asco]] and of the Seris. The latter also use materials such as the tails of [[rattlesnake]]s and animal teeth. Some of the Seris\u2019 best work is located in a museum in Bahia Kino. There is also jewelry, especially necklaces made with various seeds, small twigs and river stones. In [[Oquitoa]], they made ceremonial crowns of glass in various colors. These are most often used to decorate the tombs of loved ones on [[Day of the Dead]]. The Yaquis make unique belts using the paws of deer as well as elaborate masks for ceremonies. However, these people generally do not commercialize their wares, with the exception of cloth dolls in local markets.<ref name=\"rincones\">Gonzalez, pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\n==Media==\n[[List of newspapers in Mexico|Newspapers]] of Sonora include: ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Agua Prieta'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Caborca'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Hermosillo'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Magdalena'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Nogales'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Puerto Pe\u00f1asco'', ''El Imparcial'', ''El Informador del Mayo'', ''Entorno Informativo'', ''Expreso Hermosillo'', ''La I Noticias para Mi Hermosillo'', ''La Voz del Puerto'', ''Tribuna (Sonora)'', and ''Tribuna de San Luis.''<ref name=SIC>{{cite web |work=Sistema de Informaci\u00f3n Cultural |publisher=Gobierno de Mexico |language=es |accessdate= March 11, 2020 |url= https://sic.gob.mx/?table=impresos&disciplina=&estado_id=26 |title= Publicaciones peri\u00f3dicas en Sonora }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://libguides.utsa.edu/latamnews |title=Latin American & Mexican Online News |work=Research Guides |publisher=[[University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries]] |location=US |archivedate= March 7, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307192643/http://libguides.utsa.edu/latamnews }}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nThe most prolific art of the state is literature, which includes poetry, novels, plays and essays.

Today, most are employed in industry and tourism, but the dress and folklore of the ''vaquero'' is still important. Jeans and cowboy hats are still extremely popular, especially with men.

Lyrics most often deal with the important moments of everyday life which are celebrated and embellished. Only recently has ''norte\u00f1o'' music been accepted by social classes outside those with which it developed.

Sonora is considered a cultural zone separate from [[Mesoamerica]], although there may have been some Mesoamerican influence. The major differences between Sonoran cultures and Mesoamerica include dry climate farming, although the same basics of corn, squash and beans are produced. There is also a heavier reliance on wild resources. More important was the lack of true cities during this area's prehispanic history, with small settlements clustered around water sources and weak hierarchical systems. The cultures here also share some traits with those of the United States Southwest, but are distinct from these as well.<ref name=\"gorenstein241242\">Foster, pp. 241\u2013242</ref>\n\nThe [[Cerro de Trincheras]] (\"Trench Hill\") is an archeological site, with [[petroglyph]]s, plazas and astronomical observatories. The exact purpose of the area has been disputed, but the area reached its height between 1300 and 1450 CE, when it had population of about 1,000, which made its living growing corn, squash, cotton and [[agave]]. Its largest structure is called La Cancha (\"The Ballcourt\"), which is at the base of the north side of the hill. It is a rectangular patio marked by rocks piled on its edges, measuring {{convert|51|by|13|m|ft}}. Some researchers believe it was some kind of [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ball court]] and others believe it was a kind of open air theater. On the hill itself is an observatory, which gives views of the area. Most of the area's artifacts of stone and shell were found here. The Plaza de Caracol (Snail Plaza) is marked by a meter and a half high stone wall in an open spiral, most likely used for ceremonies.<ref name=\"mexdesholbox\">{{cite journal |date=March 2010 |title= La Trinchera de los Dioses |trans-title=The Trench of the Gods |journal= Mexico Desconocido |pages=82\u201387 |location=Mexico City |publisher= Impresiones Aereas SA de CV |issn=1870-9397 |editor1-first= Beatriz |editor1-last= 397 Quintanar Hinojosa |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Gastronomy===\n[[File:IMG 0558-746804.jpg|thumb|A very large flour tortilla made in Sonora]]\nAs in other parts of Mexico, Sonoran cuisine is basically a mixture of indigenous and Spanish influences. When the Spaniards moved north from the Mexico City area, they found that the diet of the area was simpler, with the basics of corn, beans and squash, but without the further variety as existed in the lusher south. The Spaniards had a great impact on how the diet of the region. They brought European staples of wheat, beef, dairy products, pork and more, as well as dishes and ingredients from the center and south of Mexico, such as [[tortilla]]s, more varieties of [[chile pepper]]s and [[tamale]]s.<ref name=\"jamison46\">{{cite book |title=The Border Cookbook |url=https://archive.org/details/bordercookbookau00jami |url-access=registration |last=Jamison |first=Cheryl Alters |author2=Bill Jamison  |year=1995 |publisher=The Harvard Common Press |location=Boston, MA |isbn=1-55832-102-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bordercookbookau00jami/page/4 4\u20136]}}</ref> The cowboy/''vaquero'' culture has been an important aspect of Sonora's culture since the colonial period and much of the cuisine is based on what cowboys ate on the range, even though most Sonorans no longer work outdoors.<ref name=\"jamison9\"/> Sonoran cuisine is not limited to the present state.

[[Machaca]], or ''[[carne seca]]'', is still enjoyed, although refrigeration has eliminated the need to dry meat. Sonora also has a reputation for producing fine cuts of beef, but the lean Spanish cattle of the colonial period have been replaced by [[Angus cattle|Angus]], [[Hereford (cattle)|Herefords]] and [[Holstein cattle|Holsteins]].

It is divided into [[Municipalities of Sonora|72 municipalities]]; the capital city is [[Hermosillo]].\nSonora is bordered by the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] to the east, [[Baja California]] to the northwest and [[Sinaloa]] to the south. To the north, it shares the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S.\u2013Mexico border]] primarily with the state of [[Arizona]] with a small length with [[New Mexico]], and on the west has a significant share of the coastline of the [[Gulf of California]].\n\nSonora's natural geography is divided into three parts: the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] in the east of the state; plains and rolling hills in the center; and the coast on the Gulf of California. It is primarily arid or semiarid deserts and grasslands, with only the highest elevations having sufficient rainfall to support other types of vegetation.\n\nSonora is home to eight indigenous peoples, including the [[Mayo people|Mayo]], the [[O\u2019odham]], the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]], and [[Seri people|Seri]]. It has been economically important for its agriculture, livestock (especially beef), and mining since the colonial period, and for its status as a border state since the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. With the [[Gadsden Purchase]], Sonora lost more than a quarter of its territory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sonora, Navojoa |url=http://modulodeplaneacionestrategica.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/sonora-navojoa.pdf|publisher=Modulo de Planeacion Estrategica |accessdate=April 7, 2010}}</ref> From the 20th century to the present, industry, tourism, and [[agribusiness]] have dominated the economy, attracting migration from other parts of Mexico.\n\n==Etymology==\nSeveral theories exist as to the origin of the name \"Sonora\". One theory states that the name was derived from ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora'', the name given to the territory when Diego de Guzm\u00e1n crossed the [[Yaqui River]] on the day of ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario'' (\"[[Our Lady of the Rosary]]\"), which falls on {{nowrap|October 7}} with the pronunciation possibly changing because none of the indigenous languages of the area have the ''\u00f1'' sound. Another theory states that [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]] and his companions, who had wrecked off the Florida coast and made their way across the continent, were forced to cross the arid state from north to south, carrying an image of ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Angustias'' (\"Our Lady of Anguish\") on a cloth. They encountered the [[Opata people|Opata]], who could not pronounce ''Se\u00f1ora'', instead saying ''Senora'' or ''Sonora''. A third theory, written by Father Crist\u00f3bal de Ca\u00f1as in 1730, states that the name comes from the word for a natural water well, ''sonot'', which the Spaniards eventually modified to \"''Sonora''\".  The first record of the name Sonora comes from explorer [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]], who passed through the state in 1540 and called part of the area the ''Valle de la Sonora''. [[Francisco de Ibarra]] also traveled through the area in 1567 and referred to the ''Valles de Se\u00f1ora''.<ref name=\"nomenclatura\">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_sonora |title= Nomenclatura |year=2010 |work= Enciclopedia de Los Municipios y Delegaciones de M\u00e9xico Estado de Sonora |publisher= Instituto para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Nomenclature |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> The literal meaning of \"sonora\" in Spanish is \"sonorous\" or \"loud.\"\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Sonora}}\n\n===Pre-Hispanic period===\n[[File:Knight Gomphotherium.jpg|thumb|[[Gomphothere]]s (reconstructed) were hunted in Sonora by ancient Clovis hunters.]]\n\nEvidence of human existence in the state dates back over 10,000 years, with some of the best-known remains at the [[San Dieguito Complex]] in the [[El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve|El Pinacate Desert]].

Remains of ceramics have been found dating from {{nowrap|750 CE}} with diversification from 800 and {{nowrap|1300 CE}}<ref name=\"gorenstein242\"/> Between 1100 and 1350, the region had socially complex small villages with well-developed trade networks. The lowland central coast, however, seems never truly to have adopted agriculture.<ref name=\"gorenstein243\"/> Because Sonora and much of the northwest does not share many of the cultural traits of that area, it is not considered part of [[Mesoamerica]]. Though evidence exists of trade between the peoples of Sonora and Mesoamerica, [[Guasave, Sinaloa|Guasave]] in [[Sinaloa]] is  the most north-westerly point considered Mesoamerican.<ref name=\"gorenstein150\">Foster, p. 150</ref>\n\nThree archaeological cultures developed in the low, flat areas of the state near the coast: the [[Trincheras tradition]], the [[Huatabampo tradition]], and the [[Central Coast tradition]]. The Trincheras tradition is dated to between 750 and 1450 CE and mostly known from sites in the Altar, Magdalena, and Concepci\u00f3n valleys, but its range extended from the Gulf of California into northern Sonora. The tradition is named after trenches found in a number of sites, the best known of which is the Cerro de Trincheras. The Huatabampo tradition is centered south of the Trincheras along the coast, with sites along extinct lagoons, estuaries, and river valleys. This tradition has a distinctive ceramic complex. Huatabampo culture shows similarities with the [[Chametla]] to the south and the [[Hohokam]] to the north. This probably ended around 1000&nbsp;CE. Unlike the other two traditions, the Central Coast remained a hunter-gatherer culture, as the area lacks the resources for agriculture.<ref name=\"gorenstein18\">Foster, p. 18</ref>\n\nThe higher elevations of the state were dominated by the [[Casas Grandes]] and [[R\u00edo Sonora tradition]]. The R\u00edo Sonora culture is located in central Sonora from the border area to modern Sinaloa. A beginning date for this culture has not been determined but it probably disappeared by the early 14th century. The Casas Grandes tradition in Sonora was an extension of the R\u00edo Sonora tradition based in the modern state of Chihuahua, which exterted its influence down to parts of the Sonoran coast.<ref name=\"gorenstein19\">Foster, p. 19</ref><ref name=\"gorenstein251\">Foster, p. 251</ref>\n\nClimatic changes in the middle of the 15th century resulted in the increased [[desertification]] of northwest Mexico in general. This is the probable cause for the drastic decrease in the number and size of settlements starting around this time.

Originally, these missionaries worked out a peaceful compromise with the 30,000 Yaquis allowing for the establishment of more than fifty mission settlements in the Sonora river valleys. This broke down when the Jesuits opposed the native [[shaman]]ic religious tradition. The Opata were more receptive to the missionaries and allied with them. After this, the Jesuits began to move into [[Pima people|Pima]] and [[Tohono O'odham]] territories.<ref name=\"hamnett105\"/> Spanish exploration and missionary work was sufficient to consider the territory part of [[New Spain]].

He began his first mission at Cucurpe, then established churches and missions in other villages such as [[Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert|Los Remedios, Imuris, Magdalena, Coc\u00f3spera, San Ignacio, Tubutama and Caborca]]. To develop an economy for the natives, Father Kino also taught them European farming techniques.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/><ref name=\"rincones38\">Gonzalez, p. 38</ref>\n\nThe initial attraction of Sonora for the Spaniards was its fertile farmlands along the river valleys<ref name=\"yetman4\"/> and its position as part of a corridor linking the central Mexican highlands around [[Mexico City]] up the Pacific coast and on into Arizona and points north. This corridor still exists in the form of [[Mexican Federal Highway 15|Federal Highway 15]].<ref name=\"gorenstein139\">Foster, p. 139</ref> After the establishment of the mission system, Spanish colonists followed. Indigenous response was a mixture of accommodation and violence, as different strategies were employed by different groups at different times. The sporadic violence, which would continue throughout the colonial period, resulted in the Spanish building [[presidio]]s and other fortifications to protect missions and Spanish settlements.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/><ref name=\"hamnett105\"/> While the colonization process was not especially violent, the impact on the indigenous of the area was severe, as it almost completely disrupted their formerly very independent lives, forcing them to conform to an alien centralized system. One consequence of this was alcoholism among the native peoples.<ref name=\"rincones37\"/>\n\nIn 1691, what are now the states of Sonora and Sinaloa were joined into an entity called the ''Provincias de Sonora, Ostimuri, y Sinaloa''. They would remain as such through the rest of the colonial period until 1823.<ref name=\"rincones38\"/> At this time, about 1,300 Spanish settlers were in the area.<ref name=\"hamnett107\">Hamnett, p. 107</ref> Colonization increased in the 18th century, especially from 1700 to 1767, when mineral deposits were discovered, especially in [[\u00c1lamos]]. This led to the establishment of a number of royally controlled mining camps, forcing many natives off their agricultural lands. Loss of said lands along the [[Yaqui River|Yaqui]] and [[Mayo River (Mexico)|Mayo River]]s led to native uprisings during this time.<ref name=\"rincones37\"/> A major [[Seri people|Seri]] rebellion took place on the coast area in 1725\u20131726, but the largest uprising was by the Yaquis and Mayos from 1740 to 1742 with the goal of expelling the Spaniards. Part of the reason for the rebellion was that the Jesuits, as well as the secular Spaniards, were exploiting the indigenous. This rebellion destroyed the reputation of the Jesuit mission system. Another Seri rebellion occurred in 1748, with Pima and Tohono O\u2019otham support and lasted into the 1750s. This kept the settlement situation in disarray. With population of the Mexican  split half indigenous and half Spanish, about one-quarter of the indigenous population lived in Sonora alone.<ref name=\"hamnett108\">Hamnett, p. 108</ref> In 1767, the king of Spain expelled the Jesuits from Spanish-controlled territories, ending the mission system.<ref name=\"rincones3738\">Gonzalez, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\n===Independence===\nIn 1821, the colonial era in Sonora was ended by the [[Mexican War of Independence]], which started in 1810. Without being directly involved in the war, Sonora became part of an independent Mexico, which allowed for economic development. The former province of ''Sonora, Ostimuri, y Sinaloa'' was divided in 1823 to form the states of Sonora and Sinaloa, with the Sonoran capital in [[Ures]].<ref name=\"rincones38\"/> They were reunited in 1824<ref name=\"turhistoria\"/> but became separate again in 1831, when Sonora wrote its first state constitution, which put the capital in [[Hermosillo]]. In 1832, the capital was moved to [[Arizpe]].<ref name=\"rincones38\"/>\n\nIn 1835, the government of Sonora put a bounty on the [[Apache]] which, over time, evolved into a payment by the government of 100 pesos for each [[Scalping|scalp]] of a male 14 or more years old. [[James L. Haley]] wrote: \"In 1835, Don Ignacio Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, who was the long-time commander of the presidios of northern Sonora, asserted that since 1820 the Apaches had killed at least five thousand settlers, which convinced another four thousand to flee, forced the abandonment of over one hundred settlements, and caused the virtual depopulation of the interior frontier. ... The state of Sonora resorted to paying a bounty on Apache scalps in 1835.\"<ref>James L. Haley (1981). \"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RAfJwmMeq5IC&pg=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f Apaches: A History and Culture Portrait]''\".

In 1835, a centralist government was instituted based on what were called the ''Bases Constitucionales'' (\"Constitutional Bases\"). They were followed by the ''Siete Leyes Constitucionales'' (\"Seven Constitutional Laws\"), which remained in effect until 1837. But in December of the same year, General [[Jos\u00e9 de Urrea]] proclaimed in Arizpe the re-establishment of the Constitution of 1824, initially supported by then Governor [[Manuel G\u00e1ndara]]. However, for the rest of the century, G\u00e1ndara and succeeding governors would support a centralized government, leading to political instability in the state.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/><ref name=\"rincones38\"/> In 1838, the capital was moved back to Ures.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/>\n\nThe fertile lands of the Mayo and Yaquis continued to attract outsiders during the 19th century. These were now Mexicans rather than Spaniards, and later in the century, it was a major draw for North Americans.<ref name=\"yetman4\"/> By the end of the 19th century, however, the area received large numbers of immigrants from [[Europe]], especially from [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Russia]], the [[Middle East]], mainly [[Lebanon]] or [[Syria]], and even [[China]],<ref name=\"leerob92\">Lee, p. 92</ref> who brought new forms of agriculture, mining, livestock, industrial processes, ironwork, and textiles.<ref name=\"turhistoria\"/>\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War]] resulted in only one major military confrontation between Mexican and United States forces, but its consequences were severe for the state. In October 1847, the warship [[USS Cyane (1837)|USS ''Cyane'']] laid siege to [[Guaymas]] Bay, resulting in United States control of this part of the coast until 1848.<ref name=\"rincones38\"/><ref name=\"acercapuerto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.puertodeguaymas.com/acerca-del-puerto |title= Acerca del puerto |publisher= Administraction Portuaria Integral de Guaymas, SA de C V |location=Guaymas, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=About the Port |accessdate=January 13, 2011}}</ref> When the war ended, Sonora lost 339,370 hectares (13,200 square miles) of its territory to the United States through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Additionally, the war ruined the state's economy.<ref name=\"rincones38\"/> Sonora lost more territory in the 1850s, through the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. Before the war, Sonora was the largest State in Mexico. The State lost more than 29,000 square miles to the United States as a result of the 1853 Gadsden Purchase. The majority of the area is today's Arizona south of the [[Gila River]] and a part of the present-day southwestern New Mexico.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> The area's political vulnerability immediately after the war made it susceptible to buccaneers such as [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]], [[Gaston de Raousset-Boulbon]], and [[Henry Alexander Crabb]], who attacked Sonoran ports such as Guaymas and [[Caborca]]. However, most attacks were repelled.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> The economy did not begin to recover from the war until the late 1850s, when [[Ignacio Pesqueira]] became governor and attracted foreign investment to the state, especially in the mining sector, as well as worked to create markets abroad for agricultural products.<ref name=\"rincones38\"/>\n\nDuring the [[French intervention in Mexico]], Sonora was invaded by French troops as part of the effort to install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as a monarch in Mexico. The port of Guaymas was attacked by forces under Armando Castagny, forcing Mexican forces under Pesqueira and General Patoni to retreat north of the city. French troops attacked the Mexicans again at a place called ''La Pasi\u00f3n'', again resulting in defeat for the Mexican resistance. The French were not defeated in the state until the [[Battle of Llanos de Ures]] in 1866 by Pesqueira, Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Morales and \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez.<ref name=\"turhistoria\"/><ref name=\"rincones39\">Gonzalez, p. 39</ref> Shortly after this, the state's current constitution was written in 1871, and its capital was permanently moved to Hermosillo.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/><ref name=\"mediofisico\"/>\n\n[[File:Cajeme2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cajem\u00e9]], Yaqui resistance leader]]\n\nDuring the regime of [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] from the late 19th century to the 20th century, major economic changes occurred. These changes promoted rapid economic growth, which had far-reaching social and political consequences. Sonora and the rest of the northern states rapidly increased in economic importance. Development of a rail system integrated the state's economy into the national, and also allowed greater federal control over all of Mexico's territory. After 1880, this rail system was extended north into the United States, making it an important part of binational economic relations to this day.<ref name=\"hamnett184\">Hamnett, p. 184</ref> However, the changes also permitted foreigners and certain Mexicans to take over very large tracts of land in Mexico. In Sonora, [[Guillermo Andrade]] controlled {{Convert|1,570,000|ha|km2 sqmi}}, [[Manuel Peniche]] and American [[William Cornell Green]] about {{Convert|500,000|ha|km2 sqmi}}. Foreign industry owners also tended to bring in Asian and European workers.<ref name=\"enchistoria\"/> [[Chinese immigration to Mexico|Chinese immigration]] into Sonora would begin at this time, and the Chinese soon became an economic force as they built small businesses that spread wherever economic development occurred.<ref name=\"leerob8992\">Lee, pp. 89\u201392</ref>\n\nThe appropriation of land for both agriculture and mining placed renewed pressure on the Yaquis and other native peoples of Sonora. Previously, active resistance had given the Yaqui fairly autonomous control of a portion of the state and kept their agricultural system along the Yaqui River. Encroachment on this land led to uprisings and guerilla warfare by the Yaquis after 1887. By 1895, the federal and state governments began to violently repress the Yaquis and forcefully relocate captured Yaquis to the plantations in Mexico's tropical south, especially the [[henequen]] plantations in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. The Yaqui resistance continued into the 20th century, with the expulsions reaching a peak between 1904 and 1908, by which time about one quarter of this population had been deported. Still more were forced to flee into Arizona.<ref name=\"hamnett191\">Hamnett, p. 191</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Cananea.jpg|thumb|The Cananea miners' strike 1906]]\nThe policies of the D\u00edaz government caused resentment not only among the Yaquis, but also throughout the country.<ref name=\"hamnett192\">Hamnett, p. 192</ref> One of the preludes to the [[Mexican Revolution]] was the [[Cananea strike|1906 Cananea miner's strike]]. Approximately 2,000 strikers sought negotiations with American mine owner William Greene, but he refused to meet with them. The strike quickly turned violent when the miners tried to take control of the mine and gunfire was exchanged. Greene requested help from federal troops, but when it was obvious they could not arrive in time, he appealed to the governments of Arizona and Sonora to allow Arizona volunteers to assist him. This increased the scale of the violence. When Mexican federal troops arrived two days later, they put everything to a brutal end, with the suspected leaders of the strike executed. The heavy-handed way in which D\u00edaz had handled the strike made resentment against Diaz grow, with more strikes beginning in other areas.<ref name=\"kirkwood127\">{{cite book |last= Kirkwood |first= Burton |title= History of Mexico |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofmexico00burt |url-access= registration |year=2000 |publisher= Greenwood Press |location= Westport, CT, USA |isbn= 978-1-4039-6258-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmexico00burt/page/127 127]}}</ref><ref name=\"rincones3940\">Gonzalez, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nIn late 1910, the Mexican Revolution began in earnest, and D\u00edaz was quickly deposed. The governor of [[Coahuila]], [[Venustiano Carranza]], sought refuge in Sonora, and became one of the principal political leaders during the rest of the war, with his main base of operations in Hermosillo. A number of the revolutionary leaders who joined Carranza in Sonora did not come from peasant backgrounds, but rather the lower middle class of hacienda-managers, shopkeepers, mill-workers, or schoolteachers, who opposed large-scale landowners and the Porfirian elite.<ref name=\"hamnett220\">Hamnett, p. 220</ref> After D\u00edaz was deposed, Carranza competed for power against [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]] and others.<ref name=\"rincones3940\"/> The Yaquis joined with \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n's forces after 1913.<ref name=\"hamnett192\"/>\n\nBy 1920, Carranza had become president of Mexico, but found himself opposed by Obreg\u00f3n and others.

This is the area with the coolest temperatures.<ref name=\"mediofisico\"/> Deforestation has been a significant problem, especially after 1980, because the rate of cutting trees has increased. In central Sonora, the area covered by [[Madrean evergreen woodland]] and Sonoran Desert scrub decreased 28% and 31%, respectively, between 1973 and 1992 (ValdezZamudio et al. 2000). During this same period,<ref name=\"cartron70\">Cartron, p. 70</ref> For example, much of the forests of [[mesquite]] trees in the lower elevations of the state have disappeared because of the demand for local fuels and the market for mesquite charcoal in Mexico and the United States<ref name=\"cartron64\">Cartron, p. 64</ref>\n\nMost of northern Mexico suffers from one of the world's highest rates of [[desertification]] due to [[land degradation]] in arid and semi arid areas, with the loss of biological and/or economic productivity, but the process is most severe Sonora as neighboring [[Sinaloa]]. Land degradation occurs because of clearing land for agriculture, the planting of non-native buffelgrass for grazing, the cutting of forests, overgrazing of natural vegetation and soil salinization from irrigation. A study by Balling in 1998 showed higher soil and air temperatures in areas that have been overgrazed, deforested and otherwise cleared land, likely due to the lack of shading vegetation, which leads to higher soil evaporation and desert conditions. Studies have also indicated that warming trends are higher in Sonora than in neighboring Arizona, into which the Sonora Desert also extends.<ref name=\"cartron70\"/>\n\nThe state contains 139 species and subspecies of native mammals, with the most important being white tailed deer, [[mule deer]], wild sheep, bats, hares, squirrels, [[mole (animal)|moles]], [[beaver]]s, [[coyote]]s, wolves, foxes, [[jaguar]]s, and [[mountain lion]]s. Amphibians and reptiles include frogs and toads, [[desert tortoise]]s, [[chameleon]]s, [[gila monster]]s, [[rattlesnake]]s and other types of snakes.

This cools the air masses, leading to rain and occasionally snow in the higher elevations. While most of the rain falls in the mountainous areas, much of this water finds its way back to the western coastal plains in the form of rivers and streams that empty into the Gulf of California and fill underground [[aquifer]]s.<ref name=\"yetman15\"/> Most of the year's precipitation falls during the rainy season, which is locally called \u201clas aguas\u201d (the waters). These last from July to mid September, when [[monsoon]] winds bring moist air from southerly tropical waters. Most of this is from the Pacific Ocean west of [[Central America]] but can also come from [[Gulf of Mexico]] as well. This moister flow results in nearly daily afternoon thunderstorms. After the las aguas, there may be additional moisture brought in by hurricanes, which generally move west along the Pacific coast of Mexico and occasionally come inland, especially in southern Sonora. However, these storms tend to drop large quantities of rain in a short time, causing flooding and destruction.<ref name=\"yetman11\"/>\n\nIn the winter, from November to February, there are light rains called ''equipatas'' (\"horse hoofs\", named after the sound the rain makes). These rains come in from the north from the southern extensions of frontal storms that originate in the northern Pacific Ocean. These end by March or April when the fronts are no longer strong enough to reach this far south. They end even earlier in the extreme south of the state as the storm systems retreat, with the dry season lasting eight or nine months in this part of the state. In the north these rains support a wide variety of spring annuals and wildflowers, but the water they supply in the south of the state is still important to help replenish wells.<ref name=\"yetman11\"/>\n\n===Hydrology===\n[[File:ColoradoRiverDelta ISS009-E-09839.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo of the [[Colorado River delta]] in Sonora]]\nWith the exception of the [[Colorado River]], river and aquifer systems in Sonora are a result of rains from incoming clouds rising above the Sierra Madre Occidental.

From east to west these at [[Agua Prieta]], [[Naco, Sonora|Naco]], Nogales, [[Sasabe Port of Entry|Sasabe]], [[Sonoyta]] and [[San Luis R\u00edo Colorado]].

Interaction between the peoples on both sides is a part of both the culture and the economy. In the 1980s, an international [[volleyball]] game was regularly held near Naco, with the chain link border fence serving as the net. Much of Arizona and Sonora share a cuisine based on the wheat, cheese and beef that was introduced to the region by the Spaniards, with wheat [[tortilla]]s being especially large on both sides of the border. This diet is reinforced by the vaquero/cowboy tradition which continues in both states.<ref name=\"griffith\"/> The six border crossings are essential to the existence and extent of the communities that surround them, as most of them function as ports for the passage of goods between the two countries.<ref name=\"eller\">{{cite web |url= http://ebr.eller.arizona.edu/arizona_border_region/AZ_demographic.asp |title= Arizona-Sonora Region \u2013 Population |publisher= Eller College of Management University of Arizona  |year=2011 |location=Tucson, AZ |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref> People regularly shop and work on the other side, taking advantage of opportunities there.<ref name=\"griffith\"/> The economic opportunities of the border are not equal on both sides. Most of the population along this border lives on the Sonoran side, many of which have moved here for the opportunities created by the maquiladoras and other businesses. These are lacking on the Arizona side.<ref name=\"eller\"/>\n\nThe border has separated the region's indigenous populations, such as the [[Tohono O\u2019odham]]. While members of the Tohono O\u2019odham have special border crossing privileges, these have become endangered as Mexican farmers encroach on tribal lands in Sonora, which are vulnerable to drug smugglers. Yaquis in Arizona travel south to the [[Yaqui River]] area for festival, especially [[Holy Week in Mexico|Holy Week]], and Yaquis travel north to Arizona for cultural reasons as well. When [[Father Kino]] arrived in this area, he named much of it the Pimer\u00eda Alta, as Pima territory extends from the highlands of eastern Sonora up towards [[Tucson]].<ref name=\"griffith\"/>\n\nAuthorities on each side work to keep out from the other that which is undesirable. For the United States, this mostly involves drugs and illegal immigrants. For Mexico, this mostly involves struggling against the importation of untaxed goods, especially automobiles. Smuggling people and drugs into the United States is big business in Mexico, but while it affects everyone living on the border, it is generally not seen, except for occasional newspaper headlines, occasional violent crime and religious articles geared to those in the trade. Illegal crossings taking place through tunnels, hidden cars and trucks or most commonly, simply passing through a gap in the fence, especially in the more remote areas. In 1990, a tunnel linking two warehouses in Agua Prieta and [[Douglas, AZ]] was discovered. It was sophisticated with hydraulic equipment and means to move large quantities of goods. At least three [[corrido]]s have been written about this tunnel.<ref name=\"griffith\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote =\n|1895<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geohive.com/cntry/subspop/mx-pop.aspx |title=Mexico: extended population list |publisher=GeoHive |accessdate=2011-07-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311141056/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/subspop/mx-pop.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-11 }}</ref> | 192721\n|1900 | 221682\n|1910 | 265383\n|1921 | 275127\n|1930 | 316271\n|1940 | 364176\n|1950 | 510607\n|1960 | 783378\n|1970 | 1098720\n|1980 | 1513731\n|1990 | 1823606\n|1995 | 2085536 \n|2000 |  2216969\n|2005 | 2394861\n|2010 | 2662480 \n|2015<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/est/contenidos/proyectos/encuestas/hogares/especiales/ei2015/doc/eic_2015_presentacion.pdf |title=Encuesta Intercensal 2015 |publisher=INEGI |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> | 2850330\n}}\n\n===General population===\n[[File:Farlninios01.jpg|thumb|Sonoran children visiting the Office of Sonora State Deputy]]\nEconomic growth in the state since the [[Mexican Revolution]] has led to steady population growth.

This includes non-traditional crops such as fruits, nuts and winter vegetables such as tomatoes, especially since [[NAFTA]].<ref name=\"cartron59\"/>\n\nIrrigation is essential for reliable agriculture on the coastal lowlands of the state,<ref name=\"yetman7\">Yetman, p. 7</ref> and large scale irrigation infrastruction is needed for large scale production. After the [[Mexican Revolution]], the federal government took control of Sonora's irrigation infrastructure and after [[World War II]], began extensive dam and reservoir construction. From the 1940s to the 1970s, advanced in agricultural techniques were pioneered by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) based in [[Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n]]. This combined new varieties of wheat, with irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides to greatly increase production. Mexico went from a wheat importer in the 1940s to a wheat exporter in the 1960s.<ref name=\"cartron59\"/>\n\nHowever, such intensive agriculture in such an arid area has had a significant negative impact on water supplies. Eighty-eight percent of all water taken from above and below the surface is used for agriculture. One third of [[aquifer]]s are overdrafted, especially in [[Caborca]], [[Guaymas]], and the coast near [[Hermosillo]].<ref name=\"randall347\">{{cite book |editor1-first= Laura |editor1-last= Randall |title= Changing Structure of Mexico : Political, Social, and Economic Prospects |year=2006 |publisher= M.E.

For this reason, the area under cultivation dropped by more than 24% during the last quarter of the 20th century.<ref name=\"cartron59\"/>\n\nThe state still maintains its traditional livestock industry, especially in beef cattle, which has a national reputation for quality. In 2001, the state produced 1,477,686 heads of cattle, 1,229,297 pigs, 38,933 sheep, 33,033 goats, 83,260 horses and 11,988,552 heads of domestic fowl.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> The availability of relatively inexpensive semiarid land, along with proximity to United States markets, concentrates livestock production in Sonora and other northern states.<ref name=\"cartron60\">Cartron, p. 60</ref>\n\n===Fishing===\nSonora is a major producer of seafood in Mexico with a developed fishing infrastructure.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> The Gulf of California contains a large quantity of fish and shellfish, but major fishing did not begin in Sonora and neighboring [[Sinaloa]] until the mid 20th century.

Two species which have been particularly hard hit are sharks and [[manta ray]]s. In addition, shrimp trawling catches a large amount of non target species, which are discarded, and have destroyed large areas of the Gulf's seafloor. All this has led to rapidly declining harvests.<ref name=\"cartron67\"/>\n\n===Industry and mining===\n[[File:Cananea mine.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of mines in Cananea]]\nMost of the industry of the state is related to agriculture and fishing, in food processing and packing.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> In the 1980s, the state gained a large number of industrial plants called \"[[maquiladora]]s\", mostly situated along the border and in the capital of [[Hermosillo]].<ref name=\"actecon\"/> These are assembly plants run by mostly United States companies, which have certain duty and tax breaks. By the end of the 20th century, these enterprises had a large influence on the expansion and modernization of the border area, including Sonora. They not only introduced new sources of employment, their United States management styles have had influence on business in the state and the rest of the north. However, maquiladoras peaked in 2001, and now many United States companies are moving production facilities to China. The number of maquiladoras has declined, but the value of their output has increased as those that remain shift to higher value-added goods and automation. In addition, many of the plants abandoned by United States companies have been taken over by Mexican firms. Despite the decline of maquiladoras, exports from them have risen 40%.<ref name=\"malat28\">{{cite book |editor1-first= Randy |editor1-last= Malat |others= Szerlip, Barbara (Editor). |title= Passport Mexico : Your Pocket Guide to Mexican Business, Customs and Etiquette (3rd Edition) |year= 2008 |publisher= World Trade Press |location= Petaluma, CA, USA |isbn= 978-1-885073-91-4 |page= [https://archive.org/details/passportmexicoyo0000mala/page/28 28] |url= https://archive.org/details/passportmexicoyo0000mala/page/28 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to livestock, mining is another traditional element of Sonora's economy, beginning with a major find near the city of [[\u00c1lamos]]. While the silver of that area has mostly been depleted, Sonora still plays a large part in Mexico's standing as one of the top fifteen producers of minerals in the world, leading in silver, [[celestite]] and [[bismuth]]. Sonora is the leading producer of gold, copper, [[graphite]], [[molybdenum]], and [[wollastonite]]. There are still deposits of silver in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Sonora also has one of the largest coal reserves in the country.<ref name=\"cartron56\">Cartron, p. 56</ref> The state has the largest mining surface in Mexico,<ref name=\"cartron56\"/> and three of the country's largest mines: La Caridad, Cananea and Mineria Mar\u00eda.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the government forced out most foreign interests in Mexican mining, beginning with the increasing restriction of ownership in Mexican mining companies.<ref name=\"cartron56\"/> These restrictions were relaxed starting in 1992, with the only restriction that the operating company be Mexican. Within three years of the change, more than seventy foreign companies, mostly United States and Canadian enterprises, opened offices in Hermosillo.<ref name=\"cartron57\"/>\n\nMajor mining operations have had severe environmental impact, especially in the areas surrounding it, with Cananea as the primary example. Mining has been functioning here for over a century, with mining and smelter wastes polluting the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro]] and [[Sonora River]]s near the mine, threatening both watersheds. Mining operations also destroy nearby forests due to the demand for building materials and fuel. Few old trees stand near the city of [[Cananea]] and the town of [[San Javier, Sonora|San Javier]] in central Sonora.<ref name=\"cartron57\"/>\n\n===Tourism===\nBusiness and leisure visitors to the state primarily come from Mexico (over 60%), with the majority of foreign visitors coming from the United States, especially the states of Arizona, California and New Mexico. The four most important destinations in the state for leisure and business travelers include [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales]], [[Hermosillo]], [[Guaymas]] and [[Puerto Pe\u00f1asco]], with beach destinations preferred by most leisure travelers. One advantage that Sonora has is its proximity to the United States, from which come most of the world's travelers. In second place are tourists from Canada, many of whom visit as part of cruises. United States tourists mostly visit Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, [[San Carlos Nuevo Guaymas|San Carlos]] and Navajoa and prefer areas they consider friendly, with no \u201canti-U.S.\u201d sentiment. Leisure visitors from the United States tend to be between 40 and 65 years of age, married or in a relationship, educated at the university level or higher, with about thirty days of vacation time, and they and primarily research travel options on the Internet. Most visit to relax and experience another culture. Most domestic visitors also use the Internet, with about half having a university education or higher and about half are married or with a partner. Most domestic visitors are on vacation with their families. The busiest domestic travel times are [[Holy Week]], summer and Christmas, with the overall busiest months being January, April, July, August and December.<ref name=\"sustenible\">{{Cite report |title= Plan Estrat\u00e9gico de Desarrollo Tur\u00edstico Sustenible del Estado de Sonora |url=http://www.sonoraturismo.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/Plan-Estrategico-de-Desarrollo-Turistico-Sustentable-del-Estado-de-Sonora.pdf |author= Gobierno del Estado de Sonora, Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo de Contenidos and Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey |publisher=2010\u20132015 |accessdate=February 15, 2011 |docket=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the state received more than seven million visitors, who spent more than 20 billion pesos to the economy.

Just over half of tourists in the state arrive to their destinations by private automobile, followed by airplane and commercial bus.<ref name=\"sustenible\"/>\n\nDuring the 2000s, Sonora has increased its tourism infrastructure. In the last half of the 2000s, Sonora has increased its network of highways from {{Convert|3,600|km|mi}} to {{Convert|4,500|km|mi}}, accounting for 6.7% of all highways in Mexico. It ranks second in four-lane highways, surpassed only by Chihuahua. From 2003 to 2009 the number of hotels in the state has increased from 321 to 410 and the number of rooms from 13,226 to 15,806, over 20%. Most of these hotels and rooms are in Hermosillo (57 hotels/3232 rooms) followed by Puerto Pe\u00f1asco (40/3158), [[Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n]] (41/1671), Guaymas/San Carlos (28/1590), Nogales (24/1185), Navojoa (15/637) and [[Magdalena de Kino]] (10/284).<ref name=\"sustenible\"/> The cities of Hermosillo, Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n, Guaymas, Nogales, [[San Luis R\u00edo Colorado]], Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, [[Bah\u00eda Kino]] and [[\u00c1lamos]] all have 5-star hotels.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> There are 2,577 restaurants in the state with 1288 in Hermosillo.<ref name=\"sustenible\"/>\n\nHotel occupation went from 45% in 2003 to 57.7% in 2006 but dropped to 36% in 2009. The state's tourism suffered in 2008 and 2009, mostly due to the economic downturn and the [[H1N1]] \"swine flu\" influenza crisis, which brought hotel occupancy rates down about 30%.<ref name=\"sustenible\"/>\n\nSonora's major tourist attraction is its beaches, especially San Carlos, Puerto Pe\u00f1asco, Bah\u00eda Kino and the Gulf of Santa Clara in San Luis R\u00edo Colorado.<ref name=\"actecon\"/> San Carlos has a large variety of sea life off its shores, making it popular for sports fishing and scuba diving. One of its main attractions is the Playa de los Algodones, called such because its sand dunes look like cotton balls. On one of hills behind it, there is a lookout point which allows for views of the area. A number of Yaquis, Seris and Guaimas on and around the Tetakawi Hill, making a living from fishing. Puerto Pe\u00f1asco has recently experienced large scale development along its {{Convert|110|km|mi}} of beaches, which have calm seas. It is located extreme northwest of the state. Some of the available activities include jet skiing, boating, sailing, sports fishing, scuba diving and snorkeling. It is located near [[Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve|El Pinacate biosphere reserve]]. There is also an aquarium called the [[Acuario de Cer-Mar]], which is a research center open to the public. The aquarium has a number of species such as marine turtles, octopus, [[seahorse]]s and many varieties of fish. Bah\u00eda Kino is named after the Jesuit missionary, who visited the area in the 17th century. In the 1930s, a group of fishermen established a village in what is now known as Kino Viejo. This bay's beaches have white sand, with warm calm waters off of them. For this reason, Kino Viejo calls itself ''la perla del Mar de Cort\u00e9s'' (the pearl of the Gulf of California). Available activities include horseback riding, scuba diving and sports fishing. The [[Isla Tibur\u00f3n]] is {{Convert|28|km|mi}} from Bahia Kino in the Gulf of California. It is the largest island of Mexico, measuring {{Convert|50|by|20|km|mi}}. It has been declared an ecological reserve to protect its flora and fauna, such as the wild rams and deer that live here.<ref name=\"79playas\"/>\n[[File:Cocospera2-1-.jpg|thumb|Mission at Coc\u00f3spera founded by Padre Kino]]\n\nTo enhance tourism in areas away from the primary beaches, the state of Sonora has set up several tourist routes for promotion as well as gained \"[[Pueblo M\u00e1gico]]\" status for one of its smaller cities. The Ruta de las Missiones (\"Missions Route\") covers the principle stops of [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Eusebio Kino]], as the worked to establish the many religious institutions which are part of the state's identity.

Counting traffic going both north and south, the Nogales port handles about three quarters of all border crossing between Sonora and Arizona. Nogales is a major port of entry for Mexican agricultural products heading to the United States and Canada.<ref name=\"redesigning\">{{cite news |title= Arizona Studies Options for Redesigning Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales |first=Paola |last=Banchero |newspaper= Knight Ridder Tribune Business News |date=March 1, 2002 |page=1}}</ref> In 2005, 268,163 commercial trucks moved through the port, up from 242,435 in 2004,<ref name=\"clogged\"/> handling about 7.6% of all United States-Mexico truck traffic. Most of the merchandise that passes through Sonora on its way to the United States winds up in western states such as Arizona, [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]], as well as into Canada.<ref name=\"redesigning\"/>\n\nThe volume of traffic, along with new security measures which have been put into place since 2001, create traffic jams of trucks and other vehicles, especially during the winter when demand for products grown in Mexico's warm climates peaks. These jams can result in lines about eight miles long. For trucks moving into Sonora and south, inspection stations at [[V\u00edcam]] and near the Sinaloa border also cause delays. Delays in shipping causes more produce to rot before it can get to the consumer.<ref name=\"clogged\"/>\n\nThe last reason for the importance of the border is the [[maquiladora]] industries, which have made areas such as Nogales grow significantly.<ref name=\"freetrade\"/> Many of Sonora's incoming migrants from other parts of Mexico come to work at these factories.<ref name=\"cartron52\"/>\n\n===Handcrafts===\n[[File:MAPElNorte026.JPG|thumb|Corita basket on display at the [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City]] ]]\nThere are a number of different crafts made in the state, which are often distinguished by the use of certain materials and of certain designs. The best known of these is the [[Mexican ironwood carvings|carving of figures from ironwood (''palo fierro'' in Spanish)]], which is a very dense, almost black wood that sinks in water. This wood was often used in braziers in the past because it would burn for a very long time. This carving is the specialty of the [[Yaqui people|Yaquis]] and the [[Seri people|Seris]]. Before it can be carved, this wood must be dried thoroughly, a process that can take up to five years. If this is not done, the wood takes on an [[ochre]] color, rather than its characteristic shiny near black. Objects made from this wood are almost always decorative in nature in a wide variety of shapes such as sahuaro and other cacti, eagles, turtles, dolphins and other flora and fauna of the state, along with crosses. The last is popular among indigenous groups as it is believed that such guard against the envy of others and other ills. Objects made of this wood are very much in demand on the international market, but indigenous craftsmen cannot compete with factory made pieces.<ref name=\"rincones4849\">Gonzalez, pp. 48\u201349</ref>\n\nThe higher elevations of the state and riverbanks contain large quantities of trees. [[Aconchi]] is one of the villages of the state with a well-established tradition of making furniture, with almost forty workshops. Many of these are in rustic or colonial style. In [[Arizpe]] and [[\u00c1lamos]], they specialize in a type of chair made by bending and combining long flexible branches of willow and \u201cgu\u00e1sima\u201d ([[Guazuma ulmifolia]]) In the town of [[Tubutama]], they make clocks of [[mesquite]] wood.<ref name=\"rincones49\">Gonzalez, p. 49</ref>\n[[Basketmaking]] is still widely practiced in the state, with hand made wares available in local markets such as in [[Bah\u00eda Kino]], [[Punta Chueca]] and [[El Desemboque]]. Those made near the ocean often have marine designs. Baskets made of reeds are made in [[Ures]] along with hats. In Aconchi, palm fronds are used to make hats and baskets called guaris, used for food storage. In various locations, a basket variety called \u201c[[corita (basket)|caritas]]\" are made in a globe shape and have a lid. This is a specialty of the Seris. These are typically made by women, with small baskets taking a month to make. Larger ones can take up to two years. Most coritas are bought by foreigners as the work needed to create them makes them expensive.<ref name=\"rincones49\"/>\n\nLeather goods such as belts, shoes, jackets, wallets and more in made in locations such as [[N\u00e1cori Chico]], [[Moctezuma, Sonora|Moctezuma]], [[Pitiquito]], [[Bacoachi]], [[Ban\u00e1michi]], [[Hu\u00e1sbas]], [[Arivechi]] and [[Ures]]. This craft is a result of the state's history of cattle ranching. The mining industry gave rise to the working of metals, especially copper in [[Cananea]]. Items include pots, pans, plates and decorative items. [[\u00c1lamos]] is known for items made in brass and wrought iron.<ref name=\"rincones50\">Gonzalez, p. 50</ref>\nJewelry such as necklaces, bracelets and earrings are often made using materials from the sea such as various types of shells and spines from marine animals. This is a specialty in [[Puerto Pe\u00f1asco]] and of the Seris. The latter also use materials such as the tails of [[rattlesnake]]s and animal teeth. Some of the Seris\u2019 best work is located in a museum in Bahia Kino. There is also jewelry, especially necklaces made with various seeds, small twigs and river stones. In [[Oquitoa]], they made ceremonial crowns of glass in various colors. These are most often used to decorate the tombs of loved ones on [[Day of the Dead]]. The Yaquis make unique belts using the paws of deer as well as elaborate masks for ceremonies. However, these people generally do not commercialize their wares, with the exception of cloth dolls in local markets.<ref name=\"rincones\">Gonzalez, pp. 50\u201351</ref>\n\n==Media==\n[[List of newspapers in Mexico|Newspapers]] of Sonora include: ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Agua Prieta'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Caborca'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Hermosillo'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Magdalena'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Nogales'', ''El Gran Diario de Sonora Puerto Pe\u00f1asco'', ''El Imparcial'', ''El Informador del Mayo'', ''Entorno Informativo'', ''Expreso Hermosillo'', ''La I Noticias para Mi Hermosillo'', ''La Voz del Puerto'', ''Tribuna (Sonora)'', and ''Tribuna de San Luis.''<ref name=SIC>{{cite web |work=Sistema de Informaci\u00f3n Cultural |publisher=Gobierno de Mexico |language=es |accessdate= March 11, 2020 |url= https://sic.gob.mx/?table=impresos&disciplina=&estado_id=26 |title= Publicaciones peri\u00f3dicas en Sonora }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://libguides.utsa.edu/latamnews |title=Latin American & Mexican Online News |work=Research Guides |publisher=[[University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries]] |location=US |archivedate= March 7, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307192643/http://libguides.utsa.edu/latamnews }}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nThe most prolific art of the state is literature, which includes poetry, novels, plays and essays.

Today, most are employed in industry and tourism, but the dress and folklore of the ''vaquero'' is still important. Jeans and cowboy hats are still extremely popular, especially with men.

Lyrics most often deal with the important moments of everyday life which are celebrated and embellished. Only recently has ''norte\u00f1o'' music been accepted by social classes outside those with which it developed.

Sonora is considered a cultural zone separate from [[Mesoamerica]], although there may have been some Mesoamerican influence. The major differences between Sonoran cultures and Mesoamerica include dry climate farming, although the same basics of corn, squash and beans are produced. There is also a heavier reliance on wild resources. More important was the lack of true cities during this area's prehispanic history, with small settlements clustered around water sources and weak hierarchical systems. The cultures here also share some traits with those of the United States Southwest, but are distinct from these as well.<ref name=\"gorenstein241242\">Foster, pp. 241\u2013242</ref>\n\nThe [[Cerro de Trincheras]] (\"Trench Hill\") is an archeological site, with [[petroglyph]]s, plazas and astronomical observatories. The exact purpose of the area has been disputed, but the area reached its height between 1300 and 1450 CE, when it had population of about 1,000, which made its living growing corn, squash, cotton and [[agave]]. Its largest structure is called La Cancha (\"The Ballcourt\"), which is at the base of the north side of the hill. It is a rectangular patio marked by rocks piled on its edges, measuring {{convert|51|by|13|m|ft}}. Some researchers believe it was some kind of [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ball court]] and others believe it was a kind of open air theater. On the hill itself is an observatory, which gives views of the area. Most of the area's artifacts of stone and shell were found here. The Plaza de Caracol (Snail Plaza) is marked by a meter and a half high stone wall in an open spiral, most likely used for ceremonies.<ref name=\"mexdesholbox\">{{cite journal |date=March 2010 |title= La Trinchera de los Dioses |trans-title=The Trench of the Gods |journal= Mexico Desconocido |pages=82\u201387 |location=Mexico City |publisher= Impresiones Aereas SA de CV |issn=1870-9397 |editor1-first= Beatriz |editor1-last= 397 Quintanar Hinojosa |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Gastronomy===\n[[File:IMG 0558-746804.jpg|thumb|A very large flour tortilla made in Sonora]]\nAs in other parts of Mexico, Sonoran cuisine is basically a mixture of indigenous and Spanish influences. When the Spaniards moved north from the Mexico City area, they found that the diet of the area was simpler, with the basics of corn, beans and squash, but without the further variety as existed in the lusher south. The Spaniards had a great impact on how the diet of the region. They brought European staples of wheat, beef, dairy products, pork and more, as well as dishes and ingredients from the center and south of Mexico, such as [[tortilla]]s, more varieties of [[chile pepper]]s and [[tamale]]s.<ref name=\"jamison46\">{{cite book |title=The Border Cookbook |url=https://archive.org/details/bordercookbookau00jami |url-access=registration |last=Jamison |first=Cheryl Alters |author2=Bill Jamison  |year=1995 |publisher=The Harvard Common Press |location=Boston, MA |isbn=1-55832-102-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bordercookbookau00jami/page/4 4\u20136]}}</ref> The cowboy/''vaquero'' culture has been an important aspect of Sonora's culture since the colonial period and much of the cuisine is based on what cowboys ate on the range, even though most Sonorans no longer work outdoors.<ref name=\"jamison9\"/> Sonoran cuisine is not limited to the present state.

[[Machaca]], or ''[[carne seca]]'', is still enjoyed, although refrigeration has eliminated the need to dry meat. Sonora also has a reputation for producing fine cuts of beef, but the lean Spanish cattle of the colonial period have been replaced by [[Angus cattle|Angus]], [[Hereford (cattle)|Herefords]] and [[Holstein cattle|Holsteins]].

Having regard to the date 1225, it would make 1140 a probable date for Godwin's birth. It seems unlikely that any documentary evidence now exists that will prove an earlier generation. We have Domesday compiled 1086. From the scarcity of surnames in that record no clear reference to the Ketts of East Anglia is forthcoming, but christian names similar to those of the earliest recorded members of the Kett family have been found. They have been abstracted from the Norfolk Domesday and closely analysed. It is worth noting that the association of one group of Godwins, Hughs, and Huberts indicates a probable derivation from Toka, a \" francigena \" or foreigner (another word is used for Frank or Frenchman). This Toka was born about 960 A.D. These men were tenants of the de Morleys and the previous holders of de Morley lands.
