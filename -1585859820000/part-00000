There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

She and her family moved to London to live with her grandparents when the [[World War II|Second World War]] began in 1939.<ref name=\"DIDiscs MP\"/> She went to Willesden County Grammar School (now [[Capital City Academy]]). During the war, without her parents' knowledge, at the age of 12  she worked on a paper round in [[Dollis Hill]], London, in the evenings. She told her mother that she was studying art after-hours at school. Her grandfather saw her delivering papers, however, and reported this to her mother who prevented her from continuing with the job and punished her by making her do housework. After this she earned a little money from a Mr Hill, their lodger, who took pity on her and paid her to clean his room. She idolised Hill, whom she thought was a gentleman, and many years later saw similar characteristics in the actor [[James Robertson Justice]]. Later the family bought a tobacconist's and newsagent shop, which employed four [[Paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paperboys]]. When one of the paperboys was caught stealing money, her mother\u2014needing to fill his shift quickly\u2014made Parkin, then aged 14, do his paper round instead. On her first day, a car knocked her off her bicycle and she hit her head on the kerb. She was knocked unconscious, hospitalised, and spent about a year off school, convalescing. Parkin spent much of this period alone in her room above the shop, drawing and painting. This developed into an interest in the arts.<ref name=TPR>{{cite episode|title=The Paper Round with Molly Parkin|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b014q007 |series= The Paper Round |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] |airdate=2012-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1949 Parkin gained a scholarship to study [[fine art]] at [[Goldsmiths College]], London, and then a scholarship to [[Brighton College of Art]]. After marriage she became a teacher, painting throughout this period. After a series of affairs, including a long-term association with James Robertson Justice, Parkin separated from her husband at the start of the 1960s; at this time she lost the desire, inspiration and passion to continue with her artwork.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nTo support her two daughters, Parkin turned to fashion. After making hats and bags for [[Barbara Hulanicki]] at [[Biba]], and working alongside [[Mary Quant]], she opened her own Chelsea boutique, which was featured in a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article about [[Swinging London]]. After selling the shop to business partner [[Terence Donovan (photographer)|Terence Donovan]], she joined ''[[Nova (UK magazine)|Nova]]'' magazine in 1965, when the radical [[Dennis Hackett]] became its editor.

She and her family moved to London to live with her grandparents when the [[World War II|Second World War]] began in 1939.<ref name=\"DIDiscs MP\"/> She went to Willesden County Grammar School (now [[Capital City Academy]]). During the war, without her parents' knowledge, at the age of 12  she worked on a paper round in [[Dollis Hill]], London, in the evenings. She told her mother that she was studying art after-hours at school. Her grandfather saw her delivering papers, however, and reported this to her mother who prevented her from continuing with the job and punished her by making her do housework. After this she earned a little money from a Mr Hill, their lodger, who took pity on her and paid her to clean his room. She idolised Hill, whom she thought was a gentleman, and many years later saw similar characteristics in the actor [[James Robertson Justice]]. Later the family bought a tobacconist's and newsagent shop, which employed four [[Paperboy (newspaper delivery)|paperboys]]. When one of the paperboys was caught stealing money, her mother\u2014needing to fill his shift quickly\u2014made Parkin, then aged 14, do his paper round instead. On her first day, a car knocked her off her bicycle and she hit her head on the kerb. She was knocked unconscious, hospitalised, and spent about a year off school, convalescing. Parkin spent much of this period alone in her room above the shop, drawing and painting. This developed into an interest in the arts.<ref name=TPR>{{cite episode|title=The Paper Round with Molly Parkin|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b014q007 |series= The Paper Round |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] |airdate=2012-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1949 Parkin gained a scholarship to study [[fine art]] at [[Goldsmiths College]], London, and then a scholarship to [[Brighton College of Art]]. After marriage she became a teacher, painting throughout this period. After a series of affairs, including a long-term association with James Robertson Justice, Parkin separated from her husband at the start of the 1960s; at this time she lost the desire, inspiration and passion to continue with her artwork.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nTo support her two daughters, Parkin turned to fashion. After making hats and bags for [[Barbara Hulanicki]] at [[Biba]], and working alongside [[Mary Quant]], she opened her own Chelsea boutique, which was featured in a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article about [[Swinging London]]. After selling the shop to business partner [[Terence Donovan (photographer)|Terence Donovan]], she joined ''[[Nova (UK magazine)|Nova]]'' magazine in 1965, when the radical [[Dennis Hackett]] became its editor.

Her second husband Sambit Roy ([[Sumanta Mukherjee]]), an out-of-work director, is assigned the job of direction.\n\nThe out-of-work director has a shady past. A witness to his shady past is an aspiring actor, who was subsequently thrown out of the acting circuit. This actor started a catering service for the film unit.\n\nThe NRI producer insists on casting a retired actress, Kakoli ([[Kalyani Mandal]]) in a prominent role.

The NRI producer was an actress of repute in her heyday. She divorced her husband and left the country to settle abroad. Before that, she had given birth to an abnormal child. The course of the film reveals that she bore a grudge against Kakoli for spreading a contagious disease to her while she was pregnant, resulting in the abnormal child.\n\nAnother amorous affair runs parallel to the main theme: The camera assistant was repenting for his past affair with the hairdresser. The hairdresser has her problems and she was extracting money very often from the camera assistant.

Located approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Toronto]], Kitchener is the regional seat. Kitchener was called '''[[Berlin to Kitchener name change|Berlin]]''' until 1916; it was designated the Town of Berlin from 1854 until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916.\n\nThe City of Kitchener covers an area of 136.86 square kilometres and had a population of 233,222 at the time of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]. The Kitchener [[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|metropolitan area]], which includes the smaller, neighbouring cities of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] to the north and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] to the south, has 523,894 people, making it the tenth largest [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario.\n\nKitchener and Waterloo are considered \"twin cities\" which are often referred to jointly as \"Kitchener\u2013Waterloo\" (K\u2013W), although they have separate [[Municipal government in Canada|municipal governments]]. Including Cambridge, the three cities are known as \"[[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|the Tri-Cities]]\". All are part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, which was created in 1973, when it replaced Waterloo County, which had been created in 1853.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geography===\nKitchener is located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], in the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. This geological and climatic region has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Situated in the Grand River Valley, the area is generally above {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in elevation.\n\nKitchener is the largest city within the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] watershed, and the largest city on the Haldimand Tract. Just to the west of the city is [[Baden Hill]], in [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot Township]]. This glacial [[kame]] remnant formation is the highest elevation for many miles. The other dominant glacial feature is the [[Waterloo Moraine]], which snakes its way through the region and holds a significant quantity of [[artesian wells]], from which the city derives most of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate description of the higher points of the moraine.\n\n===Climate===\nKitchener has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]); there are large seasonal differences, usually warm and humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions generally last from the mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May to close to the end of September.\n\nMarch 2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener \u2013 between 16 and 22 March, temperatures ranged from {{convert|21.4|C|F|1}} to {{convert|27.0|C|F|1}}\u20147 record highs in a row. 19 March high of {{convert|24|C|F|1}} is one of the highest winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of {{convert|27|C|F|1}} is the highest for March in this area.\n\nTemperatures during the year can exceed {{convert|30|C|F|1}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|-20|C|F|1}} in the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures are rare.  The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free days a year,<ref name=climate /> a much more limited number than cities on the Great Lakes due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages {{convert|160|cm|in|0}}  per year; high, but not nearly as high as areas more directly affected by [[lake effect snow]].\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was {{convert|38.3|C|0}} on August 6 & 7, 1918, and again on July 27, 1941.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1941\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-34.1|C|1}} on February 16, 2015.<ref name=\"February 2015\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Region of Waterloo International Airport]], 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1914\u2013present{{efn|Daily maximum and minimum

hectare area given to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] by the British as a gift for their allegiance during the [[American Revolution]]. Between 1796 and 1798, the Six Nations sold 38,000 hectares of this land to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] Colonel [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]].  The portion of land that Beasley purchased was remote but of great interest to German [[Mennonite]] farming families from [[Pennsylvania]]. They wanted to live in an area that would allow them to practice their beliefs without persecution. Eventually, the Mennonites purchased all of Beasley's unsold land creating 160 farm tracts.\n\nMany of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania, known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] or Pennsilfaanisch-Deitsche (German, not \"modern\" Dutch), after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre section of Block Two from the German Company which was established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian Lands.

In 1816 the Government of Upper Canada designated the settlement the Township of Waterloo.\n\nMuch of the land, made up of [[moraine]]s and swampland interspersed with rivers and streams, was converted to farmland and roads.  [[Rock Pigeon|Wild pigeons]], which once swarmed by the tens of thousands, were driven from the area.  Apple trees were introduced to the region by John Eby in the 1830s, and several [[gristmill|grist-]] and [[saw mill|sawmills]] (most notably Joseph Schneider's 1816 sawmill, John and [[Abraham Erb]]'s grist- and sawmills and Eby's cider mill) were erected throughout the area.  Schneider built Berlin's first road, from his home to the corner of King Street and Queen Street (then known as Walper corner).  $1000 was raised by the settlers to extend the road from Walper corner to Huether corner, where the Huether Brewery was built and the [[Huether Hotel]] now stands in the city of Waterloo; a petition to the government for $100 to assist in completing the project was denied.\n\nLater named the founder of Berlin, [[Benjamin Eby]] (made Mennonite preacher in 1809, and bishop in 1812) arrived from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1806 and purchased a large tract of land consisting of much of what would become the village of Berlin (named about 1830).

Here there are many fountains, ponds, waterfalls and rock grottoes. It is a popular site for wedding photos in the summer.\n\nKitchener has an extensive and safe community trail system. The trails, which are controlled and run by the city, are hundreds of kilometres in length. Due to Kitchener's close proximity to the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], several community trails and paths border the river's shores. This convenient access to the Grand River has drawn nature-seeking tourists to the city. However, Kitchener's trails and especially natural areas remain underfunded by city council and as a result, many are not adequately maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |title=Staff report regarding state of Kitchener's park system |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316205637/http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a bike park at the newly constructed McLennan Park, in the city's south end, was hailed as one of the best city-run bike parks in [[Southern Ontario]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/565847 |title=TheRecord \u2013 21 Rosedene Avenue |publisher=News.therecord.com |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> by [[Freestyle BMX|BMX]] and [[mountain biking]] enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |title=Take the Lane: Kitchener's new bike park |publisher=Therecord.blogs.com |date=21 July 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708021409/http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The bike park offers a [[Four-cross|four-cross (4X)]] section, a [[Freestyle BMX|pump track]] section, a [[Dirt jumping|jump park]], and a [[Flatland BMX|free-ride]] course.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |title=City of Kitchener |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184531/http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> McLennan Park also features an accessible play area, a splash pad, basketball courts, beach volleyball courts, a leash-free dog area, and a toboggan hill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |title=City of Kitchener \u2013 McLennan Park |publisher=City of Kitchener |accessdate=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729151656/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Chicopee Ski Club]] is also within the city limits.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Highways and expressways===\n[[File:Highway 401 Grand River.jpg|thumb|left|[[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] in Kitchener looking east towards the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]]]]\n[[File:Conestoga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]] as seen from Franklin Street bridge]]\nKitchener was very proactive and visionary about its transportation network in the 1960s, with the province undertaking at that time construction of the [[Conestoga Parkway]] from the western boundary (just past Homer Watson Boulevard) across the south side of the city and looping north along the Grand River to Northfield Drive in Waterloo.\nSubsequent upgrades took the Conestoga west beyond Trussler Road and north towards [[St. Jacobs, Ontario|St Jacobs]], with eight lanes through its middle stretch.\n\nThe Conestoga Parkway bears the provincial highway designations of Highways [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|7]] and [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|8]]. King Street becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Conestoga in the south and leads down to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport to the Preston area of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. Up until construction of the Conestoga, Highland Road through [[Baden, Ontario|Baden]] had been the primary highway to [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]]. Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to [[Guelph]] but this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to the old route.\n\nThere are two interchanges with [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] on Kitchener's southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson Boulevard.\n\nIn order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported by the Region of Waterloo, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has no plans to proceed with an interchange at Trussler Road.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Destinations from Kitchener'''\n|Northwest = [[Wellesley, Ontario|Wellesley]]\n|North     = [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Elora, Ontario|Elora]], [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]]\n|West      = [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Centre    = Kitchener\n|East      = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Guelph]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]]''</small>\n|Southwest = [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South     = [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]], [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]]\n|Southeast = [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]]''</small>\n}}\n\n===City streets===\nUnlike most southern Ontario cities whose streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most familiar to the German settlers.\n\nThere is good historical reason for this. Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived in advance of government surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The Mennonites who had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on individual farms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} There was no grid survey done\u2014no lines, no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland and southern Germany.\n\nThis is a Continental Radial pattern and the result was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced the horse, might someday have become [[roundabouts]] decorated with circular gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.\n\nIn 2004, [[roundabouts]] were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/roundabouts.asp |title=Roundabouts \u2013 Region of Waterloo |publisher=Regionofwaterloo.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619124821/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/roundabouts.asp |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Besides improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from emissions created by idling vehicles. In 2006, the first two were installed along Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener. Some people{{Who|date=February 2017}} argue roundabouts are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making the point irrelevant.\n\nA controversial plan would extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |title=Strengthening Community |publisher=Waterlooians.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212813/http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east-west arterials between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is forcing this development ahead.\n\nMost streets that cross the municipal boundary between Kitchener and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] retain the same street name in both cities. However, several streets which are divided into east and west sections in Kitchener shift to a north-south division in Waterloo. This primarily affects [[Weber Street|Weber]] and [[Waterloo Regional Road 15|King]] Streets and Westmount Road. Since these roads do not actually change their primary directional alignment significantly, (Weber Street and King Street, supposedly \"Parallel\" streets, cross 3 times), the shift in labelling can create confusion, since each of the aforementioned thoroughfares bears the labels north, south, west, and east on certain segments. However, it also reduces the potential confusion that would result from having separate west and east segments of the same street existing simultaneously in both cities.\n\nThe problem with giving streets in Waterloo Region compass-based labels, and attempting to divide each of the cities into quadrants comes from the radial layout of the roads, and the historical patterns of development. Waterloo's quadrants, created by the intersection of King and Erb Streets, roughly correspond to compass directions, but Kitchener's quadrants, delineated by King and Queen Streets, do not resemble compass directions whatsoever. A notable case is that of Lancaster Street, which runs almost exactly north-south, but is designated as east-west, since it crosses Queen Street, which divides the \"east\" and \"west\" halves of the city, yet follows a northeast-southwest orientation itself.\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:GrandRiverTransit3.jpg|thumb|GRT iXpress bus (since adapted into the ION bus service)]]\nSince 2000, public transport throughout the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] has been provided by [[Grand River Transit]], which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit.

It runs approximately east\u2013west through the northern section of downtown Kitchener. It was originally laid out and constructed in 1856 by the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR), and after the GTR's acquisition of the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]], the mainline through Kitchener became known informally as the \"North Main Line\" in contrast with the \"South Main Line\" through [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]], both connecting [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Toronto]]. Coming from the east, the [[Waterloo Spur]] diverges from the mainline and heads north through [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] and ultimately to [[Elmira, Ontario|Elmira]]. The spur was formerly owned by CN, but is now owned by the [[Region of Waterloo]] and leased to the [[Goderich-Exeter Railway]] (GEXR), a shortline freight railway.\n\n[[Kitchener station]] lies a short distance west along the track from the junction with the Waterloo Spur. The current station building dates from 1897 and is a heritage structure which is owned by [[Via Rail]], Canada's national passenger railway. Both Via Rail [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|''Corridor'']] service and [[GO Transit]] [[Kitchener line]] service are available at the station, the latter of which has its western terminus at the station. Via Rail service consists of two trains per day in each direction along the Toronto\u2013London\u2013Sarnia route; one westbound train terminates at [[Sarnia station|Sarnia]] while another terminates at [[London station (Ontario)|London]], while both eastbound trains terminate at [[Toronto Union Station]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/summer2020/24-25_Toronto-London-Sarnia.pdf |title=Toronto-London-Sarnia |access-date=8 March 2020 |publisher=[[Via Rail]]}}</ref> GO train service was originally extended to Kitchener in 2011 from its previous western terminus at [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]].<ref name=2011kitchenerline>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/sports-story/2567786-go-trains-to-run-from-kitchener-to-toronto-in-2011/ |title=GO trains to run from Kitchener to Toronto in 2011 |date=13 November 2010 |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record]] |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> GO service began with two trains per direction per weekday,<ref name=2011kitchenerline /> but since its inception train frequency has gradually increased and as of early 2020 it stands at 8 eastbound and 7 westbound trains per weekday, with no weekend service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gotransit.com/static_files/gotransit/assets/pdf/TripPlanning/FullSchedules/FS11012020/Table31.pdf |publisher=[[GO Transit]] |access-date=8 March 2020 |title=Kitchener GO Train and Bus Schedule}}</ref> In 2017, [[Metrolinx]] (the parent agency of GO Transit) constructed a purpose-built train layover facility on Shirley Avenue to supplement its existing adapted layover facility, which was at capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metrolinxengage.com/sites/default/files/waterloo_region_council_august_30_final.pdf |publisher=[[Metrolinx]] |website=Metrolinx Engage |title=Creating Connections in Waterloo Region |date=30 August 2017 |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhile Kitchener benefits from increasingly frequent commuter-oriented GO service east to Toronto, intercity Via Rail service to the city has been largely unchanged for years, limiting its connectivity to [[Southwestern Ontario]] to the west. In contrast, the South Main Line through Brantford (which is still owned by CN) has faster and more frequent service between Toronto and London than the North Main Line does, along with larger double-tracked sections. In 2017, the Ontario Liberal government proposed a Windsor\u2013Toronto [[high-speed rail]] line through Kitchener, which would improve travel times to nearby major cities as well as to the [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Bill|title=Province initiates EA for high-speed rail|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7325518-province-initiates-ea-for-high-speed-rail/|publisher=Kitchener Post|accessdate=25 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328004435/https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7325518-province-initiates-ea-for-high-speed-rail/|archivedate=28 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The proposal, if approved, would provide a 48-minute trip from Kitchener to downtown Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toronto \u2013 Kitchener \u2013 London Ontario High Speed Rail Pre-Feasibility Study prepared for Ontario Ministry of Transport Commercial in Confidence|url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/pdfs/toronto-kitchener-london-ontario-high-speed-rail-feasibility-study.pdf|website=mto.gov.on.ca|accessdate=25 June 2017|page=8|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704192850/http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/pdfs/toronto-kitchener-london-ontario-high-speed-rail-feasibility-study.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> With the election of a new [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] government, funding for the project was indefinitely paused.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/ontario-pauses-high-speed-rail-funding-will-look-at-enhancing-current-services |title=Ontario pauses high-speed rail funding, will look at enhancing current services |date=15 April 2019 |access-date=8 March 2020 |first=Shawn |last=Jeffords |newspaper=The [[National Post]]}}</ref>\n\nFreight trains in Kitchener are operated by the [[Goderich-Exeter Railway]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].

Located approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Toronto]], Kitchener is the regional seat. Kitchener was called '''[[Berlin to Kitchener name change|Berlin]]''' until 1916; it was designated the Town of Berlin from 1854 until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916.\n\nThe City of Kitchener covers an area of 136.86 square kilometres and had a population of 233,222 at the time of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]. The Kitchener [[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|metropolitan area]], which includes the smaller, neighbouring cities of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] to the north and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] to the south, has 523,894 people, making it the tenth largest [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario.\n\nKitchener and Waterloo are considered \"twin cities\" which are often referred to jointly as \"Kitchener\u2013Waterloo\" (K\u2013W), although they have separate [[Municipal government in Canada|municipal governments]]. Including Cambridge, the three cities are known as \"[[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|the Tri-Cities]]\". All are part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, which was created in 1973, when it replaced Waterloo County, which had been created in 1853.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geography===\nKitchener is located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], in the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. This geological and climatic region has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Situated in the Grand River Valley, the area is generally above {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in elevation.\n\nKitchener is the largest city within the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] watershed, and the largest city on the Haldimand Tract. Just to the west of the city is [[Baden Hill]], in [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot Township]]. This glacial [[kame]] remnant formation is the highest elevation for many miles. The other dominant glacial feature is the [[Waterloo Moraine]], which snakes its way through the region and holds a significant quantity of [[artesian wells]], from which the city derives most of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate description of the higher points of the moraine.\n\n===Climate===\nKitchener has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]); there are large seasonal differences, usually warm and humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions generally last from the mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May to close to the end of September.\n\nMarch 2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener \u2013 between 16 and 22 March, temperatures ranged from {{convert|21.4|C|F|1}} to {{convert|27.0|C|F|1}}\u20147 record highs in a row. 19 March high of {{convert|24|C|F|1}} is one of the highest winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of {{convert|27|C|F|1}} is the highest for March in this area.\n\nTemperatures during the year can exceed {{convert|30|C|F|1}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|-20|C|F|1}} in the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures are rare.  The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free days a year,<ref name=climate /> a much more limited number than cities on the Great Lakes due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages {{convert|160|cm|in|0}}  per year; high, but not nearly as high as areas more directly affected by [[lake effect snow]].\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was {{convert|38.3|C|0}} on August 6 & 7, 1918, and again on July 27, 1941.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1941\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-34.1|C|1}} on February 16, 2015.<ref name=\"February 2015\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Region of Waterloo International Airport]], 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1914\u2013present{{efn|Daily maximum and minimum

hectare area given to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] by the British as a gift for their allegiance during the [[American Revolution]]. Between 1796 and 1798, the Six Nations sold 38,000 hectares of this land to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] Colonel [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]].  The portion of land that Beasley purchased was remote but of great interest to German [[Mennonite]] farming families from [[Pennsylvania]]. They wanted to live in an area that would allow them to practice their beliefs without persecution. Eventually, the Mennonites purchased all of Beasley's unsold land creating 160 farm tracts.\n\nMany of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania, known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] or Pennsilfaanisch-Deitsche (German, not \"modern\" Dutch), after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre section of Block Two from the German Company which was established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian Lands.

In 1816 the Government of Upper Canada designated the settlement the Township of Waterloo.\n\nMuch of the land, made up of [[moraine]]s and swampland interspersed with rivers and streams, was converted to farmland and roads.  [[Rock Pigeon|Wild pigeons]], which once swarmed by the tens of thousands, were driven from the area.

He would build what later became the Walper House in Berlin. Two streets in present-day Kitchener, Frederick and Gaukel streets, are named after him. Other German-speaking immigrants from Europe arrived during the 1830s to 1850s, bringing with them their language, religion and cultural traditions. The German community became industrial and political leaders, and created a German-Canadian society unlike any other found in Canada at the time. They established German public schools and German language churches.\n\nBoth the immigrants from Germany and the Mennonites from Pennsylvania spoke German, though with different dialects such as Low German or the incorrectly called [[Pennsylvania Dutch]], actually Pennsilfaanisch ''Deitsch'' (German, not modern Dutch).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianmennonite.org/stories/10-things-know-about-mennonites-canada|title=10 things to know about Mennonites in Canada|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314064249/http://www.canadianmennonite.org/stories/10-things-know-about-mennonites-canada|archivedate=14 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (This dialect is different from [[Standard German]] with a simplified grammatical structure, some differences in vocabulary and pronunciation and a greater influence of English.)

King Street becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Conestoga in the south and leads down to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport to the Preston area of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. Up until construction of the Conestoga, Highland Road through [[Baden, Ontario|Baden]] had been the primary highway to [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]]. Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to [[Guelph]] but this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to the old route.\n\nThere are two interchanges with [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] on Kitchener's southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson Boulevard.\n\nIn order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported by the Region of Waterloo, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has no plans to proceed with an interchange at Trussler Road.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Destinations from Kitchener'''\n|Northwest = [[Wellesley, Ontario|Wellesley]]\n|North     = [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Elora, Ontario|Elora]], [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]]\n|West      = [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Centre    = Kitchener\n|East      = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Guelph]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]]''</small>\n|Southwest = [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South     = [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]], [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]]\n|Southeast = [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]]''</small>\n}}\n\n===City streets===\nUnlike most southern Ontario cities whose streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most familiar to the German settlers.\n\nThere is good historical reason for this. Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived in advance of government surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The Mennonites who had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on individual farms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} There was no grid survey done\u2014no lines, no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland and southern Germany.\n\nThis is a Continental Radial pattern and the result was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced the horse, might someday have become [[roundabouts]] decorated with circular gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.\n\nIn 2004, [[roundabouts]] were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/roundabouts.asp |title=Roundabouts \u2013 Region of Waterloo |publisher=Regionofwaterloo.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619124821/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/roundabouts.asp |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Besides improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from emissions created by idling vehicles.

Some people{{Who|date=February 2017}} argue roundabouts are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making the point irrelevant.\n\nA controversial plan would extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |title=Strengthening Community |publisher=Waterlooians.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212813/http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east-west arterials between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is forcing this development ahead.\n\nMost streets that cross the municipal boundary between Kitchener and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] retain the same street name in both cities. However, several streets which are divided into east and west sections in Kitchener shift to a north-south division in Waterloo. This primarily affects [[Weber Street|Weber]] and [[Waterloo Regional Road 15|King]] Streets and Westmount Road. Since these roads do not actually change their primary directional alignment significantly, (Weber Street and King Street, supposedly \"Parallel\" streets, cross 3 times), the shift in labelling can create confusion, since each of the aforementioned thoroughfares bears the labels north, south, west, and east on certain segments. However, it also reduces the potential confusion that would result from having separate west and east segments of the same street existing simultaneously in both cities.\n\nThe problem with giving streets in Waterloo Region compass-based labels, and attempting to divide each of the cities into quadrants comes from the radial layout of the roads, and the historical patterns of development. Waterloo's quadrants, created by the intersection of King and Erb Streets, roughly correspond to compass directions, but Kitchener's quadrants, delineated by King and Queen Streets, do not resemble compass directions whatsoever. A notable case is that of Lancaster Street, which runs almost exactly north-south, but is designated as east-west, since it crosses Queen Street, which divides the \"east\" and \"west\" halves of the city, yet follows a northeast-southwest orientation itself.\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:GrandRiverTransit3.jpg|thumb|GRT iXpress bus (since adapted into the ION bus service)]]\nSince 2000, public transport throughout the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] has been provided by [[Grand River Transit]], which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit.

It runs approximately east\u2013west through the northern section of downtown Kitchener. It was originally laid out and constructed in 1856 by the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR), and after the GTR's acquisition of the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]], the mainline through Kitchener became known informally as the \"North Main Line\" in contrast with the \"South Main Line\" through [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]], both connecting [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Toronto]]. Coming from the east, the [[Waterloo Spur]] diverges from the mainline and heads north through [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] and ultimately to [[Elmira, Ontario|Elmira]]. The spur was formerly owned by CN, but is now owned by the [[Region of Waterloo]] and leased to the [[Goderich-Exeter Railway]] (GEXR), a shortline freight railway.\n\n[[Kitchener station]] lies a short distance west along the track from the junction with the Waterloo Spur. The current station building dates from 1897 and is a heritage structure which is owned by [[Via Rail]], Canada's national passenger railway. Both Via Rail [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|''Corridor'']] service and [[GO Transit]] [[Kitchener line]] service are available at the station, the latter of which has its western terminus at the station. Via Rail service consists of two trains per day in each direction along the Toronto\u2013London\u2013Sarnia route; one westbound train terminates at [[Sarnia station|Sarnia]] while another terminates at [[London station (Ontario)|London]], while both eastbound trains terminate at [[Toronto Union Station]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/summer2020/24-25_Toronto-London-Sarnia.pdf |title=Toronto-London-Sarnia |access-date=8 March 2020 |publisher=[[Via Rail]]}}</ref> GO train service was originally extended to Kitchener in 2011 from its previous western terminus at [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]].<ref name=2011kitchenerline>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/sports-story/2567786-go-trains-to-run-from-kitchener-to-toronto-in-2011/ |title=GO trains to run from Kitchener to Toronto in 2011 |date=13 November 2010 |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record]] |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> GO service began with two trains per direction per weekday,<ref name=2011kitchenerline /> but since its inception train frequency has gradually increased and as of early 2020 it stands at 8 eastbound and 7 westbound trains per weekday, with no weekend service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gotransit.com/static_files/gotransit/assets/pdf/TripPlanning/FullSchedules/FS11012020/Table31.pdf |publisher=[[GO Transit]] |access-date=8 March 2020 |title=Kitchener GO Train and Bus Schedule}}</ref> In 2017, [[Metrolinx]] (the parent agency of GO Transit) constructed a purpose-built train layover facility on Shirley Avenue to supplement its existing adapted layover facility, which was at capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metrolinxengage.com/sites/default/files/waterloo_region_council_august_30_final.pdf |publisher=[[Metrolinx]] |website=Metrolinx Engage |title=Creating Connections in Waterloo Region |date=30 August 2017 |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhile Kitchener benefits from increasingly frequent commuter-oriented GO service east to Toronto, intercity Via Rail service to the city has been largely unchanged for years, limiting its connectivity to [[Southwestern Ontario]] to the west.
