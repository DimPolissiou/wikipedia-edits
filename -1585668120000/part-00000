Light anti-aircraft armament and fire control was also improved. The Bellonas and Royalist, carried 4 rather than 5 twin 5.25 turrets, but increased electronic and radar weight, and the fact aluminium, used to save turret weight in the original Dido, was no longer usable, made it essential to achieve higher fighting effectiveness with fewer turrets. Royalist was further modified after completion with extra facilities and crew for directing carrier aircraft operations. HMS Howe used US provided 275 HADCT for its 5.25 Mk 2 from 1944,and HMS Vanguard from 1946. The tremendous success of the RN fitted T275/Mk 37(1944 USN mod), made the smaller, Bellona's priority for development post war as smaller crewed cruiser destroyers and to replace the twin 4.5 AA, and 5.25 of fleet aircraft carries and battleships post war. The loss of these 16 gun 4.5 or 5.25 platforms from the post war RN was the driving force behind the Royalist postwar update and the Tiger class completion as AA cruisers.\n\n== Development ==\nThe [[Royal Navy]] (RN) intended in late 1943 to use the ''Bellona'' class as flagships for escort-carrier and cruiser groups for the projected [[D-Day]] and [[Operation Dragoon|South of France]] invasions and for operations with the [[United States Navy|USN]] and with the RN Fleet in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. ''Royalist'' was a class of one from the start \u2013 being fitted out, within months of commissioning, with further modifications. These modifications gave it two extra rooms for additional communications (with carriers and with [[Fleet Air Arm]] aircraft) and one of the first implementations of an AIO (Action Information Office or Organisation) \u2013 an early [[Operations Room]] for plotting and display of the tactical position and associated mechanical computers to multiply the effectiveness of its armament. Intended to enhance the vessel's role as a command ship in Northern Atlantic waters for operations against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] and [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']], the extra equipment took the ship to the limit, leaving minimal comfort and sleeping provision for Petty officers and Ratings.<ref name=\"roberts\"/> The wartime development of radar and the requirement to equip ''Royalist'' as a flagship fitted with AIO increased the crew complement from 484 to 600, adding to the discomfort.  {{HMS|Scylla|98|6}}, the other AIO-fitted ''Dido'', was fitted with more compact twin 4.5 turrets. <ref>G. Mason, [https://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-06CL-HMS_Royalist.htm HMS ''Royalist''] navalhistory.net</ref>Scylla and HMS Charybidis, fitted with 4.5 twin turrets used encased ammunition (the shell and charge in the same outer case for fast loading)  were considered  the only, true anti-aircraft variants of the class,<ref>R.

Postwar the RN rejected encased 4.5 ammunition as too heavy and reverted to separated loading in the Battle, Type 12 and HMS Ark Royal. The USN  rejected hand loading, higher calibre,70lb shells for post war 5/54 guns although France used a mod, manual version twin 5/54USN in two De Grasse, AA Cruisers in 1955-58. The other 4.5-inch-armed ''Dido'', {{HMS|Charybdis|88|6}}, was intended as the second AIO flagship, its loss in France led to the conversion of HMS ''Royalist''.<ref>Brown, 1995, pp. 112\u201313</ref> The ''Dido'' and the ''Improved Dido'' (''Bellona''s) developed from the small ''Arethusa''-class (1936) scout light cruisers, built primarily as a surface fighting fleet and as Mediterranean and trade route cruisers \u2013 and originally designed, 5,500-ton light cruisers \u2013 not scaled-down versions of the RN/RAN Leander/Perth cruisers<ref>\nD.K.

She was launched on 30 May 1942 and commissioned on 10 September 1943. Her motto, ''Surtout Loyal'', translates to \"Loyal above all\".<ref>naval-history.net</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy intended to follow the Bellonas in 1944 with a new N2 class of 5.25 cruisers with 4 twin 12rpm with automatic turrets on a hull the size to the Tigers 55ft x 64 feet and with a desire for balanced small cruisers and speed of 28 knots through new  destroyer engines, much more effective sub division , protection system and space for the crew and fuel. The N2 class was vetoed by First Sea Lord A. Cunningham in Feb 44 as the 5.25 gun was less effective against armoured cruisers than 6 inch cruisers. THe USN rejected this argument and arguing that both 5/38 (52lb) shell Atlanta cruisers and 5/54 ships with 70lb shell would destroy destroyers at maximum gun range <ref> N. Freidman. US Cruisers an Illustrated Design History, USNI.(1984) Annapolis,p220 </ref>  and built the three Juneau light cruisers in 1944-46 and nearly ordered a 5/54 batch of Atlanta in 1945. In 1950-1 USS Juneau C119 was rebuilt with modern electronics and fire control for 5/38 and new new 3/50 AA,  rather like Royalist in AA exercises it was better than other USN Cruisers including then new Worchester. But Juneau was seen as an orphan in the fleet and was scrapped while its sisters were being considered for FRAM 1 conversion in 1959-60.\n\n==Royal Navy career==\n[[File:HMS Royalist spitfire.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] of [[807 Naval Air Squadron]] [[Fleet Air Arm]] flying above HMS ''Royalist'' during a training flight from the Royal Naval Air Station at [[HMS Grebe|Dekhelia]], near Alexandria, Egypt in February 1945]]\nFollowing her commissioning, ''Royalist'' spent several months working up, during which time she underwent repairs for trial defects and for alterations and additions. Amongst these were modifications for service as a carrier flagship.<ref>Mason, naval-history.net</ref> In March 1944 ''Royalist'' joined the [[Home Fleet]] and served for a short period in the Arctic theatre. In this capacity she took part in [[Operation Tungsten]], the carrier raid against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']] whilst the ''Tirpitz'' was in [[Norway]]. ''Royalist'' was then ordered to the [[Mediterranean]] to support the landings in the south of France ([[Operation Dragoon]]) in August 1944, as part of the escort carrier squadron TF88.1. On 15 September, accompanied by {{HMS|Teazer|R23|6}}, she sank the transports ''KT4'' and ''KT26'' off Cape Spatha. She was then stationed in the [[Aegean Sea]] until late 1944, when she was ordered to the [[East Indies]]. By April 1945 she was with the [[21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron]] as Flagship, supporting the Rangoon landings ([[Operation Dracula]]), and the following month was part of a force that failed to join the [[Battle of the Malacca Strait]] where five Royal Navy destroyers intercepted the Japanese cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Haguro|Haguro]] and the destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Kamikaze (1922)|Kamikaze]] evacuating troops from [[Port Blair]] in the [[Andaman Islands]].

The substantial USN electronic warfare fit, similar to the fit on HMAS Yarra and Parammatta in 1961 and the likely reason it survived the 1971 Indo Pakistan war. As with the transfer of Royalist to the RNZN, the transfer of Diadem to Pakistan was due to persuasion by the UK Government and CNS Mountbatten. However the Suez crisis and  [[Duncan Sandys]]1957 Defence review, accelerated the phase out of RN cruisers, downgraded HMS ''Vanguard'' to a  reserve HQ ship displacing, HMS ''Cleopatra'' and HMS ''Dido'', by October 1956,<ref> M.

Their scrapping was debated, in the post Sandy's HL/HC estimates debates. The ''Royalist'' and ''Diadem'' were complex warships, even as built in 1944, like modern 'hot' warships, which after refit and rewiring in 1956 could never really be turned off, for more updating, and had to be kept running with 200 men aboard even in short periods in reserve and refit, and therefore, difficult for small navies, the RNZN and RPN.

A minority of RNZN opinion, including Cpt Phipps, saw it as a policy reversal stopping the RNZN maintaining a 6 frigate fleet, good training conditions and commonality with the RN. The ''Royalist'', with massive RN/USN assistance, however returned 9.5 years, almost continuous service, fortuateously,the Royal Navy, after Suez in 1956, with an \"uncertain, role and future,\", transferred the bulk of the fleet to the Indian and Pacific oceans, from 1957 to 1967 where prior to 1955 there was only a token presence, a couple of cruisers and destroyers. Therefore  ''Royalist'' could be deployed, effectively in 1957, with the RN carrier fleet. A complex specialised,  gunship, with a incomprehensible role, demanding RN officers, zero provision for non-officer comfort and separating 2/5th of the seagoing men of a small Navy from family, for 12\u201315 months deployment.  The ship was handed over to the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] (RNZN) on 9 July 1956. When Captain [[Peter Phipps]] went to take command of ''Royalist'' in 1955, New Zealand diplomat [[Frank Corner]] showed his own view, when he noted that Phipps agreed that the ship was a [[white elephant]], unsuitable for use in the Pacific. The RNZN had, however, operated the ''Bellona'' and ''Black Prince'' since 1946, of the same ''Dido'' class when they  transferred from the British Pacific fleet, where they provided AW/AD for the RNs aircraft carriers, as part of NZ Defence contribution in 1946\u201354.<ref>Pugsley (2003), p. 422, note 41</ref> Phipps claimed the cruiser's range was limited and it could not even reach [[Panama]] without refueling. However, Captain Phipps also stated when the cruiser reached Auckland, that it was updated, as a most modern warship, with the capability to take \"three targets simultaneously, and shoot down air targets with reasonable frequency often on the first salvo\"<ref>NZ Weekly News, 26 December 1956,' Royalist home for Christmas'.

The cruiser was still a RN cruiser on loan rather than New Zealand's; this reflected the fact the UK did not regard it as an independent force cf the RAN and RCN. Phipps demanded some improvements,<ref>RY257/182 9 April 1956</ref> while in command of {{HMS|Bellona|63|6}} as an accommodation ship, and refused to accept the cruiser until three weeks later than intended by the RN Dockyard until alterations were made to the habitability of the cruiser. These notably included more showers, and some rectification of ventilation problems.\n\nTime was not available to install the pre-wetting, [[CBRN defense|ABC]] spraydown equipment, specifically requested by the RNZN in 1955.<ref>Royalist Proceeding 1956\u201365. NZ National Archives. Wellington. NZ</ref> The ''Royalist'' needed to immediately work up for possible action in the Mediterranean. The dockyard noted that installing spraydown to wash nuclear fallout was possible, providing a wall-size copy of the plan of the pre-wetting system under installation in {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|6}}, and suggested the New Zealand dockyard could do the job. After modernisation, in 1957, ''Sheffield'' operated for only 15 months with the fleet, maintained as a static HQ ship capable of GFS, it had space, comfort, and elaborate staterooms. ''Royalist'' like the other Dido cruisers had a margin, allowing only the 47 officers, a standard cabin. ''Royalist'' offered speed and extra communications systems and an AIO (Action Information Office) fitted late 1943. The ''Dido'' cruiser, HMS ''Scylla'', was also fitted with AIO as Admiral Vian, RN D-Day command ship, severely damaged, 18 days after D day, it never recommissioned, scheduled for post war for reconstruction, with two twin Mk 6 Twin 3/ 70 mounts and  992 radar, defence cuts, in 1947 saw it scrapped in 1950<ref>N.

New Zealand [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (New Zealand)|Department of External Affairs]] viewed the British Treasury as simply getting rid of an obsolescent cruiser and getting New Zealand to pay for the refit and other RN warships ''\"Then Whitehall thought of New Zealand!\"''<ref>McGibbon, 1999, p. 186</ref><ref>Templeton, 1994, p. 124</ref> However, as with ''Bellona'' and ''Black Prince'' in 1946, transferring ''Royalist'' was a logical supplement to Australian defence by the backdoor.By 1955 the RAN had only light 4.5-inch gun Battle and  Daring destroyers (building) and the light anti-submarine carriers, HMAS ''Melbourne'' and Sydney, with obsolete Sea Venom fighters just for Melbourne, the ''Royalist'' provided the only escort for ''Melbourne'' and ''Sydney'' and its surface 82&nbsp;lb shells some deterrence to ''Sverdlov'' or  raiders than light RAN 4.5 battle guns and HMS ''Newfoundland''  (1950\u201352) and HMS ''Tiger'' were, with the ''Royalist'', the only effective cruiser reconstructions. Royalist, alone had all, turrets manned.

In some ways it was faster and more powerful in the air and surface role than HMAS ''Melbourne'', was slow, underpowered, primarily an anti submarine carrier, its  Sea Venom fighters were used to develop Sea Vixen radar and had little speed or weapon capacity. Melbourne like most WW2 RN legacy hulls completed later than 1954, eg, HMCS ''Bonaventure'', HMS ''Ark Royal'' and HMS ''Lion'' had deteriorated too much for sustained fast operation. HMS ''Royalist''{{'}}s close-in air defense of 40&nbsp;mm  STAAG 2 CIWS were initially sharper than other RN warships, and used standard RN 40&nbsp;mm ammunition, but after a few years were a  complicated, maintenance nightmare.<ref>G.

Britain could not afford escorts larger than destroyers in addition to its carrier and frigate force but the 5.25-inch DP guns, fitted to ''Vanguard'', ''Diadem'' and the Gibraltar base as well as ''Royalist'', were accurate unlike the old, twin 4-inch on all other 1950s RN cruisers. ''Royalist'' modernization for AA/AW and particularly AD support of RN carrier fighters and strike aircraft was ideal for [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Musketeer]] and likely future operations of the RN carriers focused on the Indian Ocean and [[Singapore]]. The Type 12 frigates that Phipps wanted were ordered for the RNZN early in 1957, but proved more short-ranged, and with a single manual 4.5-inch twin-gun turret and Limbo mortar were of little value against jet fighter bombers or Soviet nuclear or double-hulled Foxtrot or Juliet submarines, intended for distant patrol. ''Royalist'' could escort convoys across the whole distance at a speed of {{convert|19|kn}}, compared with the Type 12's ability to make the long leg from [[Suva]] to [[Honolulu]] at 10/15.

However RN and British Defence documents released under the 30-year rule, show the refit was to prepare it for all-out hot wars and high-level gun engagement of shadowers,<ref>E. Grove. RN since 1815.

The delay in the cruiser programme, meant most of the cruisers were now, 12 + age and the cost of structural modernisation doubled and reduced the programme to exteded refits for Crown Colony-class cruisers for colonial visits and shore bombardment.  Go ahead for Royalists update and a ten year life extension of the Colony cruiser Ceylon was approved in.1953<ref>E. Grove.2006, p. 225</ref>  HMS ''Royalist was planned  to run with HMS ''Vanguard'' in the Mediterranean. Royalist favoured as a fast, 33k deepwater cruiser, and a good steamer, given the lack of precision in British yards, tools and workers, some ships, of a class, were always better. The Royalist, east of Suez, the ship and four turrets fully manned, thou was a cramped, hard driven proposition compared with a Colony and Town cruisers, which usually only had one 6 inch turret manned and muniitoned.\n\nIn transferring ''Royalist'' to New Zealand, the Royal Navy assumed the RNZN as an extension of the RN and the junior New Zealand service and government following British command. Around 25% of the officers on ''Royalist'' were RN officers on loan or exchange, as were many of the specialist ratings. The RNZN officers on the cruiser were usually of junior experience and had lengthy training with the RN in the UK. Even on the cruiser's final deployment in 1965 on Confrontation patrols in southeast Asia, many RN and RAN officers occupied higher-ranking officer positions on board.<ref>Pugsley, 2003, p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter working up in UK waters, ''Royalist'' was operational with the British fleet in the Mediterranean as the fleet awaited the possibility of action against Egyptian air force during the [[Suez crisis]]. ''Royalist'' was intended to be mainly a radar picket and aircraft direction ship for the RAF [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] and RN carrier-based [[Hawker Sea Hawk|Seahawk]] and [[de Havilland Sea Venom|Sea Venom]] aircraft. ''Royalist'' had the standard RN long-range air warning Type 960 radar carried by other British cruisers and carriers in the area, but ''Royalist'' was somewhat better equipped for aircraft direction than its other counterparts in the area. After hostilities with Egypt commenced, the resulting international outrage caused Prime Minister [[Sidney Holland]] to reverse his support for the British by calling for Captain Peter Phipps to withdraw from operations against Egypt. At that point the only other immediately available replacement, cruiser was, HMS ''Jamaica'', a surface fighting unit without modern AA systems or Royalist's, equipment to process air-warning radar data and 'multiple communication channels' with fleet air arm aircraft. HMNZS ''Royalist'' continued for an indeterminate time as the primary coastal AD ship for the RN/RAF, for possibly 24hrs, till [[HMS Ceylon|HMS ''Ceylon'']] transferred from GFS duty, off Port Said and the risk from Egypt's jet Meteors, Migs and Badger bombers was suppressed. After about a day, HMNZS ''Royalist'' also withdrew from a scheduled bombardment mission in support of a RN destroyer squadron, moved further offshore, away from the main body of the RN fleet (changing identity to the undefined, RNZN cruiser ''Black Swan'' according to some British published accounts) continuing to assist the RN fleet, in its primary passive soft AW/AD/C3 role.<ref name=kyle>Kyle, 1991, pp. 394\u2013395</ref> Holland officially ordered a withdrawal from operations, but had allowed the cruiser to stay with the Operation Musketeer fleet, as, \"there was insufficient time for a decision not to withdraw\", an apparent non-decision.<ref name=kyle/> Much of the Soviet-supplied [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and MiGs of the [[Egyptian Air Force]] remained a threat to the RN fleet, making the presence of ''Royalist'' crucial to fleet defence.<ref>Templeton, 1994, pp. 138\u2013139; & phone interviews, mid 1990s, NZ with Royalist Radar crews (56\u201365)</ref> The reality of the pro Musketter, sentiments of the intensively worked up RNZN/RN crew (told against other options) in which most of the key officer and senior ratting positions were other than Phipps were, RN officers and many of the RNZN officers also essentially, professional RN career officers on the return voyage to New Zealand via South Africa Captain Phipps told the crew they deserved the recognition given to RN personnel for their involvement in the incident.<ref name=\"Pugsley, 2003\">Pugsley, 2003</ref> In the 2000s the New Zealand Labour Government and the RNZN awarded these personnel battle honours for war service in the Mediterranean.

During the transit of the straights, the guns were fully manned with the crews closed up; if the cruiser had been buzzed by Indonesia MiGs or patrol craft, the captain was instructed to take \"precautionary measures\" and not train or elevate the guns or test fire them again during the deployment, a \"diplomatic artifact\" given a scenario of undetectable possible threat of surprise long-range air-launched Kangaroo cruise missile attack from Indonesia Badger bombers<ref>Log of HMS Royalist. 1964.

The ''Victorious'' assertion of the right of innocent passage by a carrier which mounted [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]] aircraft painted in grey anti flash, and believed to be nuclear-armed was viewed as one of the most dangerous moments of the Cold War,<ref>Roberts, 2009, p. 51</ref> with mass panic in Java, but proved a brave and effective move, in asserting rights for naval passage and Malaysian independence.\n\nThere was considerable doubt among RNZN staff whether ''Royalist'', which had not had a major refit since 1956, could deploy again in 1965. It managed to deploy again after a seven-week, 24/7 refit in the Devonport dockyard and work up in the [[Hauraki Gulf]], where it managed {{convert|27|kn}} at half power. The cruiser was still visually impressive, and provided the crucial appearance of capability and ability to operate. It was judged the fire control systems needed either a year's refit or $140,000 of new parts,<ref>Reports and Returns.

HMS ''Royalist'' was still perceived as useful and needed in Plymouth and Singapore, even if it could not run at the 25 knots plus speed a carrier group needed to launch Vixens and Scimitar as an escort for amphibious carriers like HMS ''Albion'' and HMS ''Bulwark'' and it was decided ''Royalist'' would proceed to [[Pearl Harbor]] for a second workup, rather than a longer refit in the Devonport dockyard, before deploying to [[Hong Kong]] and Singapore in support of RN forces. ''Royalist'' conducted anti-infiltration patrols, boarding boats, deployed shore patrols, participated in Exercise Guardrail as the simulated \"enemy Sverdlov cruiser\"<ref>C. Pugsley.

This reflects the general build up in tension with Indonesia, the probable use of weapons by landing parties, the higher grade of main munition preparation and the political support for the mission, but the earlier deployments of ''Royalist'' when its system were more effective were much more important in the tactical and even strategic sense.\n\nThe 1965 deployment was somewhat marred by the refusal of the New Zealand Ministry of External Affairs or the New Zealand and British ambassadors to allow ''Royalist'' to dock with Royal Navy warships in the Tokyo or Yokohama area.<ref>Reports & Returns.

After eleven years in the RNZN, ''Royalist'' reverted to [[Royal Navy]] control in 1967. She was sold for scrap to the Nissho Co, Japan, in November 1967 and was towed from [[Auckland]] to [[Osaka]] on 31 December 1967.\n\n==References==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|first=D.K.|last=Brown|title=The Design and Construction of British Warships, 1939\u20131945.

Light anti-aircraft armament and fire control was also improved. The Bellonas and Royalist, carried 4 rather than 5 twin 5.25 turrets, but increased electronic and radar weight, and the fact aluminium, used to save turret weight in the original Dido, was no longer usable, made it essential to achieve higher fighting effectiveness with fewer turrets. Royalist was further modified after completion with extra facilities and crew for directing carrier aircraft operations. HMS Howe used US provided 275 HADCT for its 5.25 Mk 2 from 1944,and HMS Vanguard from 1946. The tremendous success of the RN fitted T275/Mk 37(1944 USN mod), made the smaller, Bellona's priority for development post war as smaller crewed cruiser destroyers and to replace the twin 4.5 AA, and 5.25 of fleet aircraft carries and battleships post war. The loss of these 16 gun 4.5 or 5.25 platforms from the post war RN was the driving force behind the Royalist postwar update and the Tiger class completion as AA cruisers.\n\n== Development ==\nThe [[Royal Navy]] (RN) intended in late 1943 to use the ''Bellona'' class as flagships for escort-carrier and cruiser groups for the projected [[D-Day]] and [[Operation Dragoon|South of France]] invasions and for operations with the [[United States Navy|USN]] and with the RN Fleet in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. ''Royalist'' was a class of one from the start \u2013 being fitted out, within months of commissioning, with further modifications. These modifications gave it two extra rooms for additional communications (with carriers and with [[Fleet Air Arm]] aircraft) and one of the first implementations of an AIO (Action Information Office or Organisation) \u2013 an early [[Operations Room]] for plotting and display of the tactical position and associated mechanical computers to multiply the effectiveness of its armament. Intended to enhance the vessel's role as a command ship in Northern Atlantic waters for operations against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] and [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']], the extra equipment took the ship to the limit, leaving minimal comfort and sleeping provision for Petty officers and Ratings.<ref name=\"roberts\"/> The wartime development of radar and the requirement to equip ''Royalist'' as a flagship fitted with AIO increased the crew complement from 484 to 600, adding to the discomfort.  {{HMS|Scylla|98|6}}, the other AIO-fitted ''Dido'', was fitted with more compact twin 4.5 turrets. <ref>G.

Postwar the RN rejected encased 4.5 ammunition as too heavy and reverted to separated loading in the Battle, Type 12 and HMS Ark Royal. The USN  rejected hand loading, higher calibre,70lb shells for post war 5/54 guns although France used a mod, manual version twin 5/54USN in two De Grasse, AA Cruisers in 1955-58. The other 4.5-inch-armed ''Dido'', {{HMS|Charybdis|88|6}}, was intended as the second AIO flagship, its loss in France led to the conversion of HMS ''Royalist''.<ref>Brown, 1995, pp. 112\u201313</ref> The ''Dido'' and the ''Improved Dido'' (''Bellona''s) developed from the small ''Arethusa''-class (1936) scout light cruisers, built primarily as a surface fighting fleet and as Mediterranean and trade route cruisers \u2013 and originally designed, 5,500-ton light cruisers \u2013 not scaled-down versions of the RN/RAN Leander/Perth cruisers<ref>\nD.K.

She was launched on 30 May 1942 and commissioned on 10 September 1943. Her motto, ''Surtout Loyal'', translates to \"Loyal above all\".<ref>naval-history.net</ref>\n  \n\n\nThe Royal Navy intended to follow the Bellonas in 1944 with a new N2 class of 5.25 cruisers with 4 twin 12rpm with automatic turrets on a hull the size to the Tigers 55ft x 64 feet and with a desire for balanced small cruisers and speed of 28 knots through new  destroyer engines, much more effective sub division , protection system and space for the crew and fuel. The N2 class was vetoed by First Sea Lord A. Cunningham in Feb 44 as the 5.25 gun was less effective against armoured cruisers than 6 inch cruisers. THe USN rejected this argument and arguing that both both 5/38 (52lb) shell Atlanta cruisers and 5/54 ships with 70lb shell would  destroy destroyers at maximum gun range <ref> N. Freidman. US Cruisers an Illustrated Design History, USNI.(1984) Annapolis,p220 </ref>  and built the three Juneau light cruisers in 1944-46 and nearly ordered a 5/54 batch of Atlanta in 1945. In 1950-1 USS Juneau C119 was rebuilt with modern electronics and fire control for 5/38 and new new 3/50 AA,  rather like Royalist in AA exercises it was better than other USN Cruisers including then new Worchester. But Juneau was seen as an orphan in the fleet and was scrapped while its sisters were being considered for FRAM 1 conversion in 1959-60.\n\n==Royal Navy career==\n[[File:HMS Royalist spitfire.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] of [[807 Naval Air Squadron]] [[Fleet Air Arm]] flying above HMS ''Royalist'' during a training flight from the Royal Naval Air Station at [[HMS Grebe|Dekhelia]], near Alexandria, Egypt in February 1945]]\nFollowing her commissioning, ''Royalist'' spent several months working up, during which time she underwent repairs for trial defects and for alterations and additions. Amongst these were modifications for service as a carrier flagship.<ref>Mason, naval-history.net</ref> In March 1944 ''Royalist'' joined the [[Home Fleet]] and served for a short period in the Arctic theatre. In this capacity she took part in [[Operation Tungsten]], the carrier raid against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|German battleship ''Tirpitz'']] whilst the ''Tirpitz'' was in [[Norway]]. ''Royalist'' was then ordered to the [[Mediterranean]] to support the landings in the south of France ([[Operation Dragoon]]) in August 1944, as part of the escort carrier squadron TF88.1. On 15 September, accompanied by {{HMS|Teazer|R23|6}}, she sank the transports ''KT4'' and ''KT26'' off Cape Spatha. She was then stationed in the [[Aegean Sea]] until late 1944, when she was ordered to the [[East Indies]]. By April 1945 she was with the [[21st Aircraft Carrier Squadron]] as Flagship, supporting the Rangoon landings ([[Operation Dracula]]), and the following month was part of a force that failed to join the [[Battle of the Malacca Strait]] where five Royal Navy destroyers intercepted the Japanese cruiser [[Japanese cruiser Haguro|Haguro]] and the destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Kamikaze (1922)|Kamikaze]] evacuating troops from [[Port Blair]] in the [[Andaman Islands]]. For the remainder of the war she covered the carrier raids against targets in the East Indies and [[Sumatra]].\n\nScottish author [[Alistair MacLean]] served on ''Royalist'' during the Second World War, and used his experiences as background for his acclaimed first novel ''[[HMS Ulysses (novel)|HMS Ulysses]]'' as well as for some of his subsequent works.\n\n==Royal New Zealand Navy career==\n\n''Royalist'' was withdrawn from the East Indies after the conclusion of hostilities, and returned home to be mothballed and dehumidified in 1946. The reconstruction of ''Royalist'' from deep preservation, of a war emergency cruiser, was superior only in the advanced interim fire control fitted with 4-7yrs, to its sister, [[HMS Diadem]] following expensive and controversial rebuild.

The substantial USN electronic warfare fit, similar to the fit on HMAS Yarra and Parammatta in 1961 and the likely reason it survived the 1971 Indo Pakistan war. As with the transfer of Royalist to the RNZN, the transfer of Diadem to Pakistan was due to persuasion by the UK Government and CNS Mountbatten. However the Suez crisis and  [[Duncan Sandys]]1957 Defence review, accelerated the phase out of RN cruisers, downgraded HMS ''Vanguard'' to a  reserve HQ ship displacing, HMS ''Cleopatra'' and HMS ''Dido'', by October 1956,<ref> M. Wright. The Last Battleship. Intruder. Wellington (2018 </ref> and the last RN Bellonas's and Dido's were for disposal in 1957. Their scrapping was debated, in the post Sandy's HL/HC estimates debates. The ''Royalist'' and ''Diadem'' were complex warships, even as built in 1944, like modern 'hot' warships, which after refit and rewiring in 1956 could never really be turned off, for more updating, and had to be kept running with 200 men aboard even in short periods in reserve and refit, and therefore, difficult for small navies, the RNZN and RPN.

A minority of RNZN opinion, including Cpt Phipps, saw it as a policy reversal stopping the RNZN maintaining a 6 frigate fleet, good training conditions and commonality with the RN. The ''Royalist'', with massive RN/USN assistance, however returned 9.5 years, almost continuous service, fortuateously,the Royal Navy, after Suez in 1956, with an \"uncertain, role and future,\", transferred the bulk of the fleet to the Indian and Pacific oceans, from 1957 to 1967 where prior to 1955 there was only a token presence, a couple of cruisers and destroyers. Therefore  ''Royalist'' could be deployed, effectively in 1957, with the RN carrier fleet. A complex specialised,  gunship, with a incomprehensible role, demanding RN officers, zero provision for non-officer comfort and separating 2/5th of the seagoing men of a small Navy from family, for 12\u201315 months deployment.  The ship was handed over to the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]] (RNZN) on 9 July 1956. When Captain [[Peter Phipps]] went to take command of ''Royalist'' in 1955, New Zealand diplomat [[Frank Corner]] showed his own view, when he noted that Phipps agreed that the ship was a [[white elephant]], unsuitable for use in the Pacific. The RNZN had, however, operated the ''Bellona'' and ''Black Prince'' since 1946, of the same ''Dido'' class when they  transferred from the British Pacific fleet, where they provided AW/AD for the RNs aircraft carriers, as part of NZ Defence contribution in 1946\u201354.<ref>Pugsley (2003), p. 422, note 41</ref> Phipps claimed the cruiser's range was limited and it could not even reach [[Panama]] without refueling. However, Captain Phipps also stated when the cruiser reached Auckland, that it was updated, as a most modern warship, with the capability to take \"three targets simultaneously, and shoot down air targets with reasonable frequency often on the first salvo\"<ref>NZ Weekly News, 26 December 1956,' Royalist home for Christmas'.

The cruiser was still a RN cruiser on loan rather than New Zealand's; this reflected the fact the UK did not regard it as an independent force cf the RAN and RCN. Phipps demanded some improvements,<ref>RY257/182 9 April 1956</ref> while in command of {{HMS|Bellona|63|6}} as an accommodation ship, and refused to accept the cruiser until three weeks later than intended by the RN Dockyard until alterations were made to the habitability of the cruiser. These notably included more showers, and some rectification of ventilation problems.\n\nTime was not available to install the pre-wetting, [[CBRN defense|ABC]] spraydown equipment, specifically requested by the RNZN in 1955.<ref>Royalist Proceeding 1956\u201365. NZ National Archives. Wellington. NZ</ref> The ''Royalist'' needed to immediately work up for possible action in the Mediterranean. The dockyard noted that installing spraydown to wash nuclear fallout was possible, providing a wall-size copy of the plan of the pre-wetting system under installation in {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|6}}, and suggested the New Zealand dockyard could do the job. After modernisation, in 1957, ''Sheffield'' operated for only 15 months with the fleet, maintained as a static HQ ship capable of GFS, it had space, comfort, and elaborate staterooms. ''Royalist'' like the other Dido cruisers had a margin, allowing only the 47 officers, a standard cabin. ''Royalist'' offered speed and extra communications systems and an AIO (Action Information Office) fitted late 1943. The ''Dido'' cruiser, HMS ''Scylla'', was also fitted with AIO as Admiral Vian, RN D-Day command ship, severely damaged, 18 days after D day, it never recommissioned, scheduled for post war for reconstruction, with two twin Mk 6 Twin 3/ 70 mounts and  992 radar, defence cuts, in 1947 saw it scrapped in 1950<ref>N.

New Zealand [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (New Zealand)|Department of External Affairs]] viewed the British Treasury as simply getting rid of an obsolescent cruiser and getting New Zealand to pay for the refit and other RN warships ''\"Then Whitehall thought of New Zealand!\"''<ref>McGibbon, 1999, p. 186</ref><ref>Templeton, 1994, p. 124</ref> However, as with ''Bellona'' and ''Black Prince'' in 1946, transferring ''Royalist'' was a logical supplement to Australian defence by the backdoor.By 1955 the RAN had only light 4.5-inch gun Battle and  Daring destroyers (building) and the light anti-submarine carriers, HMAS ''Melbourne'' and Sydney, with obsolete Sea Venom fighters just for Melbourne, the ''Royalist'' provided the only escort for ''Melbourne'' and ''Sydney'' and its surface 82&nbsp;lb shells some deterrence to ''Sverdlov'' or  raiders than light RAN 4.5 battle guns and HMS ''Newfoundland''  (1950\u201352) and HMS ''Tiger'' were, with the ''Royalist'', the only effective cruiser reconstructions. Royalist, alone had all, turrets manned.

In some ways it was faster and more powerful in the air and surface role than HMAS ''Melbourne'', was slow, underpowered, primarily an anti submarine carrier, its  Sea Venom fighters were used to develop Sea Vixen radar and had little speed or weapon capacity. Melbourne like most WW2 RN legacy hulls completed later than 1954, eg, HMCS ''Bonaventure'', HMS ''Ark Royal'' and HMS ''Lion'' had deteriorated too much for sustained fast operation. HMS ''Royalist''{{'}}s close-in air defense of 40&nbsp;mm  STAAG 2 CIWS were initially sharper than other RN warships, and used standard RN 40&nbsp;mm ammunition, but after a few years were a  complicated, maintenance nightmare.<ref>G.

Britain could not afford escorts larger than destroyers in addition to its carrier and frigate force but the 5.25-inch DP guns, fitted to ''Vanguard'', ''Diadem'' and the Gibraltar base as well as ''Royalist'', were accurate unlike the old, twin 4-inch on all other 1950s RN cruisers. ''Royalist'' modernization for AA/AW and particularly AD support of RN carrier fighters and strike aircraft was ideal for [[Operation Musketeer (1956)|Musketeer]] and likely future operations of the RN carriers focused on the Indian Ocean and [[Singapore]]. The Type 12 frigates that Phipps wanted were ordered for the RNZN early in 1957, but proved more short-ranged, and with a single manual 4.5-inch twin-gun turret and Limbo mortar were of little value against jet fighter bombers or Soviet nuclear or double-hulled Foxtrot or Juliet submarines, intended for distant patrol. ''Royalist'' could escort convoys across the whole distance at a speed of {{convert|19|kn}}, compared with the Type 12's ability to make the long leg from [[Suva]] to [[Honolulu]] at 10/15.

However RN and British Defence documents released under the 30-year rule, show the refit was to prepare it for all-out hot wars and high-level gun engagement of shadowers,<ref>E. Grove. RN since 1815.

The delay in the cruiser programme, meant most of the cruisers were now, 12 + age and the cost of structural modernisation doubled and reduced the programme to exteded refits for Crown Colony-class cruisers for colonial visits and shore bombardment.  Go ahead for Royalists update and a ten year life extension of the Colony cruiser Ceylon was approved in.1953<ref>E. Grove.2006, p. 225</ref>  HMS ''Royalist was planned  to run with HMS ''Vanguard'' in the Mediterranean. Royalist favoured as a fast, 33k deepwater cruiser, and a good steamer, given the lack of precision in British yards, tools and workers, some ships, of a class, were always better. The Royalist, east of Suez, the ship and four turrets fully manned, thou was a cramped, hard driven proposition compared with a Colony and Town cruisers, which usually only had one 6 inch turret manned and muniitoned.\n\nIn transferring ''Royalist'' to New Zealand, the Royal Navy assumed the RNZN as an extension of the RN and the junior New Zealand service and government following British command. Around 25% of the officers on ''Royalist'' were RN officers on loan or exchange, as were many of the specialist ratings. The RNZN officers on the cruiser were usually of junior experience and had lengthy training with the RN in the UK. Even on the cruiser's final deployment in 1965 on Confrontation patrols in southeast Asia, many RN and RAN officers occupied higher-ranking officer positions on board.<ref>Pugsley, 2003, p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter working up in UK waters, ''Royalist'' was operational with the British fleet in the Mediterranean as the fleet awaited the possibility of action against Egyptian air force during the [[Suez crisis]]. ''Royalist'' was intended to be mainly a radar picket and aircraft direction ship for the RAF [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] and RN carrier-based [[Hawker Sea Hawk|Seahawk]] and [[de Havilland Sea Venom|Sea Venom]] aircraft. ''Royalist'' had the standard RN long-range air warning Type 960 radar carried by other British cruisers and carriers in the area, but ''Royalist'' was somewhat better equipped for aircraft direction than its other counterparts in the area. After hostilities with Egypt commenced, the resulting international outrage caused Prime Minister [[Sidney Holland]] to reverse his support for the British by calling for Captain Peter Phipps to withdraw from operations against Egypt. At that point the only other immediately available replacement, cruiser was, HMS ''Jamaica'', a surface fighting unit without modern AA systems or Royalist's, equipment to process air-warning radar data and 'multiple communication channels' with fleet air arm aircraft. HMNZS ''Royalist'' continued for an indeterminate time as the primary coastal AD ship for the RN/RAF, for possibly 24hrs, till [[HMS Ceylon|HMS ''Ceylon'']] transferred from GFS duty, off Port Said and the risk from Egypt's jet Meteors, Migs and Badger bombers was suppressed. After about a day, HMNZS ''Royalist'' also withdrew from a scheduled bombardment mission in support of a RN destroyer squadron, moved further offshore, away from the main body of the RN fleet (changing identity to the undefined, RNZN cruiser ''Black Swan'' according to some British published accounts) continuing to assist the RN fleet, in its primary passive soft AW/AD/C3 role.<ref name=kyle>Kyle, 1991, pp. 394\u2013395</ref> Holland officially ordered a withdrawal from operations, but had allowed the cruiser to stay with the Operation Musketeer fleet, as, \"there was insufficient time for a decision not to withdraw\", an apparent non-decision.<ref name=kyle/> Much of the Soviet-supplied [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and MiGs of the [[Egyptian Air Force]] remained a threat to the RN fleet, making the presence of ''Royalist'' crucial to fleet defence.<ref>Templeton, 1994, pp. 138\u2013139; & phone interviews, mid 1990s, NZ with Royalist Radar crews (56\u201365)</ref> The reality of the pro Musketter, sentiments of the intensively worked up RNZN/RN crew (told against other options) in which most of the key officer and senior ratting positions were other than Phipps were, RN officers and many of the RNZN officers also essentially, professional RN career officers on the return voyage to New Zealand via South Africa Captain Phipps told the crew they deserved the recognition given to RN personnel for their involvement in the incident.<ref name=\"Pugsley, 2003\">Pugsley, 2003</ref> In the 2000s the New Zealand Labour Government and the RNZN awarded these personnel battle honours for war service in the Mediterranean.

After eleven years in the RNZN, ''Royalist'' reverted to [[Royal Navy]] control in 1967. She was sold for scrap to the Nissho Co, Japan, in November 1967 and was towed from [[Auckland]] to [[Osaka]] on 31 December 1967.\n\n==References==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|first=D.K.|last=Brown|title=The Design and Construction of British Warships, 1939\u20131945.

The term covers two [[Family (biology)|families]] of animals: the [[Old World porcupine]]s of family '''Hystricidae''', and the [[New World porcupine]]s of family '''Erethizontidae'''. Both families belong to the infraorder [[Hystricognathi]] within the profoundly diverse [[order (biology)|order]] Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this, the two groups were distinct from each other and were not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi.\n\nThe Old World porcupines live in southern [[Europe]], [[Asia]] (western<ref>[http://biblehub.com/topical/p/porcupine.htm Porcupine]. biblehub.com</ref> and southern), and most of [[Africa]]. They were large, terrestrial, and strictly nocturnal. In [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] terms, they form the family Hystricidae.\n\nThe New World porcupines were indigenous to [[North America]] and northern South America. They live in wooded wereas and can climb trees, where some species spend their entire lives. They were less strictly nocturnal than their Old World relatives, and generally smaller. In taxonomic terms, they form the family Erethizontidae.\n\nMost porcupines were about {{convert|25|-|36|in|cm|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, with a {{convert|8|-|10|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} long tail.{{dubious|Old or New World?

Porcupines occur in various shades of brown, grey and white.

Porcupines vary in size considerably: [[Rothschild's porcupine]] of South America weighs less than a kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb); the [[crested porcupine]] found in [[Italy]], [[Sicily]], [[North Africa]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]] can grow to well over {{convert|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The two families of porcupines were quite different, and although both belong to the [[Hystricognathi]] branch of the vast order [[Rodent]]ia, they were not closely related.\n\n===Old World compwered with New World species===\nThe 11 [[Old World porcupine]]s tend to be fairly large, and have spikes grouped in clusters.\n\nThe two subfamilies of [[New World porcupine]]s were mostly smaller (although the [[North American porcupine]] reaches about {{convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} in length and {{convert|18|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}), have their quills attached singly rather than grouped in clusters, and were excellent climbers, spending much of their time in trees. The New World porcupines evolved their spines independently (through [[convergent evolution]]) and were more closely related to several other families of rodents than they were to the Old World porcupines.\n\n===Longevity===\nPorcupines have a relatively high [[longevity]] and had held the record for being the longest-living rodent, with one individual living to 27 years,<ref>Parker, SB (1990) Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals, vol. 4, McGraw-Hill, New York.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> until the record was broken in 2002 by a [[naked mole-rat]] living to 28 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/sageke.2002.21.pe7 |pmid=14602989 |date=May 2002 |last1=Buffenstein |first1=Rochelle |last2=Jarvis |first2=Jennifer U.

A porcupine's colouring aids in part of its defence as most of the predators were [[nocturnal]] and colour blind. A porcupine's markings were black and white. The dark body and coarse hair of the porcupine were a dark brown/black and when quills were raised, present a white strip down its back mimicking the look of a skunk. This, along with the raising of the sharp quills, deters predators. Along with the raising of the quills, porcupines clatter their teeth causing warning noise to let predators know not to come closer. The incisors vibrate against each other, the strike zone shifts back and the cheek teeth clatter. This behaviour is often paired with body shivering which is used to further display the dangerous quills.<ref name=\"NAP\" /> The rattling of quills is aided by the hollow quills at the back end of the porcupine.<ref name=\"Antibiotic\">{{cite journal|last1=Roze, Locke|first1=Uldis, David|title=Antibiotic Properties of Porcupine Quills|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|date=March 1990|volume=16|issue=3|pages=725\u2013734|doi=10.1007/bf01016483|pmid=24263588}}</ref> The use of odor is when the sight and sound have failed.

The term covers two [[Family (biology)|families]] of animals: the [[Old World porcupine]]s of family '''Hystricidae''', and the [[New World porcupine]]s of family '''Erethizontidae'''. Both families belong to the infraorder [[Hystricognathi]] within the profoundly diverse [[order (biology)|order]] Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of quills: despite this, the two groups are distinct from each other and are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi.\n\nThe Old World porcupines live in southern [[Europe]], [[Asia]] (western<ref>[http://biblehub.com/topical/p/porcupine.htm Porcupine]. biblehub.com</ref> and southern), and most of [[Africa]]. They are large, terrestrial, and strictly nocturnal. In [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] terms, they form the family Hystricidae.\n\nThe New World porcupines are indigenous to [[North America]] and northern South America. They live in wooded areas and can climb trees, where some species spend their entire lives. They are less strictly nocturnal than their Old World relatives, and generally smaller. In taxonomic terms, they form the family Erethizontidae.\n\nMost porcupines are about {{convert|25|-|36|in|cm|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, with a {{convert|8|-|10|in|cm|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} long tail.{{dubious|Old or New World?

Same about weight, won't repeat it there.|date=March 2015}} Weighing {{convert|12|-|35|lb|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}, they are rounded, large, and slow, and use [[aposematic]] strategy of defence. Porcupines occur in various shades of brown, grey and white.

Porcupines vary in size considerably: [[Rothschild's porcupine]] of South America weighs less than a kilogram (2.2&nbsp;lb); the [[crested porcupine]] found in [[Italy]], [[Sicily]], [[North Africa]], and [[sub-Saharan Africa]] can grow to well over {{convert|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The two families of porcupines are quite different, and although both belong to the [[Hystricognathi]] branch of the vast order [[Rodent]]ia, they are not closely related.\n\n===Old World compared with New World species===\nThe 11 [[Old World porcupine]]s tend to be fairly large, and have spikes grouped in clusters.\n\nThe two subfamilies of [[New World porcupine]]s are mostly smaller (although the [[North American porcupine]] reaches about {{convert|85|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} in length and {{convert|18|kg|lb|abbr=on|disp=or}}), have their quills attached singly rather than grouped in clusters, and are excellent climbers, spending much of their time in trees. The New World porcupines evolved their spines independently (through [[convergent evolution]]) and are more closely related to several other families of rodents than they are to the Old World porcupines.\n\n===Longevity===\nPorcupines have a relatively high [[longevity]] and had held the record for being the longest-living rodent, with one individual living to 27 years,<ref>Parker, SB (1990) Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals, vol. 4, McGraw-Hill, New York.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> until the record was broken in 2002 by a [[naked mole-rat]] living to 28 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/sageke.2002.21.pe7 |pmid=14602989 |date=May 2002 |last1=Buffenstein |first1=Rochelle |last2=Jarvis |first2=Jennifer U.

A porcupine's colouring aids in part of its defence as most of the predators are [[nocturnal]] and colour blind. A porcupine's markings are black and white. The dark body and coarse hair of the porcupine are a dark brown/black and when quills are raised, present a white strip down its back mimicking the look of a skunk. This, along with the raising of the sharp quills, deters predators. Along with the raising of the quills, porcupines clatter their teeth causing warning noise to let predators know not to come closer. The incisors vibrate against each other, the strike zone shifts back and the cheek teeth clatter. This behaviour is often paired with body shivering which is used to further display the dangerous quills.<ref name=\"NAP\" /> The rattling of quills is aided by the hollow quills at the back end of the porcupine.<ref name=\"Antibiotic\">{{cite journal|last1=Roze, Locke|first1=Uldis, David|title=Antibiotic Properties of Porcupine Quills|journal=Journal of Chemical Ecology|date=March 1990|volume=16|issue=3|pages=725\u2013734|doi=10.1007/bf01016483|pmid=24263588}}</ref> The use of odor is when the sight and sound have failed.

''Stout'' still meant only \"strong\" and it could be related to any kind of beer, as long as it was strong: in the UK it was possible to find \"stout pale ale\", for example. Later, ''stout'' was eventually to be associated only with porter, becoming a synonym of dark beer.\n\nBecause of the huge popularity of porters, brewers made them in a variety of strengths.

Even though a larger proportion of oats in beer can lead to a bitter or astringent taste,<ref>Page 50, ''Stout'', Michael J. Lewis, published 1995 by Brewers Publications, {{ISBN|0-937381-44-6}}</ref> during the [[medieval]] period in Europe, oats were a common ingredient in ale,<ref>Page 49, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref> and proportions up to 35% were standard. Despite some areas of Europe, such as Norway, still clinging to the use of oats in brewing until the early part of the 20th century, the practice had largely died out by the 16th century, so much so that in 1513 [[Tudor period|Tudor]] sailors refused to drink oat beer offered to them because of the bitter flavour.<ref>Page 78, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.lib.hku.hk/az.php|title=Databases|website=Libguides.lib.hku.hk}}</ref>\n\nThere was a revival of interest in using oats during the end of the 19th century, when (supposedly) restorative, nourishing and invalid beers, such as the later milk stout, were popular, because of the association of [[porridge]] with health.<ref>Page 158, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref> Maclay of Alloa produced an Original Oatmalt<!--correct spelling--> Stout in 1895 which used 70% \"oatmalt\", and a 63/- Oatmeal Stout in 1909, which used 30% \"flaked (porridge) oats\".<ref>Pages 59 & 60, ''Old British Beers'', Dr. John Harrison, published 2003 by Durden Park Beer Circle, {{ISBN|0-9517752-1-9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:D Mendocino Oatmeal Stout beer bottle 8286690116 o.jpg|left |thumb|145px|An oatmeal stout from [[Mendocino Brewing Company]], a modern craft brewery founded in 1983.]]\n\nIn the 20th century many oatmeal stouts contained only a minimal amount of oats. For example, in 1936 Barclay Perkins Oatmeal Stout used only 0.5% oats.<ref>Barclay Perkins brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> As the oatmeal stout was parti-gyled with their porter and standard stout, these two also contained the same proportion of oats. (Parti-gyle brewing involves blending the worts drawn from multiple mashes or sparges after the boil to produces beers of different gravities.) The name seems to have been a marketing device more than anything else. In the 1920s and 1930s Whitbread's London Stout and Oatmeal Stout were identical, just packaged differently. The amount of oats Whitbread used was minimal, again around 0.5%.<ref>Whitbread brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> With such a small quantity of oats used, it could only have had little impact on the flavour or texture of these beers.\n\nMany breweries were still brewing oatmeal stouts in the 1950s, for example Brickwoods in Portsmouth, Matthew Brown in Blackburn and Ushers in Trowbridge.<ref>Whitbread Gravity Book, Whitbread Archive in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> When Michael Jackson mentioned the defunct Eldrige Pope \"Oat Malt Stout\" in his 1977 book ''The World Guide to Beer'', oatmeal stout was no longer being made anywhere, but [[Charles Finkel]], founder of Merchant du Vin, was curious enough to commission [[Samuel Smith Brewery|Samuel Smith]] to produce a version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-001674.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter \u2013 Kisses, oats and stouts|website=Beerhunter.com}}</ref> Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout then became the template for other breweries' versions.\n\nOatmeal stouts do not usually taste specifically of oats. The smoothness of oatmeal stouts comes from the high content of proteins, lipids (includes fats and waxes), and gums imparted by the use of oats. The gums increase the viscosity and body adding to the sense of smoothness.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.byo.com/stories/beer-styles/article/indices/11-beer-styles/1194-oatmeal-stout-style |title=Brew Your Own: The How-To Homebrew Beer Magazine \u2013 Beer Styles \u2013 Oatmeal Stout |first=Stephan  |last=Galante |website=Byo.com |date=October 1997 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Oyster stout==\n[[File:Marston's.Oyster.Stout.2012.JPG|right |thumb|165px|[[Marston's Brewery|Marston's]] Oyster Stout]]\n[[Oyster]]s have had a long association with stout.

Despite some areas of Europe, such as Norway, still clinging to the use of oats in brewing until the early part of the 20th century, the practice had largely died out by the 16th century, so much so that in 1513 [[Tudor period|Tudor]] sailors refused to drink oat beer offered to them because of the bitter flavour.<ref>Page 78, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.lib.hku.hk/az.php|title=Databases|website=Libguides.lib.hku.hk}}</ref>\n\nThere was a revival of interest in using oats during the end of the 19th century, when (supposedly) restorative, nourishing and invalid beers, such as the later milk stout, were popular, because of the association of [[porridge]] with health.<ref>Page 158, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Martyn Cornell, published 2003 by Hodder Headline, {{ISBN|0-7553-1164-7}}</ref> Maclay of Alloa produced an Original Oatmalt<!--correct spelling--> Stout in 1895 which used 70% \"oatmalt\", and a 63/- Oatmeal Stout in 1909, which used 30% \"flaked (porridge) oats\".<ref>Pages 59 & 60, ''Old British Beers'', Dr. John Harrison, published 2003 by Durden Park Beer Circle, {{ISBN|0-9517752-1-9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:D Mendocino Oatmeal Stout beer bottle 8286690116 o.jpg|left |thumb|145px|An oatmeal stout from [[Mendocino Brewing Company]], a modern craft brewery founded in 1983.]]\n\nIn the 20th century many oatmeal stouts contained only a minimal amount of oats. For example, in 1936 Barclay Perkins Oatmeal Stout used only 0.5% oats.<ref>Barclay Perkins brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> As the oatmeal stout was parti-gyled with their porter and standard stout, these two also contained the same proportion of oats. (Parti-gyle brewing involves blending the worts drawn from multiple mashes or sparges after the boil to produces beers of different gravities.) The name seems to have been a marketing device more than anything else. In the 1920s and 1930s Whitbread's London Stout and Oatmeal Stout were identical, just packaged differently. The amount of oats Whitbread used was minimal, again around 0.5%.<ref>Whitbread brewing records in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> With such a small quantity of oats used, it could only have had little impact on the flavour or texture of these beers.\n\nMany breweries were still brewing oatmeal stouts in the 1950s, for example Brickwoods in Portsmouth, Matthew Brown in Blackburn and Ushers in Trowbridge.<ref>Whitbread Gravity Book, Whitbread Archive in the London Metropolitan Archives</ref> When Michael Jackson mentioned the defunct Eldrige Pope \"Oat Malt Stout\" in his 1977 book ''The World Guide to Beer'', oatmeal stout was no longer being made anywhere, but [[Charles Finkel]], founder of Merchant du Vin, was curious enough to commission [[Samuel Smith Brewery|Samuel Smith]] to produce a version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-001674.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter \u2013 Kisses, oats and stouts|website=Beerhunter.com}}</ref> Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout then became the template for other breweries' versions.\n\nOatmeal stouts do not usually taste specifically of oats.

In a surprise attack, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Imperial]] forces routed the Ottoman army which was crossing the river. At the cost of a few hundred losses, the Habsburg forces inflicted thousands of casualties on the Ottomans, dispersed the remainder and captured the Ottoman treasure. As an immediate consequence, the Ottoman Empire lost control over [[Banat]], while in the long run, the Habsburg victory at Zenta was the last decisive step that forced the Ottoman Empire into the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] (1699), ending the Ottoman control of large parts of Central Europe.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nAfter the relief of the Habsburg capital in the [[Battle of Vienna]] of 1683, Austria enjoyed great success and by 1688 [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|Belgrade]] and most of the [[Pannonian Plain]] was occupied by the Habsburgs. But as the [[Nine Years' War|war with the French]] demanded more troops, and the new [[grand vizier]] reorganized and reinvigorated the Ottoman Army, the success ended. [[Siege of Belgrade (1690)|Belgrade was recaptured]] by the Ottomans in 1690 and the following year\u2019s campaign was relatively indecisive. Subsequently, the Ottoman army commanded by Sultan [[Mustafa II]] won three consecutive victories at the [[Battle of Lugos]] (1695), [[Battle of Ula\u015f]] (1696), and [[Battle of Cenei]] (1696).\n\nAt the Battle of Zenta in 1697, the Austrians would be led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] in his first independent command; it was to be the first of a series of notable campaigns for the Prince.\n\n==Battle==\n===Opening manoeuvres===\nPrince Eugene was made commander in chief of the Army in the newly conquered Pannonian Plain on 5 July 1697. His army consisted  of 70,000 men at full strength of whom only 35,000 were ready for battle. As the war chest was empty, Eugene had to borrow money in order to pay wages and to create a working medical service.\n\nThe Habsburg Army consisted of German, Austrian, and Hungarian infantry and cavalry forces (approx. 7,000 soldiers).<ref name=\"Military history of Hungary\">Military history of Hungary{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Thanks to [[Palatine]] [[Paul I, 1st Prince Esterh\u00e1zy of Gal\u00e1ntha|Paul Eszterh\u00e1zy]], the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary contributed to Ottoman-Habsburg wars with 20,000 soldiers.<ref>Csorba Csaba - Est\u00f3k J\u00e1nos - Salamon Konr\u00e1d: Magyarorsz\u00e1g K\u00e9pes T\u00f6rt\u00e9nete (History of Hungary in Pictures), Magyar K\u00f6nyvklub (Hungarian Book-Club), [[Budapest]] 1999. {{ISBN|963-548-961-7}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Serb light cavalry and [[Serbian Militia]] conscripts also took part in the coalition.<ref>Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete 1526-1686 (History of Hungary 1526\u20131686) 2. tome, Authors: Zsigmond Pach and \u00c1gnes V\u00e1rkonyi, Akad\u00e9mia Kiad\u00f3 (Akad\u00e9mia Publisher), [[Budapest]] 1985. {{ISBN|963-05-0929-6}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhen news arrived that the Sultan and his army were in Belgrade, Eugene decided to concentrate all his available troops from [[Upper Hungary]] and [[Transylvania]] and started to move his troops towards [[Petrovaradin]]. After the concentration took place, Eugene had an Imperial army of 50,000 to 55,000 men to face the Ottomans. On 18 July, in the village of [[Kolut]], Eugene held a military review of his forces. Soon he left with forces to Petrovaradin via [[Sombor]].<ref name=\"Zvonik\">{{in lang|hr}} [http://www.zvonik.rs/arhiva/177/povijesni.html Zvonik br.177/2009] Stjepan Bereti\u0107: Povijesni kutak - Slankamen i Senta, Accessed Nov 19, 2009<br>\"''Po oslobo\u0111enju od Turaka Hrvati i Srbi su u Somboru... osnovali vojne jedinice...

When Eugene learned of these movements, he decided to force a battle.\n\nOn 11 September 1697, the Ottoman army began to ford the river [[Tisza|Tisa]] (Tisza, Theiss) near [[Senta|Zenta]] (Senta), unaware that the Imperial Army was nearby. The Imperial army was able to surprise and attack the Ottoman forces while they were in  the process of crossing the river. After an artillery bombardment, many Imperial Dragoon regiments dismounted and proceeded to the moat encircling and engaging the Ottoman camp. Ottoman troops behind the entrenchments retreated in confusion to the bridge, which was now overcrowded. Austrian artillery targeted the Ottoman troops and killed many of them. The left flank of the Imperial army attacked, penetrating between the Ottoman left flank and the bridge, cutting off their retreat. At the same time, Imperial forces attacked from the front and, after engaging in close-quarter fighting, broke through the trenches surrounding the Ottoman camp. Barely a thousand Ottoman soldiers escaped. More than 10,000 Ottoman troops drowned in the Tisa river. Up to 20,000 Ottoman soldiers were killed on the battlefield.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole section|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe battle resulted in a spectacular victory for Austria; at the cost of 500 men they had inflicted the loss of thousands of men, 87 cannons, the royal treasure chest and the state seal of the Ottoman Empire. According to ''Prinz Eugen'' (1960, biography) by [[Alexander Lernet-Holenia]], the startled Austrians even captured a train of camels.

In a surprise attack, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Imperial]] forces routed the Ottoman army which was crossing the river. At the cost of a few hundred losses, the Habsburg forces inflicted thousands of casualties on the Ottomans, dispersed the remainder and captured the Ottoman treasure. As an immediate consequence, the Ottoman Empire lost control over [[Banat]], while in the long run, the Habsburg victory at Zenta was the last decisive step that forced the Ottoman Empire into the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] (1699), ending the Ottoman control of large parts of Central Europe.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nAfter the relief of the Habsburg capital in the [[Battle of Vienna]] of 1683, Austria enjoyed great success and by 1688 [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|Belgrade]] and most of the [[Pannonian Plain]] was occupied by the Habsburgs. But as the [[Nine Years' War|war with the French]] demanded more troops, and the new [[grand vizier]] reorganized and reinvigorated the Ottoman Army, the success ended. [[Siege of Belgrade (1690)|Belgrade was recaptured]] by the Ottomans in 1690 and the following year\u2019s campaign was relatively indecisive. Subsequently, the Ottoman army commanded by Sultan [[Mustafa II]] won three consecutive victories at the [[Battle of Lugos]] (1695), [[Battle of Ula\u015f]] (1696), and [[Battle of Cenei]] (1696).\n\nAt the Battle of Zenta in 1697, the Austrians would be led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] in his first independent command; it was to be the first of a series of notable campaigns for the Prince.\n\n==Battle==\n===Opening manoeuvres===\nPrince Eugene was made commander in chief of the Army in the newly conquered Pannonian Plain on 5 July 1697. His army consisted  of 70,000 men at full strength of whom only 35,000 were ready for battle. As the war chest was empty, Eugene had to borrow money in order to pay wages and to create a working medical service.\n\nThe Habsburg Army consisted of German, Austrian, and Hungarian infantry and cavalry forces (approx. 7,000 soldiers).<ref name=\"Military history of Hungary\">Military history of Hungary{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Thanks to [[Palatine]] [[Paul I, 1st Prince Esterh\u00e1zy of Gal\u00e1ntha|Paul Eszterh\u00e1zy]], the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary contributed to Ottoman-Habsburg wars with 20,000 soldiers.<ref>Csorba Csaba - Est\u00f3k J\u00e1nos - Salamon Konr\u00e1d: Magyarorsz\u00e1g K\u00e9pes T\u00f6rt\u00e9nete (History of Hungary in Pictures), Magyar K\u00f6nyvklub (Hungarian Book-Club), [[Budapest]] 1999. {{ISBN|963-548-961-7}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Serb light cavalry and [[Serbian Militia]] conscripts also took part in the coalition.<ref>Magyarorsz\u00e1g t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete 1526-1686 (History of Hungary 1526\u20131686) 2. tome, Authors: Zsigmond Pach and \u00c1gnes V\u00e1rkonyi, Akad\u00e9mia Kiad\u00f3 (Akad\u00e9mia Publisher), [[Budapest]] 1985. {{ISBN|963-05-0929-6}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhen news arrived that the Sultan and his army were in Belgrade, Eugene decided to concentrate all his available troops from [[Upper Hungary]] and [[Transylvania]] and started to move his troops towards [[Petrovaradin]]. After the concentration took place, Eugene had an Imperial army of 50,000 to 55,000 men to face the Ottomans. On 18 July, in the village of [[Kolut]], Eugene held a military review of his forces. Soon he left with forces to Petrovaradin via [[Sombor]].<ref name=\"Zvonik\">{{in lang|hr}} [http://www.zvonik.rs/arhiva/177/povijesni.html Zvonik br.177/2009] Stjepan Bereti\u0107: Povijesni kutak - Slankamen i Senta, Accessed Nov 19, 2009<br>\"''Po oslobo\u0111enju od Turaka Hrvati i Srbi su u Somboru... osnovali vojne jedinice...

In September the Ottomans moved north in an attempt to capture the fortress of [[Szeged]] and the Imperial army followed.\n\nThere were few [[Kuruc]] cavalries in the Ottoman army under [[Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly]], however most of them fought alongside the Austrians.

Map from 17th century.]]\nAfter the capture of Cafer Pasha (Djafer Pasha) by the imperial cavalry, the plan for the siege of Szeged was abandoned and the Sultan decided to return to winter quarters near [[Timi\u015foara]]. When Eugene learned of these movements, he decided to force a battle.\n\nOn 11 September 1697, the Ottoman army began to ford the river [[Tisza|Tisa]] (Tisza, Theiss) near [[Senta|Zenta]] (Senta), unaware that the Imperial Army was nearby. The Imperial army was able to surprise and attack the Ottoman forces while they were in  the process of crossing the river. After an artillery bombardment, many Imperial Dragoon regiments dismounted and proceeded to the moat encircling and engaging the Ottoman camp. Ottoman troops behind the entrenchments retreated in confusion to the bridge, which was now overcrowded. Austrian artillery targeted the Ottoman troops and killed many of them. The left flank of the Imperial army attacked, penetrating between the Ottoman left flank and the bridge, cutting off their retreat. At the same time, Imperial forces attacked from the front and, after engaging in close-quarter fighting, broke through the trenches surrounding the Ottoman camp. Barely a thousand Ottoman soldiers escaped. More than 10,000 Ottoman troops drowned in the Tisa river. Up to 20,000 Ottoman soldiers were killed on the battlefield.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole section|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe battle resulted in a spectacular victory for Austria; at the cost of 500 men they had inflicted the loss of thousands of men, 87 cannons, the royal treasure chest and the state seal of the Ottoman Empire. According to ''Prinz Eugen'' (1960, biography) by [[Alexander Lernet-Holenia]], the startled Austrians even captured a train of camels. The main Ottoman army was scattered and the Austrians gained complete freedom of action in Bosnia, where [[Sarajevo]] was sacked.\n\nBy the terms of the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699, the Austrians forced the sultan [[Mustafa II]] to make peace with the Emperor, and to return all the lands of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (except for [[Banat]] and a small chunk of [[Slavonia|Eastern Slavonia]]) conquered by the Ottomans in the previous 150 years.

Bristol Bay is 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;mi) long and 290&nbsp;km, (180&nbsp;mi) wide at its mouth.  A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the [[Cinder River|Cinder]], [[Egegik River|Egegik]], [[Igushik River|Igushik]], [[Kvichak River|Kvichak]], [[Meshik River|Meshik]], [[Nushagak River|Nushagak]], [[Naknek River|Naknek]], [[Togiak River|Togiak]], and [[Ugashik River|Ugashik]].\n\nUpper reaches of Bristol Bay experience some of the highest tides in the world.  One such reach, the [[Nushagak Bay]] near [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]] and another near [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]] in [[Kvichak Bay]] have tidal extremes in excess of 10&nbsp;m (30&nbsp; ft), ranking them &mdash; and the area &mdash; as eighth highest in the world.  Coupled with the extreme number of shoals, sandbars, and shallows, makes navigation troublesome, especially during the area's frequently strong winds. As the shallowest part of the Bering Sea, Bristol Bay is one of the most dangerous regions for large vessels.\n\n<!--  These features are one reason why the Bristol Bay commercial salmon fishing fleet is limited to 32-foot (10 m) overall keel length.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Also, most of the area is not well documented by nautical charts and navigational aids are sparse.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} I removed this section to the discussion page for further debate and to dispute this \"fact.\"  I'm from Bristol Bay, and there is no citation included in this \"fact,\" which I believe to be false.  ~~~~ -->\n\n== History ==\n[[File:BristolBay3.jpg|thumb|Tundra landscape near Bristol Bay]]\nIn ancient times, much of Bristol Bay was dry and arable, along with much of the [[Bering land bridge|Bering Sea Land Bridge]].  More recently, its proximity to mineral, animal and seafood riches provided an incentive for human habitation along its shoreline. Early Russian and English exploration provided most of the non-native influences of the area. During his voyage through the area in 1778, the famed British navigator and explorer, Captain [[James Cook]] named the area \"in honor of the [[Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol|Admiral Earl of Bristol]]\" in England.\n\n=== Early settlement ===\n[[File:BristolBay4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Shore of Bristol Bay]]\nAfter establishing some temporary settlements in the late 1790s, The [[Russian American Company]] sent exploratory parties to document the coast and nearby inland areas of Bristol Bay. One of these charted the area between the [[Kuskokwim River|Kuskokwim]] and [[Nushagak River]]s. The original Eskimo village at Naknek went through various names as recorded by the Russians after they arrived in the area in 1819 (1821-\u201cNaugeik\u201d; 1880- \u201cKinuyak\u201d; and finally Naknek as named by Russian Navy Captain Tebenkov). Later, in 1819, an [[Aleut people|Aleut]] by the name of Andrei Ustiugov drew the first intensive charts of Bristol Bay.  Additionally, ships of the [[Russian Navy]] conducted extensive surveys of the Bering Sea coastline into the mid-19th century, naming many of the geographical features commonly used today: Capes Constantine, Chichagof, Menshikof and Greig, Mounts [[Veniaminof]] and [[Mount Pavlof|Pavlof]], [[Becharof Lake]], etc. In 1883 the first salmon cannery was open in Bristol Bay\u201d <ref>https://www.nps.gov/lacl/learn/historyculture/upload/Canneries-Cabins-Caches-508-compliant-Sept-2015-low-res.pdf</ref> (Source information from the cannery article to give context on the expansion of the salmon industry in Alaska and the history of growth.\n\nThe influence of the Katmai Volcano Explosion in 1912 and the influenza epidemic in 1919 decimated the Naknek people and area.

This was to ensure a 50% escapement of the spawning salmon, to guarantee their sustainability.\n\nThe Japanese fleet was composed of diesel-powered steel vessels. The Japanese had a technological advantage over the American fisherman and dominated the bay that summer.\n\nIn 1938, the United States agreed with Japan that the Japanese would refrain from fishing in Alaskan waters. This agreement was honored until Japan and the United States entered World War 2. In the 1950s, Japan was strengthening its fishing presence in the Pacific; the US, Canada, and Japan passed the North Pacific Fisheries Treaty. This treaty managed the resources of the region jointly to preserve the future generations of fish. This agreement is the model for international fisheries regulations today.<ref>http://www.visitbristolbay.com/visitor-guide/cultures.html</ref>\n\n== Industry ==\n[[File:BristolBay5.jpg|thumb|Nushagak River, draining into Bristol Bay]]\n\nBristol Bay is home to the world's most abundant [[sockeye salmon]] [[fishery]] as well as strong runs of chum salmon, silver salmon, and king salmon, each occurring seasonally.<ref>La Ganga, Maria L. (December 16, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-bristol-bay-leases-20141216-story.html \"Obama protects Alaska's Bristol Bay from oil and gas drilling\"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref>  Kings are usually the first to run up the river followed by reds and chums.  Silvers and Pinks are the last to run up the river.\nOn an international scale, sockeye salmon are a relatively rare creature. Like other wild salmon species, sockeye harvests fluctuate but comprise 4 to 7 percent of global salmon production and 13 to 20 percent of native salmon harvests. Between 2011 and 2014, sockeye accounted for 5 percent of the world's salmon harvest by volume and 15 percent of the world's wild salmon harvest.\n\n===Commercial fishing===\nBristol Bay is home to the world's largest salmon run. All five Eastern Pacific species spawn in the bay's freshwater tributaries. Commercial fisheries include the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareabristolbay.main</ref> The Kvijack drains from Lake Iliamna, which is downstream of the deposit. Along with herring and other fisheries, salmon account for nearly 75% of local jobs.\n\nDuring the first 50 years of commercial salmon fishing in Bristol Bay, the fishing boats were restricted to sail power. When this restriction lifted in 1951, it took only seven short years to outfit all the boats (approximately 1,500) with diesel or gas engines. In the late 1920s another law was passed restricting the length of the boats to 32 feet. This law holds true even today.<ref>http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=commercialbyareabristolbay.main</ref>\n\n=== Canneries ===\nBristol Bay is a remote part of Alaska. The canneries preserve the freshness of the salmon which are gutted, cleaned, and processed on site. These companies have established a presence in Bristol Bay.\n\nCanneries include North Pacific Seafoods,Togiak Seafoods, Bristol Bay Setnet, Friedman Family Fisheries, Peter Pan Seafoods, Ekuk Fisheries, Big Creek Shore plant, Coffee Point Seafood, Icicle Seafoods, Wild Premium Salmon, Seafood Enterprises of Alaska, Alaska General Seafoods, Alaska Salmon Wild, Da Kine Enterprise, Extreme Salmon, Great Ruby Fish, My Girl, Naknek Family Fisheries, North Pacific Seafoods, Ocean Beauty, Silver Bay Seafoods, Trident Seafoods, Tulchina Fisheries, Diamond Lodge Smokehouse, and Nakeen Homepack.\n\n[[File:Bristol Bay shore.jpg|thumb|left|Shore of Bristol Bay near [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]]]]\nMajor industries are [[commercial fishing]] and the associated canneries, [[sport fishing]], [[hunting]] and [[tourism]].  The number of business lodges, hunting- and fishing-resorts and visitors to the nearby [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] has grown exponentially in recent years. Sports fishing is another important local industry. Many lodges cater to sport fishermen targeting the salmon and trout populations in the freshwater tributaries. Freshwater species include humpback whitefish (Coregonus pidschianpp), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma), and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).[18]\n\nThe area has also experienced significant interest in oil and mineral development, most notably with the proposed [[Pebble Mine]] on the north shore of [[Iliamna Lake]], and auctioning of leases to tracts in the southern Bristol Bay area known as the [[North Aleutians Basin]], an area which has been closed to offshore oil and gas development since a moratorium in 1998.  The draft plan by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (pending public comments until 2/5/2007), also proposes to open most of the BLM's {{convert|3600000|acres}} in the area to [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock mining]] and oil and gas drilling.\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:BristolBay1.jpg|thumb|upright|Abandoned cabin on Bristol Bay]]\nThe three largest communities of the Bristol Bay area are [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]], [[King Salmon, Alaska|King Salmon]], and [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]].

Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC staked a claim on the site in 2001 and with its partners, invested 500 million dollars into the project. The mining company lost all of its partners in 2011 due to increasing government regulations and distrust by its partners.\n\nBecause of the estimated 10 billion tons of mining waste that must be permanently stored in the area, which is an active earthquake zone, and Rio Tinto's environmental track record, which is seen as poor by many environmental advocacy groups, fears have been raised about the potential impact on the Bristol Bay area and its wildlife and residents. In April 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an assessment of the impact of the proposed mining operations on fisheries, wildlife, and native Alaska tribes.<ref>[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] [http://www2.epa.gov/bristolbay Proposal to Protect the Bristol Bay Watershed]</ref> Between 2014 and May 2017, Pebble sued the EPA several times. The company argued the EPA unfairly assumed the scope of the mine before it formally filed mining plans. Northern Dynasty Minerals LLC. accused the government agency of colluding with anti-mine activists to reach its conclusions.<ref>http://www.akbizmag.com/Alaska-Business-Monthly/November-2017/Pebble-Mine-Update/</ref>\n\nOn July 30th 2019, the EPA withdrew their preemptive proposed determination to restrict use of the pebble deposit area as a disposal site.<ref>https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-withdraws-outdated-preemptive-proposed-determination-restrict-use-pebble-deposit</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Bristol Bay Borough]]\n*[[Lake and Peninsula Borough]]\n*[[Naknek, Alaska]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Bristol Bay}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051107073559/http://www.naco.org/Template.cfm?Section=Find_a_County&Template=%2Fcffiles%2Fcounties%2Fcounty.cfm&id=2164 Lake & Peninsula Borough]\n*[http://www.theborough.com/ Bristol Bay Borough]\n*[http://www.lpsd.com/ Lake and Peninsula School District]\n*[http://www.bristolbayalliance.com/ Bristol Bay Alliance]\n*[http://www.bbna.com Bristol Bay Native Association]\n*[http://www.savebristolbay.org Save Bristol Bay]\n*[http://www.renewableresourcescoalition.org Renewable Resources Coalition]\n*[http://www.bristolbaywild.com Bristol Bay Wild]\n*[http://www.pebblewatch.com Pebble Watch by Bristol Bay Native Corporation]\n*[https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/1014 Arnold Haverlee Manuscripts] at Dartmouth College Library\n\n=== Technical reports ===\n*[http://library.state.ak.us/asp/edocs/2007/04/ocn131417018.pdf  Abundance, age, sex, and size statistics for Pacific herring in the Togiak district of Bristol Bay, 2004 / by Chuck Brazil.] Hosted by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012120420/http://library.state.ak.us/asp/ Alaska State Publications Program]\n*[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo6530 Mineral Investigations in the Bristol Bay Mining District Study Area, Southwest Alaska] [[Bureau of Land Management]]\n\n{{coord|57|40|N|159|50|W|dim:500000_region:US-AK_type:waterbody|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Bays of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Bristol Bay Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Dillingham Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Bays of the Bering Sea]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Bristol Bay.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of Bristol Bay]]\n[[File:BristolBay2.jpg|thumb|[[Packraft]]s on Nushagak Bay]]\n[[File:Bristol Bay Fisherman.jpg|thumb|Bristol Bay fisherman]]\n'''Bristol Bay''' (''Iilgayaq'' in [[Yupik language|Central Yup'ik]], {{lang-ru|\u0417\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432 \u0411\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439}}<ref>[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Alaska_1844.jpg \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u041b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0440\u044f \u0438 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043a\u0435\u0430\u043d\u0430 (1844)]</ref>) is the eastern-most arm of the [[Bering Sea]], at 57\u00b0 to 59\u00b0 North 157\u00b0 to 162\u00b0 West in [[Southwest Alaska]]. Bristol Bay is 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;mi) long and 290&nbsp;km, (180&nbsp;mi) wide at its mouth.  A number of rivers flow into the bay, including the [[Cinder River|Cinder]], [[Egegik River|Egegik]], [[Igushik River|Igushik]], [[Kvichak River|Kvichak]], [[Meshik River|Meshik]], [[Nushagak River|Nushagak]], [[Naknek River|Naknek]], [[Togiak River|Togiak]], and [[Ugashik River|Ugashik]].\n\nUpper reaches of Bristol Bay experience some of the highest tides in the world.  One such reach, the [[Nushagak Bay]] near [[Dillingham, Alaska|Dillingham]] and another near [[Naknek, Alaska|Naknek]] in [[Kvichak Bay]] have tidal extremes in excess of 10&nbsp;m (30&nbsp; ft), ranking them &mdash; and the area &mdash; as eighth highest in the world.  Coupled with the extreme number of shoals, sandbars, and shallows, makes navigation troublesome, especially during the area's frequently strong winds. As the shallowest part of the Bering Sea, Bristol Bay is one of the most dangerous regions for large vessels.\n\n<!--  These features are one reason why the Bristol Bay commercial salmon fishing fleet is limited to 32-foot (10 m) overall keel length.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} Also, most of the area is not well documented by nautical charts and navigational aids are sparse.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} I removed this section to the discussion page for further debate and to dispute this \"fact.\"  I'm from Bristol Bay, and there is no citation included in this \"fact,\" which I believe to be false.  ~~~~ -->\n\n== History ==\n[[File:BristolBay3.jpg|thumb|Tundra landscape near Bristol Bay]]\nIn ancient times, much of Bristol Bay was dry and arable, along with much of the [[Bering land bridge|Bering Sea Land Bridge]].  More recently, its proximity to mineral, animal and seafood riches provided an incentive for human habitation along its shoreline. Early Russian and English exploration provided most of the non-native influences of the area. During his voyage through the area in 1778, the famed British navigator and explorer, Captain [[James Cook]] named the area \"in honor of the [[Augustus Hervey, 3rd Earl of Bristol|Admiral Earl of Bristol]]\" in England.\n\n=== Early settlement ===\n[[File:BristolBay4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Shore of Bristol Bay]]\nAfter establishing some temporary settlements in the late 1790s, The [[Russian American Company]] sent exploratory parties to document the coast and nearby inland areas of Bristol Bay. One of these charted the area between the [[Kuskokwim River|Kuskokwim]] and [[Nushagak River]]s. The original Eskimo village at Naknek went through various names as recorded by the Russians after they arrived in the area in 1819 (1821-\u201cNaugeik\u201d; 1880- \u201cKinuyak\u201d; and finally Naknek as named by Russian Navy Captain Tebenkov).

She soon impressed her superiors and, after she had joined the [[Nazi Party]] on 1 April 1941, was elevated to the rank of a ''SS-Oberaufseherin'' in April 1942.

According to some accounts, Mandl often stood at the gate into Birkenau waiting for an inmate to turn and look at her: any who did were taken out of the lines and never heard from again. At Auschwitz, Mandl was known as '''''The Beast''''', and for the next two years she participated in selections for death and other documented abuses.

On 15 May 1939, along with other guards and prisoners, Mandl was sent to the newly opened [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp]] near [[Berlin]]. She soon impressed her superiors and, after she had joined the [[Nazi Party]] on 1 April 1941, was elevated to the rank of a ''SS-Oberaufseherin'' in April 1942. She oversaw daily roll calls, assignments for ''Aufseherinnen'' and punishments such as beatings and [[flogging]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nOn 7 October 1942, Mandl was assigned to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Auschwitz II-Birkenau|Auschwitz II-Birkenau]] camp  where she succeeded [[Johanna Langefeld]] as ''SS-Lagerf\u00fchrerin'' of the women camp under ''SS-Kommandant'' [[Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df]]. As a woman she could never outrank a man,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} but her control over both female prisoners and her female subordinates was absolute. The only man Mandl reported to was the commandant.

According to some accounts, Mandl often stood at the gate into Birkenau waiting for an inmate to turn and look at her: any who did were taken out of the lines and never heard from again. At Auschwitz, Mandl was known as '''''The Beast''''', and for the next two years she participated in selections for death and other documented abuses.
