The parish is surrounded by state forests. It is very close to the famous Hindu pilgrimage centers of the Sabarimala Sri [[Ayyappa]] Temple and the Nilackal Temple. The first church of Catholics has been established in the year 1956 and it was dedicated to St George. Recently the new church building has been constructed and the church has been dedicated in the name of St Thomas. This is done to show case that the Catholics of this are too are part of St Thomas Christian community which traces its origin to the arrival of St Thomas. The church renaming has been done to attract the pilgrims as the location is near to Nilackal/Chayal.\n\nThere are 325 Christian families and about 1850 members in the parish.

The apostle reached [[Nilakkal]] at 52&nbsp;AD and started a Christian Community here. At that time, Nilackal was a 'Trade City' having trade relations with \"Pandi-chola\" states and 'Venadu'. There were 'Palace Roads' from their countries to 'Nilackal Thavalam' which were illumined by great lights (ex. Keralachaitram : K.P. Padmanabhan P. 145. Thiruvithamcore State mannel Vol. 1-p.&nbsp;665 Vol. 2-p.&nbsp;128)\nSince Nilackal was a vast region, there were many Christian churches here. Place here were known after the churches there. Even now places in the forests are called [[Plappally]], Thulappally etc. The head Church of all these small churches was called 'Thalappally and later as Thulappally. (cfr. History of Christianity in Kerala by Nagamayyas P. 136). Old tombs of Christians are seen even now in the forest area near the present church unfortunately the invasion of some alien force called 'Vakkrippali attack' the inhabitants of Nilackal fled to other places such as Kanjirappally, Aruvithura, and other parts of the Meenachil . Nilackal is also called 'Chayal' since the place slopes towards the River 'Pampa'.<ref>{{cite web|last1=history|title=Parish History|url=http://www.smcim.org/church/nilackal/article/341}}</ref>\n\nAfter a long time migration started to these remote places. It started as early as 1938. The recession felt in the socio-economic spheres after the first world war stimulated the migration to the hilly regions from the places. The majority of the immigrants were Nasranis of Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian church (One of the St Thomas Christian Church)  and non \u2013 Christians, a substantial number of Catholics also came to those Hillocks. They soon felt the strong need for a Church to meet their spiritual as well as social needs.\n\nA Catholic parish was set up under the leadership of Fr. George Ponnadathukallel. This church was actually dedicated for St George. They offered the first Qurbana in a temporary chapel on 12 February 1955. In 1960 it was officially given the status of a parish and Fr. Joseph Kalayil was appointed as the first Vicar.\n\n===New church===\n[[File:St.George Church.jpg|thumb|The old church]]\nThe name of the church was St. George from 1956 to 2007.

The parish is surrounded by state forests. It is very close to the famous Hindu pilgrimage centers of the Sabarimala Sri [[Ayyappa]] Temple and the Nilackal Temple. The first church of Catholics has been established in the year 1956 and it was dedicated to St George. Recently the new church building has been constructed and the church has been dedicated in the name of St Thomas. This is done to show case that the Catholics of this are too are part of St Thomas Christian community which traces its origin to the arrival of St Thomas. The church renaming has been done to attract the pilgrims as the location is near to Nilackal/Chayal.\n\nThere are 325 Christian families and about 1850 members in the parish. Around 250 children attend the Sunday catechesis. it has four shrines.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parish of Angelvalley was once the part of the parish. At the time of its formation, Angelvalley had around 250 families from the Nilackal, Thulapally parish.\n\nThe parish is divided into seventeen small groups called ''Koottayma'', each  known after a Biblical place such as Jerusalem, Jordan, Emmaus, Hermon, Kapharnaum, Saini, Corinthose, Thesalonica, Nazareth, Alphonsa, Chavara, Galathia, Carmel and Calvary. Nazareth and Carmel have A and B sections. Each of these groups meet weekly for prayer and study classes.\n\nParish social works are arranged under the 'Malanadu Development Society' which is the social service organization of the Diocese of Kanjirappally. Fifty S.H.G.s (Self Help Groups) get help from the M.D.S. Unit. It has a rural electrification system called 'Malanadu Mycro Hydel Power Project' Thulappally (M.H.P.P.). This power project generates electricity from water and supplies about 250 families, and  shops, clinics, temples, mosques and churches. The parish helps milk-producing farmers to sell their milk under M.M.P. (Mahima Milk Producers Union). Under the leadership of M.D.S. Unit of the parish the people of Pampavalley made the longest Rubberized Road in [[Asia]], two large bridges across the rivers Pampa and Azhuta, built many small bridges etc.\n\nA government Primary School called St. Georges L.P.S.

The apostle reached [[Nilakkal]] at 52&nbsp;AD and started a Christian Community here. At that time, Nilackal was a 'Trade City' having trade relations with \"Pandi-chola\" states and 'Venadu'. There were 'Palace Roads' from their countries to 'Nilackal Thavalam' which were illumined by great lights (ex. Keralachaitram : K.P. Padmanabhan P. 145. Thiruvithamcore State mannel Vol. 1-p.&nbsp;665 Vol. 2-p.&nbsp;128)\nSince Nilackal was a vast region, there were many Christian churches here. Place here were known after the churches there. Even now places in the forests are called [[Plappally]], Thulappally etc. The head Church of all these small churches was called 'Thalappally and later as Thulappally. (cfr. History of Christianity in Kerala by Nagamayyas P. 136). Old tombs of Christians are seen even now in the forest area near the present church unfortunately the invasion of some alien force called 'Vakkrippali attack' the inhabitants of Nilackal fled to other places such as Kanjirappally, Aruvithura, and other parts of the Meenachil . Nilackal is also called 'Chayal' since the place slopes towards the River 'Pampa'.<ref>{{cite web|last1=history|title=Parish History|url=http://www.smcim.org/church/nilackal/article/341}}</ref>\n\nAfter a long time migration started to these remote places. It started as early as 1938. The recession felt in the socio-economic spheres after the first world war stimulated the migration to the hilly regions from the places. The majority of the immigrants were Nasranis of Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian church (One of the St Thomas Christian Church)  and non \u2013 Christians, a substantial number of Catholics also came to those Hillocks. They soon felt the strong need for a Church to meet their spiritual as well as social needs.\n\nA Catholic parish was set up under the leadership of Fr. George Ponnadathukallel. This church was actually dedicated for St George. They offered the first Qurbana in a temporary chapel on 12 February 1955. In 1960 it was officially given the status of a parish and Fr. Joseph Kalayil was appointed as the first Vicar.\n\n===New church===\n[[File:St.George Church.jpg|thumb|The old church]]\nThe name of the church was St. George from 1956 to 2007. The new church was blessed on 17 January 2007 along with new Name '''Mar Thoma Sleeha Church, Nilackal Thulappally'''. Fr.Martin Uppukunnel who was the vicar from 2002 to 2007 lead the work of the new church.

However, on 30 August, Shrewsbury's council agreed a policy of non-resistance to the King.<ref>Coulton, p.90</ref> Although this was far short of outright support, Ottley used it to encourage the King to march to Shrewsbury from his initial muster at [[Nottingham]]. The Royalist army occupied the town from 20 September until 12 October, overwhelming all resistance, and subjecting the town and surrounding areas to the looting and extortion of the ill-paid soldiery.<ref>Sherwood, p.5-6</ref> Ottley, now knighted, was left in control of the town, although he was not formally made governor until January 1643.\n\n===Formation of the dragoons===\n\nIn December Corbet a number of Shropshire gentry resolved to establish a [[regiment]] of  [[dragoon]]s.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/322/mode/2up Corbet, pp. 323\u2013324]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>We whose names are hereunder written, do hereby engage ourselves, each to the other, and promise upon the faith and word of a Gentleman, that we will do our utmost endeavours, both by ourselves and friends, to raise as well for the defence of our King and country as our own particular safeties, one entire Regiment of dragooners, and with our lives to defend those men's fortunes and families, who shall be contributors herein to their abilities. And for the most speedy expedition of the said service, we have thought fit to entreat Sir Vincent Corbet, formerly Captain of the Horse for this County, to be our chief commander over the aforesaid Regiment.</blockquote>\n\nThe signatories were headed by [[Sir Richard Lee, 2nd Baronet]], MP for Shropshire until expelled by Parliament, and included Ottley, the governor.\n\nA muster was held at Battlefield, north of Shrewsbury, on 20 December. Great hopes were placed on the regiment, which was expected to recruit a thousand men. Only later did it become public that the recruiting drive had been largely unsuccessful, with only 60 responding initially.<ref name=pickstock>[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/corbettonenamestudy/First/People/dragoon.htm Stephen Pickstock: Sir Vincent Corbet, His Dragoons] at The Corbett One Name Study, accessed 31 October 2013</ref> However, Corbet and his men were summoned to the fighting in [[Cheshire]] in January.\n\n===First blood===\n[[File:Portrait of Orlando Bridgeman by Robert White 1682.jpg|thumb|Orlando Bridgeman, portrayed in later life as a distinguished judge.

The attempt to use Shropshire troops in Cheshire was dogged from the start by rivalries and poor communications. [[Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], the chief justice and effective deputy governor of Chester, rehearsed these problems in a letter to Sir Francis Ottley on 20 January:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofsh1894shro#page/n187/mode/2up Phillips, p.60-62]</ref> Corbet, he complained, had been instructed to advance from [[Whitchurch, Shropshire]] to [[Tarporley]], well inside Cheshire, but had refused on the grounds that his force was too small. Bridgeman urged Ottley to appeal to the Shropshire gentry for reinforcements, as he believed an attack by [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], the main Parliamentarian commander in the region, imminent. However, John Harrington, a relative of Ottley, made clear the hopelessness of such a recruitment strategy in a letter of 25 January:<ref name=\"Phillips, p.64\">[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofsh1894shro#page/n195/mode/2up Phillips, p.64]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I find that our County and Especially these parts are very slow to keep themselves secure and to satisfie the com'on expectation, the Divells have got possession of the Swyne and they are running into their own Ruin, I see very well that the design of raising a Thousand Dragoons is in a manner quashed every Hundred is to find 10 and every Alottment according to their proportions, but suppose they delude you they will say much and do nothing (as it seems many have done in this expedition of Sir Vincent Corbett) what will you do then?</blockquote>\n\nCorbet joined forces with [[Sir Thomas Aston, 1st Baronet]], hoping that reinforcements would arrive. On 28 January Bridgeman wrote to Shrewsbury, preparing Ottley for bad news:<ref name=\"Phillips, p.64\"/> Aston had moved toward Stafford and Brereton had slipped into [[Nantwich]] behind him. Later the same day, Aston wrote to explain what had happened: approaching what they thought was the friendly town of Nantwich, they had found it occupied by about 140 Parliamentarians. After a couple of attempts to storm the town, they withdrew to regroup, only to come face to face with Brereton's main force. They fought their way through: \"both sides are loosers, what wee know not, night being theyre, friend our enemy.\" Aston requested [[musketeer]]s to make good their losses. Corbet's account, written the following morning at [[Market Drayton]], also sought to portray the encounter as a draw, but ominously asked not for soldiers but surgeons.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofsh1894shro#page/n201/mode/2up Phillips, pp. 67\u201368]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This in hast, is onely to give you notice, of a skirmish we had, w<sup>th</sup> Breartons and y<sup>e</sup> Nantwich forces, I cannot as yet certify of any p'ticular passage, onely thus far be satisfied for y<sup>e</sup> present; the relation of it is not very good neither is it very bad, this much I would request you y<sup>t</sup> w<sup>th</sup> all Speede, you will send unto Whitchurch all y<sup>e</sup> Churgieons you can possible p'vide for wee are in gr<sup>t</sup> want of them.</blockquote>\n\nBrereton's account of the skirmish<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n243/mode/2up Corbet, p.326-7]</ref> avers that the force he sent to occupy Nantwich was a mere fifty dragoons. When the Royalists tried to lay an ambush, the local people kept the Parliamentarians informed. When, his main force confronted the Royalists, who betrayed their own position by their lighted musket matches, Corbet's dragoons \"were presentlie disordered and many of them ran awaye withoute ever giving fire.\" He thought Aston was wounded and both he and Corbet had been captured briefly but were able to escape under cover of darkness to [[Over, Cheshire|Over]], abandoning their arms in the process. He considered his own troops' performance \"far beyonde what could bee expected of us,\" considering that they had just marched from [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]]. The participants differed little over facts but considerably over interpretation. The behaviour of the Royalist commanders led to accusations of cowardice, but was just as easily interpreted as prudence.<ref name=pickstock/> Certainly Corbet's disobedience at Whitchurch the previous week had saved his small force from being completely cut off in hostile territory. Harrington again pointed out the obvious weaknesses: \"I was hartily sorry to see S'<sup>r</sup> Vincent Corbett so poorly furnished with raw Soldiers and Young Commanders.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofsh1894shro#page/n205/mode/2up Phillips, p.69]</ref>\n\n===Campaigns===\n\nCorbet's force seems to have grown in size and experience and was in regular service around Whitchurch during March,  suffering considerable losses.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n243/mode/2up Corbet, p.326]</ref> In May a Parliamentarian raiding party surprised Corbet's force at dusk at Market Drayton,\n\n<blockquote>entered the towne theye havinge neither garde nor scouts abroad (but secure as theye thoughte).

And alsoe three ensignes, four drums and other weapons. But Sir Vincent fled in his shirte and wascot, leaving his app'all behind him which Capt: Whitney had with his money and many letters in his pockett.<ref name=corb328>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n247/mode/2up Corbet, p. 328]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, experience was making Corbet's force more effective, so that Brereton remarked of one encounter: \"the Shropshire horse and Dragoons came on with great resolution and boldness, and in very good order.\" In July Corbet was authorised to raise a thousand [[infantry]]. The enlarged and more versatile force was able to make a much more effective contribution to Royalist efforts in the region, where the tide of battle flowed to and fro constantly, but the progress of the war was ultimately a question of taking and holding ground, particularly the patchwork of fortresses and strongpoints. The propaganda war was also important in holding territory and populations, and Ottley at Shrewsbury was accused by Royalist headquarters at Oxford of slacking in the face of a torrent of Parliamentarian newspapers and [[pamphlets]].<ref name=odnb>{{Cite ODNB|id=20940|title=Ottley, Sir Francis|author=Wright, Stephen}}Subscription required: free to most UK public library members.</ref>\n\nParliament had been reorganising to retake Shropshire, establishing a Parliamentary committee for the county in February.<ref>Coulton, p.96</ref> It contained two Corbets: Sir John Corbet and  [[Robert Corbet (died 1676)]],<ref>Coulton, p. 95</ref> Sir Vincent's first cousin.<ref name=gr136/> In April it was federated with its counterparts in [[Warwickshire]] and [[Staffordshire]], and in late summer, the support of Brereton allowed the committee to gain its first foothold in its native county, at the unfortified market town of [[Wem]].<ref>Sherwood, p. 64</ref>  By the autumn, the Royalists had regained the initiative in the region but both Wem and Nantwich withstood repeated assaults. Early in 1644 [[Prince Rupert]] brought a large cavalry force to the area, ousted Ottley and set about reconquering Shropshire and Cheshire.<ref>Coulton, p. 98</ref> The Royalists did well while he was present, but he was constantly diverted to other crises, and the Parliamentarians made steady gains when the pressure was off. An incident involving Sir Vincent Corbet, probably in the early summer, illustrates his continuing humanity and respect for family in a situation of now total war. Under a Parliamentary ordinance, 13 captured Irish soldiers had been hanged. Subsequently, some parliamentarians were captured by Rupert's forces and he ordered 13 to be hanged as a reprisal.\n\n<blockquote>They cast the dice on a drum head, to see who should dye, and amongst them there was one Phillip Litleton, who had been servant and keeper of the parke to my old master, Robert Corbett of Stanwardine, Esqr. This Phillip saw Sir Vincent Corbett, of Morton Corbett, ride by, and said to some that stood by, \"if Sir Vincent Corbett did know that I were here, hee would save my life.\" Upon this a charitable soldier roade after Sir Vincent and told him what one of the prisoners sayed. Hee came back immediately, and seeing Phillip, hee alighted from his horse and fell on his knees beefore the Prince, (who sate there on horsebacke to see the execution,) and beggd for the life of Phillip, which was readily granted on condition hee would never beare arms against the King. Phillip promised and escaped, and afterwards noe more Irish were hangd.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesmemo00gouggoog#page/n48/mode/2up Gough, p.42]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe seems to have spent the summer and autumn of 1644 fighting to hold back the slow Parliamentarian advance while constantly hampered by lack of accurate information or clear strategy. A letter of 23 August reflects this constant chasing of rumours.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n251/mode/2up Corbet, p.332]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This morning I heard from Wem and there strength is not above five hundered foote and foure troopes of Horse theire largest peece is two thousand weight, ye other two are small ones they make noe preparation for removing yet. but as soone as they doe I hope to have intelligence they brag much and threaten hard yt they will swallow us all up with yt greate gun, but in this place we feare them not, depending upon your releefe.

However, Corbet was not at home when it fell to Wem's small garrison in September 1644. The operation was led by William Reinking, a Dutch professional soldier retained by the Parliamentarians.<ref name=\"Corbet, p.335-6\">[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n253/mode/2up Corbet, p.335-6]</ref> Mounting one of the fortifications by surprise, five determined attackers made as much noise and confusion as possible, hurling [[hand grenades]] at the defenders to pen them indoors and convince them that a large force had broken in. The castle fell, with the loss of only one Parliamentarian and a huge quantity of arms and ammunition was taken.\n\nThe decline of Royalist control in the region now had a political and ideological, as well as a military, aspect. When Rupert and his brother [[Maurice of the Palatinate|Prince Maurice]] brought a large force, [[Bridgnorth]] refused to admit them and [[Much Wenlock]] refused to supply food.<ref>Coulton, p.101</ref> This reflected increasing disenchantment at lower levels: when the Bridgnorth garrison tried to requisition supplies at [[Tong, Shropshire|Tong]] and [[Shifnal]],\n\n<blockquote>Sir Morton Brigges encouraged the Parishioners to resist and a scuffle ensued, in which most of the soldiers were wounded, and disarmed, and called Popish Dogs. They were kept Prisoners for five or six hours...''<ref name=corb328/></blockquote>\n\nBy the end of the year, groups of \"clubmen\" were operating in the south of Shropshire as a more organised response to the plunder and extortion practised by the soldiers.<ref>Coulton, p.102</ref>\n\nWhen Maurice took away part of the Shrewsbury garrison to campaign in Cheshire in February 1645, the Parliamentary committee saw their chance. As Corbet was away on campaign, probably with Maurice, he avoided capture by Parliamentarians, who surprised a meeting of the county's commissioners of array at  [[Apley Hall]],<ref name=odnb/> home of [[Sir Thomas Whitmore, 1st Baronet]], on 21 February and took them prisoner. The following day, soldiers lent by Brereton and commanded by [[Thomas Mytton]] were set to storm Shrewsbury. However, Reinking exploited an entrance provided by Sir William Owen, a former MP and tenant of the council house, and seized control with minimum bloodshed, opening the gates to the main force.<ref>Coulton, p.103-104</ref><ref>Sherwood, p.124-125</ref> Significantly, the Roundheads refrained from looting, as they considered the townspeople essentially well-disposed towards Parliament.\n\n[[File:Bridgnorth 1646 inscription.JPG|right|thumb|Inscription on Bridgnorth museum, detailing the Royalist destruction of the town in 1646.]]\n\nThe Shrewsbury Foot, the infantry recruited by Corbet, were present at the decisive [[Battle of Naseby]] later in the year,<ref name=corb328/> although it is unlikely Corbet was with them.<ref name=pickstock/> However, he is known to have been present in May 1646 at the siege of [[Bridgnorth]],<ref name=\"Corbet, p.335-6\"/> where he was accompanied by his relative, John Corbet, the son and heir of the Parliamentarian Sir John. The defenders retreated into the castle and [[Sir Thomas Wolryche, 1st Baronet]] ordered the town itself to be burnt to ground to deny it to the enemy, allegedly making more than 300 families homeless. The Royalist garrison were finally forced to come to terms as the Parliamentarians began to undermine the castle. The \"Bridgnorth articles,\" negotiated by deputations from both sides, allowed the garrison the choice of peace or exile. For Corbet, as for most of the others, it was to be peace, but at considerable cost.\n\n===Aftermath of war===\nCorbet was compelled to [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|compound for delinquency]] to regain his [[Sequestration (law)|sequestrated]] estates. The fine was one-sixth of the value of the estates, assessed as \u00a32,822. This was reduced by \u00a3433 in respect of Corbet's debts, which added up to \u00a39,200.<ref name=youngvince>B.D.

Sir Vincent Corbet was left free to drill a royalist muster at [[Atcham]], a few miles east of [[Shrewsbury]], the following day.\n\nThe situation hung in the balance for another month. However, on 30 August, Shrewsbury's council agreed a policy of non-resistance to the King.<ref>Coulton, p.90</ref> Although this was far short of outright support, Ottley used it to encourage the King to march to Shrewsbury from his initial muster at [[Nottingham]]. The Royalist army occupied the town from 20 September until 12 October, overwhelming all resistance, and subjecting the town and surrounding areas to the looting and extortion of the ill-paid soldiery.<ref>Sherwood, p.5-6</ref> Ottley, now knighted, was left in control of the town, although he was not formally made governor until January 1643.\n\n===Formation of the dragoons===\n\nIn December Corbet a number of Shropshire gentry resolved to establish a [[regiment]] of  [[dragoon]]s.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/322/mode/2up Corbet, pp. 323\u2013324]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>We whose names are hereunder written, do hereby engage ourselves, each to the other, and promise upon the faith and word of a Gentleman, that we will do our utmost endeavours, both by ourselves and friends, to raise as well for the defence of our King and country as our own particular safeties, one entire Regiment of dragooners, and with our lives to defend those men's fortunes and families, who shall be contributors herein to their abilities. And for the most speedy expedition of the said service, we have thought fit to entreat Sir Vincent Corbet, formerly Captain of the Horse for this County, to be our chief commander over the aforesaid Regiment.</blockquote>\n\nThe signatories were headed by [[Sir Richard Lee, 2nd Baronet]], MP for Shropshire until expelled by Parliament, and included Ottley, the governor.\n\nA muster was held at Battlefield, north of Shrewsbury, on 20 December. Great hopes were placed on the regiment, which was expected to recruit a thousand men. Only later did it become public that the recruiting drive had been largely unsuccessful, with only 60 responding initially.<ref name=pickstock>[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/corbettonenamestudy/First/People/dragoon.htm Stephen Pickstock: Sir Vincent Corbet, His Dragoons] at The Corbett One Name Study, accessed 31 October 2013</ref> However, Corbet and his men were summoned to the fighting in [[Cheshire]] in January.\n\n===First blood===\n[[File:Portrait of Orlando Bridgeman by Robert White 1682.jpg|thumb|Orlando Bridgeman, portrayed in later life as a distinguished judge.

Aston was Corbet's comrade in arms in 1643.]]\n[[File:William brereton.jpg|thumb|Major General Sir William Brereton, the chief commander of Parliamentarian forces in Cheshire and a major supporter of the Shropshire committee.]]\n\n[[Chester]] was a vital Royalist stronghold, allowing the King to draw on supplies and reinforcements from Ireland, but the county was largely Parliamentarian in allegiance. The attempt to use Shropshire troops in Cheshire was dogged from the start by rivalries and poor communications. [[Sir Orlando Bridgeman, 1st Baronet, of Great Lever|Orlando Bridgeman]], the chief justice and effective deputy governor of Chester, rehearsed these problems in a letter to Sir Francis Ottley on 20 January:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofsh1894shro#page/n187/mode/2up Phillips, p.60-62]</ref> Corbet, he complained, had been instructed to advance from [[Whitchurch, Shropshire]] to [[Tarporley]], well inside Cheshire, but had refused on the grounds that his force was too small. Bridgeman urged Ottley to appeal to the Shropshire gentry for reinforcements, as he believed an attack by [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], the main Parliamentarian commander in the region, imminent. However, John Harrington, a relative of Ottley, made clear the hopelessness of such a recruitment strategy in a letter of 25 January:<ref name=\"Phillips, p.64\">[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofsh1894shro#page/n195/mode/2up Phillips, p.64]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>I find that our County and Especially these parts are very slow to keep themselves secure and to satisfie the com'on expectation, the Divells have got possession of the Swyne and they are running into their own Ruin, I see very well that the design of raising a Thousand Dragoons is in a manner quashed every Hundred is to find 10 and every Alottment according to their proportions, but suppose they delude you they will say much and do nothing (as it seems many have done in this expedition of Sir Vincent Corbett) what will you do then?</blockquote>\n\nCorbet joined forces with [[Sir Thomas Aston, 1st Baronet]], hoping that reinforcements would arrive. On 28 January Bridgeman wrote to Shrewsbury, preparing Ottley for bad news:<ref name=\"Phillips, p.64\"/> Aston had moved toward Stafford and Brereton had slipped into [[Nantwich]] behind him. Later the same day, Aston wrote to explain what had happened: approaching what they thought was the friendly town of Nantwich, they had found it occupied by about 140 Parliamentarians. After a couple of attempts to storm the town, they withdrew to regroup, only to come face to face with Brereton's main force. They fought their way through: \"both sides are loosers, what wee know not, night being theyre, friend our enemy.\" Aston requested [[musketeer]]s to make good their losses. Corbet's account, written the following morning at [[Market Drayton]], also sought to portray the encounter as a draw, but ominously asked not for soldiers but surgeons.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofsh1894shro#page/n201/mode/2up Phillips, pp. 67\u201368]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This in hast, is onely to give you notice, of a skirmish we had, w<sup>th</sup> Breartons and y<sup>e</sup> Nantwich forces, I cannot as yet certify of any p'ticular passage, onely thus far be satisfied for y<sup>e</sup> present; the relation of it is not very good neither is it very bad, this much I would request you y<sup>t</sup> w<sup>th</sup> all Speede, you will send unto Whitchurch all y<sup>e</sup> Churgieons you can possible p'vide for wee are in gr<sup>t</sup> want of them.</blockquote>\n\nBrereton's account of the skirmish<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n243/mode/2up Corbet, p.326-7]</ref> avers that the force he sent to occupy Nantwich was a mere fifty dragoons. When the Royalists tried to lay an ambush, the local people kept the Parliamentarians informed. When, his main force confronted the Royalists, who betrayed their own position by their lighted musket matches, Corbet's dragoons \"were presentlie disordered and many of them ran awaye withoute ever giving fire.\" He thought Aston was wounded and both he and Corbet had been captured briefly but were able to escape under cover of darkness to [[Over, Cheshire|Over]], abandoning their arms in the process. He considered his own troops' performance \"far beyonde what could bee expected of us,\" considering that they had just marched from [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]]. The participants differed little over facts but considerably over interpretation. The behaviour of the Royalist commanders led to accusations of cowardice, but was just as easily interpreted as prudence.<ref name=pickstock/> Certainly Corbet's disobedience at Whitchurch the previous week had saved his small force from being completely cut off in hostile territory. Harrington again pointed out the obvious weaknesses: \"I was hartily sorry to see S'<sup>r</sup> Vincent Corbett so poorly furnished with raw Soldiers and Young Commanders.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/transactionsofsh1894shro#page/n205/mode/2up Phillips, p.69]</ref>\n\n===Campaigns===\n\nCorbet's force seems to have grown in size and experience and was in regular service around Whitchurch during March,  suffering considerable losses.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n243/mode/2up Corbet, p.326]</ref> In May a Parliamentarian raiding party surprised Corbet's force at dusk at Market Drayton,\n\n<blockquote>entered the towne theye havinge neither garde nor scouts abroad (but secure as theye thoughte).

But Sir Vincent fled in his shirte and wascot, leaving his app'all behind him which Capt: Whitney had with his money and many letters in his pockett.<ref name=corb328>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n247/mode/2up Corbet, p. 328]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, experience was making Corbet's force more effective, so that Brereton remarked of one encounter: \"the Shropshire horse and Dragoons came on with great resolution and boldness, and in very good order.\" In July Corbet was authorised to raise a thousand [[infantry]]. The enlarged and more versatile force was able to make a much more effective contribution to Royalist efforts in the region, where the tide of battle flowed to and fro constantly, but the progress of the war was ultimately a question of taking and holding ground, particularly the patchwork of fortresses and strongpoints. The propaganda war was also important in holding territory and populations, and Ottley at Shrewsbury was accused by Royalist headquarters at Oxford of slacking in the face of a torrent of Parliamentarian newspapers and [[pamphlets]].<ref name=odnb>{{Cite ODNB|id=20940|title=Ottley, Sir Francis|author=Wright, Stephen}}Subscription required: free to most UK public library members.</ref>\n\nParliament had been reorganising to retake Shropshire, establishing a Parliamentary committee for the county in February.<ref>Coulton, p.96</ref> It contained two Corbets: Sir John Corbet and  [[Robert Corbet (died 1676)]],<ref>Coulton, p. 95</ref> Sir Vincent's first cousin.<ref name=gr136/> In April it was federated with its counterparts in [[Warwickshire]] and [[Staffordshire]], and in late summer, the support of Brereton allowed the committee to gain its first foothold in its native county, at the unfortified market town of [[Wem]].<ref>Sherwood, p. 64</ref>  By the autumn, the Royalists had regained the initiative in the region but both Wem and Nantwich withstood repeated assaults. Early in 1644 [[Prince Rupert]] brought a large cavalry force to the area, ousted Ottley and set about reconquering Shropshire and Cheshire.<ref>Coulton, p. 98</ref> The Royalists did well while he was present, but he was constantly diverted to other crises, and the Parliamentarians made steady gains when the pressure was off. An incident involving Sir Vincent Corbet, probably in the early summer, illustrates his continuing humanity and respect for family in a situation of now total war. Under a Parliamentary ordinance, 13 captured Irish soldiers had been hanged. Subsequently, some parliamentarians were captured by Rupert's forces and he ordered 13 to be hanged as a reprisal.\n\n<blockquote>They cast the dice on a drum head, to see who should dye, and amongst them there was one Phillip Litleton, who had been servant and keeper of the parke to my old master, Robert Corbett of Stanwardine, Esqr. This Phillip saw Sir Vincent Corbett, of Morton Corbett, ride by, and said to some that stood by, \"if Sir Vincent Corbett did know that I were here, hee would save my life.\" Upon this a charitable soldier roade after Sir Vincent and told him what one of the prisoners sayed. Hee came back immediately, and seeing Phillip, hee alighted from his horse and fell on his knees beefore the Prince, (who sate there on horsebacke to see the execution,) and beggd for the life of Phillip, which was readily granted on condition hee would never beare arms against the King. Phillip promised and escaped, and afterwards noe more Irish were hangd.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/antiquitiesmemo00gouggoog#page/n48/mode/2up Gough, p.42]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe seems to have spent the summer and autumn of 1644 fighting to hold back the slow Parliamentarian advance while constantly hampered by lack of accurate information or clear strategy. A letter of 23 August reflects this constant chasing of rumours.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n251/mode/2up Corbet, p.332]</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This morning I heard from Wem and there strength is not above five hundered foote and foure troopes of Horse theire largest peece is two thousand weight, ye other two are small ones they make noe preparation for removing yet. but as soone as they doe I hope to have intelligence they brag much and threaten hard yt they will swallow us all up with yt greate gun, but in this place we feare them not, depending upon your releefe.

However, Corbet was not at home when it fell to Wem's small garrison in September 1644. The operation was led by William Reinking, a Dutch professional soldier retained by the Parliamentarians.<ref name=\"Corbet, p.335-6\">[https://archive.org/stream/familyofcorbetit02corb#page/n253/mode/2up Corbet, p.335-6]</ref> Mounting one of the fortifications by surprise, five determined attackers made as much noise and confusion as possible, hurling [[hand grenades]] at the defenders to pen them indoors and convince them that a large force had broken in. The castle fell, with the loss of only one Parliamentarian and a huge quantity of arms and ammunition was taken.\n\nThe decline of Royalist control in the region now had a political and ideological, as well as a military, aspect. When Rupert and his brother [[Maurice of the Palatinate|Prince Maurice]] brought a large force, [[Bridgnorth]] refused to admit them and [[Much Wenlock]] refused to supply food.<ref>Coulton, p.101</ref> This reflected increasing disenchantment at lower levels: when the Bridgnorth garrison tried to requisition supplies at [[Tong, Shropshire|Tong]] and [[Shifnal]],\n\n<blockquote>Sir Morton Brigges encouraged the Parishioners to resist and a scuffle ensued, in which most of the soldiers were wounded, and disarmed, and called Popish Dogs. They were kept Prisoners for five or six hours...''<ref name=corb328/></blockquote>\n\nBy the end of the year, groups of \"clubmen\" were operating in the south of Shropshire as a more organised response to the plunder and extortion practised by the soldiers.<ref>Coulton, p.102</ref>\n\nWhen Maurice took away part of the Shrewsbury garrison to campaign in Cheshire in February 1645, the Parliamentary committee saw their chance. As Corbet was away on campaign, probably with Maurice, he avoided capture by Parliamentarians, who surprised a meeting of the county's commissioners of array at  [[Apley Hall]],<ref name=odnb/> home of [[Sir Thomas Whitmore, 1st Baronet]], on 21 February and took them prisoner. The following day, soldiers lent by Brereton and commanded by [[Thomas Mytton]] were set to storm Shrewsbury. However, Reinking exploited an entrance provided by Sir William Owen, a former MP and tenant of the council house, and seized control with minimum bloodshed, opening the gates to the main force.<ref>Coulton, p.103-104</ref><ref>Sherwood, p.124-125</ref> Significantly, the Roundheads refrained from looting, as they considered the townspeople essentially well-disposed towards Parliament.\n\n[[File:Bridgnorth 1646 inscription.JPG|right|thumb|Inscription on Bridgnorth museum, detailing the Royalist destruction of the town in 1646.]]\n\nThe Shrewsbury Foot, the infantry recruited by Corbet, were present at the decisive [[Battle of Naseby]] later in the year,<ref name=corb328/> although it is unlikely Corbet was with them.<ref name=pickstock/> However, he is known to have been present in May 1646 at the siege of [[Bridgnorth]],<ref name=\"Corbet, p.335-6\"/> where he was accompanied by his relative, John Corbet, the son and heir of the Parliamentarian Sir John. The defenders retreated into the castle and [[Sir Thomas Wolryche, 1st Baronet]] ordered the town itself to be burnt to ground to deny it to the enemy, allegedly making more than 300 families homeless. The Royalist garrison were finally forced to come to terms as the Parliamentarians began to undermine the castle. The \"Bridgnorth articles,\" negotiated by deputations from both sides, allowed the garrison the choice of peace or exile. For Corbet, as for most of the others, it was to be peace, but at considerable cost.\n\n===Aftermath of war===\nCorbet was compelled to [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|compound for delinquency]] to regain his [[Sequestration (law)|sequestrated]] estates. The fine was one-sixth of the value of the estates, assessed as \u00a32,822. This was reduced by \u00a3433 in respect of Corbet's debts, which added up to \u00a39,200.<ref name=youngvince>B.D.
