''Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64'', Dover Miniature Scores (1999)</ref> A typical performance lasts just under half an hour.\n\nMendelssohn originally proposed the idea of the violin concerto to [[Ferdinand David (musician)|Ferdinand David]], a close friend and then [[concertmaster]] of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]]. Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not [[premiere]]d until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. The work itself was one of the foremost violin concertos of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era and was influential on many other composers.\n\nAlthough the concerto consists of three [[movement (music)|movements]] in a standard fast\u2013slow\u2013fast structure and each movement follows a traditional [[musical form#Single forms|form]], the concerto was innovative and included many novel features for its time. Distinctive aspects include the almost immediate entrance of the violin at the beginning of the work (rather than following an orchestral preview of the first movement's major themes, as was typical in [[Classical period (music)|Classical]]-era concertos) and the [[through-composed]] form of the concerto as a whole, in which the three movements are melodically and harmonically connected and played [[wikt:attacca|attacca]] (each movement immediately following the previous one without any pauses).(citation needed)\n\nThe concerto was well received and soon became regarded as one of the greatest violin concertos of all time. The concerto remains popular to this day and has developed a reputation as an essential concerto for all aspiring concert violinists to master, and usually one of the first Romantic era concertos they learn. Many professional violinists have recorded the concerto and the work is regularly performed in concerts and [[List of classical music competitions|classical music competition]]s.\n\nMendelssohn also wrote a virtuoso [[Concerto for Violin and Strings (Mendelssohn)|Concerto for Violin and String Orchestra in D minor]] between 1821 and 1823, when he was 12 to 14 years old, at the same time that he produced his [[String symphonies (Mendelssohn)|twelve string symphonies]].<ref>[http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/Violin-Concerto-In-D-Minor/998265 SheetMusicPlus.

''Letters of Felix Mendelssohn, 1833\u20131847'', Ayer (1970)</ref>\n\nThe concerto took another six years to complete. There are many possible reasons for the delay, including self-doubt,<ref name=\"cam2\" /> his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mendelssohn)|third symphony]]<ref name=\"sb\" /> and an unhappy period in Berlin after a request from King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]].<ref name=\"cme\">Jacobson, J.

''Concerto Conversations'', HUP (1999)</ref> The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short [[Coda (music)#Codetta|codetta]] ends the [[Sonata form#Exposition|exposition]] section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the [[Sonata form#Development|development]] section, where the music builds up to the innovative [[cadenza]], which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise.<ref name=\"mt\"/> The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from [[quaver]]s to [[tuplet|quaver-triplets]] and finally to [[semiquaver]]s,<ref name=\"cam2\"/> which require ricochet bowing from the soloist.<ref name=\"bar\">Mendelssohn, F. ''Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64'', B\u00e4renreiter (2005)</ref> This serves as a link to the [[Sonata form#Recapitulation|recapitulation]], where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked \"Presto\",<ref name=\"bar\"/> before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.\n\n=== Andante ===\n'''''7\u20139 minutes'''''\n<score> \\relative c'' {\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo \"Andante\" 8 = 100 \\key c \\major \\time 6/8 e4. f8( d b) a'4.( g4. g8) f( e d a f') e4.( d4) r8 g,8( c e) d4( b16 a) g,8( c e) d4( b16 a) g8( c e) g4( e16 d) c8( a f') d4} </score>\n\nThe bassoon sustains its B from the final chord of the first movement before moving up a [[semitone]] to [[middle C]].<ref name=\"sb\" /> This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical [[C major]] slow movement.

The opening exposition leads into a brief second [[B major]]<ref name=\"cam2\"/> theme which is played by the soloist and builds to a series of rapidly ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, after which the music moves into a short development section in [[G major]].<ref name=\"cam2\"/> The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a [[counter-melody]] in the strings. The second theme is repeated, this time in the home key of E Major.

Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not [[premiere]]d until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. The work itself was one of the foremost violin concertos of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era and was influential on many other composers.\n\nAlthough the concerto consists of three [[movement (music)|movements]] in a standard fast\u2013slow\u2013fast structure and each movement follows a traditional [[musical form#Single forms|form]], the concerto was innovative and included many novel features for its time. Distinctive aspects include the almost immediate entrance of the violin at the beginning of the work (rather than following an orchestral preview of the first movement's major themes, as was typical in [[Classical period (music)|Classical]]-era concertos) and the [[through-composed]] form of the concerto as a whole, in which the three movements are melodically and harmonically connected and played [[wikt:attacca|attacca]] (each movement immediately following the previous one without any pauses).(citation needed)\n\nThe concerto was well received and soon became regarded as one of the greatest violin concertos of all time. The concerto remains popular to this day and has developed a reputation as an essential concerto for all aspiring concert violinists to master, and usually one of the first Romantic era concertos they learn. Many professional violinists have recorded the concerto and the work is regularly performed in concerts and [[List of classical music competitions|classical music competition]]s.\n\nMendelssohn also wrote a virtuoso [[Concerto for Violin and Strings (Mendelssohn)|Concerto for Violin and String Orchestra in D minor]] between 1821 and 1823, when he was 12 to 14 years old, at the same time that he produced his [[String symphonies (Mendelssohn)|twelve string symphonies]].<ref>[http://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/Violin-Concerto-In-D-Minor/998265 SheetMusicPlus.

The ceiling is [[barrel vault]]ed with ancient wooden ribs set into them. The walls are polished in the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] style. It was faced by a substantial wooden [[facade]], now entirely lost. A large horseshoe-shaped window, the chaitya-window, was set above the arched doorway and the whole portico-area was carved to imitate a multi-storeyed building with balconies and windows and sculptured men and women who observed the scene below.

is a transitional economy with limited market reforms.<ref name=\"CIABK\"/> [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared [[1992 Bosnian independence referendum|independence]] from socialist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] on [[Independence Day (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|1 March 1992]].\n\n==Overview==\nBosnia and Herzegovina is an upper middle-income country which has accomplished a great deal since the mid-1990s. Today, it is an EU potential candidate country and is now embarking on a new growth model amid a period of slow growth and the global financial crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bosniaandherzegovina|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Worldbank.org|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> \nBosnia and Herzegovina is a small, open economy, dominated by services, which accounted for 55% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2016, with a moderately developed industrial and manufacturing sector (23% and 12%, respectively), and a limited agricultural base (about 6% of GDP).<ref name=OECD>[https://www.oecd.org/south-east-europe/programme/Unleashing_the_Transformation_potential_for_Growth_in_WB.pdf OECD 2019]</ref>\n\nThe key economic challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the imbalance of its economic model: public policies and incentives are skewed toward the public rather than the private sector, consumption rather than investment, and imports rather than exports. The country needs to shift to a business environment that is conducive to private investment. The country faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing liberty market reforms to its economy.\n\nThe [[konvertibilna marka]] (convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has increased. Implementation of privatization, however, has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all ; foreign banks, primarily from Western Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A sizable current account deficit and very high unemployment rate remain the two most serious economic problems. The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.\n\nThe United States Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina produces the Country Commercial Guide \u2013 an annual report that delivers a comprehensive look at Bosnia and Herzegovina's commercial and economic environment, using economic, political, and market analysis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018193841/http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html |archive-date=2012-10-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Brief economic history until the 1990s ==\n[[File:Real GDP growth rates RS & FBH.png|250px|thumb|Real GDP growth rates in Republic of Srpska and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n\nAt the time of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was an important mineral processing centre and provided the other republics with basic mineral commodities in exchange for current consumption goods. While large amounts of public capital investments poured in during the 1970s, productivity levels remained low, often due to the limited capacity of public managers.<ref name=OECD/> Under former republican premier [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]], and Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], metal-product industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's metal products plants.\n\nMerging small firms into larger agglomerates was a common practice in the SFRY to preserve employment levels. As a result, four large conglomerates emerged in Bosnia and Herzegovina over time: [[Energoinvest]] (energy sector), [[Unis (Yugoslavia)|Unis]] (automotive and defence industry, which partnered with [[Volkswagen]] in the early 1970s), [[\u0160ipad]] (wood processing) and [[RMK Zenica]] (steel industry, later acquired by ArcelorMittal). Construction and defence were important industries of the Bosnian economy, despite their low efficiency and, ultimately, supply excess. The defence industry was particularly developed in the southern districts and around [[Mostar]], which was also a relevant metallurgical centre ([[Aluminij Mostar]]). Machinery production was concentrated in the north, particularly around [[Banja Luka]]. The [[Tuzla]] district was renowned for its chemical industry. The automotive industry, which developed in the 1950s with the production of vehicle components, extended later on to passenger and commercial vehicles, with plants in [[Sarajevo]], [[Mostar]] and [[Banja Luka]]. Agriculture was not highly developed, despite its importance for employment and the presence of the large [[Agrokomerc]] conglomerate based at the north-west border with [[Croatia]].<ref name=OECD/>\n\nTito had pushed the development of metal industries, and electro-energetic sector, in the republic with the result that Bosnia and Herzegovina were a host of large numbers of industrial firms. Some of them were worked with World brand names, companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro, Volkswagen and SKF. Big Companies like Energoinvest, UNIS, Hidrogradnja, Vranica, RMK Zenica, TAS Sarajevo, FAMOS Sarajevo and BNT Novi Travnik, have yearly income in billions of USD$ at that time. Building sector companies bringing large amounts of income in USD$. Unemployment at that time is very low. Work force is highly skilled, with highly professional, educated managers, engineers, science experts, which use western world's newest technologies in large scale areas. Before the war, Yugoslav premier [[Ante Markovi\u0107]], made some preparations for privatization, in economy, finance, and industry sectors, but the war ceased development in these actions.\n\nThe economy suffered heavily from the [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], with over \u20ac200 billion in material damages<ref>http://balkans.aljazeera.net/video/presuda-karadzicu-materijalna-steta-u-ratu-u-bih-200-milijardi-eura</ref> and GDP (excluding services) reduced by 90% between 1990 and 1995. Today, most of the abovementioned companies have been privatised. The economy remains fragile, primarily consumption driven and vulnerable to external fluctuations. This was seen with the global economic crisis, which pushed Bosnia and Herzegovina into recession in 2009 and 2012 (with GDP growth of -3% and -0.8%, respectively) and severe floods in 2014, which caused damage of approximately 15% of GDP. Since 2015, annual GDP growth has increased to more than 3%. Still, the country registered a current account deficit of 4.7% of GDP in 2017, decreasing from 5.3% in 2015, resulting from a reduction in its trade deficit, which nevertheless remains large (17.4% of GDP in 2017).<ref name=OECD/>\n\nA Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in late 1997, debt negotiations were held with the [[London Club]] in December 1997 and with the [[Paris Club]] in October 1998, and a new currency, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark]], was introduced in mid-1998. In 1999, the Convertible Mark gained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank dramatically increased its reserve holdings. Due to Bosnia's strict currency board regime attaching the Bosnian mark to the Euro, [[inflation]] has remained low in the entire country.\n\nWith an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996\u201399 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000\u201302.\nThe country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and [[humanitarian aid]] from the international community. Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) assistance accounts for 20%-25% of [[economic growth]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHowever, growth has been uneven throughout the post-war period, with the Federation outpacing the RS. According to World Bank estimates, GDP growth was 62% in the Federation and 25% in the RS in 1996, 35% in the Federation and flat in the RS in 1997, and continued growth in the Federation in 1998.\n\nMovement has been slow, but considerable progress has been made in economic reform since peace was re-established. [[Banking]] reform lagged, as did the implementation of [[privatization]]. Many companies (mainly factories) that were privatized faced massive problems, causing the owners to reduce salaries and deny the workers their salaries, and some of the new owners and tycoons destroy that factories.\n\n===Macro-Economic===\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1997\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and

is a transitional economy with limited market reforms.<ref name=\"CIABK\"/> [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared [[1992 Bosnian independence referendum|independence]] from socialist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] on [[Independence Day (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|1 March 1992]].\n\n==Overview==\nBosnia and Herzegovina is an upper middle-income country which has accomplished a great deal since the mid-1990s. Today, it is an EU potential candidate country and is now embarking on a new growth model amid a period of slow growth and the global financial crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bosniaandherzegovina|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Worldbank.org|accessdate=4 January 2018}}</ref> \nBosnia and Herzegovina is a small, open economy, dominated by services, which accounted for 55% of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2016, with a moderately developed industrial and manufacturing sector (23% and 12%, respectively), and a limited agricultural base (about 6% of GDP).<ref name=OECD>[https://www.oecd.org/south-east-europe/programme/Unleashing_the_Transformation_potential_for_Growth_in_WB.pdf OECD 2019]</ref>\n\nThe key economic challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the imbalance of its economic model: public policies and incentives are skewed toward the public rather than the private sector, consumption rather than investment, and imports rather than exports. The country needs to shift to a business environment that is conducive to private investment. The country faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing liberty market reforms to its economy.\n\nThe [[konvertibilna marka]] (convertible mark or BAM) - the national currency introduced in 1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the banking sector has increased. Implementation of privatization, however, has been slow, and local entities only reluctantly support national-level institutions. Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all ; foreign banks, primarily from Western Europe, now control most of the banking sector. A sizable current account deficit and very high unemployment rate remain the two most serious economic problems. The country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and humanitarian aid from the international community but will have to prepare for an era of declining assistance.\n\nThe United States Embassy in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina produces the Country Commercial Guide \u2013 an annual report that delivers a comprehensive look at Bosnia and Herzegovina's commercial and economic environment, using economic, political, and market analysis.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018193841/http://sarajevo.usembassy.gov/country-commercial-guide.html |archive-date=2012-10-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Brief economic history until the 1990s ==\n[[File:Real GDP growth rates RS & FBH.png|250px|thumb|Real GDP growth rates in Republic of Srpska and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n\nAt the time of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was an important mineral processing centre and provided the other republics with basic mineral commodities in exchange for current consumption goods. While large amounts of public capital investments poured in during the 1970s, productivity levels remained low, often due to the limited capacity of public managers.<ref name=OECD/> Under former republican premier [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]], and Yugoslav president [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], metal-product industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's metal products plants.\n\nMerging small firms into larger agglomerates was a common practice in the SFRY to preserve employment levels. As a result, four large conglomerates emerged in Bosnia and Herzegovina over time: [[Energoinvest]] (energy sector), [[Unis (Yugoslavia)|Unis]] (automotive and defence industry, which partnered with [[Volkswagen]] in the early 1970s), [[\u0160ipad]] (wood processing) and [[RMK Zenica]] (steel industry, later acquired by ArcelorMittal). Construction and defence were important industries of the Bosnian economy, despite their low efficiency and, ultimately, supply excess. The defence industry was particularly developed in the southern districts and around [[Mostar]], which was also a relevant metallurgical centre ([[Aluminij Mostar]]). Machinery production was concentrated in the north, particularly around [[Banja Luka]]. The [[Tuzla]] district was renowned for its chemical industry. The automotive industry, which developed in the 1950s with the production of vehicle components, extended later on to passenger and commercial vehicles, with plants in [[Sarajevo]], [[Mostar]] and [[Banja Luka]]. Agriculture was not highly developed, despite its importance for employment and the presence of the large [[Agrokomerc]] conglomerate based at the north-west border with [[Croatia]].<ref name=OECD/>\n\nTito had pushed the development of metal industries, and electro-energetic sector, in the republic with the result that Bosnia and Herzegovina were a host of large numbers of industrial firms. Some of them were worked with World brand names, companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Marlboro, Volkswagen and SKF. Big Companies like Energoinvest, UNIS, Hidrogradnja, Vranica, RMK Zenica, TAS Sarajevo, FAMOS Sarajevo and BNT Novi Travnik, have yearly income in billions of USD$ at that time. Building sector companies bringing large amounts of income in USD$. Unemployment at that time is very low. Work force is highly skilled, with highly professional, educated managers, engineers, science experts, which use western world's newest technologies in large scale areas. Before the war, Yugoslav premier [[Ante Markovi\u0107]], made some preparations for privatization, in economy, finance, and industry sectors, but the war ceased development in these actions.\n\nThe economy suffered heavily from the [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], with over \u20ac200 billion in material damages<ref>http://balkans.aljazeera.net/video/presuda-karadzicu-materijalna-steta-u-ratu-u-bih-200-milijardi-eura</ref> and GDP (excluding services) reduced by 90% between 1990 and 1995. Today, most of the abovementioned companies have been privatised. The economy remains fragile, primarily consumption driven and vulnerable to external fluctuations. This was seen with the global economic crisis, which pushed Bosnia and Herzegovina into recession in 2009 and 2012 (with GDP growth of -3% and -0.8%, respectively) and severe floods in 2014, which caused damage of approximately 15% of GDP. Since 2015, annual GDP growth has increased to more than 3%. Still, the country registered a current account deficit of 4.7% of GDP in 2017, decreasing from 5.3% in 2015, resulting from a reduction in its trade deficit, which nevertheless remains large (17.4% of GDP in 2017).<ref name=OECD/>\n\nA Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina was established in late 1997, debt negotiations were held with the [[London Club]] in December 1997 and with the [[Paris Club]] in October 1998, and a new currency, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark]], was introduced in mid-1998. In 1999, the Convertible Mark gained wider acceptance, and the Central Bank dramatically increased its reserve holdings. Due to Bosnia's strict currency board regime attaching the Bosnian mark to the Euro, [[inflation]] has remained low in the entire country.\n\nWith an uneasy peace in place, output recovered in 1996\u201399 at high percentage rates from a low base; but output growth slowed in 2000\u201302.\nThe country receives substantial amounts of reconstruction assistance and [[humanitarian aid]] from the international community. Support for Eastern European Democracy (SEED) assistance accounts for 20%-25% of [[economic growth]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nHowever, growth has been uneven throughout the post-war period, with the Federation outpacing the RS. According to World Bank estimates, GDP growth was 62% in the Federation and 25% in the RS in 1996, 35% in the Federation and flat in the RS in 1997, and continued growth in the Federation in 1998.\n\nMovement has been slow, but considerable progress has been made in economic reform since peace was re-established. [[Banking]] reform lagged, as did the implementation of [[privatization]]. Many companies (mainly factories) that were privatized faced massive problems, causing the owners to reduce salaries and deny the workers their salaries, and some of the new owners and tycoons destroy that factories.\n\n===Macro-Economic===\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1997\u20132017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report for Selected Countries and

Although most of his plays are set in Norway\u2014often in places reminiscent of [[Skien]], the port town where he grew up\u2014Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into a [[Patriciate of Norway|patrician]] merchant family, the intertwined [[Ibsen (family)|Ibsen]]\u00a0and [[Paus]] family, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background and often modelled characters after family members. He was the father of Prime Minister [[Sigurd Ibsen]]. Ibsen's dramas had a strong influence upon contemporary culture.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Altenburg2.png|thumb|left|A [[silhouette]] (ca. 1815\u20131820) of Ibsen's mother (far right), grandparents and other relatives]] my uncle\nIbsen was born into an affluent merchant family in the wealthy port town of [[Skien]] in Bratsberg ([[Telemark]]). His parents were [[Knud Ibsen]] (1797\u20131877) and [[Marichen Altenburg]] (1799\u20131869). Henrik Ibsen wrote that \u201cmy parents were members on both sides of the most respected families in Skien,\u201d explaining that he was closely related with \u201cjust about all the [[Patriciate of Norway|patrician]] families who then dominated the place and its surroundings.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibsen.uio.no/BREV_1880-1889ht%7cB18820921GB.xhtml|title=Henrik Ibsens skrifter: Brev til GEORG BRANDES (21. september 1882)|website=www.ibsen.uio.no}}</ref><ref>Haugen (1979: 23)</ref>\n\nHis parents, though not related by blood, had been raised as something that resembled social siblings.<ref>Templeton, Joan (1997). ''Ibsen's Women''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 1ff.</ref> Knud Ibsen's biological father, ship's captain Henrich Ibsen, died at sea when he was newborn in 1797 and his mother married captain [[Ole Paus (shipowner)|Ole Paus]] the following year; Ole Paus was the brother of Marichen's mother Hedevig Paus, and their families were very close; for example Ole's oldest biological son and Knud's half-brother [[Henrik Johan Paus]] was raised in Hedevig's home together with his cousin Marichen, and the biological and social children of the Paus siblings, including Knud and Marichen, spent much of their childhood together. Some Ibsen scholars have claimed that Henrik Ibsen was fascinated by his parents\u2019 \u201cstrange, almost incestuous marriage;\u201d he would treat the subject of incestuous relationships in several plays, notably his masterpiece ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.<ref>Ferguson p. 280</ref>\n\nWhen Henrik Ibsen was around seven years old, his father's fortunes took a significant turn for the worse, and the family was eventually forced to sell the major Altenburg building in central Skien and move permanently to their large summer house, ''Venst\u00f8p'', outside of the city.<ref>Michael Meyers. ''Henrik Ibsen'', Chapter one.</ref> Henrik's sister Hedvig would write about their mother: \"She was a quiet, lovable woman, the soul of the house, everything to her husband and children.

Ibsen would both model and name characters in his plays after his own family. A central theme in Ibsen's plays is the portrayal of suffering women, echoing his mother [[Marichen Altenburg]]; Ibsen's sympathy with women would eventually find significant expression with their portrayal in dramas such as ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.<ref name=\"Templeton\"/>\n\nAt fifteen, Ibsen was forced to leave school. He moved to the small town of [[Grimstad]] to become an apprentice [[pharmacist]] and began writing plays. In 1846, when Ibsen was 18, he had a liaison with Else Sophie Jensdatter Birkedalen which produced a son, Hans Jacob Hendrichsen Birkdalen, whose upbringing Ibsen paid for until the boy was fourteen, though Ibsen never saw Hans Jacob. Ibsen went to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (later renamed Kristiania and then Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university. He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing. His first play, the [[tragedy]] ''[[Catilina (play)|Catilina]]'' (1850), was published under the pseudonym \"Brynjolf Bjarme\", when he was only 22, but it was not performed. His first play to be staged, ''[[The Burial Mound]]'' (1850), received little attention. Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years remained unsuccessful.<ref>Michael Meyes. ''Henrik Ibsen''. Chapters corresponding to individual early plays.</ref> Ibsen's main inspiration in the early period, right up to ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', was apparently the Norwegian author [[Henrik Wergeland]] and the [[Norwegian folk tales]] as collected by [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]]. In Ibsen's youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and playwright.\n\n==Life and writings==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2016}}\nHe spent the next several years employed at [[Det norske Theater (Bergen)]], where he was involved in the production of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer. During this period, he published five new, though largely unremarkable, plays. Despite Ibsen's failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued writing.\n\nIbsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the [[Christiania Theatre]]. He married [[Suzannah Ibsen|Suzannah Thoresen]] on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child [[Sigurd Ibsen|Sigurd]] on 23 December 1859. The couple lived in very poor financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway. In 1864, he left Christiania and went to [[Sorrento]] in Italy in self-imposed exile. He didn't return to his native land for the next 27 years, and when he returned to it he was a noted, but controversial, playwright.\n\nHis next play, ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'' (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as did the following play, ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (1867), to which [[Edvard Grieg]] famously composed [[incidental music]] and songs. Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] and traces of the latter's influence are evident in ''Brand'', it was not until after ''Brand'' that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously. Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read ''[[Either/Or]]'' and ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''. Ibsen's next play ''Peer Gynt'' was consciously informed by Kierkegaard.<ref>Shapiro, Bruce. ''Divine Madness and the Absurd Paradox''. (1990) {{ISBN|978-0-313-27290-5}}</ref><ref>Downs, Brian. ''Ibsen: The Intellectual Background'' (1946)</ref>\n\nWith success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements into the drama, exploring what he termed the \"drama of ideas\". His next series of plays are often considered his Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy across Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Ibsen photographed in Dresden c. 1870]]\n\nIbsen moved from Italy to [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1868, where he spent years writing the play he regarded as his main work, ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'' (1873), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed. Ibsen moved to [[Munich]] in 1875 and began work on his first contemporary realist drama ''[[The Pillars of Society]]'', first published and performed in 1877.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts about Pillars of Society|url=http://ibsen.nb.no/index.gan?id=473|work=ibsen.nb.no|date=10 August 2001|first=Jens-Morten|last=Hanssen|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> ''[[A Doll's House]]'' followed in 1879. This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which characterized Ibsen's society.\n\nIbsen was already in his fifties when ''A Doll\u2019s House'' was published. He himself saw his latter plays as a series. At the end of his career, he described them as \u201cthat series of dramas which began with ''A Doll\u2019s House'' and which is now completed with ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]''\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Ibsen, Vol IV|last=MacFarlane|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=London|pages=439}}</ref> Furthermore, it was the reception of ''A Doll\u2019s House'' which brought Ibsen international acclaim.\n\n''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen's society, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her to marry her fianc\u00e9 despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of syphilis. The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable family was considered intolerable.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mary|last=Spongberg|date=1998 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xPg8DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA162|title=Feminizing Venereal Disease: The Body of the Prostitute in Nineteenth-Century Medical Discourse|page=162|isbn=0814780822|publisher=NYU Press|accessdate=2019-08-26}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882), Ibsen went even further. In earlier plays, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households. In ''An Enemy'', controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community. One primary message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often \"right\" than the mass of people, who are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike. Contemporary society's belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged. In ''An Enemy of the People'', Ibsen chastised not only the conservatism of society, but also the liberalism of the time. He illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving. ''An Enemy of the People'' was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous work, ''Ghosts''. The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of ''Ghosts''. The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public bath. The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]]. He expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an 'enemy of the people' by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows. The play ends with his complete ostracism. It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the doctor.\n\nAs audiences by now expected, Ibsen's next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this time, his attack was not against society's mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism. Always an iconoclast, Ibsen saw himself as an objective observer of society, \u201clike a lone franc tireur in the outposts\u201d, playing a lone hand, as he put it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Ibsen, Vol V|last=MacFarlane|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=London|pages=476}}</ref> Ibsen, perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, relied upon immediate sources such as newspapers and second-hand report for his contact with intellectual thought. He claimed to be ignorant of books, leaving them to his wife and son, but, as [[Georg Brandes]] described, \u201che seemed to stand in some mysterious correspondence with the fermenting, germinating ideas of the day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibsen: A biography|last=Meyer|first=Michael|publisher=Doubleday and Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=500}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) is by many considered Ibsen's finest work, and it is certainly the most complex. It tells the story of Gregers Werle, a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal. Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the \"Summons of the Ideal\". Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child. Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed. Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary \"invention\", his wife is earning the household income.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIbsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his child. Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice. Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the \"ideal\" is sometimes too much for the human heart to bear.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:Handwriting2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Letter from Ibsen to his English reviewer and translator [[Edmund Gosse]]: \"30.8.[18]99.

In such later plays as ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890) and ''[[The Master Builder]]'' (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection of current conventions. Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective consideration of interpersonal confrontation.  ''Hedda Gabler'' and ''A Doll\u2019s House'' are regularly cited as Ibsen\u2019s most popular and influential plays,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/theatre/henrik-ibsen-plays-a-dolls-house-hedda-gabler-a4233501.html|title=Henrik Ibsen's greatest plays, from A Doll's House to Hedda Gabler|last=Paskett|first=Zoe|date=11 September 2019|website=Evening Standard|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> with the title role of Hedda regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the present day.\n\nIbsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] which was to be adopted by [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and others and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] and [[Edmund Gosse]]. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel \"Stephen Hero\". Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. Michael Meyer's translations in the 1950s were welcomed by actors and directors as playable, rather than academic. As The Times newspaper put it, ''\u2018This, one may think, is how Ibsen might have expressed himself in English'.''\n\nIbsen intentionally obscured his influences. However, asked later what he had read when he wrote [[Catiline]], Ibsen replied that he had read only the Danish [[Norse saga]]-inspired [[Romantic period|Romantic]] tragedian [[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] and [[Ludvig Holberg]], \"the Scandinavian Moli\u00e8re\". [BBC Radio 4's in Our Time from Thursday, 31 May 2018 www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b42q58]\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAt the time when Ibsen was writing, literature was emerging as a formidable force in 19th century society.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Consciousness and Society: the Reorientation of European Social Thought|last=Hughes|first=H. Stuart|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-0765809186|location=|pages=}}</ref> It was still a relatively new form of popular discussion and entertainment. With the vast increase in literacy towards the end of the century, the possibilities of literature being used for subversion struck horror into the heart of the Establishment. Ibsen\u2019s plays, from ''A Doll\u2019s House'' onwards, caused an uproar: not just in Norway, but throughout Europe, and even across the Atlantic in America. No other artist, apart from Richard Wagner, had such an effect internationally, inspiring almost blasphemous adoration and hysterical abuse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibsen: A Biography|last=Meyer|first=Michael|publisher=Doubleday & Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the publication of ''Ghosts'', he wrote: \u201cwhile the storm lasted, I have made many studies and observations and I shall not hesitate to exploit them in my future writings.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Ibsen|last=MacFarlane|first=Robert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=London|pages=477}}</ref> Indeed, his next play ''An Enemy of the People'' was initially regard by the critics to be simply his response to the violent criticism which had greeted ''Ghosts''. Ibsen expected criticism: as he wrote to his publisher: \u201c''Ghosts'' will probably cause alarm in some circles, but it can\u2019t be helped. If it did not, there would have been no necessity for me to have written it.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibsen: A biography|last=Meyer|first=Michael|publisher=Doubleday & Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=505}}</ref>\n\nIbsen didn\u2019t just read the critical reaction to his plays, he actively corresponded with critics, publishers, theatre directors and newspaper editors on the subject. The interpretation of his work, both by critics and directors, concerned him greatly. He often advised directors on which actor or actress would be suitable for a particular role. [An example of this is a letter he wrote to Hans Schroder in November 1884, with detailed instructions for the production of ''The Wild Duck''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibsen: A Biography|last=Meyer|first=Michael|publisher=Doubleday & Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=559}}</ref>]\n\nIbsen\u2019s plays initially reached a far wider audience as read plays rather than in performance. It was 20 years, for instance, before the authorities would allow ''Ghosts'' to be performed in Norway. Each new play that Ibsen wrote, from 1879 onwards, had an explosive effect on intellectual circles. This was greatest for ''A Doll\u2019s House'' and ''Ghosts'', and it did lessen with the later plays, but the translation of Ibsen\u2019s works into German, French and English during the decade following the initial publication of each play and frequent new productions as and when permission was granted, meant that Ibsen remained a topic of lively conversation throughout the latter decades of the 19th century. When ''A Doll\u2019s House'' was published, it had an explosive effect: it was the centre of every conversation at every social gathering in Christiana. One hostess even wrote on the invitations to her soir\u00e9e, \u201cYou are politely requested not to mention Mr Ibsen\u2019s new play\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Henrik Ibsen: Four Major Plays (Introduction)|last=MacFarlane|first=James|publisher=The World\u2019s Classics|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Introduction}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Henrik Ibsen portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Ibsen, late in his career]]\nOn 23 May 1906, Ibsen died in his home at Arbins gade 1 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo)<ref>since 2006 [[The Ibsen Museum (Oslo)]]</ref> after a series of strokes in March 1900.

From a modern perspective, the aspects of his writing that appeal most are the psychological issues which he explored. The social issues, taken up so prominently in his own day, have become dated, as has the late-Victorian middle-class setting of his plays. The fact that, whether read and staged, they still possess a compelling power is testament to his enduring quality as a thinker and a dramatist.\n\nOn the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Ibsen's death in 2006, the Norwegian government organised the [[Ibsen Year]], which included celebrations around the world. The [[NRK]] produced a miniseries on Ibsen's childhood and youth in 2006, ''[[An Immortal Man]]''. Several prizes are awarded in the name of Henrik Ibsen, among them the [[International Ibsen Award]], the [[Norwegian Ibsen Award]] and the [[Ibsen Centennial Commemoration Award]].\n\nEvery year, since 2008, the annual \"Delhi Ibsen Festival\", is held in Delhi, India, organized by the Dramatic Art and Design Academy (DADA) in collaboration with The Royal Norwegian Embassy in India.

Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them.\n\nThe oldest documented member of the [[Ibsen family]] was ship's captain Rasmus Ibsen (1632\u20131703) from [[Stege, Denmark]]. His son, ship's captain Peder Ibsen became a [[Citizen|burgher]] of [[Bergen]] in Norway in 1726.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Ibsen/norsk_slekt_som_stammer_fra_skipper_Rasmus_Ibsen|title=Ibsen \u2013 norsk slekt|author=Terje Bratberg|work=Store norske leksikon|date=15 November 2018}}</ref> Henrik Ibsen had Danish, German, Norwegian and some distant Scottish ancestry. Most of his ancestors belonged to the merchant class of original Danish and German extraction, and many of his ancestors were ship's captains.\n\nIbsen's biographer [[Henrik J\u00e6ger]] famously wrote in 1888 that Ibsen did not have a drop of Norwegian blood in his veins, stating that \"the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane\". This, however, is not completely accurate; notably through his grandmother Hedevig Paus, Ibsen was descended from one of the very few families of the patrician class of original Norwegian extraction, known since the 15th century. Ibsen's ancestors had mostly lived in Norway for several generations, even though many had foreign ancestry.<ref>[[Henrik J\u00e6ger|Henrik Jaeger]], ''Henrik Ibsen.

The patronymic became \"frozen\", i.e. it became a permanent [[family name]], in the 17th century. The phenomenon of patronymics becoming frozen started in the 17th century in bourgeois families in Denmark, and the practice was only widely adopted in Norway from around 1900.\n\n{{ahnentafel \n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Although most of his plays are set in Norway\u2014often in places reminiscent of [[Skien]], the port town where he grew up\u2014Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into a [[Patriciate of Norway|patrician]] merchant family, the intertwined [[Ibsen (family)|Ibsen]]\u00a0and [[Paus]] family, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background and often modelled characters after family members. He was the father of Prime Minister [[Sigurd Ibsen]]. Ibsen's dramas had a strong influence upon contemporary culture.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Altenburg2.png|thumb|left|A [[silhouette]] (ca. 1815\u20131820) of Ibsen's mother (far right), grandparents and other relatives]]\nIbsen was born into an affluent merchant family in the wealthy port town of [[Skien]] in Bratsberg ([[Telemark]]). His parents were [[Knud Ibsen]] (1797\u20131877) and [[Marichen Altenburg]] (1799\u20131869). Henrik Ibsen wrote that \u201cmy parents were members on both sides of the most respected families in Skien,\u201d explaining that he was closely related with \u201cjust about all the [[Patriciate of Norway|patrician]] families who then dominated the place and its surroundings.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibsen.uio.no/BREV_1880-1889ht%7cB18820921GB.xhtml|title=Henrik Ibsens skrifter: Brev til GEORG BRANDES (21. september 1882)|website=www.ibsen.uio.no}}</ref><ref>Haugen (1979: 23)</ref>\n\nHis parents, though not related by blood, had been raised as something that resembled social siblings.<ref>Templeton, Joan (1997).

Cambridge University Press. pp. 1ff.</ref> Knud Ibsen's biological father, ship's captain Henrich Ibsen, died at sea when he was newborn in 1797 and his mother married captain [[Ole Paus (shipowner)|Ole Paus]] the following year; Ole Paus was the brother of Marichen's mother Hedevig Paus, and their families were very close; for example Ole's oldest biological son and Knud's half-brother [[Henrik Johan Paus]] was raised in Hedevig's home together with his cousin Marichen, and the biological and social children of the Paus siblings, including Knud and Marichen, spent much of their childhood together. Some Ibsen scholars have claimed that Henrik Ibsen was fascinated by his parents\u2019 \u201cstrange, almost incestuous marriage;\u201d he would treat the subject of incestuous relationships in several plays, notably his masterpiece ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.<ref>Ferguson p. 280</ref>\n\nWhen Henrik Ibsen was around seven years old, his father's fortunes took a significant turn for the worse, and the family was eventually forced to sell the major Altenburg building in central Skien and move permanently to their large summer house, ''Venst\u00f8p'', outside of the city.<ref>Michael Meyers. ''Henrik Ibsen'', Chapter one.</ref> Henrik's sister Hedvig would write about their mother: \"She was a quiet, lovable woman, the soul of the house, everything to her husband and children.

Ibsen would both model and name characters in his plays after his own family. A central theme in Ibsen's plays is the portrayal of suffering women, echoing his mother [[Marichen Altenburg]]; Ibsen's sympathy with women would eventually find significant expression with their portrayal in dramas such as ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.<ref name=\"Templeton\"/>\n\nAt fifteen, Ibsen was forced to leave school. He moved to the small town of [[Grimstad]] to become an apprentice [[pharmacist]] and began writing plays. In 1846, when Ibsen was 18, he had a liaison with Else Sophie Jensdatter Birkedalen which produced a son, Hans Jacob Hendrichsen Birkdalen, whose upbringing Ibsen paid for until the boy was fourteen, though Ibsen never saw Hans Jacob. Ibsen went to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (later renamed Kristiania and then Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university. He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing. His first play, the [[tragedy]] ''[[Catilina (play)|Catilina]]'' (1850), was published under the pseudonym \"Brynjolf Bjarme\", when he was only 22, but it was not performed. His first play to be staged, ''[[The Burial Mound]]'' (1850), received little attention. Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years remained unsuccessful.<ref>Michael Meyes. ''Henrik Ibsen''. Chapters corresponding to individual early plays.</ref> Ibsen's main inspiration in the early period, right up to ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', was apparently the Norwegian author [[Henrik Wergeland]] and the [[Norwegian folk tales]] as collected by [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] and [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]]. In Ibsen's youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and playwright.\n\n==Life and writings==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2016}}\nHe spent the next several years employed at [[Det norske Theater (Bergen)]], where he was involved in the production of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer. During this period, he published five new, though largely unremarkable, plays. Despite Ibsen's failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued writing.\n\nIbsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the [[Christiania Theatre]]. He married [[Suzannah Ibsen|Suzannah Thoresen]] on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child [[Sigurd Ibsen|Sigurd]] on 23 December 1859. The couple lived in very poor financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway. In 1864, he left Christiania and went to [[Sorrento]] in Italy in self-imposed exile. He didn't return to his native land for the next 27 years, and when he returned to it he was a noted, but controversial, playwright.\n\nHis next play, ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'' (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as did the following play, ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (1867), to which [[Edvard Grieg]] famously composed [[incidental music]] and songs. Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] and traces of the latter's influence are evident in ''Brand'', it was not until after ''Brand'' that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously. Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read ''[[Either/Or]]'' and ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''. Ibsen's next play ''Peer Gynt'' was consciously informed by Kierkegaard.<ref>Shapiro, Bruce. ''Divine Madness and the Absurd Paradox''. (1990) {{ISBN|978-0-313-27290-5}}</ref><ref>Downs, Brian. ''Ibsen: The Intellectual Background'' (1946)</ref>\n\nWith success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements into the drama, exploring what he termed the \"drama of ideas\". His next series of plays are often considered his Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy across Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Ibsen photographed in Dresden c. 1870]]\n\nIbsen moved from Italy to [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1868, where he spent years writing the play he regarded as his main work, ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'' (1873), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed. Ibsen moved to [[Munich]] in 1875 and began work on his first contemporary realist drama ''[[The Pillars of Society]]'', first published and performed in 1877.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts about Pillars of Society|url=http://ibsen.nb.no/index.gan?id=473|work=ibsen.nb.no|date=10 August 2001|first=Jens-Morten|last=Hanssen|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> ''[[A Doll's House]]'' followed in 1879. This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which characterized Ibsen's society.\n\nIbsen was already in his fifties when ''A Doll\u2019s House'' was published. He himself saw his latter plays as a series. At the end of his career, he described them as \u201cthat series of dramas which began with ''A Doll\u2019s House'' and which is now completed with ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]''\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Ibsen, Vol IV|last=MacFarlane|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=London|pages=439}}</ref> Furthermore, it was the reception of ''A Doll\u2019s House'' which brought Ibsen international acclaim.\n\n''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen's society, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her to marry her fianc\u00e9 despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of syphilis. The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable family was considered intolerable.<ref>{{cite book|first=Mary|last=Spongberg|date=1998 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=xPg8DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA162|title=Feminizing Venereal Disease: The Body of the Prostitute in Nineteenth-Century Medical Discourse|page=162|isbn=0814780822|publisher=NYU Press|accessdate=2019-08-26}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882), Ibsen went even further. In earlier plays, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households. In ''An Enemy'', controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community. One primary message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often \"right\" than the mass of people, who are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike. Contemporary society's belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged. In ''An Enemy of the People'', Ibsen chastised not only the conservatism of society, but also the liberalism of the time. He illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving. ''An Enemy of the People'' was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous work, ''Ghosts''. The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of ''Ghosts''. The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public bath. The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]]. He expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an 'enemy of the people' by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows. The play ends with his complete ostracism. It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the doctor.\n\nAs audiences by now expected, Ibsen's next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this time, his attack was not against society's mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism. Always an iconoclast, Ibsen saw himself as an objective observer of society, \u201clike a lone franc tireur in the outposts\u201d, playing a lone hand, as he put it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Ibsen, Vol V|last=MacFarlane|first=James|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=London|pages=476}}</ref> Ibsen, perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, relied upon immediate sources such as newspapers and second-hand report for his contact with intellectual thought. He claimed to be ignorant of books, leaving them to his wife and son, but, as [[Georg Brandes]] described, \u201che seemed to stand in some mysterious correspondence with the fermenting, germinating ideas of the day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibsen: A biography|last=Meyer|first=Michael|publisher=Doubleday and Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=500}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) is by many considered Ibsen's finest work, and it is certainly the most complex. It tells the story of Gregers Werle, a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal. Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the \"Summons of the Ideal\". Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child. Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed. Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary \"invention\", his wife is earning the household income.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIbsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his child. Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice. Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the \"ideal\" is sometimes too much for the human heart to bear.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[File:Handwriting2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Letter from Ibsen to his English reviewer and translator [[Edmund Gosse]]: \"30.8.[18]99.

In such later plays as ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890) and ''[[The Master Builder]]'' (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection of current conventions. Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective consideration of interpersonal confrontation.  ''Hedda Gabler'' and ''A Doll\u2019s House'' are regularly cited as Ibsen\u2019s most popular and influential plays,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/theatre/henrik-ibsen-plays-a-dolls-house-hedda-gabler-a4233501.html|title=Henrik Ibsen's greatest plays, from A Doll's House to Hedda Gabler|last=Paskett|first=Zoe|date=11 September 2019|website=Evening Standard|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> with the title role of Hedda regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the present day.\n\nIbsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] which was to be adopted by [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and others and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] and [[Edmund Gosse]]. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel \"Stephen Hero\". Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. Michael Meyer's translations in the 1950s were welcomed by actors and directors as playable, rather than academic. As The Times newspaper put it, ''\u2018This, one may think, is how Ibsen might have expressed himself in English'.''\n\nIbsen intentionally obscured his influences. However, asked later what he had read when he wrote [[Catiline]], Ibsen replied that he had read only the Danish [[Norse saga]]-inspired [[Romantic period|Romantic]] tragedian [[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] and [[Ludvig Holberg]], \"the Scandinavian Moli\u00e8re\". [BBC Radio 4's in Our Time from Thursday, 31 May 2018 www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b42q58]\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAt the time when Ibsen was writing, literature was emerging as a formidable force in 19th century society.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Consciousness and Society: the Reorientation of European Social Thought|last=Hughes|first=H. Stuart|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2002|isbn=978-0765809186|location=|pages=}}</ref> It was still a relatively new form of popular discussion and entertainment. With the vast increase in literacy towards the end of the century, the possibilities of literature being used for subversion struck horror into the heart of the Establishment. Ibsen\u2019s plays, from ''A Doll\u2019s House'' onwards, caused an uproar: not just in Norway, but throughout Europe, and even across the Atlantic in America. No other artist, apart from Richard Wagner, had such an effect internationally, inspiring almost blasphemous adoration and hysterical abuse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibsen: A Biography|last=Meyer|first=Michael|publisher=Doubleday & Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the publication of ''Ghosts'', he wrote: \u201cwhile the storm lasted, I have made many studies and observations and I shall not hesitate to exploit them in my future writings.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Ibsen|last=MacFarlane|first=Robert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=London|pages=477}}</ref> Indeed, his next play ''An Enemy of the People'' was initially regard by the critics to be simply his response to the violent criticism which had greeted ''Ghosts''. Ibsen expected criticism: as he wrote to his publisher: \u201c''Ghosts'' will probably cause alarm in some circles, but it can\u2019t be helped. If it did not, there would have been no necessity for me to have written it.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibsen: A biography|last=Meyer|first=Michael|publisher=Doubleday & Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=505}}</ref>\n\nIbsen didn\u2019t just read the critical reaction to his plays, he actively corresponded with critics, publishers, theatre directors and newspaper editors on the subject. The interpretation of his work, both by critics and directors, concerned him greatly. He often advised directors on which actor or actress would be suitable for a particular role. [An example of this is a letter he wrote to Hans Schroder in November 1884, with detailed instructions for the production of ''The Wild Duck''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ibsen: A Biography|last=Meyer|first=Michael|publisher=Doubleday & Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=559}}</ref>]\n\nIbsen\u2019s plays initially reached a far wider audience as read plays rather than in performance. It was 20 years, for instance, before the authorities would allow ''Ghosts'' to be performed in Norway. Each new play that Ibsen wrote, from 1879 onwards, had an explosive effect on intellectual circles. This was greatest for ''A Doll\u2019s House'' and ''Ghosts'', and it did lessen with the later plays, but the translation of Ibsen\u2019s works into German, French and English during the decade following the initial publication of each play and frequent new productions as and when permission was granted, meant that Ibsen remained a topic of lively conversation throughout the latter decades of the 19th century. When ''A Doll\u2019s House'' was published, it had an explosive effect: it was the centre of every conversation at every social gathering in Christiana. One hostess even wrote on the invitations to her soir\u00e9e, \u201cYou are politely requested not to mention Mr Ibsen\u2019s new play\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Henrik Ibsen: Four Major Plays (Introduction)|last=MacFarlane|first=James|publisher=The World\u2019s Classics|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Introduction}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Henrik Ibsen portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Ibsen, late in his career]]\nOn 23 May 1906, Ibsen died in his home at Arbins gade 1 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo)<ref>since 2006 [[The Ibsen Museum (Oslo)]]</ref> after a series of strokes in March 1900.

From a modern perspective, the aspects of his writing that appeal most are the psychological issues which he explored. The social issues, taken up so prominently in his own day, have become dated, as has the late-Victorian middle-class setting of his plays. The fact that, whether read and staged, they still possess a compelling power is testament to his enduring quality as a thinker and a dramatist.\n\nOn the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Ibsen's death in 2006, the Norwegian government organised the [[Ibsen Year]], which included celebrations around the world. The [[NRK]] produced a miniseries on Ibsen's childhood and youth in 2006, ''[[An Immortal Man]]''. Several prizes are awarded in the name of Henrik Ibsen, among them the [[International Ibsen Award]], the [[Norwegian Ibsen Award]] and the [[Ibsen Centennial Commemoration Award]].\n\nEvery year, since 2008, the annual \"Delhi Ibsen Festival\", is held in Delhi, India, organized by the Dramatic Art and Design Academy (DADA) in collaboration with The Royal Norwegian Embassy in India.

Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them.\n\nThe oldest documented member of the [[Ibsen family]] was ship's captain Rasmus Ibsen (1632\u20131703) from [[Stege, Denmark]]. His son, ship's captain Peder Ibsen became a [[Citizen|burgher]] of [[Bergen]] in Norway in 1726.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Ibsen/norsk_slekt_som_stammer_fra_skipper_Rasmus_Ibsen|title=Ibsen \u2013 norsk slekt|author=Terje Bratberg|work=Store norske leksikon|date=15 November 2018}}</ref> Henrik Ibsen had Danish, German, Norwegian and some distant Scottish ancestry. Most of his ancestors belonged to the merchant class of original Danish and German extraction, and many of his ancestors were ship's captains.\n\nIbsen's biographer [[Henrik J\u00e6ger]] famously wrote in 1888 that Ibsen did not have a drop of Norwegian blood in his veins, stating that \"the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane\". This, however, is not completely accurate; notably through his grandmother Hedevig Paus, Ibsen was descended from one of the very few families of the patrician class of original Norwegian extraction, known since the 15th century. Ibsen's ancestors had mostly lived in Norway for several generations, even though many had foreign ancestry.<ref>[[Henrik J\u00e6ger|Henrik Jaeger]], ''Henrik Ibsen.

The patronymic became \"frozen\", i.e. it became a permanent [[family name]], in the 17th century. The phenomenon of patronymics becoming frozen started in the 17th century in bourgeois families in Denmark, and the practice was only widely adopted in Norway from around 1900.\n\n{{ahnentafel \n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Simon \u2014 creator of the 'About That' gossip app in which the personal lives of students at their fictional American high school, Bayview High, are posted for the rest of the school to see \u2014 begins a speech about the stereotypical personalities of the other four students and how he, through the medium of his app, is the omniscient narrator. He then drinks water from a plastic cup, announces that it tastes bad, then suffers a fatal [[allergy|allergic]] reaction.\n\nInitially the incident is considered an accident, but after a [[tumblr]] post is shared claiming that Simon's death was planned and the killer watched him die, the police begin to investigate and find an unpublished post by Simon that features the secrets of each of the other four students from detention. Each of the secrets would affect the character's future: Bronwyn's cheating on a test could impact her college applications; Nate's repeated misdemeanour could send him to jail; Addy's infidelity might end her relationship; and the accusation of [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]]-use could halt Cooper's potential [[baseball]] career. The four are initially suspicious of one another, wondering which of them is the guilty culprit, but they begin to appreciate each other's company due to their shared situation as the uncomfortable weeks at school pass.\n\nAs the story progresses, the investigation receives media attention, with news teams and reporters turning up at the students' houses, the school, and other locations frequented by the 'Bayview four' \u2014 the nickname used by the media for the suspects. Fearing the reporters outside, Bronwyn accepts Nate's proposal to leave with him through the woods at the back of the school. This triggers a romance between the two.\n\nAfter Simon's [[funeral]], the initial post is leaked and the rest of the school learn the four's secrets, triggering the consequences of each of their secrets: Bronwyn's parents are disappointed; Nate's house is searched; Addy's relationship ends; and Cooper's performance is investigated. This prompts Maeve, Bronwyn's younger sister, to begin investigating Simon's online activity, which brings to light the encrypted original post about Cooper, and Simon's activity on massacre-worship forums, on which he mentions a similar desire but with a 'twist'.\n\nAs Addy begins to find out who she is without Jake, she befriends Janae, Simon's friend, who begins to eat lunch with her at school and asks to 'hang out' at Addy's. After a conversation with Jake, Addy realises how he controlled their relationship and leaves his home. After another backdoor escape from school and development of their romance, Bronwyn and Nate return to his home in order to avoid the media and the disapproval of Bronwyn's parents, and find his mother outside, whom he claimed was dead. She claims to now be sober, and wishes to reconcile with her son and help during the investigation. Nate later explains everything to Bronwyn and the two begin dating in secret to avoid any suspicion regarding the case.\n\nThe [[encryption|encrypted]] file regarding Cooper is eventually opened by the police, outing him as gay and posing him as the new prime suspect, which had previously been Nate due to his previous conviction. This causes a rift between Cooper and his father, who is suggested to be [[homophobia|homophobic]]. When Cooper is [[bullying|bullied]] verbally as he enters the cafeteria after this news is leaked, Nate defends him, and afterwards the group all sit together, demonstrating their new [[solidarity]] and unexpected friendship. Shortly after, evidence is found in Nate's school locker and home tying him to the murder and he is arrested. This prompts Bronwyn to contact Eli Kleinfelter, a [[lawyer]] who she saw on television defending the 'Bayview four', asking him to help with the case against Nate.\n\nShe also suggests a meeting between the remaining three, and allies to their plight \u2014 Maeve, Addy's sister Ashton, and Cooper's newly acknowledged boyfriend Kris. As they discuss all that they know, Kris suggests that Simon may have committed [[suicide]] and framed the others for his death, and that Janae is the person most likely to know more. Addy, having befriended Janae, goes to her house under the half-pretence of checking on her, though she has come to care for her, and Janae confesses Simon's plan and her and Jake's involvement. Shortly afterwards, however, Jake arrives at the house, and as Addy and Janae try to trick him into a taped confession, Addy's phone alerts Jake to her presence, who then chases Addy down and attempts to strangle her. Addy is saved just in time by Cooper, who accompanied her to the house and stayed outside, saw Jake's arrival and followed them.\n\nJake is taken into custody and Nate is released, but is shaken from his time in the [[juvenile detention]] centre, rejecting Bronwyn's concern and breaking off their burgeoning relationship. Addy begins to heal in hospital after the ordeal, and once she is released Ashton takes her to the apartment she has just rented and asks Addy to live with her, which Addy happily accepts. Cooper's college and drafting options begin to reappear and his relationship with his father starts to improve again after the tension from being outed. Bronwyn applies to [[Yale]], having received a [[Twitter|tweet]] from the university acknowledging her admission of guilt over cheating and welcoming her application. She begins dating Evan Neiman, a student and fellow [[mathlete]], though she does not consider it serious, and does not invite him to her [[piano]] recital. As she is leaving the recital, she finds Nate waiting for her, wanting to apologise and ask if she would consider being at least friends if not more. The story ends as she accepts his offer to a movie as friends, but with a potential for more.\n\n== Characters ==\n* '''Bronwyn Rojas:''' One of the four point-of-view characters; the '[[brain]]'.

Simon \u2014 creator of the 'About That' gossip app in which the personal lives of students at their fictional American high school, Bayview High, are posted for the rest of the school to see \u2014 begins a speech about the stereotypical personalities of the other four students and how he, through the medium of his app, is the omniscient narrator. He then drinks water from a plastic cup, announces that it tastes bad, then suffers a fatal [[allergy|allergic]] reaction.\n\nInitially the incident is considered an accident, but after a [[tumblr]] post is shared claiming that Simon's death was planned and the killer watched him die, the police begin to investigate and find an unpublished post by Simon that features the secrets of each of the other four students from detention. Each of the secrets would affect the character's future: Bronwyn's cheating on a test could impact her college applications; Nate's repeated misdemeanour could send him to jail; Addy's infidelity might end her relationship; and the accusation of [[Anabolic steroid|steroid]]-use could halt Cooper's potential [[baseball]] career. The four are initially suspicious of one another, wondering which of them is the guilty culprit, but they begin to appreciate each other's company due to their shared situation as the uncomfortable weeks at school pass.\n\nAs the story progresses, the investigation receives media attention, with news teams and reporters turning up at the students' houses, the school, and other locations frequented by the 'Bayview four' \u2014 the nickname used by the media for the suspects. Fearing the reporters outside, Bronwyn accepts Nate's proposal to leave with him through the woods at the back of the school. This triggers a romance between the two.\n\nAfter Simon's [[funeral]], the initial post is leaked and the rest of the school learn the four's secrets, triggering the consequences of each of their secrets: Bronwyn's parents are disappointed; Nate's house is searched; Addy's relationship ends; and Cooper's performance is investigated. This prompts Maeve, Bronwyn's younger sister, to begin investigating Simon's online activity, which brings to light the encrypted original post about Cooper, and Simon's activity on massacre-worship forums, on which he mentions a similar desire but with a 'twist'.\n\nAs Addy begins to find out who she is without Jake, she befriends Janae, Simon's friend, who begins to eat lunch with her at school and asks to 'hang out' at Addy's. After a conversation with Jake, Addy realises how he controlled their relationship and leaves his home. After another backdoor escape from school and development of their romance, Bronwyn and Nate return to his home in order to avoid the media and the disapproval of Bronwyn's parents, and find his mother outside, whom he claimed was dead. She claims to now be sober, and wishes to reconcile with her son and help during the investigation. Nate later explains everything to Bronwyn and the two begin dating in secret to avoid any suspicion regarding the case.\n\nThe [[encryption|encrypted]] file regarding Cooper is eventually opened by the police, outing him as gay and posing him as the new prime suspect, which had previously been Nate due to his previous conviction. This causes a rift between Cooper and his father, who is suggested to be [[homophobia|homophobic]]. When Cooper is [[bullying|bullied]] verbally as he enters the cafeteria after this news is leaked, Nate defends him, and afterwards the group all sit together, demonstrating their new [[solidarity]] and unexpected friendship. Shortly after, evidence is found in Nate's school locker and home tying him to the murder and he is arrested. This prompts Bronwyn to contact Eli Kleinfelter, a [[lawyer]] who she saw on television defending the 'Bayview four', asking him to help with the case against Nate.\n\nShe also suggests a meeting between the remaining three, and allies to their plight \u2014 Maeve, Addy's sister Ashton, and Cooper's newly acknowledged boyfriend Kris. As they discuss all that they know, Kris suggests that Simon may have committed [[suicide]] and framed the others for his death, and that Janae is the person most likely to know more. Addy, having befriended Janae, goes to her house under the half-pretence of checking on her, though she has come to care for her, and Janae confesses Simon's plan and her and Jake's involvement. Shortly afterwards, however, Jake arrives at the house, and as Addy and Janae try to trick him into a taped confession, Addy's phone alerts Jake to her presence, who then chases Addy down and attempts to strangle her. Addy is saved just in time by Cooper, who accompanied her to the house and stayed outside, saw Jake's arrival and followed them.\n\nJake is taken into custody and Nate is released, but is shaken from his time in the [[juvenile detention]] centre, rejecting Bronwyn's concern and breaking off their burgeoning relationship. Addy begins to heal in hospital after the ordeal, and once she is released Ashton takes her to the apartment she has just rented and asks Addy to live with her, which Addy happily accepts. Cooper's college and drafting options begin to reappear and his relationship with his father starts to improve again after the tension from being outed. Bronwyn applies to [[Yale]], having received a [[Twitter|tweet]] from the university acknowledging her admission of guilt over cheating and welcoming her application. She begins dating Evan Neiman, a student and fellow [[mathlete]], though she does not consider it serious, and does not invite him to her [[piano]] recital. As she is leaving the recital, she finds Nate waiting for her, wanting to apologise and ask if she would consider being at least friends if not more. The story ends as she accepts his offer to a movie as friends, but with a potential for more.\n\n== Characters ==\n* '''Bronwyn Rojas:''' One of the four point-of-view characters; the '[[brain]]'.
