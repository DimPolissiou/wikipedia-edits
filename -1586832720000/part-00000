In the usual way, the ownership of the estate (and the various titles) were generally passed from father to son, excepting when there were no male heirs. This particular branch of the Campbell family were given the titles of [[Breadalbane, Scotland|Breadalbane]], an area in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] of Scotland; and [[Glen Orchy|Glenorchy]], a [[glen]] in [[Argyll and Bute]].\n\nA number of the Campbells were Earls of Breadalbane and [[Parts of Holland|Holland]]. The family were given the lands of Breadalbane and [[Lawers]] in the 15th century by [[James III of Scotland|King James III]], for Sir Colin Campbell's help in capturing Thomas Chalmer, one of the assassins of [[James I of Scotland|King James I]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1919\">Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 9 April 1919, Page 2</ref> The title of Holland refers to an area of [[Lincolnshire]], England. The [[John Campbell, 1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland|1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland]] married the [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland|1st Earl of Holland's]] daughter, Lady Mary Rich. He therefore acquired the English title of Holland, through his wife. The [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland|1st Earl of Holland]] was executed in London in 1649 for [[treason]]. He was beheaded.\n\nSir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy, who built Balloch Castle in 1552, was a [[knight]], the lowest rank of all of the owners of Balloch and Taymouth Castle. As time went on, his descendants' rank gradually increased, until the last Campbell listed, Sir Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane until 1922, achieved the high rank of [[Marquess]].\n\nThe male ranking hierarchy in Scotland, from lowest to highest is as follows; [[Knight]], [[Baronet]], [[Baron]], [[Lord of Parliament]], [[Viscount]], [[Earl]], [[Marquess]] and [[Duke]].\n\nThe Campbells of Breadalbane were incredibly powerful and influential, due to the vast amounts of land that they owned in Scotland. They were also involved in many of the violent events and battles during Scotland's historical clan feuds. They were thus, highly feared by the other clans, for their determination to both increase their power and influence and to defend their estates at all costs, throughout this bloody period in Scotland's history. There was also a long-running [[feud]] between the Campbells and the [[Clan Gregor|Gregors]], who later went on to become known as the MacGregors, for whom the famous [[Rob Roy MacGregor]] belonged. More information about these events are detailed in the history sections below.<ref name=\"scotsman.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/which-was-the-most-feared-highland-clan-1-4371553 |title=Which was the most feared Highland clan? |publisher=The Scotsman |date=2017-02-20 |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\n===The Black Book of Taymouth===\n\nIn 1855, the [[John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane|2nd Marquess of Breadalbane]] allowed historical papers from the Breadlabane Charter Room to be published in printed form in a book called ''The Black Book of Taymouth''. This book had in fact largely been written and compiled between 1598 and 1648 by William Bowie, although [[Cosmo Innes]] also contributed to the 1855 publication, which includes entries up to 1703. The book concentrates more on the history of the Central Highlands than that of the Breadalbane family, although this is referred to in the book.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe book is written in [[Scots language|Scots]], with William Bowie dedicating his version of the book to Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy, 1st Baronet Campbell, otherwise known as 'Black Duncan'.

The first was a sailing vessel, built in 1851 by Scott & Sons.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The second was a three-masted 'fully rigged' sailing vessel, built in 1865, by [[Charles Connell & Company]].

Some time in the 17th century, the Laird of Inchbrakie witnessed a large crowd, headed by one of the Campbells of Glenorchy, who were preparing to drown a witch. The Laird recognised the victim as being Katherine Niven, his old nurse and subsequently did his best to try and save her. He was unsuccessful, but she was still grateful enough to throw him a blue sapphire stone for his efforts. She said that whilst the stone remained with him, he would always have good fortune and that the Campbells would not have a male heir. Both prophecies were said to have come true.<ref>The Dundee Telegraph dated 6 April 1937, Page 3</ref> If there is any element of truth in this tale, then it would seem that the Campbell who was leading the [[witch-hunt]] may have been [[Sir Colin Campbell, 2nd Baronet]], who died childless in 1640.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nTaymouth Castle is said to be haunted.<ref name=\"heraldscotland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12759834.The_fairytale_castle_in_search_of_a_happy_ending/ |title=The fairytale castle in search of a happy ending |publisher=HeraldScotland |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\n==Taymouth Castle History==\n\nThe landowners of Taymouth Castle, together with dates of ownership and significant events are shown here.

The main block of the old house was demolished, to be replaced from 1806, by a [[Gothic revival|Gothic]] building, to the designs of the brothers James and [[Archibald Elliot]]. The English-Italian [[Francis Bernasconi]] carried out the ornate plasterwork of the staircase and drawing rooms between 1809 and 1812.<ref name=listed/> In 1818, the old east wing was pulled down and replaced by a two-storey wing designed by [[William Atkinson (architect)|William Atkinson]].<ref name=listed/>\n\nIn 1793, John Campbell formed three regiments of [[fencibles]], known as the [[Breadalbane Fencibles]] to help defend the land in time of need. He managed to raise 2,300 men, of whom 1,600 were from his own estate. At one time, the castle also had its own [[fire brigade]].<ref>The Courier and Advertiser dated 26 July 1950, Page 3</ref>\n\nIn 1819, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Prince Leopold]], the future king of [[Belgium]] visited the castle and was welcomed by more than 2,000 [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The Dundee Courier dated 24 November 1948, Page 2</ref> A royal salute was fired from the battery and the pipers were playing 'Phaill Phranse', the Prince's Welcome.

Loudon described Taymouth as the 'most magnificent residence in the country ... The mountain, lawn and banks of the waters, are richly clothed with wood, through which are led magnificent walks. Of trees, the lime and larches have attained to a great size, and there is an avenue of the former 450 yards in length, scarcely equalled anywhere.'<ref name=\"GDL00354\"/>\n\nThe 4th Earl, was created 1st Marquess of Breadalbane in 1831, but died in 1834.

The ceilings of the West Wing are described by [[Historic Scotland]] as the \"finest of their period in the UK\".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} It took an Italian painter nearly ten years to paint the ceilings with the various coats of arms of the Breadalbane family and their flags. He painted them lying on his back in rope slings.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> [[Ore]] [[smelting]] equipment was also installed into the West Wing, to smelt the specimens of ore that were occasionally found on the Breadalbane estates.

On their arrival, the castle's heavy guns fired off a royal salute, with over 200 traditionally-armed highlanders there to receive them.<ref>The Illustrated London News dated 3 September 1842, Page 7</ref> They were duly entertained with 'lavish pomp' and it was remarked that the scene would need the pen of a poet to give any justice to the splendour. In the evening, 50,000 lamps were lit on a slope outside the castle, arranged in such a fashion as they formed the words \"Welcome Victoria and Albert\". Apparently, their stay cost Campbell \u00a360,000, whilst at the time, he was said to have an annual rental income of \u00a345,000.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">The Inverness Courier dated 14 September 1842, Page 3</ref>\n\nLater during their stay, the Queen was rowed up Loch Tay from [[Killin]],<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 23 March 1951, Page 2</ref> whilst Prince Albert rode out on a stag hunt over the estate.

Both were only distantly related to the 2nd Marquess and could never have imagined that they could ultimately inherit. John Alexander Gavin Campbell of Glenfalloch's claim was disputed by Lieutenant Charles William Campbell of Borland. The dispute ultimately hinged on whether J A G Campbell's grandparents were legally married, and therefore the legitimacy of his father. There was apparently very little evidence on this fact, other than a letter written by his grandmother stating that they were married in 1782.

He was also a [[County council|County Councillor]] in both Perth and Argyll, a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Argyll, a [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Councillor]], [[Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland]], [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], [[Lord-in-waiting]] to Queen Victoria, [[Treasurer of the Household|Treasurer]] and [[Lord Steward]] of the Royal Household and an [[Aide-de-camp|ADC]] to His Majesty.<ref name=\"autogenerated1919\"/>\n\nIn 1872, he married Lady Alma Imogene Graham, daughter of the [[James Graham, 4th Duke of Montrose|4th Duke of Montrose]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1919\"/>\n\nIn 1877, [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] visited the castle. In the same year, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]], who was the youngest son of Queen Victoria, also visited.<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\">Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 30 November 1950, Page 4</ref>\n\nIn December 1879, the former [[Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] stayed at Taymouth Castle for three days, whilst on a speech-making tour of Scotland. The tour was said to be an unusual event, as in those days it was pretty unheard of for a leading politician to 'stump' the country in this way. It was described as 'an American-style election campaign'.<ref>The Illustrated London News dated 1 November 1979, Page 59</ref> In the same year, [[Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden]] also visited the castle.<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\"/>\n\nSir Gavin started the Lock Tay Steamboat Company, to enable his tenants to travel more easily to the nearest railway station, on a vessel known as the Queen of the Lake. Later, the enterprise was transformed into a popular attraction, operating pleasure cruises between Kenmore and Killin. Eventually, the ship was taken over by [[British Railways]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn 1881, the castle had another royal visitor, being [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]]. Later in 1884, King [[Oscar II of Sweden]] visited and in the following year, the Prince [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick of Hanover]] visited the castle.<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\"/>\n\nIn 1888, Sir Gavin was awarded the Medal of the [[Royal Humane Society]], for saving the life of a servant, whilst at the imminent risk to his own life. The servant, by the name of McLean, had fallen out of a boat and into the River Tay. At the time, the river was flooded and McLean was caught in a deep whirlpool, with eddies and rocks creating even more difficulties. Sir Gavin, who was out shooting at the time,  stripped off his gunbelt and dived into the river to rescue him. The medal he earned for this, along with five more of his medals, were sold at auction in 2009 for \u00a32,700.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dnw.co.uk/auction-archive/lot-archive/lot.php?department=Medals&lot_id=171379 |title=Lot 323, 24 June 2009 &#124; Dix Noonan Webb |publisher=Dnw.co.uk |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\nSir Gavin was also awarded the Swedish [[Royal Order of the Seraphim|Order of the Seraphim]], conferred upon him by [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar]], for his hospitality to the then Prince [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], when he came to the UK to marry [[Princess Margaret of Connaught]] in 1905.<ref>Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 6 August 1920, Page 2</ref>\n\nWhen he inherited his titles in 1871, his estate was still nearly half a million acres in size.<ref name=\"glendiscovery.com\"/> It contained 'The Heart of Scotland', a thick wood of fir trees in the shape of a heart.<ref name=\"autogenerated1919\"/> Unfortunately, throughout Sir Gavin's tenure at Taymouth, he managed to lose most of this land. His worsening financial problems, were said to be due to an extravagant lifestyle, \"bad management and his gambling addiction\".<ref name=\"heraldscotland.com\"/> His mountainous debts finally forced him to put the castle and its remaining 60,000 acres up for sale in 1920. Included in the sale were a number of farms, hotels, private houses and shooting and fishing rights.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 6 August 1920, Page 3</ref> The sale was achieved in 1921, when the castle was sold for \u00a320,000<ref>Edinburgh Evening News dated 12 May 1923, Page 5</ref> to a syndicate, who intended to turn the estate into a hotel complex.<ref name=\"autogenerated1922\">The Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 24 April 1922, Page 6</ref> However, the completion date was set for May 1922 and the Campbells continued to reside in the castle for the time being.\n\nThe father of the Scottish writer [[Fred Urquhart]] was chauffeur to the Marquess in the early twentieth century, and Urquhart's novel ''Palace of Green Days'' (1979) draws on his childhood memories of this.<ref>{{cite web|title=Papers of Fred Urquhart|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/65dc9cb7-f7d6-3fc8-86a9-549649371222|website=Jisc Archives Hub|accessdate=27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1922, the Marquess and Marchioness duly said farewell to the castle forever, after fifty years of occupation, and moved out to their other home in Craig, [[Dalmally]].<ref>The Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 24 March 1922, Page 5</ref>\n\nSir Gavin died childless, very shortly afterwards, in October 1922 and most of his titles died with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepeerage.com/p15045.htm#i150444 |title=Person Page |publisher=Thepeerage.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref> However, even though every last acre of the original half a million acre estate had been sold off, there were still three more Earls of Breadalbane and Holland. The 10th and last Earl was John Romer Boreland Campbell, who died childless in 1995. Following his death, the title has remained dormant.<ref name=\"glendiscovery.com\"/>\n\n===Taymouth Castle Hotel Company LTD (1922 &ndash; 1940)===\n\nAt the time of their purchase, the hotel company from [[Glasgow]], which included the MacTaggart family,<ref name=\"heraldscotland.com\"/> also bought 520 acres of adjoining land, which brought the estate back to around 2,000 acres. It was declared by the company that they intended to convert the castle into a [[Hydrotherapy|hydropathic]] hotel, along with opening a brand new golf course on its lands. The company also acquired fishing rights on [[Loch Tay]] and part of the [[River Tay]] and shooting rights on Drumhill.<ref name=\"autogenerated1922\"/> At the same time, there was a huge auction at the castle, in which all of its furniture and effects were sold. The newspaper article reporting the event, said that 'the things that gave the castle its life and history, will be scattered to the four winds of heaven'.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 22 April 1922, Page 3</ref> The auction realised total sales of \u00a324,000, with half of that amount being paid by the new hotel owners, to retain furniture in the castle.<ref>The Scotsman dated 1 May 1922, Page 7</ref>\n\nThe hydro hotel opened on 30 June 1923, boasting around 100 bedrooms. Since buying the castle, its facilities had been greatly improved, including central heating and electricity being installed throughout. The hotel also offered music and dancing, a grass riding track and had four [[en tout cas]] tennis courts and a covered badminton court. They possessed a fleet of motor vehicles, offering drives to places of interest and steamer excursions on Loch Tay. The golf course had been finished and there was of course fly fishing. At the time of opening, they hadn't quite managed to offer shooting, but they had the shooting rights for Drummond Hill, on which 30 stags had been killed in the previous year.<ref>The Motherwell Times dated 6 July 1923, Page 8</ref>\n\nDespite good patronage, the Taymouth Castle Hotel Company LTD were forced into voluntary liquidation in March 1926. The blame was put on the high cost of all the alterations necessary to convert the castle. It was disclosed that as there were good Easter bookings, the hotel would remain open for the time being.<ref>The Dundee Evening Telegraph date 29 March 1926, Page 9</ref> The hotel eventually closed for the winter on 30 September 1926, with the liquidators having already sold off portions of the lands, dramatically reducing the size of the estate.<ref>Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 8 December 1926, Page 3</ref>\n\nThe hotel reopened on 1 June 1927, for the summer season. The advertised rate was 18s to 25s per person per day.<ref>The Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer dated 18 May 1927, Page 1</ref> In September 1927,  the [[Yi Un|Prince]] and [[Yi Bangja|Princess]] Gin Ri of Korea visited the castle. Whilst at that time a colony of Japan, the prince was the son of the late [[Gojong of Korea|Emperor of Korea]] and the princess was a cousin of the [[Empress K\u014djun|Empress of Japan]].<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 1 September 1927, Page 10</ref>\n\nThe following year the hotel reopened for the 1928 season and its long-term future was secured, when the castle was bought by a 'well known London combine'. The new owners declared that the castle would continue as a 'hydro'.<ref>Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 1 May 1928, Page 3</ref>\n\n===Taymouth Castle Hospital (1940 &ndash; 1948)===\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], use of the castle was requisitioned by the War Office, to help with the war effort. From 1940, it became known as the No. 1 Polish General Hospital, or otherwise as the Taymouth Castle Hospital. It was the chief Polish hospital in the country and boasted some of the finest and most up-to-date equipment, with its operating theatres and X-Ray machines.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref>\n\nAlso, in April 1940, the castle advertised that the golf course and Policy Parks were available for let, for sheep and cattle grazing.<ref>Perthshire Advertiser dated 17 April 1940, Page 3</ref> It was later noted that despite having its own golf course, the wounded Polish servicemen showed no interest in golf, although they were enthusiastic footballers.<ref>The Scotsman dated 27 July 1950, Page 6</ref>\n\nOver the eight years of its use as a hospital, thousands of Polish patients were treated there, with its biggest influx after the battle of [[Cassino]], when over 200 Polish casualties arrived.<ref>Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref> At its height, it had 1200 beds and 200 staff. Despite still being under the control of the War Office, its use as a hospital came to an end in December 1947, with the remaining Polish patients being disbursed to hospitals in England.\n\nThe chairman of the owning hotel company said that he thought that it would be a year or two before the castle could be re-opened as a hotel. He said that the lack of tradesmen would be a big obstacle to its redecoration and renovation.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref> Severe damage to one of the west towers, from a fire in 1946, would also have to be repaired. However, during its time as a hospital, care had been taken to protect the castle's magnificent carved oak walls and doors. These had been boarded up, using cardboard and plywood. Similar precautions had been taken to protect the marble mantelpieces and stained glass windows.<ref>Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref>\n\nSeventy-five [[Nissen huts]] were removed from the castle grounds.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref> However, their foundations can still be seen today.\n\n===Civil Defence Corps Training School (1949 &ndash; 1968)===\n\nIn February 1949, the government formed the [[Civil Defence Corps]], which was a civilian volunteer organisation, which could take control of areas of the country in times of national emergency, such as after a nuclear attack. In a joint announcement by the [[Home Office]] and the [[Scottish Office]], it was declared that Taymouth Castle was to be used as one of three training centres in Scotland, which would teach instructors in how to train a much bigger volunteer force.<ref>The Scotsman dated 18 February 1949, Page 6</ref> Alterations were made to the castle, which was designed to train between 100 and 150 men and women at a time.<ref>The Scotsman dated 3 June 1949, Page 5</ref> The cost of these alterations was finally put at \u00a3126,000, way past its original budget of \u00a375,700.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 21 March 1950, Page 3</ref>\n\nWhen it was opened in December 1950 by the [[Scottish Secretary]] [[Hector McNeil]], it was described as the most up-to-date in the world.<ref>Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 8 December 1950, Page 4</ref> The centre also included a mock '[[The Blitz|blitzed]] village', for trainees to practice in.<ref>Dundee Courier dated 12 September 1950, Page 4</ref> The village was built and then partially demolished, to provide defense volunteers with practical rescue training. Roofs were said to lie at 'drunken angles', walls gaped open, timber beams were scorched with fire; and all laid out to conform with Scottish types of architecture. The village was so realistic that the visiting [[James Henderson-Stewart|Sir James Henderson-Stewart]], Under-[[Secretary of State for Scotland]] said that there was a staggering contrast between the beauty of the castle and the scenes of ruin, bringing home more forcibly the devastation of war and the need to be ready for any emergency.<ref>Arbroath Herald and Advertiser for the Montrose Burghs dated 1 August 1952, Page 3</ref>\n\nAs part of their training, the volunteers were given advanced instruction in [[Nuclear weapon|atomic]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[Biological warfare|biological]] warfare.<ref>The Fifeshire Advertiser dated 3 February 1951, Page 3</ref>\n\nBy 1956, the Corps had grown to 330,000 personnel. However, the Corps was eventually disbanded in 1968, after a change of thinking in how to deal with nuclear attacks.\nHowever, its role in national defence didn't end there. From 1968, it was also one of the designated locations for plan [[PYTHON]], the plan for [[continuity of government]] in the event of nuclear war.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/15053819.The_top_secret_story_of_just_how_important_Portland_could_have_been_in_the_Cold_War/|title=If nuclear war had broken out between Russia and the west, HMS Osprey on Portland would have been a remote hideaway for the government|publisher=Dorset Echo|date=28 January 2017}}</ref> The plan, which was classified as TOP SECRET, was that in the event of a nuclear attack, the government and other essential personnel could be dispersed around the country, to secret and protected locations. Taymouth Castle was chosen as one of these sites.\n\nIt is not known when Taymouth Castle ceased to be considered as one of these secret locations, but the three associated [[Caledonian MacBrayne|CalMac]] support ships, which were capable of acting as floating nuclear bunkers, were sold by CalMac in the 1980s. These ships operated from day-to-day as normal commercial car ferries, but had been designed and built in such a way that if needed, they could be used as [[radiation]] resistant transport and decontamination chambers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Julie McDowall |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15039649.How_Scotland_and_three_CalMac_ferries_played_a_crucial_part_in_nuclear_planning/ |title=How Scotland and three CalMac ferries played a crucial part in nuclear planning |publisher=HeraldScotland |date=1968-05-01 |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\n===Boarding School (1970 &ndash; 1974)===\n\nAfter it ceased to be a Civil Defence Corps training centre in 1968, Taymouth Castle was turned into a boarding school for high-school aged students.

Subjects taught at the school were English, US History, British History, Geography, Algebra, Geometry, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, General Science, French, and German<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/ClassLists1.jpg List of teachers and subjects in 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref> -- with two 'study halls'<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/StudyHalls1.jpg Study-hall list from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref> and a PE class every weekday.  Activities via a number of 'clubs' were also offered, and at weekends, trips were arranged to various locations in the region.\n\nThe boys' dormitory was on the second floor, east of the main entrance, with the girls' dormitory to the west.  In some ways, rules were quite liberal when compared to British private schools of the time.  For example, 11th-grade students were (reluctantly) allowed to smoke in certain areas if they had written permission from their parents<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/SchCode1.jpg School Code of Conduct document from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>. On the other hand, boys were required to have a \"businessman's haircut\"<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/SchCode1.jpg School Code of Conduct document from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>, and that girls \"dress neatly, are polite, well-mannered and ladylike\", (they were also asked to \"remember to wear soft slippers on the Third Floor.\"<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/GirlsBd1.jpg Notice to Girls from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>)  There was no uniform, but there was the expectation for \"all students to rise when any adult enters a room\"<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/GirlsBd1.jpg Notice to Girls from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>. \n\nAll students were boarders (no 'day students'), and were provided with wholesome meals: breakfast at 8:00 am, lunch at 1:15 pm, and dinner at 6:30 pm<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/Sched1.jpg Weekday Schedule from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>. Two staff would supervise the student eating hall, while the rest of the staff dined in the famous 'Banner Hall' of the castle (the ceiling being emblazed with the coats of arms of dignitaries who had visited the castle throughout its history)<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/perth-kinross/90661/preview-tour-gives-a-tantalising-glimpse-of-taymouth-castles-future/ Description of the ceiling of the Banner Hall, The Courier, 27 August 2011; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref><ref>[https://scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/record/hes/24893/taymouth-castle/rcahms Images of Taymouth Castle, 'Scotland's Places' website; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>.\n\nIt was expected that student enrollment in the school would grow substantially in the year following its opening -- as had happened at the 'sister' school, Herringswell Manor in Suffolk -- but this did not happen, and the school closed within a few years of its opening.  A website commemorating this unique but short-lived educational facility was set up in 2001, with original documents and photos collected from teacher and student alumni being displayed<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/TayHome.htm 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, established 2001.]</ref>.\n\n===Speech and Drama School (1982)===\n\nIn September 1981, it was advertised that the Taymouth Castle Residential School of Speech and Drama was starting classes in January 1982. Auditions were being held for three courses, which were a One-year Stage course, a Two-year Diploma and Stage course and a One-year course in [[puppetry]].<ref>The Stage dated 24 September 1981, Page 12</ref>\n\nAt this time, nothing further is known about those courses, but the castle is known to have been closed and empty since around that time.\n\nThe golf course continued to be operated separately, but this too is currently closed, whilst alterations are being made to the course.\n\n===Restoration plans (1982 &ndash; date)===\n\nDespite its many changes of use and its requisitioning by the government, through the war years and beyond, legal ownership of the castle was still retained by the MacTaggart family, who had first turned the castle into a hotel in 1922. However, they had been unable to make any real commercial use of the castle since the boarding school for children of American servicemen closed in 1979. Throughout the 1990s, the family had been unsuccessfully trying to sell the estate, with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cher]] both being initially interested.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 1995, the castle and estate were on the market for \u00a35.5m.<ref name=\"buildingsatrisk.org.uk\"/>\n\nBy the year 2000, the castle was suffering badly from leaks and rot.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} It was eventually sold to a building consortium in 2005 for \u00a312m. At the time of purchase, plans to redevelop the castle as a \"six-star\" hotel with 150 rooms had already been approved by Perth and Kinross Council.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3533134.stm |title= Council backs castle hotel plans | publisher = BBC News | date= 4 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nHowever, since then, due to the huge costs involved and the need to find suitable investment, progress has been slow, with work starting and stalling.

On 7 April 1570, after securing the consent of the [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Regent Morton]], Sir Colin personally beheaded Gregor at Balloch Castle, in the presence of the [[John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl|Earl of Atholl]], the Justice Clerk. Gregor's wife, Marion Campbell, who also witnessed her husband's execution, wrote a bitter [[lament]] about the affair, called '[[Griogal Cridhe]]'.

Wary that he might already be married, Elizabeth made him swear that he had no other wife and he solemnly swore on the cross of his sword that he 'had no wife above ground'. She did not realise the deception and they were indeed married. His other wife was ultimately released from the vault, after she had made a declaration that she was not his wife.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">The Bradford Observer dated 12 September 1861, Page 7</ref>\n\nHe had several nicknames, the first being 'Duncan of the (seven) Castles', as he was renowned for building them. His other nickname was 'Black Duncan'. He had been appointed by the King to keep the peace between the feuding clans in Argyll and Perthshire and was accordingly allowed to maintain a large force of armed soldiers to support him. However, he had a reputation for causing trouble, rather than stopping it and was said to be more interested in using his power to acquire extra land for himself. During his lifetime, he therefore managed to significantly enlarge the family's estate, by 'fair means or foul'.<ref>In Famed Breadalbane by William Gillies</ref> He also extended Balloch Castle.<ref name=\"glendiscovery.com\"/>\n\nIn April 1603, King [[James VI and I]] outlawed the [[Clan Gregor]], following the [[Battle of Glen Fruin]], in which the Gregors killed between 200 and 300 men of the [[Clan Colquhoun]].

The Campbell army were routed and of its 2,000 men, about 1,500 were killed during a running battle over 14 miles of countryside. Their commander, Auchinbreck, was captured and beheaded by [[Alasdair Mac Colla]], who commanded part of the Royalist forces. Although they won this battle, Montrose suffered a heavy defeat seven months later at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]] and his forces were ultimately crushed five years later, at the [[Battle of Carbisdale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://montrose-society.ndo.co.uk/batin.htm |title=The 1st Marquis of Montrose Society |publisher=Montrose-society.ndo.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\nSir Robert had 16 children from his marriage with Isabel MacIntosh, dying in 1657.\n\n===Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy, 4th Baronet Campbell (1657 &ndash; 1677)===\n\nSir John Campbell was Commissioner of Supply and Excise for Argyll and Perth and succeeded to the title of 4th Baronet Campbell, of Glenorchy.

In 1692, he played a key role in the [[Massacre of Glencoe]], by instructing a relative, [[Robert Campbell of Glenlyon]], to carry it out.<ref name=\"fionamsinclair.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"perthshire-scotland.co.uk\"/> Thirty Eight McDonalds from the [[MacDonald of Glencoe|Clan McDonald of Glencoe]] were killed by their own guests and another 40 women and children died of [[Hypothermia|exposure]], after their homes were burned.\n\nCampbell also took part in the abortive [[Cavalier|royalist]] uprising under [[John Campbell, 1st Earl of Loudoun]] in 1654 and was also implicated in the [[Sir James Montgomery, 4th Baronet|Montgomery Plot]], a [[Jacobitism|Jocobite]] scheme to restore [[James II of England|King James II and VII]] to the thrones of England and Scotland. In 1692, he was imprisoned for a time in [[Edinburgh Castle]] for his involvement in negotiations between Jacobite chiefs. However, he was released after it was discovered that he was acting with the knowledge of [[William III of England|King William III]].\n\nIn 1672, Campbell acquired as payment of debts, the estates and titles of George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness, which included the parish of [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] and the castles of [[Castle Sinclair Girnigoe|Girnigoe]], [[Ackergill Tower|Ackergill]] and [[Keiss Castle|Keiss]]. He assumed the title of [[Earl of Caithness]], although his right to these titles and lands were disputed by George Sinclair of Keiss, first cousin to the 6th Earl of Caithness. Sinclair lay [[siege]] to Girnigoe Castle, damaging it so badly that it has never been inhabited since. In a counter-attack, Campbell took his army and marched on Sinclair, to fight what was to become known as the [[Battle of Altimarlach]]. Campbell's force easily routed Sinclair's army, whose men fled across the [[Wick River|River Wick]]. But, a large number were killed and it is said that so many lay slain, that Campbell's soldiers were able to cross the river over their bodies, without getting their feet wet. Despite this strategic victory, George Sinclair later won his argument in court in 1681 and claimed the title of Earl of Caithness and the lands. However, Campbell was compensated for the loss of these, by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] elevating him to Lord of [[Glen Orchy|Glenorchy]], Benederaloch, Ormelie and Wick, Viscount of Tay and Paintland, and 1st Earl of [[Breadalbane, Scotland|Breadalbane]] and [[Parts of Holland|Holland]].<ref>The John O'Groat Journal dated 16 April 1841, Page 4</ref>\n\nIt was here that Campbell's piper composed the clan's famous [[pibroch]], 'Bodach na Briogais', which ridicules the Sinclairs. The event is also commemorated in the famous song 'The Campbells are Coming'.<ref name=\"fionamsinclair.co.uk\"/> Many people refer to the Battle of Altimarlach as the last clan battle in Scotland and it would seem that it was the last true clan battle. However, in 1689 there was a later fierce battle at [[Battle of Maol Ruadh|Mullroy]], [[Kilmonivaig]], when the [[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch|Macdonalds of Keppoch]] fought and defeated the [[Clan Mackintosh|MacIntoshes]], over ownership of [[Glen Roy]]. However, the MacIntoshes had government support and part of their army was made up of government troops, making it more of a government action than a true clan battle.<ref>The Ludlow Advertiser dated 12 August 1899, Page 6</ref>\n\nIt is said that the people of Wick, hated Campbell so much that they caused him no end of trouble. Wearied by these incessant vexations, he divided Wick into 62 portions in 1690 and sold them all.\n\nAt one time, King William III entrusted Campbell with \u00a320,000, a huge sum of money, to use it to achieve peace between some warring Highland Chiefs. However, rather than spend the money, he managed to negotiate a deal between them. When asked to account for the \u00a320,000, he replied \"Gentlemen - the money is spent, the Highlands are at peace, and that is the only way of accounting among friends\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nAn early fan of golf, Slippery John is recorded as buying a pair of golf clubs for his children in 1672 and having one club repaired at a cost of four shillings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishgolfhistory.org/news/a-new-reference-to-golf-in-1460/ |title=A 'New' Reference to 'Golf' in 1460 |publisher=Scottish Golf History |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Taymouth Castle#The Black Book of Taymouth|Black Book of Taymouth]], the history of the Breadalbanes, published by the [[John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane|2nd Marquess of Breadalbane]] states that in 1681, Gilleasba, chief of the MacDonalds of Keppoch, gave a bond of [[manrent]] to Sir John, promising that none of his clan or his people would commit robbery on his lands.

Elaborate gardens and orchards were also planted on both sides of the Castle. To the south, Adam planted an avenue of trees in the shape of a D. On the banks of the river, he planted two long avenues of [[lime (fruit)|lime trees]]. These are known as the North and South Terraces.\n\nIn 1739, Jan Griffer was brought in to make further changes to the gardens. The long radiating avenues were removed and some new [[pavilions]] were built. Griffer also planted a lot more individual trees, which made the overall design of the castle less formal. Further changes that John Campbell made during his lifetime were the removal of the formal gardens, the remaining avenue and part of the terrace.

In the usual way, the ownership of the estate (and the various titles) were generally passed from father to son, excepting when there were no male heirs. This particular branch of the Campbell family were given the titles of [[Breadalbane, Scotland|Breadalbane]], an area in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] of Scotland; and [[Glen Orchy|Glenorchy]], a [[glen]] in [[Argyll and Bute]].\n\nA number of the Campbells were Earls of Breadalbane and [[Parts of Holland|Holland]]. The family were given the lands of Breadalbane and [[Lawers]] in the 15th century by [[James III of Scotland|King James III]], for Sir Colin Campbell's help in capturing Thomas Chalmer, one of the assassins of [[James I of Scotland|King James I]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1919\">Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 9 April 1919, Page 2</ref> The title of Holland refers to an area of [[Lincolnshire]], England. The [[John Campbell, 1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland|1st Earl of Breadalbane and Holland]] married the [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland|1st Earl of Holland's]] daughter, Lady Mary Rich. He therefore acquired the English title of Holland, through his wife. The [[Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland|1st Earl of Holland]] was executed in London in 1649 for [[treason]]. He was beheaded.\n\nSir Colin Campbell of Glenorchy, who built Balloch Castle in 1552, was a [[knight]], the lowest rank of all of the owners of Balloch and Taymouth Castle. As time went on, his descendants' rank gradually increased, until the last Campbell listed, Sir Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane until 1922, achieved the high rank of [[Marquess]].\n\nThe male ranking hierarchy in Scotland, from lowest to highest is as follows; [[Knight]], [[Baronet]], [[Baron]], [[Lord of Parliament]], [[Viscount]], [[Earl]], [[Marquess]] and [[Duke]].\n\nThe Campbells of Breadalbane were incredibly powerful and influential, due to the vast amounts of land that they owned in Scotland. They were also involved in many of the violent events and battles during Scotland's historical clan feuds. They were thus, highly feared by the other clans, for their determination to both increase their power and influence and to defend their estates at all costs, throughout this bloody period in Scotland's history. There was also a long-running [[feud]] between the Campbells and the [[Clan Gregor|Gregors]], who later went on to become known as the MacGregors, for whom the famous [[Rob Roy MacGregor]] belonged.

The book concentrates more on the history of the Central Highlands than that of the Breadalbane family, although this is referred to in the book.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe book is written in [[Scots language|Scots]], with William Bowie dedicating his version of the book to Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy, 1st Baronet Campbell, otherwise known as 'Black Duncan'.

Some time in the 17th century, the Laird of Inchbrakie witnessed a large crowd, headed by one of the Campbells of Glenorchy, who were preparing to drown a witch. The Laird recognised the victim as being Katherine Niven, his old nurse and subsequently did his best to try and save her. He was unsuccessful, but she was still grateful enough to throw him a blue sapphire stone for his efforts. She said that whilst the stone remained with him, he would always have good fortune and that the Campbells would not have a male heir. Both prophecies were said to have come true.<ref>The Dundee Telegraph dated 6 April 1937, Page 3</ref> If there is any element of truth in this tale, then it would seem that the Campbell who was leading the [[witch-hunt]] may have been [[Sir Colin Campbell, 2nd Baronet]], who died childless in 1640.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nTaymouth Castle is said to be haunted.<ref name=\"heraldscotland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12759834.The_fairytale_castle_in_search_of_a_happy_ending/ |title=The fairytale castle in search of a happy ending |publisher=HeraldScotland |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\n==Taymouth Castle History==\n\nThe landowners of Taymouth Castle, together with dates of ownership and significant events are shown here.

The main block of the old house was demolished, to be replaced from 1806, by a [[Gothic revival|Gothic]] building, to the designs of the brothers James and [[Archibald Elliot]]. The English-Italian [[Francis Bernasconi]] carried out the ornate plasterwork of the staircase and drawing rooms between 1809 and 1812.<ref name=listed/> In 1818, the old east wing was pulled down and replaced by a two-storey wing designed by [[William Atkinson (architect)|William Atkinson]].<ref name=listed/>\n\nIn 1793, John Campbell formed three regiments of [[fencibles]], known as the [[Breadalbane Fencibles]] to help defend the land in time of need.

John Alexander Gavin Campbell of Glenfalloch's claim was disputed by Lieutenant Charles William Campbell of Borland. The dispute ultimately hinged on whether J A G Campbell's grandparents were legally married, and therefore the legitimacy of his father. There was apparently very little evidence on this fact, other than a letter written by his grandmother stating that they were married in 1782. However, it was ultimately decided that the marriage must have taken place, as J A G Campbell's claim was eventually ratified by the Scottish [[Court of Session]].<ref>The Sheffield Independent dated 6 June 1863, Page 6</ref> On appeal, this ruling was confirmed by a vote of two-to-one in the [[House of Lords]].<ref>The Pall Mall Gazette dated 20 March 1902, Page 3</ref>\n\nJohn Campbell had four children from his marriage to Mary Theresa Edwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepeerage.com/p3534.htm#i35338 |title=Person Page |publisher=Thepeerage.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref> He gained the rank of captain in the service of the [[Royal Scots|1st Royals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p3534.htm#i35338 |title=Person Page |publisher=Thepeerage.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\nHe died at the age of 46 at [[Albany (London)|The Albany]], [[Piccadilly]], London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fisherfamily.me.uk/history/breadalbane.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019042750/http://fisherfamily.me.uk/history/breadalbane.html |archivedate=19 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Sir Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane (1871 &ndash; 1922)===\n\n[[Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane]] served as a lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]. He also served in the [[House of Lords]] as a liberal politician. During his lifetime he amassed a number of titles and honours including; [[Knights Hospitaller|Knight of St John of Jerusalem]], [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]], [[List of baronetcies in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia|Baronet of Nova Scotia]], [[Baron Breadalbane]], Lord of Glenorchy, Benederloch, Ormelie and Weick, Viscount Tay and Paintland, [[Earl of Ormelie]] and [[Marquess of Breadalbane]]. He was also a [[County council|County Councillor]] in both Perth and Argyll, a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Argyll, a [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Councillor]], [[Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland]], [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]], [[Lord-in-waiting]] to Queen Victoria, [[Treasurer of the Household|Treasurer]] and [[Lord Steward]] of the Royal Household and an [[Aide-de-camp|ADC]] to His Majesty.<ref name=\"autogenerated1919\"/>\n\nIn 1872, he married Lady Alma Imogene Graham, daughter of the [[James Graham, 4th Duke of Montrose|4th Duke of Montrose]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1919\"/>\n\nIn 1877, [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] visited the castle. In the same year, [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany]], who was the youngest son of Queen Victoria, also visited.<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\">Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 30 November 1950, Page 4</ref>\n\nIn December 1879, the former [[Prime Minister]] [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] stayed at Taymouth Castle for three days, whilst on a speech-making tour of Scotland. The tour was said to be an unusual event, as in those days it was pretty unheard of for a leading politician to 'stump' the country in this way. It was described as 'an American-style election campaign'.<ref>The Illustrated London News dated 1 November 1979, Page 59</ref> In the same year, [[Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden]] also visited the castle.<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\"/>\n\nSir Gavin started the Lock Tay Steamboat Company, to enable his tenants to travel more easily to the nearest railway station, on a vessel known as the Queen of the Lake. Later, the enterprise was transformed into a popular attraction, operating pleasure cruises between Kenmore and Killin. Eventually, the ship was taken over by [[British Railways]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nIn 1881, the castle had another royal visitor, being [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]]. Later in 1884, King [[Oscar II of Sweden]] visited and in the following year, the Prince [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick of Hanover]] visited the castle.<ref name=\"autogenerated1950\"/>\n\nIn 1888, Sir Gavin was awarded the Medal of the [[Royal Humane Society]], for saving the life of a servant, whilst at the imminent risk to his own life. The servant, by the name of McLean, had fallen out of a boat and into the River Tay. At the time, the river was flooded and McLean was caught in a deep whirpool, with eddies and rocks creating even more difficulties. Sir Gavin, who was out shooting at the time,  stripped off his gunbelt and dived into the river to rescue him. The medal he earned for this, along with five more of his medals, were sold at auction in 2009 for \u00a32,700.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dnw.co.uk/auction-archive/lot-archive/lot.php?department=Medals&lot_id=171379 |title=Lot 323, 24 June 2009 &#124; Dix Noonan Webb |publisher=Dnw.co.uk |date=2009-06-24 |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\nSir Gavin was also awarded the Swedish [[Royal Order of the Seraphim|Order of the Seraphim]], conferred upon him by [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar]], for his hospitality to the then Prince [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], when he came to the UK to marry [[Princess Margaret of Connaught]] in 1905.<ref>Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 6 August 1920, Page 2</ref>\n\nWhen he inherited his titles in 1871, his estate was still nearly half a million acres in size.<ref name=\"glendiscovery.com\"/> It contained 'The Heart of Scotland', a thick wood of fir trees in the shape of a heart.<ref name=\"autogenerated1919\"/> Unfortunately, throughout Sir Gavin's tenure at Taymouth, he managed to lose most of this land. His worsening financial problems, were said to be due to an extravagant lifestyle, \"bad management and his gambling addiction\".<ref name=\"heraldscotland.com\"/> His mountainous debts finally forced him to put the castle and its remaining 60,000 acres up for sale in 1920. Included in the sale were a number of farms, hotels, private houses and shooting and fishing rights.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 6 August 1920, Page 3</ref> The sale was achieved in 1921, when the castle was sold for \u00a320,000<ref>Edinburgh Evening News dated 12 May 1923, Page 5</ref> to a syndicate, who intended to turn the estate into a hotel complex.<ref name=\"autogenerated1922\">The Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 24 April 1922, Page 6</ref> However, the completion date was set for May 1922 and the Campbells continued to reside in the castle for the time being.\n\nThe father of the Scottish writer [[Fred Urquhart]] was chauffeur to the Marquess in the early twentieth century, and Urquhart's novel ''Palace of Green Days'' (1979) draws on his childhood memories of this.<ref>{{cite web|title=Papers of Fred Urquhart|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/65dc9cb7-f7d6-3fc8-86a9-549649371222|website=Jisc Archives Hub|accessdate=27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1922, the Marquess and Marchioness duly said farewell to the castle forever, after fifty years of occupation, and moved out to their other home in Craig, [[Dalmally]].<ref>The Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 24 March 1922, Page 5</ref>\n\nSir Gavin died childless, very shortly afterwards, in October 1922 and most of his titles died with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepeerage.com/p15045.htm#i150444 |title=Person Page |publisher=Thepeerage.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref> However, even though every last acre of the original half a million acre estate had been sold off, there were still three more Earls of Breadalbane and Holland. The 10th and last Earl was John Romer Boreland Campbell, who died childless in 1995. Following his death, the title has remained dormant.<ref name=\"glendiscovery.com\"/>\n\n===Taymouth Castle Hotel Company LTD (1922 &ndash; 1940)===\n\nAt the time of their purchase, the hotel company from [[Glasgow]], which included the MacTaggart family,<ref name=\"heraldscotland.com\"/> also bought 520 acres of adjoining land, which brought the estate back to around 2,000 acres. It was declared by the company that they intended to convert the castle into a [[Hydrotherapy|hydropathic]] hotel, along with opening a brand new golf course on its lands. The company also acquired fishing rights on [[Loch Tay]] and part of the [[River Tay]] and shooting rights on Drumhill.<ref name=\"autogenerated1922\"/> At the same time, there was a huge auction at the castle, in which all of its furniture and effects were sold. The newspaper article reporting the event, said that 'the things that gave the castle its life and history, will be scattered to the four winds of heaven'.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 22 April 1922, Page 3</ref> The auction realised total sales of \u00a324,000, with half of that amount being paid by the new hotel owners, to retain furniture in the castle.<ref>The Scotsman dated 1 May 1922, Page 7</ref>\n\nThe hydro hotel opened on 30 June 1923, boasting around 100 bedrooms. Since buying the castle, its facilities had been greatly improved, including central heating and electricity being installed throughout. The hotel also offered music and dancing, a grass riding track and had four [[en tout cas]] tennis courts and a covered badminton court. They possessed a fleet of motor vehicles, offering drives to places of interest and steamer excursions on Loch Tay. The golf course had been finished and there was of course fly fishing. At the time of opening, they hadn't quite managed to offer shooting, but they had the shooting rights for Drummond Hill, on which 30 stags had been killed in the previous year.<ref>The Motherwell Times dated 6 July 1923, Page 8</ref>\n\nDespite good patronage, the Taymouth Castle Hotel Company LTD were forced into voluntary liquidation in March 1926. The blame was put on the high cost of all the alterations necessary to convert the castle. It was disclosed that as there were good Easter bookings, the hotel would remain open for the time being.<ref>The Dundee Evening Telegraph date 29 March 1926, Page 9</ref> The hotel eventually closed for the winter on 30 September 1926, with the liquidators having already sold off portions of the lands, dramatically reducing the size of the estate.<ref>Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 8 December 1926, Page 3</ref>\n\nThe hotel reopened on 1 June 1927, for the summer season. The advertised rate was 18s to 25s per person per day.<ref>The Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer dated 18 May 1927, Page 1</ref> In September 1927,  the [[Yi Un|Prince]] and [[Yi Bangja|Princess]] Gin Ri of Korea visited the castle. Whilst at that time a colony of Japan, the prince was the son of the late [[Gojong of Korea|Emperor of Korea]] and the princess was a cousin of the [[Empress K\u014djun|Empress of Japan]].<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 1 September 1927, Page 10</ref>\n\nThe following year the hotel reopened for the 1928 season and its long-term future was secured, when the castle was bought by a 'well known London combine'. The new owners declared that the castle would continue as a 'hydro'.<ref>Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 1 May 1928, Page 3</ref>\n\n===Taymouth Castle Hospital (1940 &ndash; 1948)===\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], use of the castle was requisitioned by the War Office, to help with the war effort. From 1940, it became known as the No. 1 Polish General Hospital, or otherwise as the Taymouth Castle Hospital. It was the chief Polish hospital in the country and boasted some of the finest and most up-to-date equipment, with its operating theatres and X-Ray machines.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref>\n\nAlso, in April 1940, the castle advertised that the golf course and Policy Parks were available for let, for sheep and cattle grazing.<ref>Perthshire Advertiser dated 17 April 1940, Page 3</ref> It was later noted that despite having its own golf course, the wounded Polish servicemen showed no interest in golf, although they were enthusiastic footballers.<ref>The Scotsman dated 27 July 1950, Page 6</ref>\n\nOver the eight years of its use as a hospital, thousands of Polish patients were treated there, with its biggest influx after the battle of [[Cassino]], when over 200 Polish casualties arrived.<ref>Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref> At its height, it had 1200 beds and 200 staff. Despite still being under the control of the War Office, its use as a hospital came to an end in December 1947, with the remaining Polish patients being disbursed to hospitals in England.\n\nThe chairman of the owning hotel company said that he thought that it would be a year or two before the castle could be re-opened as a hotel. He said that the lack of tradesmen would be a big obstacle to its redecoration and renovation.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref> Severe damage to one of the west towers, from a fire in 1946, would also have to be repaired. However, during its time as a hospital, care had been taken to protect the castle's magnificent carved oak walls and doors. These had been boarded up, using cardboard and plywood. Similar precautions had been taken to protect the marble mantelpieces and stained glass windows.<ref>Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref>\n\nSeventy-five [[Nissen huts]] were removed from the castle grounds.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 10 December 1947, Page 2</ref> However, their foundations can still be seen today.\n\n===Civil Defence Corps Training School (1949 &ndash; 1968)===\n\nIn February 1949, the government formed the [[Civil Defence Corps]], which was a civilian volunteer organisation, which could take control of areas of the country in times of national emergency, such as after a nuclear attack. In a joint announcement by the [[Home Office]] and the [[Scottish Office]], it was declared that Taymouth Castle was to be used as one of three training centres in Scotland, which would teach instructors in how to train a much bigger volunteer force.<ref>The Scotsman dated 18 February 1949, Page 6</ref> Alterations were made to the castle, which was designed to train between 100 and 150 men and women at a time.<ref>The Scotsman dated 3 June 1949, Page 5</ref> The cost of these alterations was finally put at \u00a3126,000, way past its original budget of \u00a375,700.<ref>The Dundee Courier dated 21 March 1950, Page 3</ref>\n\nWhen it was opened in December 1950 by the [[Scottish Secretary]] [[Hector McNeil]], it was described as the most up-to-date in the world.<ref>Dundee Evening Telegraph dated 8 December 1950, Page 4</ref> The centre also included a mock '[[The Blitz|blitzed]] village', for trainees to practice in.<ref>Dundee Courier dated 12 September 1950, Page 4</ref> The village was built and then partially demolished, to provide defense volunteers with practical rescue training. Roofs were said to lie at 'drunken angles', walls gaped open, timber beams were scorched with fire; and all laid out to conform with Scottish types of architecture. The village was so realistic that the visiting [[James Henderson-Stewart|Sir James Henderson-Stewart]], Under-[[Secretary of State for Scotland]] said that there was a staggering contrast between the beauty of the castle and the scenes of ruin, bringing home more forcibly the devastation of war and the need to be ready for any emergency.<ref>Arbroath Herald and Advertiser for the Montrose Burghs dated 1 August 1952, Page 3</ref>\n\nAs part of their training, the volunteers were given advanced instruction in [[Nuclear weapon|atomic]], [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[Biological warfare|biological]] warfare.<ref>The Fifeshire Advertiser dated 3 February 1951, Page 3</ref>\n\nBy 1956, the Corps had grown to 330,000 personnel. However, the Corps was eventually disbanded in 1968, after a change of thinking in how to deal with nuclear attacks.\nHowever, its role in national defence didn't end there. From 1968, it was also one of the designated locations for plan [[PYTHON]], the plan for [[continuity of government]] in the event of nuclear war.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dorsetecho.co.uk/news/15053819.The_top_secret_story_of_just_how_important_Portland_could_have_been_in_the_Cold_War/|title=If nuclear war had broken out between Russia and the west, HMS Osprey on Portland would have been a remote hideaway for the government|publisher=Dorset Echo|date=28 January 2017}}</ref> The plan, which was classified as TOP SECRET, was that in the event of a nuclear attack, the government and other essential personnel could be dispersed around the country, to secret and protected locations. Taymouth Castle was chosen as one of these sites.\n\nIt is not known when Taymouth Castle ceased to be considered as one of these secret locations, but the three associated [[Caledonian MacBrayne|CalMac]] support ships, which were capable of acting as floating nuclear bunkers, were sold by CalMac in the 1980s. These ships operated from day-to-day as normal commercial car ferries, but had been designed and built in such a way that if needed, they could be used as [[radiation]] resistant transport and decontamination chambers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Julie McDowall |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/15039649.How_Scotland_and_three_CalMac_ferries_played_a_crucial_part_in_nuclear_planning/ |title=How Scotland and three CalMac ferries played a crucial part in nuclear planning |publisher=HeraldScotland |date=1968-05-01 |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\n===Boarding School (1970 &ndash; 1974)===\n\nAfter it ceased to be a Civil Defence Corps training centre in 1968, Taymouth Castle was turned into a boarding school for high-school aged students.

The castle was leased for this purpose by a Mr McCormick<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/Group%20photo1970.htm 1970 photo and caption identifying Mr McCormack, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref> who also operated Herringswell Manor School<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/TayStories.htm Reminiscence of Bill Cox, a former student at Herringswell Manor School who visited Taymouth Castle School in 1972, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 3 September 2019]</ref> in Suffolk. At its opening, Taymouth Castle School had only 17 students<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/TayList.htm List of students from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref> -- some were the children of American workers on North Sea oil rigs, but most came from families resident in the continental US.

Subjects taught at the school were English, US History, British History, Geography, Algebra, Geometry, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, General Science, French, and German<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/ClassLists1.jpg List of teachers and subjects in 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref> -- with two 'study halls'<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/StudyHalls1.jpg Study-hall list from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref> and a PE class every weekday.  Activities via a number of 'clubs' were also offered, and at weekends, trips were arranged to various locations in the region.\n\nThe boys' dormitory was on the second floor, east of the main entrance, with the girls' dormitory to the west.  In some ways, rules were quite liberal when compared to British private schools of the time.  For example, 11th-grade students were (reluctantly) allowed to smoke in certain areas if they had written permission from their parents<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/SchCode1.jpg School Code of Conduct document from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>. On the other hand, boys were required to have a \"businessman's haircut\"<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/SchCode1.jpg School Code of Conduct document from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>, and that girls \"dress neatly, are polite, well-mannered and ladylike\", (they were also asked to \"remember to wear soft slippers on the Third Floor.\"<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/GirlsBd1.jpg Notice to Girls from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>)  There was no uniform, but there was the expectation for \"all students to rise when any adult enters a room\"<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/GirlsBd1.jpg Notice to Girls from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>. \n\nAll students were boarders (no 'day students'), and were provided with wholesome meals: breakfast at 8:00 am, lunch at 1:15 pm, and dinner at 6:30 pm<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/Sched1.jpg Weekday Schedule from 1971, at 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, 2001; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>. Two staff would supervise the student eating hall, while the rest of the staff dined in the famous 'Banner Hall' of the castle (the ceiling being emblazed with the coats of arms of dignitaries who had visited the castle throughout its history)<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/perth-kinross/90661/preview-tour-gives-a-tantalising-glimpse-of-taymouth-castles-future/ Description of the ceiling of the Banner Hall, The Courier, 27 August 2011; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref><ref>[https://scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/record/hes/24893/taymouth-castle/rcahms Images of Taymouth Castle, 'Scotland's Places' website; accessed 16 August 2019]</ref>.\n\nIt was expected that student enrollment in the school would grow substantially in the year following its opening -- as had happened at the 'sister' school, Herringswell Manor in Suffolk -- but this did not happen, and the school closed within a few years of its opening.  A website commemorating this unique but short-lived educational facility was set up in 2001, with original documents and photos collected from teacher and student alumni being displayed<ref>[https://www.mopoke.com.au/Taymouth/TayHome.htm 'Remembering Taymouth Castle School' website, established 2001.]</ref>.\n\n===Speech and Drama School (1982)===\n\nIn September 1981, it was advertised that the Taymouth Castle Residential School of Speech and Drama was starting classes in January 1982. Auditions were being held for three courses, which were a One-year Stage course, a Two-year Diploma and Stage course and a One-year course in [[puppetry]].<ref>The Stage dated 24 September 1981, Page 12</ref>\n\nAt this time, nothing further is known about those courses, but the castle is known to have been closed and empty since around that time.\n\nThe golf course continued to be operated separately, but this too is currently closed, whilst alterations are being made to the course.\n\n===Restoration plans (1982 &ndash; date)===\n\nDespite its many changes of use and its requisitioning by the government, through the war years and beyond, legal ownership of the castle was still retained by the MacTaggart family, who had first turned the castle into a hotel in 1922. However, they had been unable to make any real commercial use of the castle since the boarding school for children of American servicemen closed in 1979. Throughout the 1990s, the family had been unsuccessfully trying to sell the estate, with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cher]] both being initially interested.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In 1995, the castle and estate were on the market for \u00a35.5m.<ref name=\"buildingsatrisk.org.uk\"/>\n\nBy the year 2000, the castle was suffering badly from leaks and rot.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} It was eventually sold to a building consortium in 2005 for \u00a312m. At the time of purchase, plans to redevelop the castle as a \"six-star\" hotel with 150 rooms had already been approved by Perth and Kinross Council.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3533134.stm |title= Council backs castle hotel plans | publisher = BBC News | date= 4 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nHowever, since then, due to the huge costs involved and the need to find suitable investment, progress has been slow, with work starting and stalling.

One of his first actions as laird, was to evict<ref name=\"glendiscovery.com\"/> the Clan Gregor from Balloch (now Kenmore), at the east end of Loch Tay. In 1552,<ref name=\"heraldscotland.com\"/> he consolidated his position and built a [[tower houses in Britain and Ireland|tower house]] there, known as Balloch Castle. Balloch means 'the house at the narrow pass'.<ref>Falkirk Herald dated 1 October 1949, Page 8</ref> Sir Colin is said to have chosen the site of the castle in a novel manner.

This bitter and violent feud ran from 1562 until 1569, when their clan chief Gregor Roy, 10th Chief MacGregor, was captured by Sir Colin whilst visiting his wife. On 7 April 1570, after securing the consent of the [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Regent Morton]], Sir Colin personally beheaded Gregor at Balloch Castle, in the presence of the [[John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl|Earl of Atholl]], the Justice Clerk. Gregor's wife, Marion Campbell, who also witnessed her husband's execution, wrote a bitter [[lament]] about the affair, called '[[Griogal Cridhe]]'.

The traditional tale is that he had her locked in an underground vault, whilst he courted Elizabeth Sinclair, the daughter of the [[Lord Sinclair|5th Lord Sinclair]]. Wary that he might already be married, Elizabeth made him swear that he had no other wife and he solemnly swore on the cross of his sword that he 'had no wife above ground'. She did not realise the deception and they were indeed married. His other wife was ultimately released from the vault, after she had made a declaration that she was not his wife.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">The Bradford Observer dated 12 September 1861, Page 7</ref>\n\nHe had several nicknames, the first being 'Duncan of the (seven) Castles', as he was renowned for building them. His other nickname was 'Black Duncan'. He had been appointed by the King to keep the peace between the feuding clans in Argyll and Perthshire and was accordingly allowed to maintain a large force of armed soldiers to support him. However, he had a reputation for causing trouble, rather than stopping it and was said to be more interested in using his power to acquire extra land for himself. During his lifetime, he therefore managed to significantly enlarge the family's estate, by 'fair means or foul'.<ref>In Famed Breadalbane by William Gillies</ref> He also extended Balloch Castle.<ref name=\"glendiscovery.com\"/>\n\nIn April 1603, King [[James VI and I]] outlawed the [[Clan Gregor]], following the [[Battle of Glen Fruin]], in which the Gregors killed between 200 and 300 men of the [[Clan Colquhoun]]. The name Gregor or MacGregor was abolished and it became entirely legal to kill anyone of that name and seize his property. Over the next ten years, over 100 Gregors were slain and their lands given to the Campbells.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/clan-gregor-macgregor-p1475131 |title=Clan Gregor (MacGregor) |publisher=VisitScotland |date=2017-01-01 |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref> It was said that Sir Duncan was instrumental in this and got most of their leaders killed or hanged.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nOne of Sir Duncan's castles was [[Finlarig Castle]], built in 1629.

The Campbell army were routed and of its 2,000 men, about 1,500 were killed during a running battle over 14 miles of countryside. Their commander, Auchinbreck, was captured and beheaded by [[Alasdair Mac Colla]], who commanded part of the Royalist forces. Although they won this battle, Montrose suffered a heavy defeat seven months later at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]] and his forces were ultimately crushed five years later, at the [[Battle of Carbisdale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://montrose-society.ndo.co.uk/batin.htm |title=The 1st Marquis of Montrose Society |publisher=Montrose-society.ndo.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\nSir Robert had 16 children from his marriage with Isabel MacIntosh, dying in 1657.\n\n===Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy, 4th Baronet Campbell (1657 &ndash; 1677)===\n\nSir John Campbell was Commissioner of Supply and Excise for Argyll and Perth and succeeded to the title of 4th Baronet Campbell, of Glenorchy.

In 1692, he played a key role in the [[Massacre of Glencoe]], by instructing a relative, [[Robert Campbell of Glenlyon]], to carry it out.<ref name=\"fionamsinclair.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"perthshire-scotland.co.uk\"/> Thirty Eight McDonalds from the [[MacDonald of Glencoe|Clan McDonald of Glencoe]] were killed by their own guests and another 40 women and children died of [[Hypothermia|exposure]], after their homes were burned.\n\nCampbell also took part in the abortive [[Cavalier|royalist]] uprising under [[John Campbell, 1st Earl of Loudoun]] in 1654 and was also implicated in the [[Sir James Montgomery, 4th Baronet|Montgomery Plot]], a [[Jacobitism|Jocobite]] scheme to restore [[James II of England|King James II and VII]] to the thrones of England and Scotland. In 1692, he was imprisoned for a time in [[Edinburgh Castle]] for his involvement in negotiations between Jacobite chiefs. However, he was released after it was discovered that he was acting with the knowledge of [[William III of England|King William III]].\n\nIn 1672, Campbell acquired as payment of debts, the estates and titles of George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness, which included the parish of [[Wick, Caithness|Wick]] and the castles of [[Castle Sinclair Girnigoe|Girnigoe]], [[Ackergill Tower|Ackergill]] and [[Keiss Castle|Keiss]]. He assumed the title of [[Earl of Caithness]], although his right to these titles and lands were disputed by George Sinclair of Keiss, first cousin to the 6th Earl of Caithness. Sinclair lay [[siege]] to Girnigoe Castle, damaging it so badly that it has never been inhabited since. In a counter-attack, Campbell took his army and marched on Sinclair, to fight what was to become known as the [[Battle of Altimarlach]]. Campbell's force easily routed Sinclair's army, whose men fled across the [[Wick River|River Wick]]. But, a large number were killed and it is said that so many lay slain, that Campbell's soldiers were able to cross the river over their bodies, without getting their feet wet. Despite this strategic victory, George Sinclair later won his argument in court in 1681 and claimed the title of Earl of Caithness and the lands. However, Campbell was compensated for the loss of these, by [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] elevating him to Lord of [[Glen Orchy|Glenorchy]], Benederaloch, Ormelie and Wick, Viscount of Tay and Paintland, and 1st Earl of [[Breadalbane, Scotland|Breadalbane]] and [[Parts of Holland|Holland]].<ref>The John O'Groat Journal dated 16 April 1841, Page 4</ref>\n\nIt was here that Campbell's piper composed the clan's famous [[pibroch]], 'Bodach na Briogais', which ridicules the Sinclairs. The event is also commemorated in the famous song 'The Campbells are Coming'.<ref name=\"fionamsinclair.co.uk\"/> Many people refer to the Battle of Altimarlach as the last clan battle in Scotland and it would seem that it was the last true clan battle. However, in 1689 there was a later fierce battle at [[Battle of Maol Ruadh|Mullroy]], [[Kilmonivaig]], when the [[Clan MacDonald of Keppoch|Macdonalds of Keppoch]] fought and defeated the [[Clan Mackintosh|MacIntoshes]], over ownership of [[Glen Roy]]. However, the MacIntoshes had government support and part of their army was made up of government troops, making it more of a government action than a true clan battle.<ref>The Ludlow Advertiser dated 12 August 1899, Page 6</ref>\n\nIt is said that the people of Wick, hated Campbell so much that they caused him no end of trouble. Wearied by these incessant vexations, he divided Wick into 62 portions in 1690 and sold them all.\n\nAt one time, King William III entrusted Campbell with \u00a320,000, a huge sum of money, to use it to achieve peace between some warring Highland Chiefs. However, rather than spend the money, he managed to negotiate a deal between them. When asked to account for the \u00a320,000, he replied \"Gentlemen - the money is spent, the Highlands are at peace, and that is the only way of accounting among friends\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nAn early fan of golf, Slippery John is recorded as buying a pair of golf clubs for his children in 1672 and having one club repaired at a cost of four shillings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishgolfhistory.org/news/a-new-reference-to-golf-in-1460/ |title=A 'New' Reference to 'Golf' in 1460 |publisher=Scottish Golf History |date= |accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Taymouth Castle#The Black Book of Taymouth|Black Book of Taymouth]], the history of the Breadalbanes, published by the [[John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane|2nd Marquess of Breadalbane]] states that in 1681, Gilleasba, chief of the MacDonalds of Keppoch, gave a bond of [[manrent]] to Sir John, promising that none of his clan or his people would commit robbery on his lands.

Elaborate gardens and orchards were also planted on both sides of the Castle. To the south, Adam planted an avenue of trees in the shape of a D. On the banks of the river, he planted two long avenues of [[lime (fruit)|lime trees]]. These are known as the North and South Terraces.\n\nIn 1739, Jan Griffer was brought in to make further changes to the gardens. The long radiating avenues were removed and some new [[pavilions]] were built. Griffer also planted a lot more individual trees, which made the overall design of the castle less formal. Further changes that John Campbell made during his lifetime were the removal of the formal gardens, the remaining avenue and part of the terrace. He also moved the orchard to the west of the ridge where the Dairy now stands and moved the walled-garden to the north-east of the castle.

The ride was first installed and operated in 2004 at [[Knott's Berry Farm]] in [[Buena Park, California]], [[United States]].\n\n==Design and operation==\nThe original Screamin' Swing consists of a {{convert|62|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} A-frame, supporting two arms. Each arm supports two rows of seating, back to back. The first Screamin' Swings developed had four seats per arm with two arms. The lowest variant is the four-seat/one-arm design, and the capacities increase to 8 seat, 16 seat, 32 seat and 40 seat designs, all utilizing two arms. For two-arm models, the swings can operate individually or simultaneously (although in opposite directions) and are propelled by compressed air, provided by [[Ingersoll Rand]] or Sullair compressors. These compressors disperse air into tanks located within the arms, the movement triggering actuators and cables to produce the motion. Some parks operate Screamin' Swing as an [[upcharge attraction]].\n\nOne of the tallest Screamin' Swings in the world is [[Skyhawk (ride)|Skyhawk]] at [[Cedar Point]]. It stands {{convert|103|ft|m}} tall, swings to a height of {{convert|125|ft|m}}, has a maximum arc of 120\u00b0, and can achieve a maximum speed of {{convert|65|mi/h|km/h}}.\n\nThe first larger Screamin' Swing developed was Rush, located at Thorpe Park (UK). The ride stands at {{convert|62|ft|m}} tall with a dynamic height of {{convert|70|ft|m}}. It opened in May 2005 as 'The Worlds Biggest Full Throttle Speed Swing'.\n\nA Screamin' Swing located at the [[Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park]] in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, swings riders out over a steep canyon, {{convert|1300|ft|m}} above the Colorado River. The swing structure is {{convert|50|ft|m}} tall and has a maximum arc of 122\u00b0. It opened in May 2010, and is billed 'The Giant Canyon Swing'.\n\n==Installations==\n\n[[Image:Thunder N Lightning.jpg|thumb|''Thunder N' Lightning'', a Screamin' Swing operating at [[Lake Compounce]]]]\n\n<!-- This is a list of existing projects and CONFIRMED future projects. \"Confirmed\" means the park has issued a press release announcing it (acceptable) or a reliable source (i.e., local newspaper) has published an article mentioning its construction (preferable).

He was a member of the Port Adelaide side which won the premiership in 2004. On 3 July 2013, he retired from [[Australian Football League|AFL]] football due to a troublesome knee. Cornes is currently serving as a forward development coach for the [https://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/club/staff Port Adelaide Football Club].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Port Adelaide career (1999\u20132011)===\n\n====Early career (1999\u20132003)====\nCornes began his AFL career as a key-forward and after playing only 6 games in 1999, was a regular in the Power forward line in 2000, booting 22 goals. Between 2000 and 2003 Cornes and Tredrea formed one of the best forward partnerships in the AFL, with Chad playing up the ground demonstrating his great contested marking ability. Despite being one of the best forwards in the game, Cornes was moved into defence at the start of the 2004 season.\n\n====Career change (2004\u20132005)====\nIn 2004, Cornes was moved to centre-half back. The new position worked wonders as Cornes began to single-handedly dominate games, earning himself his first [[All-Australian]] award, and finishing third in the [[Brownlow medal]]. The move to centre-half back was a key reason for Port Adelaide's dominance, which culminated in their first Premiership in 2004, defeating the [[Brisbane Lions]] by 40 points. He had a key defensive role on Brisbane Lions' forward [[Jonathan Brown (Australian footballer)|Jonathan Brown]] during the Grand Final, restricting him to just one behind for the match.\n\nAfter Port Adelaide's dominance in 2004, Cornes was again used as a key defender to great effect. However, Port Adelaide was unable to repeat its finals' glory of 2004, being eliminated by cross town rivals [[Adelaide Crows|Adelaide]] in the first semi-final.\n\n====Leadership (2006\u20132007)====\nThe 2006 was a disappointing one for Port Adelaide, and one which frustrated Cornes in particular. The season never really took off, and with Cornes now being a senior player, he was moved into the midfield to help the younger players. This move paid off as he dominated matches, which was a huge positive for the Power in an otherwise disappointing campaign. Cornes won the [[Showdown Medal]] in round 21.<ref>[http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/6038/Default.aspx?newsId=31309 Cornes can't wait for 2007]</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Cornes was a key midfielder and has a largely impressive season. Cornes finished the 2007 season with 643 disposals, and led the competition in kicks, and went into the Brownlow medal count as one of the favourites. The great form of Cornes in midfield was crucial to the side making the AFL Grand Final, which was a huge surprise to most, including Cornes. Despite not expecting to have a good season, when they did make the Grand Final the belief appeared to be strong but they were unable to win their second flag, going down to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] by a record 119 points\n\n====Injuries (2008\u20132010)====\nPort looked to bounce back from their Grand Final humiliation of the previous year when they took on Geelong in the opening round of 2008. Despite being close throughout the match, they were unable to win and that was the start of a four-game losing streak for the Power. Cornes suffered a broken finger in Round 6 against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] but returned just three weeks later despite the nature of the break being very severe. After 2 years with on and off form, Cornes broke his finger again in mid-2010.\n\n====End of Port Adelaide career (2011)====\nDespite having to stay on the sidelines for the rest of the year, he played on in 2011. In August 2011 he announced that he would be retiring from the AFL after the following week's match against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]].<ref>[http://www.sportal.com.au/afl-news-display/chad-cornes-retires-132587 Chad Cornes retires] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120910060256/http://www.sportal.com.au/afl-news-display/chad-cornes-retires-132587 |date=10 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Greater Western Sydney career (2012\u20132013)===\nCornes came out of retirement, and was traded to the Giants during the 2011 October Trade Week.

While the geometry and dimensions of the prison compound were exact in the mockup, and it had been built of [[Lumber#Divisional lumber|two-by-four studs]] and two horizontal strips of cloth to facilitate such disassembly, the mockup had no roofs or solid walls, and blended too well with dirt roads and other features already present, to be identified as S\u01a1n T\u00e2y. Gargus states that it resembled \"a [[feedlot|stockyard]] in disrepair.\" However, to satisfy security concerns, aerial photographs were taken to be certain of that conclusion. Similarly, the claim that full-size trees were uprooted and relocated to exact locations is also a myth. Even were such a labor-intensive idea not outlandish, the probable loss of helicopters during practice would have canceled the mission (Potted plant miniatures were positioned to locate trees at the practice site).

The support group attacked the location with small arms and hand grenades in an eight-minute firefight, after which Simons estimated that 100 to 200 hostile soldiers had been killed. Two A-1s supported ''Greenleaf'' with an air strike using [[white phosphorus]] bombs on a wooden footbridge east of the area. Apple 01 returned at 02:23, and by 02:28,<ref name=\"times\"/> the support group had disengaged under fire and reboarded the helicopter for the short movement to the correct landing area.<ref>Schemmer (1976), p. 172.</ref><ref group=n>Schemmer noted that Apple 01 made three combat assault landings in nine and one half minutes.

He also observed Apple 01 unload at the secondary school and initiated Plan Green, the contingency plan for the loss or absence of ''Greenleaf''. The ''Redwine'' security group, including ground force commander Sydnor, landed at 02:20<ref name=\"times\"/> outside S\u01a1n T\u00e2y prison and immediately executed the previously rehearsed contingency plan. In the meantime, Cherry 02 arrived with the A-1 force, dropped two more napalm ground markers, and created other diversions to disguise the target area by dropping [[Flare#Fusee|MK-6 log flares]] and battle simulators at road intersections that North Vietnamese reaction forces might be expected to use.<ref>Gargus (2007), p. 187.</ref> Cherry 02 then orbited in the area just west of the Black River acting as on-call support for the ground teams, jamming North Vietnamese radio communications, and providing a secure radio link to the mission command post in Da Nang.<ref name=\"af155\">Thigpen (2001), p. 155.</ref><ref group=n>Each orbit, anchored on the original IP, took four minutes to complete.

The 65 prisoners at S\u01a1n T\u00e2y had been moved on 14 July because its wells had been contaminated by flooding,<ref>Tilford (1983), p. 104.</ref> or possibly due to the threat of further inundation, to a camp {{convert|15|mi|km}} closer to Hanoi that the POWs dubbed \"Camp Faith\".<ref>Schemmer (1976), pp. 66, 223.</ref><ref name=\"af157\"/><ref group=n>Thigpen notes, however, that the senior POW in North Vietnam, Air Force MG John Flynn, contends that the move was due to construction at the camp to improve its security, after which the prisoners were to have been returned. \"Camp Faith\" was so dubbed because Hanoi separated Protestant from Catholic prisoners in the mistaken belief that it would facilitate worship by each group and thus garner praise from the international community. (Tilford, p. 104)</ref> Although relatively near S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, the risk of disastrous consequences from lack of reconnaissance, planning, and rehearsing precluded a switch of targets at the last minute. A mission with Camp Faith as the objective required a lengthy delay for a new window of acceptable conditions,<ref>Schemmer (1976), p. 133.</ref><ref group=n>Moorer advised Nixon at their November 18 meeting that the next window would be in March 1971, four months hence.</ref> which increased the chance of security compromise and further withheld personnel and equipment from their parent commands. New reports of increasing numbers of deaths among POWs argued strongly against such a delay.

The 65 prisoners at S\u01a1n T\u00e2y had been moved on 14 July because its wells had been contaminated by flooding,<ref>Tilford (1983), p. 104.</ref> or possibly due to the threat of further inundation, to a camp {{convert|15|mi|km}} closer to Hanoi that the POWs dubbed \"Camp Faith\".<ref>Schemmer (1976), pp. 66, 223.</ref><ref name=\"af157\"/><ref group=n>Thigpen notes, however, that the senior POW in North Vietnam, Air Force MG John Flynn, contends that the move was due to construction at the camp to improve its security, after which the prisoners were to have been returned. \"Camp Faith\" was so dubbed because Hanoi separated Protestant from Catholic prisoners in the mistaken belief that it would facilitate worship by each group and thus garner praise from the international community. (Tilford, p. 104)</ref> Although relatively near S\u01a1n T\u00e2y, the risk of disastrous consequences from lack of reconnaissance, planning, and rehearsing precluded a switch of targets at the last minute.

However, Maracle often suffered through periods of depression connected to alcoholism and found it difficult to accept his success as a painter and sculptor.<ref name=\"Landon\" /> Far from being focused only on political and social issues, also prevalent in many of his works are the themes of hope and joy such as in the playful \"An Early Morning Climb\" (see Figure 2).  His work can be found in the [[McMichael Canadian Art Collection]] (Kleinburg, ON), the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] (Gatineau, QC), the [[Woodland Cultural Centre]] (Brantford, ON), and [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]] (Gatineau, QC).  The installation of the [[Thunder Bay Art Gallery]] Collection Spotlight series featured four large portrait paintings by Maracle. Maracle's artwork has been included in numerous group exhibitions since the mid/late 1970s, including the recent group exhibition \"Oh So Iroquois\", curated by Ryan Rice for The [[Ottawa Art Gallery]].<ref>Suzanne Morrissette, \"Clifford Maracle: Permanent Collection Spotlight\", Aanationtalk, October 30, 2012.</ref>\n\n==Solo Shows==\n1985 Clifford Maracle: Paintings and Sculpture - Galerie Dresdnere, Toronto, ON <br>\n1994 Hard Edge Psychological Revelation - Maslak McLeod Canadian Art, Santa Fe, NM\n\n==Group shows==\n1983 Indian Art '83 - Woodland Cultural Educational Centre, Brantford, ON <br>\n2007 Oh So Iroquois - Ottawa Art Gallery, Ottawa, ON <br>\n2010 Oh So Iroquois - Art Gallery of Southwestern Manitoba, Brandon, Manitoba <br>\n2012 Permanent Collection Spotlight \u2013 Thunder Bay Art Gallery.

He joined the [[Green Party of Ontario]] in 1987 and became the party's first official leader in 1993 \u2013 a position he held until November 14, 2009, when he was replaced by [[Mike Schreiner]]. From 2017 to 2019 he was the leader of the [[Yukon Green Party]].<ref name=\"WDSdj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehorsestar.com/News/yukon-greens-run-record-number-of-candidates|title=Yukon Greens run record number of candidates|last=Cohen|first=Sidney|date=31 August 2016|publisher=[[Whitehorse Star|Whitehorse Daily Star]]|language=English|accessdate=1 September 2016|location=[[Whitehorse, Yukon]]}}</ref> De Jong has also campaigned for federal office as a member of the [[Green Party of Canada]].\n\n==Education and activism==\n\nBorn into a Dutch background, De Jong earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of Western Ontario]] in 1978, and a [[Bachelor of Education]] from [[University of Ottawa]] in 1979.  After graduating, he worked as an elementary school teacher.  He developed an interest in environmental concerns during the mid-1980s, and became involved in campaigns to save Ontario's old growth forests.  He was also involved in the anti-nuclear, renewable energy and [[pro-choice]] movements.  De Jong now resides in [http://www.faroyukon.ca/ Faro, Yukon] with his partner Tove Christensen.\n\n==Politics==\n\nThe Ontario Green Party did not originally have a formal leadership structure, and was run in a very decentralized manner (nominal leaders were sometimes chosen for elections, but they had no personal authority over party decisions).  De Jong and others opposed this approach, and successfully campaigned for a formal leadership contest in 1993.  De Jong himself entered this contest, and defeated [[James R. M. Harris|Jim Harris]], who later became leader of the Green Party of Canada.  De Jong supported Harris's leadership of the federal party until Harris stepped down in 2006, at which time de Jong supported [[David Chernushenko]]'s leadership bid.  He was challenged for the leadership of the Ontario Green Party by [[Judy Greenwood-Speers]] in 2001.\n\n[[Image:Mike Schreiner and Frank de Jong Hart House 2009.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Frank De Jong (right), with his successor as [[Green Party of Ontario|Ontario Greens]] Leader, [[Mike Schreiner]] (left)]]\n\nLike Harris, de Jong is an [[eco-capitalist]].  He defines his political philosophy as \"socially progressive, fiscally conservative, and environmentally aware\".<ref>[http://www.gpo.ca/node/26 Green Party of Ontario Leader Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208173600/http://www.gpo.ca/node/26 |date=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>  He has long supported conservative economic policies, including a gradual shift from the taxation of incomes to the taxation of natural resources.  Recently, he has also spoken against extensive government subsidies and funding for crown corporations.\n\nAt the October 2005 [[Green Party of Ontario]] [[Annual General Meeting]], de Jong narrowly avoided a \"leadership review\" when 67% of voting members voted against it.  The GPO constitution requires that a leadership review be held bi-annually; If more than one-third of voting members had opted for a review, a leadership race would have been held in 2006.  At the 2007 AGM, de Jong survived the next scheduled review, this time with approximately 71% support from party members.  This followed what was considered the strongest election performance by the GPO to date.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/article/279832 \"Green leader gets 71 per cent support\"]. ''Toronto Star'', November 26, 2007.</ref> Speaking at the Green Party of Ontario AGM in May 2009, de Jong announced that he will not be running for re-election as leader of the party.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/639159 \"Frank de Jong to step down as Green party leader\"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', May 23, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the September 14, 2006, Parkdale\u2014High Park by-election, de Jong received 6.2 percent of the vote.  On November 7, 2006, he was nominated as the GPO candidate in the riding of [[Davenport (provincial electoral district)|Davenport]] for the [[2007 Ontario general election]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20120802015025/http://www.greenparty.on.ca/node/922%23attachments ''Davenport Green Party nominates de Jong''], Green Party of Ontario news release, November 8, 2006.</ref> In that election, de Jong captured 10.26 percent of the vote, his best showing as a member of the Green Party.\n\nDe Jong was a candidate for Ward 18 in [[2010 Toronto municipal election|Toronto's 2010 municipal election]].\n\nAs of December 2014, de Jong was living in [[Faro, Yukon]] and was the [[Green Party of Canada]] candidate in the [[Yukon (electoral district)|Yukon]] riding in the [[42nd Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], placing a distant fourth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynolds |first=Christopher |url=http://whitehorsestar.com/News/local-man-pursues-ndp-nomination |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Local man pursues NDP nomination |publisher=Whitehorsestar.com |date=2014-12-18 |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref><ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/green-party-s-frank-de-jong-asks-yukoners-to-follow-their-green-conscience-1.3259765 ]</ref>\n\nDe Jong was elected pp leader of the Yukon Green Party in September 2016.<ref>[https://www.yukon-news.com/news/de-jong-takes-over-green-party-leadership-as-candidates-step-forward/ ]</ref><ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-green-party-territorial-election-young-voters-1.3832123]</ref>\n\n==Election campaigns==\n\n{{wikinews2|New Democrats score upset in Ontario's Parkdale-High Park by-election|Ontario Green Party leader to run in byelection}}\nDe Jong has campaigned for federal and provincial office several times. His best showing was in the [[2003 Ontario general election|provincial election of 2003]], when he ran against sitting [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Ernie Eves]] and finished third, ahead of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] candidate.  On all other occasions, de Jong has finished well behind candidates of the major parties.\n\nDuring the 1995 provincial campaign, de Jong cycled on a \"leader's tour\" from [[Ottawa]] to [[Sault Ste.

He joined the [[Green Party of Ontario]] in 1987 and became the party's first official leader in 1993 \u2013 a position he held until November 14, 2009, when he was replaced by [[Mike Schreiner]]. He is the current interim leader of the [[Yukon Green Party]].<ref name=\"WDSdj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehorsestar.com/News/yukon-greens-run-record-number-of-candidates|title=Yukon Greens run record number of candidates|last=Cohen|first=Sidney|date=31 August 2016|publisher=[[Whitehorse Star|Whitehorse Daily Star]]|language=English|accessdate=1 September 2016|location=[[Whitehorse, Yukon]]}}</ref> De Jong has also campaigned for federal office as a member of the [[Green Party of Canada]].\n\n==Education and activism==\n\nBorn into a Dutch background, De Jong earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of Western Ontario]] in 1978, and a [[Bachelor of Education]] from [[University of Ottawa]] in 1979.  After graduating, he worked as an elementary school teacher.  He developed an interest in environmental concerns during the mid-1980s, and became involved in campaigns to save Ontario's old growth forests.  He was also involved in the anti-nuclear, renewable energy and [[pro-choice]] movements.  De Jong now resides in [http://www.faroyukon.ca/ Faro, Yukon] with his partner Tove Christensen.\n\n==Politics==\n\nThe Ontario Green Party did not originally have a formal leadership structure, and was run in a very decentralized manner (nominal leaders were sometimes chosen for elections, but they had no personal authority over party decisions).  De Jong and others opposed this approach, and successfully campaigned for a formal leadership contest in 1993.  De Jong himself entered this contest, and defeated [[James R. M. Harris|Jim Harris]], who later became leader of the Green Party of Canada.  De Jong supported Harris's leadership of the federal party until Harris stepped down in 2006, at which time de Jong supported [[David Chernushenko]]'s leadership bid.  He was challenged for the leadership of the Ontario Green Party by [[Judy Greenwood-Speers]] in 2001.\n\n[[Image:Mike Schreiner and Frank de Jong Hart House 2009.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Frank De Jong (right), with his successor as [[Green Party of Ontario|Ontario Greens]] Leader, [[Mike Schreiner]] (left)]]\n\nLike Harris, de Jong is an [[eco-capitalist]].  He defines his political philosophy as \"socially progressive, fiscally conservative, and environmentally aware\".<ref>[http://www.gpo.ca/node/26 Green Party of Ontario Leader Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208173600/http://www.gpo.ca/node/26 |date=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>  He has long supported conservative economic policies, including a gradual shift from the taxation of incomes to the taxation of natural resources.  Recently, he has also spoken against extensive government subsidies and funding for crown corporations.\n\nAt the October 2005 [[Green Party of Ontario]] [[Annual General Meeting]], de Jong narrowly avoided a \"leadership review\" when 67% of voting members voted against it.  The GPO constitution requires that a leadership review be held bi-annually; If more than one-third of voting members had opted for a review, a leadership race would have been held in 2006.  At the 2007 AGM, de Jong survived the next scheduled review, this time with approximately 71% support from party members.  This followed what was considered the strongest election performance by the GPO to date.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/article/279832 \"Green leader gets 71 per cent support\"]. ''Toronto Star'', November 26, 2007.</ref> Speaking at the Green Party of Ontario AGM in May 2009, de Jong announced that he will not be running for re-election as leader of the party.<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/ontario/article/639159 \"Frank de Jong to step down as Green party leader\"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', May 23, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the September 14, 2006, Parkdale\u2014High Park by-election, de Jong received 6.2 percent of the vote.  On November 7, 2006, he was nominated as the GPO candidate in the riding of [[Davenport (provincial electoral district)|Davenport]] for the [[2007 Ontario general election]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20120802015025/http://www.greenparty.on.ca/node/922%23attachments ''Davenport Green Party nominates de Jong''], Green Party of Ontario news release, November 8, 2006.</ref> In that election, de Jong captured 10.26 percent of the vote, his best showing as a member of the Green Party.\n\nDe Jong was a candidate for Ward 18 in [[2010 Toronto municipal election|Toronto's 2010 municipal election]].\n\nAs of December 2014, de Jong was living in [[Faro, Yukon]] and was the [[Green Party of Canada]] candidate in the [[Yukon (electoral district)|Yukon]] riding in the [[42nd Canadian federal election|2015 federal election]], placing a distant fourth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reynolds |first=Christopher |url=http://whitehorsestar.com/News/local-man-pursues-ndp-nomination |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Local man pursues NDP nomination |publisher=Whitehorsestar.com |date=2014-12-18 |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref><ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/green-party-s-frank-de-jong-asks-yukoners-to-follow-their-green-conscience-1.3259765 ]</ref>\n\nDe Jong was appointed interim leader of the Yukon Green Party in September 2016.<ref>[https://www.yukon-news.com/news/de-jong-takes-over-green-party-leadership-as-candidates-step-forward/ ]</ref><ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/yukon-green-party-territorial-election-young-voters-1.3832123]</ref>\n\n==Election campaigns==\n\n{{wikinews2|New Democrats score upset in Ontario's Parkdale-High Park by-election|Ontario Green Party leader to run in byelection}}\nDe Jong has campaigned for federal and provincial office several times. His best showing was in the [[2003 Ontario general election|provincial election of 2003]], when he ran against sitting [[Premier of Ontario|Premier]] [[Ernie Eves]] and finished third, ahead of the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] candidate.  On all other occasions, de Jong has finished well behind candidates of the major parties.\n\nDuring the 1995 provincial campaign, de Jong cycled on a \"leader's tour\" from [[Ottawa]] to [[Sault Ste.
