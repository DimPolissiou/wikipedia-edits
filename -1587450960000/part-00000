For example, he enjoys a symphony concert not so much for the music, but for the atmosphere: \"the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendor.\" Later on in the story, he steals money from where he works to support a short escapade in [[New York City]]. Once he exhausts his funds and his father catches wind of what has happened, he commits suicide by jumping in front of a train rather than allow his father to take him back to Pittsburgh.\n\nPaul's teachers and father refer to Paul as a \"case\", representing him at a distance and as an example of someone to be studied, handled, and managed; the term enables Cather to adopt \"the voice of medical authority.\" <ref name=WK>{{cite book|first= Wayne |last= Koestenbaum | title=The Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality and the Mystery of Desire |publisher =Gay Men's Press | date=1994 |pages= 28\u201329|title-link= The Queen's Throat }}</ref> \n\n==Plot summary==\nThe short story \u201c''Paul\u2019s Case,\u201d'' is about a young boy who struggles to fit in at home and in school. The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is full of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

The \"whirling\" motions of said snowfall occur several times; as Paul gazes out of the train window on his way to New York, as well as consistently throughout the time he is actually in the city. It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors. Paul's smile in this circumstance displays his cocky attitude and shows that he doesn't care about what the authorities have to say to him.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://englishivbl2b.pbworks.com/w/page/19070348/%22Paul%27s%20Case%22%20--%20Cork%20Terborg,%20Payton%20Laczynski,%20Katie%20Erickson|title=English / \"Paul's Case\" -- Cork Terborg, Payton Laczynski, Katie Erickson|website=englishivbl2b.pbworks.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A different interpretation of Paul's smile arises from the detail where Paul's drawing master claimed there was, \"something sort of haunted about [his smile],\" which is a detail that is often used to support the idea that Paul's smile refers to him having a disability.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''The Basement:''' During the story, Paul sneaks into his home through his basement and reflects on his relationship with his father.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater. This place may have given him the approval he was looking for in his household<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://login.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3387549?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=benefits&searchText=of&searchText=extracurricular&searchText=activities&searchUri=/action/doBasicSearch?searchType=facetSearch&amp;sd=&amp;ed=&amp;Query=benefits+of+extracurricular+activities&amp;pagemark=cGFnZU1hcms9Mg%253D%253D&ab_segments=0/basic_SYC-5152/control&seq=1|title=Marvin K.

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater.

Marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh (D\u00f3nal \"the warlike\") \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tiob\u00f3id a B\u00farc (Tibbot Bourke) and Murchadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O'Flaherty), and her half-brother D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa (\"D\u00f3nal of the Pipes\"), were taken captive by the English governor of [[Connacht]], [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]], O'Malley sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court in [[Greenwich Palace]].\n\n==Early life==\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was born in Ireland around 1530, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was [[King of England]] and held the title [[Lord of Ireland]]. Under the policies of the [[English government]] at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However, this was to change over the course of O'Malley's life as the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] gathered pace.\n\nEoghan Dubhdara \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, her father,<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=20}}</ref> and his family were based in [[Clew Bay]], [[County Mayo]]. He was lord of the [[O'Malley (surname)|\u00d3 M\u00e1ille dynasty]] and ruler of Umall, descended from [[Maille mac Conall]]. The U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille (O'Malleys) were one of the seafaring families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of [[Murrisk]]<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\"/> in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the [[Mac William \u00cdochtar|Mac Uilliam \u00cdochtair]] branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourkes (De Burca) were originally [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] but by N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's lifetime completely [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a half-brother called D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa, the son of her father.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=21}}</ref> Although typically during this period sons would inherit, O'Malley \"was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities\".<ref>[http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/22130/1/Granuaile.pdf O'Connell ]</ref>\n\nWith shore castles like [[Carrickkildavnet Castle|Carrickkildavnet]], the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family (see [[Chiefs of the Name]]) was known simply by his surname as \u00d3 M\u00e1ille (anglicised as The O'Malley). Local folklore had it that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname \"Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol\" ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8\u0261\u02e0\u027e\u02e0\u0251\u02d0n\u02b2\u0259 w\u0268\u02d0l\u02e0}}; from ''maol'' meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0261|r|\u0254\u02d0|nj|\u0259|\u02c8|w|e\u026a|l}}).<ref>as used to name the ships ILV ''Granuaile'' of the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]]</ref> The nickname may also come from \"Gr\u00e1inne Umhaill\" (\"Gr\u00e1inne of Umhall\", Umhall being a historical district of west [[Connacht]] dominated by the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille).<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p= 57}}</ref>\n\nAs a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and [[Clare Island]],<ref name=\"chambers39\"/> but she may have been fostered to another family, for [[fosterage]] was traditional among [[Irish people|Irish]] nobility at the time. She was probably formally educated, since she is believed to have spoken in [[Latin]] with Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in 1593.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=36}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to O'Flaherty==\n[[File:Clare Island.jpg|thumb|250px|Clare Island, associated with Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley]]\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was married in 1546 to [[\u00d3 Flaithbertaigh|D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]], ''[[t\u00e1naiste]]'' or heir to the \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ([[O'Flaherty]]) title, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the \u00d3 M\u00e1ille chieftain. As \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ''t\u00e1naiste'', D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling [[Iar Connacht]], the area roughly equivalent to modern [[Connemara]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=42}}</ref>\n\nShe bore three children during her marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh:\n* Eoghan (Owen):<ref name=\"chambers44\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=44}}</ref> The eldest child, known to be kind and forgiving. [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]] tricked him; Owen was murdered as a result, and Bingham and his troops took over his castle.\n* M\u00e9adhbh (Maeve):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Said to be much like her mother, she married Ricard Deamhan an Chorr\u00e1in a B\u00farc, 'the Devil's Hook', with whom she had several children. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and a B\u00farc were supposedly very close, more than once saving her from death.\n* Murchadh (Murrough):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Murrough was said to take after his father, for he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Maeve, and refused to listen to his mother because of her gender. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Sir Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When O'Malley heard of this she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him. After D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh's death, O'Malley left Iar Connacht and returned to \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille territory, taking with her many O'Flaherty followers.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=45}}</ref>\n\nIn 1565, D\u00f3nal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding [[Lough Corrib]]; this was, undoubtedly, part of D\u00f3nal's wider struggle with the Joyces for control of [[Castlekirk|Hen's Castle]] on the lough. Gr\u00e1inne returned to her own lands and established her principal residence on Clare Island (now called [[Granuaile's Castle]]). She allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover. The affair only lasted briefly as he was killed by the MacMahons of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, Gr\u00e1inne attacked the MacMahon castle of Doona in [[Blacksod Bay]] and killed her lover's murderers on Cahir Island. Her attack on Doona Castle earned her the nickname 'Dark Lady of Doona'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a6886&searchClicked=clicked&quickadvsearch=yes |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography - Cambridge University Press |website=dib.cambridge.org |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to Burke==\n[[File:Carrickahowley (Rockfleet) Castle County Mayo.JPG|thumb|right|[[Rockfleet Castle]]]]\nBy 1566, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had married a second time, this time to [[Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn Bourke|Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn (\"Iron Richard\") Bourke]], his nickname deriving from his ironworks at [[Burrishoole]], the place of his principal castle and residence.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=63}}</ref> [[Tibbot ne Long Bourke, 1st Viscount Mayo|The 1st Viscount Mayo]] was a child of this marriage. \n\nStill not satisfied with her revenge, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself.<ref name=\"chambers55-56\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|pp=55\u201356}}</ref> Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers.

Because Rockfleet was over a week's march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was very weak.\n\nIn 1593, in his letter to protesting N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was ''\"nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years\"''.<ref name=\"chambers52\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=52}}</ref><ref>Lambeth Palace Library MS 601, p. 111</ref> Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, tasked with controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous.\n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] over her part of the country. An expedition from [[Galway]] led by Sheriff [[William \u00d3ge Martyn]] attacked [[Granuaile's Castle|her castle at Clare Island]] in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.\n\n==Meeting with Elizabeth==\n{{More footnotes|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|250px|The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I (a later illustration from ''Anthologia Hibernica'', vol. 11, 1793)]]\nIn the late 16th century, English power steadily grew in Ireland and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's power was steadily encroached upon. In 1593, when her two sons Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa were captured by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth I famously sent N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille a list of questions, which were answered and returned to Elizabeth. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then met with the Queen at [[Greenwich Palace]], wearing a fine gown, the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal Court. \n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille refused to bow before Elizabeth because she didn't recognise her as the \"Queen of Ireland\". It's also rumoured that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled.\n\nSome also reported that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed.\n\nTheir discussion was carried out in Latin, as N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille spoke no English and Queen Elizabeth I spoke no Irish.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\" /> After much talk, the women came to an agreement that included that Elizabeth would remove Bingham from his position in Ireland, and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille would stop supporting the Irish lords' rebellions.\n\nBingham was removed but several of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet, and soon Elizabeth sent Bingham back into Ireland. Upon Bingham's return, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille realised that the meeting with Elizabeth had been useless, and went back to supporting Irish insurgents during the ''[[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].''\n\nShe most likely died at [[Rockfleet Castle]] around 1603, the same year as Elizabeth's death, though the year and place of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's death are disputed. Her family's usual burial place was in [[Clare Island Abbey]].\n\n==Biographical sources==\nO'Malley's biography has been written by Irish historian and novelist [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], who has described O'Malley as:\n<blockquote>\"a fearless leader, by land and by sea, a political pragmatist and politician, a ruthless plunderer, a mercenary, a rebel, a shrewd and able negotiator, the protective matriarch of her family and tribe, a genuine inheritor of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Queen attributes of her remote ancestors. Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref></blockquote>\n\nDocumentary evidence for N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The O'Malley family \"book\", a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory\", questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I.<ref>See the supplement to Chambers, 2003.</ref> She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir Henry Sidney]], to his son [[Phillip Sidney|Phillip]] in 1577: \"There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men&nbsp;...\"<ref>Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85</ref>\n\nLocal traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the [[Ordnance Survey Memoirs of Ireland|Ordnance Survey of Ireland]]. In a letter of 1838 he describes her as being \"most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally\".\n\n<blockquote>Charles Cormick of Erris, now 74 years and six weeks old, saw and conversed with Elizabeth O'Donnell of Newtown within the Mullet, who died about 65 years ago who had seen and intimately known a Mr Walsh who remembered Gr\u00e1inne. Walsh died at the age of 107 and his father was the same age as Gr\u00e1inne.<ref>Gaisford St Lawrence Papers, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 73</ref></blockquote>\n\nA story is recorded of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille chiding her son T\u00edobo\u00edd in the course of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: \"''An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo th\u00f3in at\u00e1 t\u00fa, an \u00e1it a dt\u00e1inig t\u00fa as?''\" (\"Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?\").<ref name=\"Ordnance Survey Letters 2003\">Ordnance Survey Letters, Mayo, vol.

Commonly known as ''Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol'' (anglicised as '''Granuaile''') in [[Irish folklore]], she is a well-known historical figure in 16th-century [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|Irish history]]. Her name was rendered in contemporary English documents in various ways, including Gr\u00e1inne O'Maly, Graney O'Mally, Granny ni Maille, Grany O'Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O'Maly, and Granee O'Maillie.

Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"''<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref>\n\nUpon her father's death she took over active leadership of the lordship by land and sea, despite having a brother, D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille. Marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh (D\u00f3nal \"the warlike\") \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tiob\u00f3id a B\u00farc (Tibbot Bourke) and Murchadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O'Flaherty), and her half-brother D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa (\"D\u00f3nal of the Pipes\"), were taken captive by the English governor of [[Connacht]], [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]], O'Malley sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court in [[Greenwich Palace]].\n\n==Early life==\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was born in Ireland around 1530, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was [[King of England]] and held the title [[Lord of Ireland]]. Under the policies of the [[English government]] at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However, this was to change over the course of O'Malley's life as the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] gathered pace.\n\nEoghan Dubhdara \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, her father,<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=20}}</ref> and his family were based in [[Clew Bay]], [[County Mayo]]. He was lord of the [[O'Malley (surname)|\u00d3 M\u00e1ille dynasty]] and ruler of Umall, descended from [[Maille mac Conall]]. The U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille (O'Malleys) were one of the seafaring families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of [[Murrisk]]<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\"/> in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the [[Mac William \u00cdochtar|Mac Uilliam \u00cdochtair]] branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourkes (De Burca) were originally [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] but by N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's lifetime completely [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a half-brother called D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa, the son of her father.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=21}}</ref> Although typically during this period sons would inherit, O'Malley \"was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities\".<ref>[http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/22130/1/Granuaile.pdf O'Connell ]</ref>\n\nWith shore castles like [[Carrickkildavnet Castle|Carrickkildavnet]], the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family (see [[Chiefs of the Name]]) was known simply by his surname as \u00d3 M\u00e1ille (anglicised as The O'Malley). Local folklore had it that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname \"Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol\" ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8\u0261\u02e0\u027e\u02e0\u0251\u02d0n\u02b2\u0259 w\u0268\u02d0l\u02e0}}; from ''maol'' meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0261|r|\u0254\u02d0|nj|\u0259|\u02c8|w|e\u026a|l}}).<ref>as used to name the ships ILV ''Granuaile'' of the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]]</ref> The nickname may also come from \"Gr\u00e1inne Umhaill\" (\"Gr\u00e1inne of Umhall\", Umhall being a historical district of west [[Connacht]] dominated by the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille).<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p= 57}}</ref>\n\nAs a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and [[Clare Island]],<ref name=\"chambers39\"/> but she may have been fostered to another family, for [[fosterage]] was traditional among [[Irish people|Irish]] nobility at the time. She was probably formally educated, since she is believed to have spoken in [[Latin]] with Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in 1593.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=36}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to O'Flaherty==\n[[File:Clare Island.jpg|thumb|250px|Clare Island, associated with Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley]]\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was married in 1546 to [[\u00d3 Flaithbertaigh|D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]], ''[[t\u00e1naiste]]'' or heir to the \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ([[O'Flaherty]]) title, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the \u00d3 M\u00e1ille chieftain. As \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ''t\u00e1naiste'', D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling [[Iar Connacht]], the area roughly equivalent to modern [[Connemara]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=42}}</ref>\n\nShe bore three children during her marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh:\n* Eoghan (Owen):<ref name=\"chambers44\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=44}}</ref> The eldest child, known to be kind and forgiving. [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]] tricked him; Owen was murdered as a result, and Bingham and his troops took over his castle.\n* M\u00e9adhbh (Maeve):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Said to be much like her mother, she married Ricard Deamhan an Chorr\u00e1in a B\u00farc, 'the Devil's Hook', with whom she had several children. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and a B\u00farc were supposedly very close, more than once saving her from death.\n* Murchadh (Murrough):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Murrough was said to take after his father, for he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Maeve, and refused to listen to his mother because of her gender. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Sir Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When O'Malley heard of this she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him. After D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh's death, O'Malley left Iar Connacht and returned to \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille territory, taking with her many O'Flaherty followers.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=45}}</ref>\n\nIn 1565, D\u00f3nal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding [[Lough Corrib]]; this was, undoubtedly, part of D\u00f3nal's wider struggle with the Joyces for control of [[Castlekirk|Hen's Castle]] on the lough. Gr\u00e1inne returned to her own lands and established her principal residence on Clare Island (now called [[Granuaile's Castle]]). She allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover. The affair only lasted briefly as he was killed by the MacMahons of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, Gr\u00e1inne attacked the MacMahon castle of Doona in [[Blacksod Bay]] and killed her lover's murderers on Cahir Island. Her attack on Doona Castle earned her the nickname 'Dark Lady of Doona'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a6886&searchClicked=clicked&quickadvsearch=yes |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography - Cambridge University Press |website=dib.cambridge.org |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to Burke==\n[[File:Carrickahowley (Rockfleet) Castle County Mayo.JPG|thumb|right|[[Rockfleet Castle]]]]\nBy 1566, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had married a second time, this time to [[Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn Bourke|Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn (\"Iron Richard\") Bourke]], his nickname deriving from his ironworks at [[Burrishoole]], the place of his principal castle and residence.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=63}}</ref> [[Tibbot ne Long Bourke, 1st Viscount Mayo|The 1st Viscount Mayo]] was a child of this marriage. \n\nStill not satisfied with her revenge, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself.<ref name=\"chambers55-56\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|pp=55\u201356}}</ref> Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another lord who stole property from her and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=56}}</ref>\n\nMore than twenty years after her death, an English [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the [[Irish people]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=53}}</ref><ref>Calendar of State Papers Relating to Ireland (James I) 1623, no. 997. (London 1860\u20131912)</ref>\n\n==Autonomous status==\nIn 1576, Grace engaged in the [[surrender and regrant]] process with the Lord Deputy Sir [[Henry Sidney]] in respect of her lands. Because Rockfleet was over a week's march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was very weak.\n\nIn 1593, in his letter to protesting N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was ''\"nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years\"''.<ref name=\"chambers52\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=52}}</ref><ref>Lambeth Palace Library MS 601, p. 111</ref> Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, tasked with controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous.\n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] over her part of the country. An expedition from [[Galway]] led by Sheriff [[William \u00d3ge Martyn]] attacked [[Granuaile's Castle|her castle at Clare Island]] in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.\n\n==Meeting with Elizabeth==\n{{More footnotes|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|250px|The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I (a later illustration from ''Anthologia Hibernica'', vol. 11, 1793)]]\nIn the later 16th century, English power steadily increased in Ireland and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's power was steadily encroached upon. Finally in 1593, when her family (her two sons Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa) were taken captive by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth I famously sent N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille a list of questions, which were answered and returned to Elizabeth. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then met with the Queen at [[Greenwich Palace]], wearing a fine gown, the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal Court. \n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille refused to bow before Elizabeth because she didn't recognise her as the \"Queen of Ireland.\" It's also rumoured that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled.\n\nSome also reported that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed.\n\nTheir discussion was carried out in Latin, as N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille spoke no English and Queen Elizabeth I spoke no Irish.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\" /> After much talk, the two women came to an agreement. Included in the stipulations for each party were that: Elizabeth was to remove Bingham from his position in Ireland, and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was to stop supporting the Irish lords' rebellions.\n\nThe meeting seemed to have done some good, for Richard Bingham was removed from service. However, several of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet, and within a rather short period of time Queen Elizabeth I sent Bingham back into Ireland. Upon Bingham's return, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille realised that the meeting with Elizabeth had been useless, and went back to supporting Irish insurgents during the ''[[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].''\n\nShe most likely died at [[Rockfleet Castle]] around 1603. The same year as Elizabeth's death, though the year and place of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's death are disputed. Her family's usual burial place was in [[Clare Island Abbey]].\n\n==Biographical sources==\nO'Malley's biography has been written by Irish historian and novelist [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], who has described O'Malley as:\n<blockquote>\"a fearless leader, by land and by sea, a political pragmatist and politician, a ruthless plunderer, a mercenary, a rebel, a shrewd and able negotiator, the protective matriarch of her family and tribe, a genuine inheritor of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Queen attributes of her remote ancestors. Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref></blockquote>\n\nDocumentary evidence for N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The O'Malley family \"book\", a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory\", questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I.<ref>See the supplement to Chambers, 2003.</ref> She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir Henry Sidney]], to his son [[Phillip Sidney|Phillip]] in 1577: \"There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men&nbsp;...\"<ref>Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85</ref>\n\nLocal traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the [[Ordnance Survey Memoirs of Ireland|Ordnance Survey of Ireland]]. In a letter of 1838 he describes her as being \"most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally\".\n\n<blockquote>Charles Cormick of Erris, now 74 years and six weeks old, saw and conversed with Elizabeth O'Donnell of Newtown within the Mullet, who died about 65 years ago who had seen and intimately known a Mr Walsh who remembered Gr\u00e1inne. Walsh died at the age of 107 and his father was the same age as Gr\u00e1inne.<ref>Gaisford St Lawrence Papers, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 73</ref></blockquote>\n\nA story is recorded of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille chiding her son T\u00edobo\u00edd in the course of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: \"''An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo th\u00f3in at\u00e1 t\u00fa, an \u00e1it a dt\u00e1inig t\u00fa as?''\" (\"Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?\").<ref name=\"Ordnance Survey Letters 2003\">Ordnance Survey Letters, Mayo, vol. II, cited in Chambers 2003, spelling modernised.</ref> She is also recorded as saying, with regard to her followers, \"''go mb'fhearr l\u00e9i l\u00e1n loinge de chlann Chonraoi agus de chlann Mhic an Fhail\u00ed n\u00e1 l\u00e1n loinge d'\u00f3r''\" (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).<ref name=\"Ordnance Survey Letters 2003\"/>\n\n==Westport House==\n[[Westport House]] in County Mayo, Ireland, was the seat of the Browne dynasty, [[Marquess of Sligo|Marquesses of Sligo]], direct descendants of Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. The current house was built close to the site of Cahernamart (''Cathair na Mart'' - \"fort of the slaughtered cows\"), an O'Malley fort. The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the [[Siege of Limerick (1650\u201351)]], and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's great-great granddaughter.\n\nThere is a bronze statue of O'Malley by the artist Michael Cooper \u2013 the brother-in-law of [[Jeremy Browne, 11th Marquess of Sligo|the 11th Marquess of Sligo]] \u2013 in the grounds of Westport House.<ref>'Westport House A Brief History' Westport House 2008</ref> Westport House also contains a comprehensive exhibition on the life of O'Malley compiled by author [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], a leading authority on Granuaile.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nO'Malley's life has inspired many musicians, novelists, and playwrights to create works based on her life and adventures and she has been used as a [[National personification|personification]] of Ireland:<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Hardiman |author-link=James Hardiman |title=Irish Minstrelsy; or Bardic Remains of Ireland, Volume 2 |year=1831 |page=[https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00hardgoog/page/n154 140] |url=https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00hardgoog}}\n<blockquote>Her name has been frequently used by our Bards, to designate Ireland.

As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalogue of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.\n\nColumbia's ties to Edison and the [[North American Phonograph Company]] were severed in 1894 with the [[North American Phonograph Company]]'s breakup. Thereafter it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the \"XP\" record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903. According to one source, they continued to mold brown waxes until 1904 with the highest number being 32601, \"Heinie\", which is a duet by [[Arthur Collins (singer)|Arthur Collins]] and [[Byron G. Harlan]]. The molded brown waxes may have been sold to [[Sears]] for distribution (possibly under Sears' Oxford trademark for Columbia products).<ref>{{cite web|last=Gracyk |first=Tim |url=http://www.gracyk.com/wax.shtml |title=Tim Gracyk's Phonographs, Singers, and Old Records - How Late Did Columbia Use Brown Wax? |publisher=Gracyk.com |date=October 11, 1904 |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphophone1901.jpg|right|thumb|A Columbia type AT cylinder [[graphophone]] was produced in 1898.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|last=Hazelcorn|first=Howard|title=A Collector's Guide to the Columbia Spring-Wound Cylinder Graphophone|publisher=Antique Phonograph Monthly|year=1976|edition=1|pages=10, 13}}</ref>]]\n\nColumbia began selling [[gramophone record|disc records]] (invented and patented by Victor Talking Machine Company's [[Emile Berliner]]) and phonographs in addition to the cylinder system in 1901, preceded only by their \"Toy Graphophone\" of 1899, which used small, vertically cut records. For a decade, Columbia competed with both the [[Edison Phonograph Company]] cylinders and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] disc records as one of the top three names in American recorded sound.\n\nIn order to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted a number of [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] stars to make recordings (from 1903 onward). These stars included [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Lillian Nordica]], [[Antonio Scotti]] and [[Edouard de Reszke]], but the technical standard of their recordings was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with classical singers during the pre\u2013World War I period by Victor, Edison, England's [[His Master's Voice]] (The [[Gramophone Company]] Ltd.) or Italy's [[Fonotipia Records]]. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc\u2014not just one\u2014in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their \"Double-Faced\" discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents apiece. The firm also introduced the internal-horn \"'''[[Graphophone|Grafonola]]'''\" to compete with the extremely popular \"[[Victrola]]\" sold by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company.\n\nDuring this era, Columbia used the \"Magic Notes\" logo\u2014a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle\u2014both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).\n\n[[File:Columbia1116D.jpg|left|thumb|The American label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Art Gillham]] from the mid-twenties]]\n\nColumbia stopped recording and manufacturing wax cylinder records in 1908, after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the [[Indestructible Record Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], as \"Columbia Indestructible Records\". In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and stopped manufacturing cylinder phonographs, although they continued selling Indestructible's cylinders under the Columbia name for a year or two more.\n\nColumbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph was moved to Connecticut, and Ed Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\"/>\n\n[[File:Col4951A.jpg|right|thumb|The British label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Paul Whiteman]]]]\n\nIn late 1922, Columbia went into receivership.<ref name=\"New Grove\">{{cite book|last1=Rye|first1=Howard |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=172|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref> The company was bought by its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|English subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Company]] in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from [[Western Electric]]. \"Viva-tonal\" records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by [[Art Gillham]], the \"Whispering Pianist\". In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.\n\nIn 1926, Columbia acquired [[Okeh Records]] and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including [[Bessie Smith]] in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful \"Hillbilly\" series (15000-D). In 1928, [[Paul Whiteman]], the nation's most popular orchestra leader, left Victor to record for Columbia. During the same year, Columbia executive [[Frank Buckley Walker]] pioneered some of the first country music or \"hillbilly\" genre recordings with the [[Johnson City sessions]] in Tennessee, including artists such as [[Clarence Horton Greene]] and [[Charlie Bowman|\"Fiddlin'\" Charlie Bowman]]. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, as well as recording sessions in other cities of the South.\n\nIn 1929 [[Ben Selvin]] became house bandleader and A. & R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included [[Ruth Etting]], Paul Whiteman, [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Ipana Troubadours]] (a Sam Lanin group), and [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]]. Columbia used acoustic recording for \"budget label\" pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and [[Diva Records|Diva]] (sold exclusively at [[W.T. Grant]] stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.\n\n===Columbia ownership separation (1931\u20131936)===\nIn 1931, the British Columbia Graphophone Company (itself originally a subsidiary of American Columbia Records, then to become independent, actually went on to purchase its former parent, American Columbia, in late 1929) merged with the [[Gramophone Company]] to form Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. ([[EMI]]). EMI was forced to sell its American Columbia operations (because of anti-trust concerns) and the Grigsby-Grunow Company, makers of the Majestic Radio were the purchaser. But Majestic soon fell on hard times. An abortive attempt in 1932 (around the same time that Victor was experimenting with its 33{{fraction|1|3}} \"program transcriptions\") was the \"Longer Playing Record\", a finer-grooved 10\" 78 with 4:30 to 5:00 playing time per side. Columbia issued about eight of these (in the 18000-D series), as well as a short-lived series of double-grooved \"Longer Playing Record\"s on its Clarion Records, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels. All of these experiments (and indeed the Clarion, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels) were discontinued by mid-1932.\n\nA longer-lived marketing ploy was the Columbia \"Royal Blue Record,\" a brilliant blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia's pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.\n\nWith the Great Depression's tightened economic stranglehold on the country, in a day when the phonograph itself had become a luxury, nothing slowed Columbia's decline. It was still producing some of the most remarkable records of the day, especially on sessions produced by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] and financed by EMI for overseas release. Grigsby-Grunow went under in 1934 and was forced to sell Columbia for a mere $70,000 to the [[American Record Corporation]] (ARC).<ref name=\"Hoffman2004\">{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffman|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&pg=PA212|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=August 21, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-48427-2|page=212}}</ref> This combine already included [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] as its premium label so Columbia was relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of [[Andy Iona]], the [[Irving Mills]] stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown [[Benny Goodman]]. By late 1936, pop releases were discontinued, leaving the label essentially defunct.\n\nIn 1935, Herbert M. Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company.

Retrieved on July 16, 2013.</ref>\n\nAs [[southern gospel]] developed, Columbia had astutely sought to record the artists associated with the emerging genre; for example, Columbia was the only company to record [[Charles Davis Tillman]]. Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]], a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia's bestsellers with at least 37 million records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=Solid Gospel series brings Chuck Wagon Gang to Renaissance Center. |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> many of them through the aegis of the ''Mull Singing Convention of the Air'' sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster [[J. Bazzel Mull]] (1914\u20132006).\n\nAnother event in this period that would prove to be of importance to Columbia was the 1937 hiring of talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario John Hammond. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the [[swing music]] era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932\u201333. Through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during World War II, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the [[bebop]] era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance - the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included [[Charlie Christian]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Bessie Smith]].\n\n===CBS takes over (1938\u20131947)===\n[[File:notesandmike.jpg|thumbnail|125px|left|Columbia \"notes and mic\" logo]]\n\nIn 1938 ARC, including the Columbia label in the US, was bought by [[William S.

The Royal Blue labels now disappeared in favor of a deep red, which caused [[RCA Victor]] to claim infringement on its [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was kept for its [[European classical music|classical music]] [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] line until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of its classical and Broadway albums. Columbia Phonograph Company of Canada did not survive the [[Great Depression]], so CBS made a distribution deal with [[Sparton Records]] in 1939 to release Columbia records in Canada under the Columbia name.\n\nDuring the 1940s Columbia had a contract with [[Frank Sinatra]]. Sinatra helped boost Columbia in revenue. Sinatra recorded over 200 songs with Columbia which include his most popular songs from his early years. Other popular artists on Columbia included [[Benny Goodman]] (signed from RCA Victor), [[Count Basie]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]] (both signed from Decca), [[Eddy Duchin]], [[Ray Noble]] (both moved to Columbia from Brunswick), [[Kate Smith]], [[Mildred Bailey]], and [[Will Bradley]].\n\nIn 1947, the company was renamed Columbia Records Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2002655160/ | title=Columbia Records paperwork collection}}</ref> and founded its Mexican record company, Discos Columbia de Mexico.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=60|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> 1948 saw the first classical LP [[Mendelssohn Violin Concerto (Nathan Milstein album)|Nathan Milstein's recording of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto]].

Some, like opera tenor (''sic''), Ezio Pinza, would go to Columbia...\"</ref>\n\n===The LP record (1948\u20131959)===\n\nColumbia's president Edward Wallerstein was instrumental in steering Paley towards the ARC purchase. He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of ''High Fidelity Magazine'' relates, \"He was no inventor\u2014he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business.\" Despite Wallerstein's stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing \"microgroove\" [[LP record]] format (sometimes written \"Lp\" in early advertisements), which rotated at 33\u2153 [[revolutions per minute]], to be the standard for the gramophone record for half a century. CBS research director Dr. [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer [[William Savory]] with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.<ref name=\"catalog1949\">{{cite book|title=Columbia Record Catalog 1949|publisher=Columbia Records Inc.|pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, as well as longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10\" LP reissue of ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', originally released on March 4, 1946 as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. [[Sinatra]] was arguably Columbia's hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'' was also considered to be the first genuine ''[[concept album]]''. Since the term \"LP\" has come to refer to the 12-inch {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other \"LP's\" listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children's records.<ref name=\"catalog1949\"/> The Library of Congress (Washington DC) now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP in June 1948.<ref>Library of Congress Columbia Records Paperwork Box 121</ref> The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.\n\nColumbia's LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music's longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Bruno Walter]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The success of these recordings eventually persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival  RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January, 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. [[Decca Records]] in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.\n\nAn \"original cast recording\" of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia's Broadway albums.<ref>Sony liner notes</ref>  Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.\n\nMany album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper \"slicks,\" one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.\n\nColumbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the \"paste-over\" front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and \"pasted over\" by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over.\n\n===The 1950s===\n[[File:ATeenageLoveAffair.JPG|thumbnail|left|Columbia used this label for its 45 r.p.m. records from 1951 until 1958.]]\n\nIn 1951, Columbia US began issuing records in the 45 rpm format RCA Victor had introduced two years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubby.net/worldofcubby/RCR/record_history.html |title=Record Collector's Resource: A History of Records |publisher=Cubby.net |date=February 26, 1917 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The same year, Ted Wallerstein retired as Columbia Records chairman;<ref name=\"Inc.1970\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=September 26, 1970|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=10|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and Columbia US also severed its decades-long distribution arrangement with EMI and signed a distribution deal with [[Philips Records]] to market Columbia recordings outside North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/bbe12043 |title=Mitch Miller And His Orchestra And Chorus - Mitch Miller - Philips - UK |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> EMI continued to distribute Okeh and later Epic label recordings until 1968.

Under new head producer [[George Avakian]], Columbia became the most vital label to the general public's appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian's prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of America's indigenous art, releasing the most important LP's by the music's founding father, [[Louis Armstrong]], but also signing to long-term contracts  [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Miles Davis]], the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain\u2014more than a half century later\u2014among the best-selling jazz albums by any label\u2014viz., ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'' by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of the \"500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231| title = Kind of Blue\n| date = February 9, 2003| accessdate = April 11, 2012| magazine = Rollingstone.com}}</ref> With another producer, [[Teo Macero]], a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz giants [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charles Mingus]], while Macero became a key agent in recording and representing\u2014through attention-grabbing, colorful\u2014albums the protean faces of Miles Davis\u2014from leading exponent of [[cool jazz]] and an explorer of the art of [[modal jazz]] through his sextet's 1958 album ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds\u2014commonly known as [[jazz fusion]].\n\n1954 was the eventful year of Columbia's embracing small-group modern jazz\u2014first, in the signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''. Contemporaneously with Columbia's first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet's debut on the label, was a [[Time Magazine]] cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck's success on college campuses. The humble [[Dave Brubeck]] demurred, saying that the second [[Time Magazine]] cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured [[Louis Armstrong]]'s picture) had been earned by [[Duke Ellington]], not himself. Within two years Ellington's picture would appear on the cover of [[Time Magazine]], following his \"wild\" success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. [[Ellington at Newport]], recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist's best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on [[Time Magazine]] were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist [[Thelonious Monk]] would be afforded the same honor.)\n\nColumbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956 when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the [[Capitol Records]] product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the [[Coronet Records|CBS Coronet]] label.\n\nIn the same year, former Columbia A&R manager [[Goddard Lieberson]] was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, as well as the company's various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation's music division soon overtook [[RCA Victor]] as the top recording company in the world, boasting a star-studded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&R manager in 1938, was noted for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality, overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles, as well as championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had very limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton von Webern]]. One of his first major successes was the original cast soundtrack of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32 million in profits.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nIn October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of \"Greatest Hits\" packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, [[Jo Stafford]], Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and [[the Four Lads]]; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation as well as that of [[Marty Robbins]]. Only Mathis' compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'''s album charts]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1200-1299) 1958-1959|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist's career was in decline.\n\n====Stereo====\n\nAlthough Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia's first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (oratorio)|Messiah]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Westminster Choir]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (recorded on December 31, 1956, on {{1/2}}-inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine). Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Bruno Walter]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by [[Eugene Ormandy]], who also recorded an abridged ''Messiah'' for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia's famous New York City studios. [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to [[Columbia Masterworks Records]].\n\nColumbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It wasn't until September 1958, that Columbia started simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono records sold to the general public were subsequently discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the \"Adventures in Sound\" series that showcased music from around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Billboard|date=January 6, 1958|title=Columbia's 1958 Tee-Off Cues Big Product Campaign: Program Set to Tie in with LP Disk's 10th Anniversary Year|url=|journal=Billboard|volume=|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi Living : The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=283\u2013297|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nAs far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match ''Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]'', the [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]] album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched.\n\nPop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.\n\n===The 1960s===\n====Outing of \"deep groove\"====\nBy the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The \"deep groove\" pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center \"block\" to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small \"ledge\" where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 12 (CL 1600-1699/CS 8400-8499) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====CBS Records====\n{{see also|CBS Records International}}\n[[File:CBSRecords.png|thumbnail|125px|right|CBS Records logo outside of the United States]]\n\nIn 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, CBS Records, in 1962, which released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain).<ref name=\"Inc.1963\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n37 40]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], outside North America. This was the result of legal maneuvers which led to the creation of EMI in the early 1930s.\n\nWhile this happened, starting in late 1961, both the mono and the stereo labels of domestic Columbia releases started carrying a small \"CBS\" at the top of the label. This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the \"ledge\" variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small \"CBS\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 13 (CL 1700-1799/CS 8500-8598) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June, 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1800-1899/CS 8600-8699) 1960-1961|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nColumbia's Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.<ref name=\"Inc.1963\"/>\n\nWith the formation of [[CBS Records International]], CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia. In 1960 CBS took over its distributor in Australia and New Zealand, the [[Australian Record Company]] (founded in 1936) including [[Coronet Records]], one of the leading Australian independent recording and distribution companies of the day. The CBS Coronet label was replaced by the CBS label with the 'walking eye' logo in 1963. ARC continued trading under that name until the late 1970s when it formally changed its business name to CBS Australia.\n\n====Mitch Miller on television====\nIn 1961, Columbia's music repertoire was given an enormous boost when [[Mitch Miller]], its A&R manager and bandleader, became the host of the variety series ''[[Sing Along with Mitch]]'' on NBC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957153|title=Remembering Singing Along With Mitch Miller|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}</ref> The show was based on Miller's 'folksy' but appealing 'chorus' style performance of popular standards.

His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] and [[The Turtles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html|title=Peter, Paul and Mary: Top songs of all time|last=Willis|first=Amy|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the [[folk rock]] genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\". In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to [[Electric Dylan controversy|'go electric']] and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group [[The Band]] which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by [[Manfred Mann]] (\"[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]\") and [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]] & Trinity (\"[[This Wheel's On Fire]]\"). Dylan's late 1960s albums ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' became cornerstone recordings of the emergent [[country rock]] genre and influenced The Byrds and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]].\n\n====Converting mono====\nColumbia's engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process \"Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo\". In the June 16, 1962, issue of ''Billboard'' magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue \"rechanneled\" versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.\n\nColumbia's rechanneling process involved a slight time delay and some bass-treble separation between channels. RCA Victor and Capitol (\"[[Duophonic]]\") used similar processes, but the relatively large delay between channels resulted in a sound that has been described by collectors as \"messy\" (Duophonic) or \"garbage can echo\" (RCA Victor). Columbia's rechanneling resulted in a sound similar to reverb, though some found it annoying.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Rock and roll====\nWhen the [[British Invasion]] arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], who was signed in 1963 as the label's first major rock star, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] who were also signed in 1963. The label released a [[merseybeat]] album, ''The Exciting New Liverpool Sound'' (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). [[Terry Melcher]], son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving \"Don't Make My Baby Blue\" for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.\n\nMelcher and [[Bruce Johnston]] discovered and brought to Columbia [[The Rip Chords]], a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in \"Here I Stand\", a remake of the song by [[Wade Flemons]], and \"[[Hey Little Cobra]]\". Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as \"Bruce & Terry\" and later as \"The Rogues\". Melcher produced early albums by [[The Byrds]] and Paul Revere & the Raiders for Columbia while Johnston produced [[The Beach Boys]] for [[Capitol Records]].\n\n====Ascension of Clive Davis====\nWhen Mitch Miller retired in 1965,<ref name=\"Inc.1965\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=December 11, 1965|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=3|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Columbia was at a turning point. Miller's disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia's A&R policy. The label's only significant \"pop\" acts at the time were Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Paul Revere & The Raiders and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&B artists, among them [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"bsn17\" /> Most historians noted that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&B genre, which led to her leaving the label for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller's singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5 million annually.<ref name=\"hitmen\" /> Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis's fortuitous decision to attend the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], where he spotted and signed several leading acts including [[Janis Joplin]]. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept \nMiles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', pioneered a [[Jazz fusion|fusion of jazz and rock music]].<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| title = Bitches Brew| author = Jurek, Thom| accessdate = April 11, 2012| publisher = Allmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nA San Francisco group called [[Moby Grape]] had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released [[Moby Grape (album)|their debut album]], along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following [[D-Day]]. The album hit made #24 on the [[Billboard 200]], but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being \"Omaha,\" which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, \"Hey Grandma,\" only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.\n\n====Simon & Garfunkel====\nArguably the most commercially successful Columbia pop act of this period, other than Bob Dylan, was Simon & Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 when CBS producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], inspired by the folk-rock experiments of The Byrds and others, added drums and bass to the duo's earlier recording of \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had already broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and [[Paul Simon]] had relocated to the UK, where he famously only found out about the single being a hit via the music press. The dramatic success of the song prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the [[folk-rock]] boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, \"[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]\", but progress slowed during 1966-67 as Simon struggled with writer's block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]''. The resulting single, \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\", became a smash hit. Both ''The Graduate'' soundtrack and Simon & Garfunkel's next studio album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'', were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.<ref name=\"bridge\">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Bridge Over Troubled Water|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush====\nDavis lured artists [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Tom Rush]] to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as \"the pop treatment\" by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for [[Horizon Records|Horizon]], then [[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]]. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like \"[[Greenback Dollar]],\" with hard rock songs for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], such as \"[[The Pusher]]\", which was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album ''My Griffin Is Gone'' was described as \"the poster child for 'overproduced,' full of all kinds of instruments and even strings\".<ref name=\"bsn27\">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 27 (K)CS 9000-9999 (1969-1970)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" and \"[[Never Been to Spain]],\" which became hits for [[Three Dog Night]] on [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]]. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.\n\nTom Rush had always been the \"storyteller\" or \"balladeer\" type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. As with Axton, Rush was given \"the treatment\" on [[Tom Rush (1970 album)|his self-titled Columbia debut]]. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done \"tastefully\", of course, but was not really on par with Rush's audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: {{cquote|Well, when you're in the studio, they bring out all these \"sweeteners\" and things they have, and while you're there, you say, yeah, that sounds good. But then you get the album home and you almost can't hear yourself under all that.<ref name=\"bsn27\" />}} Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his [[Wrong End of the Rainbow|next]] [[Merrimack County (album)|three]] [[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|albums]] for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.\n\n===The 1970s===\n====Catalog numbers====\nThe Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the [[Patti Page]] album ''Honey Come Back''. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957-58, although the prefix was now different. In July, 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C=Columbia, E=[[Epic Records|Epic]], M=[[Columbia Masterworks]], Y=[[Odyssey Records|Columbia Odyssey]], and Z=every other label that CBS distributed.  The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets\u2014or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-lps-us.html|title=CBS LPs - US unified numbering system|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> The first CBS album released under the new system was [[Elvin Bishop|The Elvin Bishop Group]]'s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with 30001, while the first actual Columbia release under the system was [[Herschel Bernardi]]'s ''Show Stopper'', assigned with C 30004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html|title=LP Discography for CBS Records US combined numbering system 30000-30499|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to ''[[Sesame Street discography|The Sesame Street Book and Record]]''. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters, which continued until 2005.\n\n====Quadraphonics====\nIn September 1970, under the guidance of [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the [[Automatt]]) and establishing an A&R head and office in San Francisco at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], headed by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], a producer and artist for [[Monument Records]] (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of [[Nils Lofgren]] and [[Roy Buchanan]]. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=If These Halls Could Talk: A Historical Tour Through San Francisco Recording Studios |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat |url-access=registration |last=Johnson |first=Heather |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat/page/n104 90]\u201394 |isbn=1-59863-141-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Columbia began recording in a four-channel process called [[quadraphonic]], using the \"SQ\" (Stereo Quadraphonic) standard that used an electronic encoding process that could be decoded by special amplifiers and then played through four speakers, with each speaker placed in the corner of a room. Remarkably, RCA countered with another quadraphonic process that required a special cartridge to play the \"discrete\" recordings for four-channel playback. Both Columbia and RCA's quadraphonic records could be played on conventional stereo equipment. Although the Columbia process required less equipment and was quite effective, many were confused by the competing systems and sales of both Columbia's matrix recordings and RCA's discrete recordings were disappointing. A few other companies also issued some matrix recordings for a few years. Quadraphonic recording was used by both classical artists, including [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Boulez]], and popular artists such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[The Clash]] and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. Columbia even released a soundtrack album of the movie version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' in quadraphonic. Many of these recordings were later remastered and released in Dolby surround sound on CD.\n\n====Yetnikoff becomes president====\nIn 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Frederic Dannen, the  shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher's words) \"wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud\". In Dannen's view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a \"record man\" (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists' intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a \"colourful character\".<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.19</ref> Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: \"He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building.\"<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd.<ref name=ce /> The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for [[French language|French-language]] recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began [[digital recording]] in a recording session of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], in New York (using [[3M]]'s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).\n\n====Dick Asher vs \"The Network\"====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\nCBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed [[Philadelphia International Records]], [[Blue Sky Records]], the [[Isley Brothers]]' [[T-Neck Records]] and [[Monument Records]] (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979 CBS had a pre-tax income of $51 million and sales of over $1 billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.\n\nTo deal with the crisis, CEO [[John Backe]] promoted [[Dick Asher]] from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher's experience. In 1972 Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher's loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.\n\nAsher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. \"Indies\" had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records' expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10 million per year. When Asher took over CBS' UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as \"The Network\", and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian [[Frederic Dannen]] estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 ''per song'' to the \"Network\" promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80 million annually.\n\nDuring this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the [[Pink Floyd]] single \"[[Another Brick In The Wall]]\", and its parent album ''[[The Wall]]'' would spend four months at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network - by ''not'' paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single. The results were immediate and deeply troubling - not one of the major radio stations in Los Angeles would program the record, despite the fact that the group was in town, performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate [[The Wall Tour (1980\u201381)|The Wall Tour]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that \"The Network\" was in effect a huge [[extortion]] racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime - a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the \"indies\" and declared them to be \"mensches\". But Dick Asher now knew that The Network's real power lay in their ability to ''prevent'' records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new [[payola]] scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the Federal Communications Commission could even revoke CBS' all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 4-27</ref>\n\n===The 1980s and sale to Sony===\n\nThe structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.\n\nIn 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by [[Sony]], which re-christened the parent division [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991.

It was used by several denominations over the next seventy years, then briefly became a radio studio in the late 1940s before being leased by CBS in 1952 and converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio. The 30th Street Studio had unique sonic characteristics, thanks to its soaring one-hundred-foot vaulted ceiling, exposed timber beams, plaster walls and unvarnished wooden floor. When Columbia took over the property, then head of A&R [[Mitch Miller]] (a musician himself) recognised its singular acoustic properties and declared that the hall was to be left \"untouched by human hands\". He posted detailed standing orders to all staff to control the maintenance and cleaning of the space, even down to the changing of light bulbs, ordering that the curtains and other fittings were never to be touched, that no painting was allowed, and especially that the wooden floor could only be swept or vacuumed, and was never under any circumstances to be mopped with water, for fear that this might alter the room's resonant and reflective properties.<ref>Milner, Greg, ''Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of recorded Music'', Granta Books, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-84708-140-7}}), p. 149</ref> CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright and it gave up its lease and closed the studio in 1982.

Easton]] (1856\u20131915) and a group of investors. It derived its name from the [[District of Columbia]], where it was headquartered.<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\">{{cite web|title=Edward Easton|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Edward_Easton |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bilton|first=Lynn|title=Hail, Columbia: A fresh book at last gives Edward Easton and his Graphophone company their due|url=http://www.intertique.com/Hail%20Columbia.htm|accessdate=January 22, 2014|year=1998}}</ref> At first it had a local monopoly on sales and service of Edison [[phonograph]]s and [[phonograph cylinder]]s in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Delaware. As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalogue of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.\n\nColumbia's ties to Edison and the [[North American Phonograph Company]] were severed in 1894 with the [[North American Phonograph Company]]'s breakup. Thereafter it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the \"XP\" record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903. According to one source, they continued to mold brown waxes until 1904 with the highest number being 32601, \"Heinie\", which is a duet by [[Arthur Collins (singer)|Arthur Collins]] and [[Byron G. Harlan]]. The molded brown waxes may have been sold to [[Sears]] for distribution (possibly under Sears' Oxford trademark for Columbia products).<ref>{{cite web|last=Gracyk |first=Tim |url=http://www.gracyk.com/wax.shtml |title=Tim Gracyk's Phonographs, Singers, and Old Records - How Late Did Columbia Use Brown Wax? |publisher=Gracyk.com |date=October 11, 1904 |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphophone1901.jpg|right|thumb|A Columbia type AT cylinder [[graphophone]] was produced in 1898.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|last=Hazelcorn|first=Howard|title=A Collector's Guide to the Columbia Spring-Wound Cylinder Graphophone|publisher=Antique Phonograph Monthly|year=1976|edition=1|pages=10, 13}}</ref>]]\n\nColumbia began selling [[gramophone record|disc records]] (invented and patented by Victor Talking Machine Company's [[Emile Berliner]]) and phonographs in addition to the cylinder system in 1901, preceded only by their \"Toy Graphophone\" of 1899, which used small, vertically cut records. For a decade, Columbia competed with both the [[Edison Phonograph Company]] cylinders and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] disc records as one of the top three names in American recorded sound.\n\nIn order to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted a number of [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] stars to make recordings (from 1903 onward). These stars included [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Lillian Nordica]], [[Antonio Scotti]] and [[Edouard de Reszke]], but the technical standard of their recordings was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with classical singers during the pre\u2013World War I period by Victor, Edison, England's [[His Master's Voice]] (The [[Gramophone Company]] Ltd.) or Italy's [[Fonotipia Records]]. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc\u2014not just one\u2014in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their \"Double-Faced\" discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents apiece. The firm also introduced the internal-horn \"'''[[Graphophone|Grafonola]]'''\" to compete with the extremely popular \"[[Victrola]]\" sold by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company.\n\nDuring this era, Columbia used the \"Magic Notes\" logo\u2014a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle\u2014both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).\n\n[[File:Columbia1116D.jpg|left|thumb|The American label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Art Gillham]] from the mid-twenties]]\n\nColumbia stopped recording and manufacturing wax cylinder records in 1908, after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the [[Indestructible Record Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], as \"Columbia Indestructible Records\". In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and stopped manufacturing cylinder phonographs, although they continued selling Indestructible's cylinders under the Columbia name for a year or two more.\n\nColumbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph was moved to Connecticut, and Ed Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\"/>\n\n[[File:Col4951A.jpg|right|thumb|The British label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Paul Whiteman]]]]\n\nIn late 1922, Columbia went into receivership.<ref name=\"New Grove\">{{cite book|last1=Rye|first1=Howard |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=172|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref> The company was bought by its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|English subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Company]] in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from [[Western Electric]]. \"Viva-tonal\" records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by [[Art Gillham]], the \"Whispering Pianist\". In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.\n\nIn 1926, Columbia acquired [[Okeh Records]] and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including [[Bessie Smith]] in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful \"Hillbilly\" series (15000-D). In 1928, [[Paul Whiteman]], the nation's most popular orchestra leader, left Victor to record for Columbia. During the same year, Columbia executive [[Frank Buckley Walker]] pioneered some of the first country music or \"hillbilly\" genre recordings with the [[Johnson City sessions]] in Tennessee, including artists such as [[Clarence Horton Greene]] and [[Charlie Bowman|\"Fiddlin'\" Charlie Bowman]]. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, as well as recording sessions in other cities of the South.\n\nIn 1929 [[Ben Selvin]] became house bandleader and A. & R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included [[Ruth Etting]], Paul Whiteman, [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Ipana Troubadours]] (a Sam Lanin group), and [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]]. Columbia used acoustic recording for \"budget label\" pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and [[Diva Records|Diva]] (sold exclusively at [[W.T. Grant]] stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.\n\n===Columbia ownership separation (1931\u20131936)===\nIn 1931, the British Columbia Graphophone Company (itself originally a subsidiary of American Columbia Records, then to become independent, actually went on to purchase its former parent, American Columbia, in late 1929) merged with the [[Gramophone Company]] to form Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. ([[EMI]]). EMI was forced to sell its American Columbia operations (because of anti-trust concerns) and the Grigsby-Grunow Company, makers of the Majestic Radio were the purchaser. But Majestic soon fell on hard times. An abortive attempt in 1932 (around the same time that Victor was experimenting with its 33{{fraction|1|3}} \"program transcriptions\") was the \"Longer Playing Record\", a finer-grooved 10\" 78 with 4:30 to 5:00 playing time per side. Columbia issued about eight of these (in the 18000-D series), as well as a short-lived series of double-grooved \"Longer Playing Record\"s on its Clarion Records, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels. All of these experiments (and indeed the Clarion, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels) were discontinued by mid-1932.\n\nA longer-lived marketing ploy was the Columbia \"Royal Blue Record,\" a brilliant blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia's pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.\n\nWith the Great Depression's tightened economic stranglehold on the country, in a day when the phonograph itself had become a luxury, nothing slowed Columbia's decline. It was still producing some of the most remarkable records of the day, especially on sessions produced by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] and financed by EMI for overseas release. Grigsby-Grunow went under in 1934 and was forced to sell Columbia for a mere $70,000 to the [[American Record Corporation]] (ARC).<ref name=\"Hoffman2004\">{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffman|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&pg=PA212|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=August 21, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-48427-2|page=212}}</ref> This combine already included [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] as its premium label so Columbia was relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of [[Andy Iona]], the [[Irving Mills]] stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown [[Benny Goodman]]. By late 1936, pop releases were discontinued, leaving the label essentially defunct.\n\nIn 1935, Herbert M. Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company.

Retrieved on July 16, 2013.</ref>\n\nAs [[southern gospel]] developed, Columbia had astutely sought to record the artists associated with the emerging genre; for example, Columbia was the only company to record [[Charles Davis Tillman]]. Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]], a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia's bestsellers with at least 37 million records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=Solid Gospel series brings Chuck Wagon Gang to Renaissance Center. |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> many of them through the aegis of the ''Mull Singing Convention of the Air'' sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster [[J. Bazzel Mull]] (1914\u20132006).\n\nAnother event in this period that would prove to be of importance to Columbia was the 1937 hiring of talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario John Hammond. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the [[swing music]] era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932\u201333. Through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during World War II, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the [[bebop]] era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance - the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included [[Charlie Christian]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Bessie Smith]].\n\n===CBS takes over (1938\u20131947)===\n[[File:notesandmike.jpg|thumbnail|125px|left|Columbia \"notes and mic\" logo]]\n\nIn 1938 ARC, including the Columbia label in the US, was bought by [[William S.

The Royal Blue labels now disappeared in favor of a deep red, which caused [[RCA Victor]] to claim infringement on its [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was kept for its [[European classical music|classical music]] [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] line until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of its classical and Broadway albums. Columbia Phonograph Company of Canada did not survive the [[Great Depression]], so CBS made a distribution deal with [[Sparton Records]] in 1939 to release Columbia records in Canada under the Columbia name.\n\nDuring the 1940s Columbia had a contract with [[Frank Sinatra]]. Sinatra helped boost Columbia in revenue. Sinatra recorded over 200 songs with Columbia which include his most popular songs from his early years. Other popular artists on Columbia included [[Benny Goodman]] (signed from RCA Victor), [[Count Basie]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]] (both signed from Decca), [[Eddy Duchin]], [[Ray Noble]] (both moved to Columbia from Brunswick), [[Kate Smith]], [[Mildred Bailey]], and [[Will Bradley]].\n\nIn 1947, the company was renamed Columbia Records Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2002655160/ | title=Columbia Records paperwork collection}}</ref> and founded its Mexican record company, Discos Columbia de Mexico.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=60|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> 1948 saw the first classical LP [[Mendelssohn Violin Concerto (Nathan Milstein album)|Nathan Milstein's recording of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto]].

Some, like opera tenor (''sic''), Ezio Pinza, would go to Columbia...\"</ref>\n\n===The LP record (1948\u20131959)===\n\nColumbia's president Edward Wallerstein was instrumental in steering Paley towards the ARC purchase. He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of ''High Fidelity Magazine'' relates, \"He was no inventor\u2014he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business.\" Despite Wallerstein's stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing \"microgroove\" [[LP record]] format (sometimes written \"Lp\" in early advertisements), which rotated at 33\u2153 [[revolutions per minute]], to be the standard for the gramophone record for half a century. CBS research director Dr. [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer [[William Savory]] with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.<ref name=\"catalog1949\">{{cite book|title=Columbia Record Catalog 1949|publisher=Columbia Records Inc.|pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, as well as longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10\" LP reissue of ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', originally released on March 4, 1946 as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. [[Sinatra]] was arguably Columbia's hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'' was also considered to be the first genuine ''[[concept album]]''. Since the term \"LP\" has come to refer to the 12-inch {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other \"LP's\" listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children's records.<ref name=\"catalog1949\"/> The Library of Congress (Washington DC) now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP in June 1948.<ref>Library of Congress Columbia Records Paperwork Box 121</ref> The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.\n\nColumbia's LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music's longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Bruno Walter]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The success of these recordings eventually persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival  RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January, 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. [[Decca Records]] in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.\n\nAn \"original cast recording\" of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia's Broadway albums.<ref>Sony liner notes</ref>  Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.\n\nMany album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper \"slicks,\" one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.\n\nColumbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the \"paste-over\" front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and \"pasted over\" by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over.\n\n===The 1950s===\n[[File:ATeenageLoveAffair.JPG|thumbnail|left|Columbia used this label for its 45 r.p.m. records from 1951 until 1958.]]\n\nIn 1951, Columbia US began issuing records in the 45 rpm format RCA Victor had introduced two years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubby.net/worldofcubby/RCR/record_history.html |title=Record Collector's Resource: A History of Records |publisher=Cubby.net |date=February 26, 1917 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The same year, Ted Wallerstein retired as Columbia Records chairman;<ref name=\"Inc.1970\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=September 26, 1970|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=10|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and Columbia US also severed its decades-long distribution arrangement with EMI and signed a distribution deal with [[Philips Records]] to market Columbia recordings outside North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/bbe12043 |title=Mitch Miller And His Orchestra And Chorus - Mitch Miller - Philips - UK |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> EMI continued to distribute Okeh and later Epic label recordings until 1968.

(Miller was a classically trained oboist who had been a friend of Columbia executive Goddard Lieberson since their days at the [[Eastman School of Music]] in the 1930s.)<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), p. 62</ref> Miller quickly signed up Mercury's biggest artist at the time, [[Frankie Laine]], and discovered several of the decade's biggest recording stars including [[Tony Bennett]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Jimmy Boyd]], [[Guy Mitchell]] (whose stage surname was taken from Miller's first name), [[Johnnie Ray]], [[The Four Lads]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Jerry Vale]] and [[Johnny Mathis]].

Columbia continued to use the \"notes and mike\" logo on record labels and even used a promo label showing both logos until the \"notes and mike\" was phased out (along with the 78 in the US) in 1958. In Canada, Columbia 78s were pressed with the \"Walking Eye\" logo in 1958.

Under new head producer [[George Avakian]], Columbia became the most vital label to the general public's appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian's prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of America's indigenous art, releasing the most important LP's by the music's founding father, [[Louis Armstrong]], but also signing to long-term contracts  [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Miles Davis]], the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain\u2014more than a half century later\u2014among the best-selling jazz albums by any label\u2014viz., ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'' by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of the \"500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231| title = Kind of Blue\n| date = February 9, 2003| accessdate = April 11, 2012| magazine = Rollingstone.com}}</ref> With another producer, [[Teo Macero]], a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz giants [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charles Mingus]], while Macero became a key agent in recording and representing\u2014through attention-grabbing, colorful\u2014albums the protean faces of Miles Davis\u2014from leading exponent of [[cool jazz]] and an explorer of the art of [[modal jazz]] through his sextet's 1958 album ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds\u2014commonly known as [[jazz fusion]].\n\n1954 was the eventful year of Columbia's embracing small-group modern jazz\u2014first, in the signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''. Contemporaneously with Columbia's first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet's debut on the label, was a [[Time Magazine]] cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck's success on college campuses. The humble [[Dave Brubeck]] demurred, saying that the second [[Time Magazine]] cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured [[Louis Armstrong]]'s picture) had been earned by [[Duke Ellington]], not himself. Within two years Ellington's picture would appear on the cover of [[Time Magazine]], following his \"wild\" success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. [[Ellington at Newport]], recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist's best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on [[Time Magazine]] were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist [[Thelonious Monk]] would be afforded the same honor.)\n\nColumbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956 when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the [[Capitol Records]] product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the [[Coronet Records|CBS Coronet]] label.\n\nIn the same year, former Columbia A&R manager [[Goddard Lieberson]] was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, as well as the company's various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation's music division soon overtook [[RCA Victor]] as the top recording company in the world, boasting a star-studded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&R manager in 1938, was noted for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality, overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles, as well as championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had very limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton von Webern]]. One of his first major successes was the original cast soundtrack of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32 million in profits.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nIn October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of \"Greatest Hits\" packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, [[Jo Stafford]], Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and [[the Four Lads]]; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation as well as that of [[Marty Robbins]]. Only Mathis' compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'''s album charts]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1200-1299) 1958-1959|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist's career was in decline.\n\n====Stereo====\n\nAlthough Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia's first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (oratorio)|Messiah]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Westminster Choir]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (recorded on December 31, 1956, on {{1/2}}-inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine). Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Bruno Walter]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by [[Eugene Ormandy]], who also recorded an abridged ''Messiah'' for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia's famous New York City studios. [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to [[Columbia Masterworks Records]].\n\nColumbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It wasn't until September 1958, that Columbia started simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono records sold to the general public were subsequently discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the \"Adventures in Sound\" series that showcased music from around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Billboard|date=January 6, 1958|title=Columbia's 1958 Tee-Off Cues Big Product Campaign: Program Set to Tie in with LP Disk's 10th Anniversary Year|url=|journal=Billboard|volume=|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi Living : The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=283\u2013297|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nAs far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match ''Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]'', the [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]] album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched.\n\nPop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.\n\n===The 1960s===\n====Outing of \"deep groove\"====\nBy the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The \"deep groove\" pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center \"block\" to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small \"ledge\" where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 12 (CL 1600-1699/CS 8400-8499) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====CBS Records====\n{{see also|CBS Records International}}\n[[File:CBSRecords.png|thumbnail|125px|right|CBS Records logo outside of the United States]]\n\nIn 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, CBS Records, in 1962, which released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain).<ref name=\"Inc.1963\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n37 40]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], outside North America.

This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the \"ledge\" variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small \"CBS\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 13 (CL 1700-1799/CS 8500-8598) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June, 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1800-1899/CS 8600-8699) 1960-1961|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nColumbia's Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.<ref name=\"Inc.1963\"/>\n\nWith the formation of [[CBS Records International]], CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia. In 1960 CBS took over its distributor in Australia and New Zealand, the [[Australian Record Company]] (founded in 1936) including [[Coronet Records]], one of the leading Australian independent recording and distribution companies of the day. The CBS Coronet label was replaced by the CBS label with the 'walking eye' logo in 1963. ARC continued trading under that name until the late 1970s when it formally changed its business name to CBS Australia.\n\n====Mitch Miller on television====\nIn 1961, Columbia's music repertoire was given an enormous boost when [[Mitch Miller]], its A&R manager and bandleader, became the host of the variety series ''[[Sing Along with Mitch]]'' on NBC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957153|title=Remembering Singing Along With Mitch Miller|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}</ref> The show was based on Miller's 'folksy' but appealing 'chorus' style performance of popular standards.

His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] and [[The Turtles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html|title=Peter, Paul and Mary: Top songs of all time|last=Willis|first=Amy|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the [[folk rock]] genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\". In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to [[Electric Dylan controversy|'go electric']] and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group [[The Band]] which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by [[Manfred Mann]] (\"[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]\") and [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]] & Trinity (\"[[This Wheel's On Fire]]\"). Dylan's late 1960s albums ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' became cornerstone recordings of the emergent [[country rock]] genre and influenced The Byrds and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]].\n\n====Converting mono====\nColumbia's engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process \"Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo\". In the June 16, 1962, issue of ''Billboard'' magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue \"rechanneled\" versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.\n\nColumbia's rechanneling process involved a slight time delay and some bass-treble separation between channels. RCA Victor and Capitol (\"[[Duophonic]]\") used similar processes, but the relatively large delay between channels resulted in a sound that has been described by collectors as \"messy\" (Duophonic) or \"garbage can echo\" (RCA Victor). Columbia's rechanneling resulted in a sound similar to reverb, though some found it annoying.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Rock and roll====\nWhen the [[British Invasion]] arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], who was signed in 1963 as the label's first major rock star, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] who were also signed in 1963. The label released a [[merseybeat]] album, ''The Exciting New Liverpool Sound'' (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). [[Terry Melcher]], son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving \"Don't Make My Baby Blue\" for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.\n\nMelcher and [[Bruce Johnston]] discovered and brought to Columbia [[The Rip Chords]], a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in \"Here I Stand\", a remake of the song by [[Wade Flemons]], and \"[[Hey Little Cobra]]\". Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as \"Bruce & Terry\" and later as \"The Rogues\".

Miller's disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia's A&R policy. The label's only significant \"pop\" acts at the time were Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Paul Revere & The Raiders and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&B artists, among them [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"bsn17\" /> Most historians noted that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&B genre, which led to her leaving the label for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller's singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5 million annually.<ref name=\"hitmen\" /> Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis's fortuitous decision to attend the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], where he spotted and signed several leading acts including [[Janis Joplin]]. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept \nMiles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', pioneered a [[Jazz fusion|fusion of jazz and rock music]].<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| title = Bitches Brew| author = Jurek, Thom| accessdate = April 11, 2012| publisher = Allmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nA San Francisco group called [[Moby Grape]] had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released [[Moby Grape (album)|their debut album]], along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following [[D-Day]]. The album hit made #24 on the [[Billboard 200]], but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being \"Omaha,\" which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, \"Hey Grandma,\" only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.\n\n====Simon & Garfunkel====\nArguably the most commercially successful Columbia pop act of this period, other than Bob Dylan, was Simon & Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 when CBS producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], inspired by the folk-rock experiments of The Byrds and others, added drums and bass to the duo's earlier recording of \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had already broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and [[Paul Simon]] had relocated to the UK, where he famously only found out about the single being a hit via the music press. The dramatic success of the song prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the [[folk-rock]] boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, \"[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]\", but progress slowed during 1966-67 as Simon struggled with writer's block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]''. The resulting single, \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\", became a smash hit. Both ''The Graduate'' soundtrack and Simon & Garfunkel's next studio album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'', were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.<ref name=\"bridge\">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Bridge Over Troubled Water|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush====\nDavis lured artists [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Tom Rush]] to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as \"the pop treatment\" by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for [[Horizon Records|Horizon]], then [[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]]. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like \"[[Greenback Dollar]],\" with hard rock songs for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], such as \"[[The Pusher]]\", which was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album ''My Griffin Is Gone'' was described as \"the poster child for 'overproduced,' full of all kinds of instruments and even strings\".<ref name=\"bsn27\">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 27 (K)CS 9000-9999 (1969-1970)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" and \"[[Never Been to Spain]],\" which became hits for [[Three Dog Night]] on [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]]. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.\n\nTom Rush had always been the \"storyteller\" or \"balladeer\" type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. As with Axton, Rush was given \"the treatment\" on [[Tom Rush (1970 album)|his self-titled Columbia debut]]. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done \"tastefully\", of course, but was not really on par with Rush's audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: {{cquote|Well, when you're in the studio, they bring out all these \"sweeteners\" and things they have, and while you're there, you say, yeah, that sounds good. But then you get the album home and you almost can't hear yourself under all that.<ref name=\"bsn27\" />}} Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his [[Wrong End of the Rainbow|next]] [[Merrimack County (album)|three]] [[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|albums]] for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.\n\n===The 1970s===\n====Catalog numbers====\nThe Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the [[Patti Page]] album ''Honey Come Back''. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957-58, although the prefix was now different. In July, 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C=Columbia, E=[[Epic Records|Epic]], M=[[Columbia Masterworks]], Y=[[Odyssey Records|Columbia Odyssey]], and Z=every other label that CBS distributed.  The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets\u2014or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-lps-us.html|title=CBS LPs - US unified numbering system|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> The first CBS album released under the new system was [[Elvin Bishop|The Elvin Bishop Group]]'s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with 30001, while the first actual Columbia release under the system was [[Herschel Bernardi]]'s ''Show Stopper'', assigned with C 30004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html|title=LP Discography for CBS Records US combined numbering system 30000-30499|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to ''[[Sesame Street discography|The Sesame Street Book and Record]]''. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters, which continued until 2005.\n\n====Quadraphonics====\nIn September 1970, under the guidance of [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the [[Automatt]]) and establishing an A&R head and office in San Francisco at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], headed by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], a producer and artist for [[Monument Records]] (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of [[Nils Lofgren]] and [[Roy Buchanan]]. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=If These Halls Could Talk: A Historical Tour Through San Francisco Recording Studios |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat |url-access=registration |last=Johnson |first=Heather |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat/page/n104 90]\u201394 |isbn=1-59863-141-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Columbia began recording in a four-channel process called [[quadraphonic]], using the \"SQ\" (Stereo Quadraphonic) standard that used an electronic encoding process that could be decoded by special amplifiers and then played through four speakers, with each speaker placed in the corner of a room. Remarkably, RCA countered with another quadraphonic process that required a special cartridge to play the \"discrete\" recordings for four-channel playback. Both Columbia and RCA's quadraphonic records could be played on conventional stereo equipment. Although the Columbia process required less equipment and was quite effective, many were confused by the competing systems and sales of both Columbia's matrix recordings and RCA's discrete recordings were disappointing. A few other companies also issued some matrix recordings for a few years. Quadraphonic recording was used by both classical artists, including [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Boulez]], and popular artists such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[The Clash]] and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. Columbia even released a soundtrack album of the movie version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' in quadraphonic. Many of these recordings were later remastered and released in Dolby surround sound on CD.\n\n====Yetnikoff becomes president====\nIn 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Frederic Dannen, the  shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher's words) \"wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud\". In Dannen's view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a \"record man\" (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists' intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a \"colourful character\".<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.19</ref> Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: \"He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building.\"<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd.<ref name=ce /> The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for [[French language|French-language]] recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began [[digital recording]] in a recording session of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], in New York (using [[3M]]'s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).\n\n====Dick Asher vs \"The Network\"====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\nCBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed [[Philadelphia International Records]], [[Blue Sky Records]], the [[Isley Brothers]]' [[T-Neck Records]] and [[Monument Records]] (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979 CBS had a pre-tax income of $51 million and sales of over $1 billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.\n\nTo deal with the crisis, CEO [[John Backe]] promoted [[Dick Asher]] from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher's experience. In 1972 Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher's loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.\n\nAsher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. \"Indies\" had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records' expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10 million per year. When Asher took over CBS' UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as \"The Network\", and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian [[Frederic Dannen]] estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 ''per song'' to the \"Network\" promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80 million annually.\n\nDuring this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the [[Pink Floyd]] single \"[[Another Brick In The Wall]]\", and its parent album ''[[The Wall]]'' would spend four months at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network - by ''not'' paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single. The results were immediate and deeply troubling - not one of the major radio stations in Los Angeles would program the record, despite the fact that the group was in town, performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate [[The Wall Tour (1980\u201381)|The Wall Tour]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that \"The Network\" was in effect a huge [[extortion]] racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime - a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the \"indies\" and declared them to be \"mensches\". But Dick Asher now knew that The Network's real power lay in their ability to ''prevent'' records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new [[payola]] scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the Federal Communications Commission could even revoke CBS' all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 4-27</ref>\n\n===The 1980s and sale to Sony===\n\nThe structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.\n\nIn 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by [[Sony]], which re-christened the parent division [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991.

The 30th Street Studio had unique sonic characteristics, thanks to its soaring one-hundred-foot vaulted ceiling, exposed timber beams, plaster walls and unvarnished wooden floor. When Columbia took over the property, then head of A&R [[Mitch Miller]] (a musician himself) recognised its singular acoustic properties and declared that the hall was to be left \"untouched by human hands\". He posted detailed standing orders to all staff to control the maintenance and cleaning of the space, even down to the changing of light bulbs, ordering that the curtains and other fittings were never to be touched, that no painting was allowed, and especially that the wooden floor could only be swept or vacuumed, and was never under any circumstances to be mopped with water, for fear that this might alter the room's resonant and reflective properties.<ref>Milner, Greg, ''Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of recorded Music'', Granta Books, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-84708-140-7}}), p. 149</ref> CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright and it gave up its lease and closed the studio in 1982. In spite of the building's inherent heritage status and its cultural significance, it was sold to developers in 1985, demolished, and replaced by a high-rise apartment complex.\n\n; Liederkranz Hall Studio\nColumbia also recorded in the highly respected Liederkranz Hall, at 111 East 58th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, in New York City, it was  built by and formerly belonged to a German cultural and musical society, [[Liederkranz of the City of New York|The Liederkranz Society]], and used as a recording studio ([[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] also recorded in Liederkranz Hall in the late 1920s).<ref name=\"SIMONS\"/><ref>[http://www.liederkranznycity.org/history.asp \"History of The Liederkranz of the City of New York\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727031333/http://www.liederkranznycity.org/history.asp |date=July 27, 2011 }} - The Liederkranz of the City of New York website.

The IIHF countered by threatening to withdraw hockey from the Games if the AHAUS was banned. The IOC suggested that both American teams be banned but the Swiss Olympic Organizing Committee rejected this proposal. The IOC decided to switch hockey to an unofficial event but relented when a compromise was reached. The AHAUS team was allowed to compete but would not be considered an official participant or allowed to win a medal. The AAU team marched in the opening ceremony and then left Switzerland.

In Israel, it is a national memorial day. The first official commemorations took place in 1951, and the observance of the day was anchored in a law passed by the [[Knesset]] in 1959.

The day was marked by the burial in a Jerusalem cemetery of ashes and bones of thousands of Jews brought from the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]] and religious ceremonies held in honor of the victims. A radio program on the Holocaust was broadcast that evening. The following year, in December 1950, the Rabbinate, organizations of former European Jewish communities and the [[Israel Defense Forces]] held memorial ceremonies around the country; they mostly involved funerals, in which objects such as desecrated [[Torah]] scrolls and the bones and ashes of the dead brought from Europe were interred.\n<ref name=RemDayHist>{{cite news|last1=Gilad|first1=Elon|title=The History of Holocaust Remembrance Day|url=https://www.haaretz.com/the-history-of-holocaust-remembrance-day-1.5246317|accessdate=January 17, 2018|work=Ha'Aretz|date=April 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, the Knesset began deliberations to choose a date for Holocaust Remembrance Day.

The [[siddur]]im of these groups add passages that are meant to be added to standard weekday service, as well as stand-alone sections.  These liturgies generally include:\n* Lighting of a candle (often each member of the congregation lights one)\n* Modern poems, including \"I believe in the sun even when it is not shining...\"\n* El Malei Rahamim (God, full of mercy, dwelling on high)\n* [[Mourner's Kaddish]]\n\nIn response to the lack of liturgy dedicated to Yom HaShoah, Daniel Gross composed, in 2009, ''I Believe: A Shoah Requiem'', a complete musical liturgy dedicated to the observance of Yom HaShoah. An a cappella oratorio scored for cantor, soprano solo, adult chorus and children's chorus, ''I Believe'' features several traditional prayer texts such as the Mourner's Kaddish (''Kaddish Yatom'') and the ''El Malei'' memorial prayer, and also includes the poetry of Paul Celan and Primo Levi.

A dedicated yahrzeit candle was conceived, with yellow wax and a barbed-wire Star of David logo reminiscent of the armbands Jews were forced to wear during the Holocaust.

A radio program on the Holocaust was broadcast that evening. The following year, in December 1950, the Rabbinate, organizations of former European Jewish communities and the [[Israel Defense Forces]] held memorial ceremonies around the country; they mostly involved funerals, in which objects such as desecrated [[Torah]] scrolls and the bones and ashes of the dead brought from Europe were interred.\n<ref name=RemDayHist>{{cite news|last1=Gilad|first1=Elon|title=The History of Holocaust Remembrance Day|url=https://www.haaretz.com/the-history-of-holocaust-remembrance-day-1.5246317|accessdate=January 17, 2018|work=Ha'Aretz|date=April 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, the Knesset began deliberations to choose a date for Holocaust Remembrance Day.

Jewish schools also hold Holocaust-related educational programs on or near Yom HaShoah.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yom Hashoah: Holocaust Memorial Day|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/yom-hashoah-holocaust-memorial-day/|website=My Jewish Learning.|accessdate=January 17, 2018|date=2018}}</ref><ref name=\"JVL-YH\">{{cite web|title=Jewish Holidays: Yom HaShoah \u2013 Holocaust Memorial Day|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/yom-ha-shoah-holocaust-memorial-day|website=Jewish Virtual Library|date=2018}}</ref>\n\nCommemorations typically include memorial services and communal vigils and educational programs. These programs often include talks by Holocaust survivors (although this is becoming less common as time passes and there are fewer survivors who remain alive), candle-lighting ceremonies, the recitation of [[El Malei Rachamim|memorial prayers]], the [[Kaddish#Mourner's Kaddish|Mourner's Kaddish]] and appropriate songs and readings.

Print.</ref> have developed similar liturgies to be used on Yom HaShoah. The [[siddur]]im of these groups add passages that are meant to be added to standard weekday service, as well as stand-alone sections.  These liturgies generally include:\n* Lighting of a candle (often each member of the congregation lights one)\n* Modern poems, including \"I believe in the sun even when it is not shining...\"\n* El Malei Rahamim (God, full of mercy, dwelling on high)\n* [[Mourner's Kaddish]]\n\nIn response to the lack of liturgy dedicated to Yom HaShoah, Daniel Gross composed, in 2009, ''I Believe: A Shoah Requiem'', a complete musical liturgy dedicated to the observance of Yom HaShoah. An a cappella oratorio scored for cantor, soprano solo, adult chorus and children's chorus, ''I Believe'' features several traditional prayer texts such as the Mourner's Kaddish (''Kaddish Yatom'') and the ''El Malei'' memorial prayer, and also includes the poetry of Paul Celan and Primo Levi. On April 7, 2013, ''I Believe'' had its world premiere<ref>[http://www.theoaklandpress.com/general-news/20130405/sound-check-interfaith-shoah-requiem-at-orchestra-hall Gary Graff.

Fisher Music Center in Detroit, Michigan.\n\n===Orthodox Judaism===\nWhile there are Orthodox Jews who commemorate the Holocaust on Yom HaShoah, others in the Orthodox community, especially [[Haredim]], including [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]], remember the victims of the Holocaust on traditional days of mourning that were already in place before the [[Holocaust]], such as [[Tisha B'Av]] in the summer, and the [[Tenth of Tevet]] in the winter, because in the Jewish tradition the month of Nisan is considered a joyous month associated with [[Passover]] and messianic redemption.  Some ultra-Orthodox rabbis recommend adding ''piyyutim'' (religious poems) about the Holocaust to the liturgy of Tisha B\u2019Av; some adherents follow this advice.<ref name=\"MJL\">{{cite web|title=Yom Hashoah: Holocaust Memorial Day|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/yom-hashoah-holocaust-memorial-day/|website=My Jewish Learning|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Feinstein |first = Moshe |title = Igros Moshe, Volume 8, Yoreh Deah, Siman 57| year = 1996| location = New York|page = 289|isbn =}}</ref>\n\n===Conservative Judaism===\n\n[[File:Yom Hashoah candle.jpg|thumb|200px|A lit Yom HaShoah Yellow Candle]]In 1981, members of the Federation of Jewish Men's Clubs FJMC, a branch of the mainstream Conservative/Masorti movement, created a special memorial project specifically for Yom HaShoah.  A dedicated yahrzeit candle was conceived, with yellow wax and a barbed-wire Star of David logo reminiscent of the armbands Jews were forced to wear during the Holocaust.  This object has come to be known as the Yellow Candle (TM).  Approximately 200,000 candles are distributed around the world each year, along with relevant prayers and meditations.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1984, Conservative [[Rabbi]] [[David Golinkin]] wrote an article in ''[[Conservative Judaism]]'' journal suggesting a program of observance for the holiday, including fasting.  In his article he noted that while private fasts are indeed prohibited during the month of Nisan (a major Orthodox objection to the placement of the day), communal fasts for tragedies befalling Jewish communities had indeed been declared throughout the pre-Modern period.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nAnother prominent Conservative Jewish figure shared the Orthodox sentiment about not adopting Yom HaShoah. [[Ismar Schorsch]], former Chancellor of [[Conservative Judaism]]'s [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] held that Holocaust commemoration should take place on [[Tisha b'Av]].<ref name=\"JVL\">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/yomhashoah.html|title=Holocaust Memorial Day (Yom Ha-Shoah)|year=2011|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Masorti (Conservative) movement in Israel has created ''[[Megillat HaShoah]]'', a scroll and liturgical reading for Yom HaShoah.  This publication was a joint project of Jewish leaders in Israel, the United States and Canada.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 2011, the FJMC introduced a related Yellow Candle concept for use on ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (The Night of Shattered Glass), November 9\u201310, commemorating the first organised Nazi [[pogrom]] of Jews in 1938, and other important Shoah commemoration dates. Called the Ner Katan, FJMC's new version consists of six Yellow Candles provided for communal observances and ceremonies.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nMore recently Conservative rabbis and lay leaders in the US, Israel and Canada collaborated to write ''[[Megillat Hashoah]]'' (The Holocaust Scroll). It contains personal recollections of Holocaust survivors. A [[responsum]] was written by Rabbi [[David Golinkin]] expressing the view that not only is it legitimate for the modern Jewish community to write a new scroll of mourning, it was also incumbent to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schechter.edu/insightIsrael.aspx?ID=34|title=Megillat HaShoah: The Holocaust Scroll|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719181539/http://www.schechter.edu/insightIsrael.aspx?ID=34|archivedate=July 19, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Reform Judaism===\nReform Jewish congregations have tended to commemorate the memory of the Holocaust either on&nbsp;[[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]]'''&nbsp;'''or on Yom HaShoah.

As a result, there were 22 provinces in China (Outer China and [[China proper]]) near the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]].\n\n===ROC provinces (1912\u20131949)===\nThe [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], established in 1912, set up four more provinces in [[Inner Mongolia]] and two provinces in historic [[Tibet]], bringing the total to 28. In 1931, [[Ma Zhongying]] established [[Hexi Province|Hexi]] in the northern parts of Gansu but the ROC never acknowledged the province. However, China lost four provinces with the establishment of the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in [[Manchuria]]. After the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]] in 1945, China re-incorporated Manchuria as 10 provinces, and assumed control of Taiwan as a province. As a result, the Republic of China in 1946 had 35 provinces. Although the Republic of China now only controls one province ([[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]), and some islands of a second province ([[Fujian]]), it continues to formally claim all 35 provinces (including those that no longer form part of the area of the People's Republic of China).\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Andong Province|Andong]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5b89\u6771\u7701}})

The committee secretary is first-in-charge of the province; second-in-command is the governor of the provincial government.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) claims the island of Taiwan and its surrounding islets, including Penghu, as \"[[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan Province]]\", though Taiwan has not been under control of a government that ruled from mainland China since 1949, when the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] lost the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China]], which established the PRC. ([[Kinmen]] and the [[Matsu Islands]] are claimed by the PRC as part of its Fujian Province. [[Pratas Islands|Pratas]] and [[Taiping Island|Taiping]] are claimed by the PRC as part of Guangdong and Hainan provinces respectively.) The territory is controlled by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC, commonly called \"Taiwan\").\n\n=== Municipality===\n{{Main|Direct-administered municipalities of China}}\n\nA municipality ({{zh |s = \u76f4\u8f96\u5e02 |t = \u76f4\u8f44\u5e02 |p = zh\u00edxi\u00e1sh\u00ec |l = direct-administrated city |links = no }}) or municipality directly under the administration of the central government is a higher level of city which is directly under the Chinese government, with status equal to that of the provinces. In practice, their political status is higher than that of common provinces.\n\n=== Autonomous region ===\n{{Main|Autonomous regions of China}}\n\nAn autonomous region ({{zh |s = \u81ea\u6cbb\u533a |t = \u81ea\u6cbb\u5340 |p = z\u00eczh\u00ecq\u016b |links = no }}) is a minority subject which has a higher population of a particular minority ethnic group along with its own local government, but an autonomous region theoretically has more legislative rights than in actual practice. The governor of each autonomous region is usually appointed from the respective minority ethnic group.\n\n=== Special administrative region (SAR) ===\n{{Main|Special administrative regions of China}}\n\nA special administrative region (SAR) ({{zh |s = \u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a |t = \u7279\u5225\u884c\u653f\u5340 |p = t\u00e8bi\u00e9 x\u00edngzh\u00e8ngq\u016b |links = no }}) is a highly autonomous and self-governing sub national subject of the People's Republic of China that is directly under the Central People's Government. Each SAR has a chief executive as head of the region and head of government. The region's government is not fully independent, as foreign policy and military defence are the responsibility of the central government, according to the basic laws.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== List of province-level divisions ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!colspan=9|{{PRC provinces big imagemap alt}}\n|-\n!align=\"center\"|[[Guobiao|GB/T 2260-2007]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/work/design/chinastdb_1210.doc# |title=GB/T 2260 codes for the provinces of China |access-date=2011-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040305025950/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis/work/design/chinastdb_1210.doc# |archive-date=2004-03-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n!align=\"center\"|[[ISO 3166-2:CN|ISO]]<ref>[[ISO 3166-2:CN]] ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 3166-2|3166-2]] codes for the provinces of China)</ref>\n!align=\"left\"|Province\n!align=\"left\"|Chinese<br />Hanyu Pinyin\n!align=\"left\"|Capital\n!align=\"right\"|Population{{efn|as of 2010}}\n!align=\"right\"|Density{{efn|per km<sup>2</sup>}}\n!align=\"right\"|Area{{efn|km<sup>2</sup>}}\n!align=\"center\" class=\"alphabetical\"| Abbreviation{{efn|Abbreviation in the parentheses is informal}}\n|-\n{{tent division chn 1|[[Anhui|Anhui Province]]                   |{{zh|labels=no|s=\u5b89\u5fbd\u7701}}|{{lang|zh-hant|\u5b89\u5fbd\u7701}}|\u0100nhu\u012b Sh\u011bng   |{{lang|zh|\u7696}}  |CN-AH|9696ff| |[[Hefei]]       | 59,500,510| 425.91|139,700|AH|W\u01cen}}\n{{tent division chn 1|[[Beijing|Beijing Municipality]]|{{zh|labels=no|s=\u5317\u4eac\u5e02}}|{{lang|zh-hant|\u5317\u4eac\u5e02}}|B\u011bij\u012bng Sh\u00ec|{{lang|zh|\u4eac}}|CN-BJ|ff8585||''Beijing''|19,612,368|1,167.40|16,800|BJ|J\u012bng}}\n{{tent division chn 1|[[Chongqing|Chongqing Municipality]]           |\u91cd\u5e86\u5e02|\u91cd\u6176\u5e02|Ch\u00f3ngq\u00ecng Sh\u00ec|{{lang|zh|\u6e1d}}    |CN-CQ|ff8585| |''Chongqing''| 28,846,170| 350.50|82,300|CQ|Y\u00fa}}\n|- style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"{{tent division chn 1|[[Fujian|Fujian Province]]{{efn|Most of the Fujian Province is administered by the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] while the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (ROC)]] retains control of the [[Kinmen County]] (Quemoy) and [[Matsu Islands|Lienchiang County]] (Matsu) under its own streamlined [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian Province]].}}|{{zh|labels=no|s=\u798f\u5efa\u7701}}|{{lang|zh-hant|\u798f\u5efa\u7701}}|F\u00faji\u00e0n Sh\u011bng  |{{lang|zh|\u95fd}}  |CN-FJ|9696ff| |[[Fuzhou]] (PRC)<br>[[Jincheng, Kinmen|Jincheng]] (ROC){{efn|The [[Fujian Provincial Government]] was formed on 1 May 1927 and the provincial government was relocated from [[Fuzhou|Foochow]] to Kinmen, then [[Xindian District|Hsintien Township]] and [[New Taipei City|Taipei County]] within [[Taiwan Province]] in 1956 before moving back to Kinmen on 15 January 1996.

Anhui were originally one province called Jiangnan, with its capital at Nanjing.

In 1931, [[Ma Zhongying]] established [[Hexi Province|Hexi]] in the northern parts of Gansu but the ROC never acknowledged the province. However, China lost four provinces with the establishment of the Japanese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in [[Manchuria]]. After the defeat of Japan in [[World War II]] in 1945, China re-incorporated Manchuria as 10 provinces, and assumed control of Taiwan as a province. As a result, the Republic of China in 1946 had 35 provinces. Although the Republic of China now only controls one province ([[Taiwan Province|Taiwan]]), and some islands of a second province ([[Fujian]]), it continues to formally claim all 35 provinces (including those that no longer form part of the area of the People's Republic of China).\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Andong Province|Andong]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5b89\u6771\u7701}})

At the conclusion of this moving service of Dedication, Sir Frederic turned to Charles Prior, Head Boy of the College, and handed him a large silver key. \"You are to look after the monument and this consecrated ground on which we now stand\", he told Prior. \"You have in keeping the memory of many men who made the supreme sacrifice.\n\nTheir memory and what they died for will live forever as the generations come and go\". Later that month the first Ceremony of the Key was held as Prior passed his charge on to the 1925 Custodian and a new tradition was born.\n\nceremony-of-the-key-13Every year since, a member of the incoming Matriculation Class has been elected by popular vote of his fellows as the Custodian of the Key for one year and the handing-over ceremony is now a traditional part of Founders\u2019 Day proceedings.\n\nIn September 1939 the Officer Commanding of the Cadet Detachment, Colonel Tim Harvey, gave the ceremony its present form and authentic military flavour. The format has remained unaltered to this day. The Key is regarded as a symbol of guardianship of, and responsibility for, the traditions and values of Selborne. The \"Changing of Guard\", with the Grade 12 group handing custody to the Grade 11's symbolizes the passage of responsibility for, and leadership of the pupil body and all it holds dear, from those departing to those remaining.\n\nThose on parade at Founders\u2019 Day are all current pupils at the College.

The Founders\u2019 Day is strongly supported by visiting Old Boys and their families.\n\n==History==\nSelborne College was founded in 1872 by Pastor Heinrich Muller a German settler, and at that stage was known as the Panmure Public School. In 1880 the first recorded sporting engagement involving the school took place: a cricket match against [[Dale College Boys' High School|Dale College]] in King William's Town.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.selborne.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=1&Itemid=2 Selborne College \u2013 About Selborne<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 1892 another sporting milestone was reached when this school played its first rugby match. Again the opponents were Dale College.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nAfter Pastor Muller's resignation in 1896, John Young piloted the school through an eventful seven-year period that encompassed the Anglo-Boer War and saw the school move premises to Muir Street. It was under headmaster George Rattray, in 1907, that the school was named Selborne College in honour of the [[William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne|Second Earl of Selborne]], High Commissioner from 1905 to 1910, whose Selborne Memorandum became the blueprint for the Union of South Africa.\n\nThe Selborne family coat of arms and motto were adopted as the College badge and motto: Palma Virtuti ('Reward is to the Brave') underpins the approach to both the academic and extra-curricular activities of the school. By 1920 it became evident that the school was once again outgrowing its premises and in May 1922 the foundation stone was laid by Sir Frederic de Waal, Administrator of the Cape, on the present site of Selborne College.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nDr Rattray, when he handed over the reins to George Floyd at the beginning of 1931, had forged the character of Selborne. Under Floyd strong emphasis was laid on sporting as well as academic achievement and in the post-war years Selborne continued to maintain an impressive record of progress. Mr Floyd was succeeded by John Perry (1949\u20131958), after whom came Alan Barker (1959\u20131968).<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nJohn Stonier took over the reins of the school in 1969, and was succeeded by Tim Gordon (1981\u20131992), in whose final year the East London City Council presented the College with an illuminated address in recognition of the school's 120 years of service to the community. 1993 saw Alan (Sam) Gunn take over as headmaster until his retirement in November 2014. With 21 years service, Gunn is the longest serving headmaster in the College's history. The current headmaster Andrew Dewar was appointed in 2015 and is the first Old Selbornian <ref>[http://showme.co.za/east-london/news/new-selborne-college-headmaster/ New Selborne College headmaster]</ref> to fill the post having matriculated from Selborne College in 1988<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nToday, Selborne College is still heavily reliant on traditions; one of these is the Ceremony of the Key, instituted in 1924 at the unveiling of the War Memorial statue of the young soldier that stands in front of the school, and takes place on Founders' Day. With this ceremony, boys reaffirm their recognition of the achievements and sacrifices of the past and of their responsibilities to the future.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Traditions==\nOn 8 November 1924, Sir Frederic de Waal, then Administrator of the [[Cape Province]], unveiled the War Memorial which stands in front of the school. At the conclusion of his service of Dedication, Sir Frederic turned to Charles Prior, Head Boy of the College, and handed him a large silver key. \"You are to look after the monument and this consecrated ground on which we now stand\", he told Prior. \"You have in keeping the memory of many men who made the supreme sacrifice. Their memory and what they died for will live forever as the generations come and go\". Later that month the first Ceremony of the Key was held as Prior passed his charge on to the 1925 Custodian and a new tradition was born.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.selborne.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=68 Selborne College \u2013 Traditions<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nEvery year since, a member of the incoming Matriculation Class has been elected by popular vote of his fellows as the Custodian of the Key for one year and the handing-over ceremony is now a traditional part of Founders' Day proceedings.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn September 1939 the Officer Commanding of the Cadet Detachment, Colonel Tim Harvey, gave the ceremony its present form and authentic military flavour. The format has remained unaltered to this day. The Key is regarded as a symbol of guardianship of, and responsibility for, the traditions and values of Selborne.
