''Risk 2210 A.D.'' was designed by [[Rob Daviau]] and Craig Van Ness and first released in 2001. In 2002, it won the [[Origins Award]] for \"Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Board Game of 2001\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners |title=Origins Award Winners (2001) |publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design |accessdate=2007-10-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042430/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners |archivedate = 2008-02-02}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nThe boxed set includes:\n* 1 Earth Game Board, including land territories and water colonies.\n* 1 Moon Game Board\n* 5 different colored sets of playing pieces:\n** MODs (Machines of Destruction) in denomination sizes of 1, 3, and 5.\n** 4 Space Stations\n** The 5 commanders\n* Energy in denominations of 1s and 5s\n* 5 command card decks (1 for each type of commander)\n* 3 territory card decks, 1 for each type of territory (land, water, moon)\n* 5 Turn Order Markers\n* 4 Devastation Markers\n* 1 Score Chart\n* 6 and 8 sided dice, three of each black (attack dice), and two of each white (defense dice), 10 total dice\n\n===Box redesign===\n''2210 A.D.'' originally came packaged in a rectangular boxed set with a playing board that folded into fourths. At some point the design changed to a square, like the packaging for ''[[Risk Godstorm]]''. The board in the square box folds into sixths, the cardboard playing pieces are one-sided as opposed to being printed on both sides as they were for the rectangular box, and the Moon was printed on much thinner cardstock.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Setup===\nBefore the game, 4 cards are randomly selected from the land territory deck. Each of the 4 territory cards drawn will have a \"devastation marker\" placed on its corresponding territory on the earth game board. These territories are impassable for the rest of the game.\n\nEach player is allocated 3 energy chips before the game begins. The number of armies allocated to each player and the process of claiming territories is identical to the Standard [[Risk (game)|Risk]] board game, but the armies are called MODs; therefore, number of MODs allocated to each player at the beginning of the game depends on the number of players.  If three people are playing, each player counts out 35 MODs; four players, 30 MODs; five players, 25 MODs. Players then take turns claiming land territories by placing a 1.0 MOD on an unoccupied land territory until all the land territories are occupied. Players then take turns placing their remaining armies on their claimed land territories. Following MOD placement, each player places a space station, a land commander, and a diplomat on any of their claimed territories.\n\nWater and Lunar territories may not be claimed at the beginning of the game. Devastated land territories can not be claimed or occupied at any point during the game.\n\n===Determining turn order===\nThe game is limited to five rounds called years. At the beginning of each year, players use energy chips they have accumulated to bid for turn order through a [[First-price sealed-bid auction]] format. Player secretly bid energy by placing the corresponding of energy chips they would bid into a closed hand. Players open their hands containing their bids simultaneously. The highest bidder selects which turn order he/she wants, then the next highest bidder, and so on. The highest bidder may select any turn the player wants, the player is not limited to \"first.\"\n\n===Ending game===\nAfter each player has completed his turn, a year is considered to have passed. At the end of year 5, each player's score is calculated based on the number of territories the player owns, colonies the player holds, and the number of colony influence cards the player has the commanders to activate. The player with the highest score wins.\n\n==Player Turn==\n\n===Turn order overview===\nAt the beginning of each player's turn, based on the number of countries the player owns and whole continents the player holds, the player gains additional MODs and energy. The player places the MODs and then has the opportunity to buy additional commanders, cards, and space stations. Then the player may play command cards that he has sufficient energy to activate. Next comes the attack phase in which, if the player successfully takes three contested territories, the player receives one bonus energy and one bonus command card. After the attack phase, the player may move one group of units from any one of the player's territories to any other territory the player occupies, so long as both territories are connected by a path of his own territories.\n\n===Collection of Energy and Deployment of MODs===\nSimilar to the obtaining reinforcements in classic [[Risk (game)|Risk]], players receive additional MODs and Energy at the beginning of their turn.  The number of MODs received is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the number of territories a player owns, a players colony bonuses, and the number of space stations a player controls. Players divide their total number of territories, regardless of type, by three and receive that number of MODs rounded down to the nearest integer. If this result is less than three, round up to three MODs. The Score Chart is designed to aide players in this task. Additionally, players receive colony bonuses by occupying all the territories in a land, water, or lunar colony at the beginning of their turn. This is similar to continental bonuses in classic [[Risk (game)|Risk]]. These MODs are dispersed among the player's controlled territories as the he/she chooses. Players also place one MOD on each of territory that contain a Space Station he/she controls.\n\nPlayers receive Energy equal to the number of MODs received at this point in the turn.\n\n===Commanders and Space Stations===\nAfter players have Collected Energy and Deployed their MODs, players may purchase Commanders and Space Stations. Commanders cost three energy while space stations cost five energy.\n\nOne of the biggest differences from classic ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'' is the addition of commanders: land, naval, space, [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]], and [[diplomacy|diplomat]]. These fill a number of roles. Their most basic function is to act as an improved army unit, enabling players to roll eight-sided [[dice]] rather than the typical six-sided ones. This is explained more thoroughly in the next section. Space and Naval commanders allow movement into Moon or Water territories respectively.<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Risk 2210 game board 02.jpg|thumb|left|Players may battle for control of the Moon]]  -->\n\n===Command Cards===\nPerhaps one of the most important functions of the commanders is allowing the purchase and use of commander cards. After players have purchased and placed their commanders or space station, players may purchase a maximum of four commander cards at a cost of one energy per card. Players may only purchase commander cards if he/she has the corresponding Commander in play. The text of the commander card will illustrate when the card may, or must, be played. Many of the Commander cards have energy costs that must be paid if the card is to be put into play.\n\nEach commander deck adds its own strategic elements to the game. Diplomat Cards tend to be low cost cards that increase unit mobility or place a negative effect on other players. Land Cards tend to be low cost cards that increase the number of MODs available to a player. Naval Cards tends to have the emphasize energy gain. The Nuclear Deck contains relatively higher cost cards with sweeping global effects. Space Cards tend to be a mixture of the elements already described.\nIf an Armageddon card is played, then even if your nuclear commander is destroyed mid turn you can finish playing the nuclear card.\n\n===Invading territories===\nThree major elements differentiate invasion in Risk 2210 A.D. from classic [[Risk (game)|Risk]]: limitations in which territories may be invaded, how commanders affect dice, and how space stations affect dice. Players may only invade Water or Lunar territories if they have the corresponding commander in play. Additionally Lunar territories can only be invaded from the Earth game board by a territory containing a space station. Only three of the territories on the Moon game board can be invaded into from the Earth game board. These are the Sea of Crisis, Tycho, and Bay of Dew. Players can not invade from the moon to earth without the \"Invading Earth\" card found in the Space Deck.\n\nIf no commanders are attacking or defending a territory, play continues identically to classical [[Risk (game)| Risk]]. However, defending players may defend their territories using an 8-sided die instead of a 6-sided die if a commander is present in that territory. If two commanders are present in a defending territory, the defender may substitute both of the 6-sided dice used in defense for two 8-sided dice. This is true regardless of commander type for defending.\n\nSubstitution of 6-sided dice with 8-sided dice for invading players is contingent on the type of territory that player is invading into/from and the type of commander that player is invading into. The following table is provided in the Risk 2210 A.D. Gameplay Manual.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; text-align:left\"\n|-\n! Commander\n! Roll 8-sided die when attacking\n|-\n| Diplomat\n| Never\n|-\n| Land\n| When invading from or into a land territory\n|-\n| Naval\n| When invading from or into a water territory\n|-\n| Space\n| When invading from or into a Lunar territory\n|-\n| Nuclear\n| Always\n|-\n| Tech (Frontline Expansion 2)\n| Never\n|}\n\nPlayers do not have to remove Commanders if they suffer a loss while using an 8-sided dice. Players may remove MODs from their corresponding invading or defending territories first. Commanders are removed from a defending player if an invading player destroys all MODs in an defending player's territory. Commanders may be repurchased.\n\nAll units in space stations, regardless of type, defend with 8-sided dice. If a territory with a Space Station is captured by an invading player, that Space Station is replaced with another of the invading players same color.\n\nSimilar to classic [[Risk (game)|Risk]], if an invading player captured three or more contested territories, territories defended by another player, the invading player receives one energy and one commander card. Commander cards received this way can only be chosen from Commanders that the invading player currently has in play.\n\n===Fortifying===\nA player may end his turn by fortifying. To fortify, a player moves as many units from one territory, and only one territory, to another territory that is connected at all points by territories that player occupies. Players need not own a space or naval commander to fortify into lunar or water territories. However, to fortify from a territory on the Earth Game Board to a territory on the Moon Game Board one of the connected territories must be a space station.\n\n\n==Prominent differences from classic ''Risk''==\n* Only five players (classic ''Risk'' seats six)\n* Addition of water and moon territories\n* Addition of commanders (land, naval, space, nuclear, diplomat)\n* Command card decks corresponding to each of the five commanders\n* Players earn and spend \"energy\" to obtain commanders, cards, space stations, and to activate some command cards\n* Players can roll an 8-sided-die in some instances\n* Armies are not acquired through card trading\n* The game is only 5 years (turns) long; the winner is the player with highest score at the end of the last year\n* Players bid energy to determine turn order rather than following the same order determined by a dice from the beginning of the game.\n\n===Territories===\nGeographically, the map is nearly identical to the classic ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'' map. It has the same forty-two territories as before, but they have somewhat different names; Greenland, for example, is now the Exiled States of America. There is a tendency for large territories to be given the name of a present-day [[microstate]] (Andorra, Djibouti, Hong Kong, and Lesotho). Additionally, a few connections are removed from the Earth Board that are present in classic [[Risk (game)|Risk]] board; the picture shows that Egypt is the only African country to have a connection with Middle East.\n\nThirteen water territories divided into five colonies and fourteen lunar territories divided into three colonies have been added. Similar to continental bonuses, if a player controls all the territories in a lunar or water colony at the beginning of his turn, he will receive additional MODs and Energy that turn.\n\nThe map changes each game \u2014 before any units are placed, four Devastation markers are positioned randomly on the board. Those four territories are nuclear [[:wikt:wasteland|wasteland]]s that are impassable and uninhabitable during the game.\n\n===Commanders and cards===\n\nOne of the biggest differences from classic ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'' is the addition of commanders: land, naval, space, [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]], and [[diplomacy|diplomat]]. These fill a number of roles. Card play can shift the balance of power rapidly. Players can only buy four cards at a time, and only for commanders in play. Like the new avenues of movement, cards open up the board by making no position impregnable, no attack a certainty. With cards in use, the game is more fluid and positions are constantly shifting. There is a separate deck of cards for each type of commander. Perhaps the most devastating card attacks are enabled by the nuclear commander: playing a nuclear card has the potential to destroy all the armies on an entire continent.\n\n===Energy===\nEnergy also has a strategic importance. It is used to buy cards, to bring commanders and space stations into play, to bid for the most advantageous place in the turn order, and to play certain cards. Each round, players bid energy for the right to choose when they want to take their turns. But players who spend too much energy one turn may find themselves playing at a disadvantage the next turn, or even for the rest of the game.\n\n===Turn limit===\n''Risk 2210 A.D.'' includes a five-turn limit, although it is possible to play as in normal ''Risk'' with unlimited turns.  Whoever controls the most territories (and bonuses) at the end of the fifth year wins.\n\nThe game includes the necessary equipment and cards for playing the classic version of ''Risk''.\n\n==Renamed territories==\nA map of the original Risk board, which does not contain the US Pacific regions, and has different oceanic connections. In more recent game boards, the connection between East Africa and the Middle East has been removed. There is also a moon map board used in Risk 2210 A.D. Note: there does not appear to be a bridge between the Exiled States of America and Canada on the actual artwork.

''Risk 2210 A.D.'' was designed by [[Rob Daviau]] and Craig Van Ness and first released in 2001. In 2002, it won the [[Origins Award]] for \"Best Science Fiction or Fantasy Board Game of 2001\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners |title=Origins Award Winners (2001) |publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design |accessdate=2007-10-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080202042430/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001/list-of-winners |archivedate = 2008-02-02}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nThe boxed set includes:\n* 1 Earth Game Board, including land territories and water colonies.\n* 1 Moon Game Board\n* 5 different colored sets of playing pieces:\n** MODs (Machines of Destruction) in denomination sizes of 1, 3, and 5.\n** 4 Space Stations\n** The 5 commanders\n* Energy in denominations of 1s and 5s\n* 5 command card decks (1 for each type of commander)\n* 3 territory card decks, 1 for each type of territory (land, water, moon)\n* 5 Turn Order Markers\n* 4 Devastation Markers\n* 1 Score Chart\n* 6 and 8 sided dice, three of each black (attack dice), and two of each white (defense dice), 10 total dice\n\n===Box redesign===\n''2210 A.D.'' originally came packaged in a rectangular boxed set with a playing board that folded into fourths. At some point the design changed to a square, like the packaging for ''[[Risk Godstorm]]''. The board in the square box folds into sixths, the cardboard playing pieces are one-sided as opposed to being printed on both sides as they were for the rectangular box, and the Moon was printed on much thinner cardstock.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Setup===\nBefore the game, 4 cards are randomly selected from the land territory deck. Each of the 4 territory cards drawn will have a \"devastation marker\" placed on its corresponding territory on the earth game board. These territories are impassable for the rest of the game.\n\nEach player is allocated 3 energy chips before the game begins. The number of armies allocated to each player and the process of claiming territories is identical to the Standard [[Risk (game)|Risk]] board game, but the armies are called MODs; therefore, number of MODs allocated to each player at the beginning of the game depends on the number of players.  If three people are playing, each player counts out 35 MODs; four players, 30 MODs; five players, 25 MODs. Players then take turns claiming land territories by placing a 1.0 MOD on an unoccupied land territory until all the land territories are occupied. Players then take turns placing their remaining armies on their claimed land territories. Following MOD placement, each player places a space station, a land commander, and a diplomat on any of their claimed territories.\n\nWater and Lunar territories may not be claimed at the beginning of the game. Devastated land territories can not be claimed or occupied at any point during the game.\n\n===Determining Turn Order===\nThe game is limited to five rounds called years. At the beginning of each year, players use energy chips they have accumulated to bid for turn order through a [[First-price sealed-bid auction]] format. Player secretly bid energy by placing the corresponding of energy chips they would bid into a closed hand. Players open their hands containing their bids simultaneously. The highest bidder selects which turn order he/she wants, then the next highest bidder, and so on. The highest bidder may select any turn the player wants, the player is not limited to \"first.\"\n\n===Ending game===\nAfter each player has completed his turn, a year is considered to have passed. At the end of year 5, each player's score is calculated based on the number of territories the player owns, colonies the player holds, and the number of colony influence cards the player has the commanders to activate. The player with the highest score wins.\n\n==Player Turn==\n\n===Turn order overview===\nAt the beginning of each player's turn, based on the number of countries the player owns and whole continents the player holds, the player gains additional MODs and energy. The player places the MODs and then has the opportunity to buy additional commanders, cards, and space stations. Then the player may play command cards that he has sufficient energy to activate. Next comes the attack phase in which, if the player successfully takes three contested territories, the player receives one bonus energy and one bonus command card. After the attack phase, the player may move one group of units from any one of the player's territories to any other territory the player occupies, so long as both territories are connected by a path of his own territories.\n\n===Collection of Energy and Deployment of MODs===\nSimilar to the obtaining reinforcements in classic [[Risk (game)|Risk]], players receive additional MODs and Energy at the beginning of their turn.  The number of MODs received is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the number of territories a player owns, a players colony bonuses, and the number of space stations a player controls. Players divide their total number of territories, regardless of type, by three and receive that number of MODs rounded down to the nearest integer. If this result is less than three, round up to three MODs. The Score Chart is designed to aide players in this task. Additionally, players receive colony bonuses by occupying all the territories in a land, water, or lunar colony at the beginning of their turn. This is similar to continental bonuses in classic [[Risk (game)|Risk]]. These MODs are dispersed among the player's controlled territories as the he/she chooses. Players also place one MOD on each of territory that contain a Space Station he/she controls.\n\nPlayers receive Energy equal to the number of MODs received at this point in the turn.\n\n===Commanders and Space Stations===\nAfter players have Collected Energy and Deployed their MODs, players may purchase Commanders and Space Stations. Commanders cost three energy while space stations cost five energy.\n\nOne of the biggest differences from classic ''[[Risk (game)|Risk]]'' is the addition of commanders: land, naval, space, [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]], and [[diplomacy|diplomat]]. These fill a number of roles. Their most basic function is to act as an improved army unit, enabling players to roll eight-sided [[dice]] rather than the typical six-sided ones. This is explained more thoroughly in the next section. Space and Naval commanders allow movement into Moon or Water territories respectively.<!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Risk 2210 game board 02.jpg|thumb|left|Players may battle for control of the Moon]]  -->\n\n===Command Cards===\nPerhaps one of the most important functions of the commanders is allowing the purchase and use of commander cards. After players have purchased and placed their commanders or space station, players may purchase a maximum of four commander cards at a cost of one energy per card. Players may only purchase commander cards if he/she has the corresponding Commander in play. The text of the commander card will illustrate when the card may, or must, be played. Many of the Commander cards have energy costs that must be paid if the card is to be put into play.\n\nEach commander deck adds its own strategic elements to the game.

The \"P for Pursuit\" designation was derived from the French ''Chasseur'' designation (literally, hunter) for [[fighter aircraft|fighters]].|group=N}} was the first American all-metal production [[fighter aircraft]] and the first pursuit [[monoplane]] to enter squadron service with the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. Designed and built by [[Boeing]], the prototype first flew in 1932, and the type was still in use with the U.S. Army Air Corps as late as 1941 in the [[Philippines]].  There are only two surviving Peashooters, but there are three reproductions on exhibit with two more under construction.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe project, funded by Boeing, to produce the Boeing Model 248 began in September 1931, with the US Army Air Corps supplying the engines and the instruments. The design, which included an open cockpit, fixed landing gear and externally braced wings, was the last such design procured by the USAAC as a fighter aircraft. The Model 248 had a high landing speed, which caused a number of accidents. To remedy this, [[Flap (aircraft)|flap]]s were fitted to reduce the landing speed. The Army Air Corps ordered three prototypes, designated ''XP-936'', with the first flight on 20 March 1932.\n\nThe Boeing XP-936 was still tricky to land and could roll onto its back while landing, injuring the pilot. The prototype's headrest offered little protection in such instances. As a result, production Model 266s (''P-26A''s) had a taller headrest installed to provide some protection.\n\nTwo [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s were completed as ''P-26B''s with [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340|Pratt & Whitney R-1340-33]] engines. These were followed by twenty-three ''P-26C''s, with [[Carburetor|carburated]] R-1340-33s and modified fuel systems. Both the [[Spanish Air Force]] (one aircraft) and the [[Republic of China Air Force]] (eleven aircraft) ordered examples of the Boeing ''Model 281'', an export version of the P-26 comparable to the P-26C, in 1936.\n\nThe diminutive \"Peashooter\", as it was known by service pilots, was faster than previous American combat aircraft. Nonetheless, rapid progress in aviation led to it quickly becoming an anachronism, with [[Flying wires|wire-braced]] wings, fixed landing gear and an open cockpit. The stressed-skin [[cantilever]]-wing [[Dewoitine D.500]] flew the same year as the P-26 and two years afterwards the Soviet [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]] was flying with retractable landing gear. By 1935, just three years after the P-26, the [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]], [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] were all flying with enclosed cockpits, retractable landing gear and cantilever wings. However, the P-26 remained in service until after the United States entered [[World War II]] in December 1941.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===U.S. Army Air Corps===\n[[File:Boeing P-26 in flight, 9 aircraft formation 060907-F-1234P-004.jpg|thumb|Formation of nine Boeing P-26s of the 20th Pursuit Group]]\n\nDeliveries to USAAC pursuit squadrons began in December 1933 with the last production P-26C aircraft coming off the assembly line in 1936. Ultimately, 22 squadrons flew the Peashooter, with peak service being six squadrons, in 1936. P-26s were the frontline fighters of the USAAC until 1938, when [[Seversky P-35]]s and [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]]s began to replace the P-26. A total of twenty P-26s were lost in accidents between 1934 and America's entry into World War II on 7 December 1941, but only five before 1940.\n\nAir Corps units using the P-26<ref>Maloney and Ryan 1965, Squadron Assignments</ref> were the:\n*[[1st Operations Group|1st Pursuit Group]] ([[17th Fighter Squadron|17th]], [[27th Fighter Squadron|27th]], and [[94th Fighter Squadron|94th PS]]), [[Selfridge Field]], Michigan;\n* [[4th Composite Group]] ([[3d Fighter Training Squadron|3d]], 17th, and [[20th Fighter Squadron|20th PS]]), [[Nichols Field|Nichols]] and [[Clark Field|Clark field]]s, [[Philippine Department]].\n*[[8th Operations Group|8th Pursuit Group]] (33rd, [[35th Fighter Squadron|35th]], and [[36th Fighter Squadron|36th PS]]), [[Langley Field]], Virginia;\n*[[16th Pursuit Group]] ([[24th Fighter Squadron|24th]] and [[78th Reconnaissance Squadron|78th PS]]), [[Albrook Field]], Panama Canal Zone;\n[[File:P-26 Maloney.jpg|thumb|Boeing P-26A Peashooter of the 34th Pursuit Squadron 17th Pursuit Group]]\n*[[17th Pursuit Group]] ([[34th Bomb Squadron|34th]], 73d, and 95th PS), [[March Field]], California\n*[[18th Operations Group|18th Pursuit Group]] ([[6th Night Fighter Squadron|6th]] and [[19th Fighter Squadron|19th PS]]), [[Wheeler Field]], Hawaii; and\n*[[20th Pursuit Group]] ([[55th Fighter Squadron|55th]], [[77th Fighter Squadron|77th]], and [[79th Fighter Squadron|79th PS]]), [[Barksdale Field]], Louisiana.\n\n====Overseas deployments====\nBetween 1938 and 1940, P-26s were assigned overseas to supplement Seversky P-35s in two defense units based at [[Wheeler Field]], Territory of [[Hawaii]]:\n*18th Pursuit Group (6th, 19th, 73d, and 78th PS)\n*[[15th Pursuit Group]] (45th and [[47th Fighter Squadron|47th PS]]).\n\nThe 17th PG became the [[17th Attack Group]] in 1935, and its P-26s were transferred in 1938 to the [[16th Pursuit Group]] (24th, 29th, and 78th PS) at [[Albrook Field]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. These P-26s were transferred in 1940 to the [[37th Pursuit Group]] (28th, 30th, and 31st PS) which flew them until they were replaced by P-40s in May 1941. Some continued service with the [[32d Pursuit Group]] (51st and 53rd PS), but only nine P-26s remained operational in Central America at the start of World War II.\n\nP-26As were also flown by the 3d&nbsp;PS of the [[4th Composite Group]], based in the Philippines. Between 1937 and 1941, 31 were sold to the fledgling [[Philippine Army Air Corps]].\n\n===Combat service===\nThe first Boeing P-26 to experience major combat operation was the Chinese Model 281. On 15 August 1937, eight P-26/281s from the [[Chinese Nationalist Air Force]] 3rd Pursuit Group, 17th Squadron, based at Chuyung airfield, engaged eight out of twenty [[Mitsubishi G3M]] ''Nell'' [[medium bomber]]s from the Kisarazu Air Group sent to attack Nanking. The Chinese Boeing fighters helped shoot down two of the four Japanese bombers destroyed that day without suffering any losses.

The \"P for Pursuit\" designation was derived from the French ''Chasseur'' designation (literally, hunter) for [[fighter aircraft|fighters]].|group=N}} was the first American all-metal production [[fighter aircraft]] and the first pursuit [[monoplane]] to enter squadron service with the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. Designed and built by [[Boeing]], the prototype first flew in 1932, and the type was still in use with the U.S. Army Air Corps as late as 1941 in the [[Philippines]].  There are only two surviving Peashooters, but there are three reproductions on exhibit with two more under construction.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe project, funded by Boeing, to produce the Boeing Model 248 began in September 1931, with the US Army Air Corps supplying the engines and the instruments. The design, which included an open cockpit, fixed landing gear and externally braced wings, was the last such design procured by the USAAC as a fighter aircraft. The Model 248 had a high landing speed, which caused a number of accidents. To remedy this, [[Flap (aircraft)|flap]]s were fitted to reduce the landing speed. The Army Air Corps ordered three prototypes, designated ''XP-936'', with the first flight on 20 March 1932.\n\nThe Boeing XP-936 was still tricky to land and could roll onto its back while landing, injuring the pilot. The prototype's headrest offered little protection in such instances. As a result, production Model 266s (''P-26A''s) had a taller headrest installed to provide some protection.\n\nTwo [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s were completed as ''P-26B''s with [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Pratt & Whitney R-1340|Pratt & Whitney R-1340-33]] engines. These were followed by twenty-three ''P-26C''s, with [[Carburetor|carburated]] R-1340-33s and modified fuel systems. Both the [[Spanish Air Force]] (one aircraft) and the [[Republic of China Air Force]] (eleven aircraft) ordered examples of the Boeing ''Model 281'', an export version of the P-26 comparable to the P-26C, in 1936.\n\nThe diminutive \"Peashooter\", as it was known by service pilots, was faster than previous American combat aircraft. Nonetheless, rapid progress in aviation led to it quickly becoming an anachronism, with [[Flying wires|wire-braced]] wings, fixed landing gear and an open cockpit. The stressed-skin [[cantilever]]-wing [[Dewoitine D.500]] flew the same year as the P-26 and two years afterwards the Soviet [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]] was flying with retractable landing gear. By 1935, just three years after the P-26, the [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]], [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] were all flying with enclosed cockpits, retractable landing gear and cantilever wings. However, the P-26 remained in service until after the United States entered [[World War II]] in December 1941.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===U.S. Army Air Corps===\n[[File:Boeing P-26 in flight, 9 aircraft formation 060907-F-1234P-004.jpg|thumb|Formation of nine Boeing P-26s of the 20th Pursuit Group]]\n\nDeliveries to USAAC pursuit squadrons began in December 1933 with the last production P-26C aircraft coming off the assembly line in 1936. Ultimately, 22 squadrons flew the Peashooter, with peak service being six squadrons, in 1936. P-26s were the frontline fighters of the USAAC until 1938, when [[Seversky P-35]]s and [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk|Curtiss P-36]]s began to replace the P-26. A total of twenty P-26s were lost in accidents between 1934 and America's entry into World War II on 7 December 1941, but only five before 1940.\n\nAir Corps units using the P-26<ref>Maloney and Ryan 1965, Squadron Assignments</ref> were the:\n*[[1st Operations Group|1st Pursuit Group]] ([[17th Fighter Squadron|17th]], [[27th Fighter Squadron|27th]], and [[94th Fighter Squadron|94th PS]]), [[Selfridge Field]], Michigan;\n* [[4th Composite Group]] ([[3d Fighter Training Squadron|3d]], 17th, and [[20th Fighter Squadron|20th PS]]), [[Nichols Field|Nichols]] and [[Clark Field|Clark field]]s, [[Philippine Department]].\n*[[8th Operations Group|8th Pursuit Group]] (33rd, [[35th Fighter Squadron|35th]], and [[36th Fighter Squadron|36th PS]]), [[Langley Field]], Virginia;\n*[[16th Pursuit Group]] ([[24th Fighter Squadron|24th]] and [[78th Reconnaissance Squadron|78th PS]]), [[Albrook Field]], Panama Canal Zone;\n[[File:P-26 Maloney.jpg|thumb|Boeing P-26A Peashooter of the 34th Pursuit Squadron 17th Pursuit Group]]\n*[[17th Pursuit Group]] ([[34th Bomb Squadron|34th]], 73d, and 95th PS), [[March Field]], California\n*[[18th Operations Group|18th Pursuit Group]] ([[6th Night Fighter Squadron|6th]] and [[19th Fighter Squadron|19th PS]]), [[Wheeler Field]], Hawaii; and\n*[[20th Pursuit Group]] ([[55th Fighter Squadron|55th]], [[77th Fighter Squadron|77th]], and [[79th Fighter Squadron|79th PS]]), [[Barksdale Field]], Louisiana.\n\n====Overseas deployments====\nBetween 1938 and 1940, P-26s were assigned overseas to supplement Seversky P-35s in two defense units based at [[Wheeler Field]], Territory of [[Hawaii]]:\n*18th Pursuit Group (6th, 19th, 73d, and 78th PS)\n*[[15th Pursuit Group]] (45th and [[47th Fighter Squadron|47th PS]]).\n\nThe 17th PG became the [[17th Attack Group]] in 1935, and its P-26s were transferred in 1938 to the [[16th Pursuit Group]] (24th, 29th, and 78th PS) at [[Albrook Field]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]]. These P-26s were transferred in 1940 to the [[37th Pursuit Group]] (28th, 30th, and 31st PS) which flew them until they were replaced by P-40s in May 1941. Some continued service with the [[32d Pursuit Group]] (51st and 53rd PS), but only nine P-26s remained operational in Central America at the start of World War II.\n\nP-26As were also flown by the 3d&nbsp;PS of the [[4th Composite Group]], based in the Philippines. Between 1937 and 1941, 31 were sold to the fledgling [[Philippine Army Air Corps]].\n\n===Combat service===\nThe first Boeing P-26 to experience major combat operation was the Chinese Model 281. On 15 August 1937, eight P-26/281s from the [[Chinese Nationalist Air Force]] 3rd Pursuit Group, 17th Squadron, based at Chuyung airfield, engaged eight out of twenty [[Mitsubishi G3M]] ''Nell'' [[medium bomber]]s from the Kisarazu Air Group sent to attack Nanking. The Chinese Boeing fighters helped shoot down two of the four Japanese bombers destroyed that day without suffering any losses. Subsequent engagements between the Chinese Peashooter pilots and pilots of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] flying the [[Mitsubishi A5M]] ([[World War II Allied names for Japanese aircraft|Allied reporting name]] \"Claude\") were the first aerial dogfights and kills between all-metal monoplane fighter aircraft.<ref>Gustavsson, H\u00e5kan.
