Released on December 26, 1972 on [[Motown]]'s Soul Records imprint as S 35098, it became one of their biggest hit singles to date, and was also the last single the group released prior to them leaving Motown for [[Buddah Records]] in February 1973.\n\n==Background==\nBy 1972, Gladys Knight & The Pips had spent six and a half years with Motown Records, having signed with the label in 1966. Though well known prior to signing with Motown, they achieved widespread success with the label with hits such as \"[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]\", \"[[Nitty Gritty (song)|Nitty Gritty]]\" and \"[[If I Were Your Woman (song)|If I Were Your Woman]]\". However, the group would recall being treated like outsiders in the label. Lead singer Gladys Knight recalled on [[A&E Network|A&E]]'s ''[[Biography (television program)|Biography]]'' that she and the group were regarded as a second-string act and that \"[[The Supremes|Diana (Ross) & The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]] and [[Marvin Gaye]] were given all the hits, while we took the leftovers\". While on Motown, Knight & The Pips recorded for Soul Records, a label Motown used for acts that recorded material with more of an R&B flavor than a pop flavor. In 1972, the group had success with their cover of musician [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s ballad, \"[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]\". The song helped to make the group's transition from soul and blues-oriented material to more middle of the road fare.\n\n==Recording==\nIn late 1972, the group began recording songs for what would be their final Motown album, ''[[Neither One of Us (album)|Neither One of Us]]'', at Motown's [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] studios in Detroit. Among the songs they would record that wounded up on the album included a [[funk]]-oriented cover of [[Bill Withers]]' \"[[Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?|Who Is She (And What Is She to You)?]]\", a cover of \"[[For Once in My Life]]\" and a self-penned composition, \"Daddy Could Swear, I Declare\", the latter song of which they had begun promoting in the summer of 1972 through a performance on the TV program, ''[[Soul Train]]''. They also recorded a good portion of the album at Motown's Hollywood studios, MoWest.\n\nThey worked on the majority of the album with producer [[Joe Porter (producer)|Joe Porter]], who allowed the group creative freedom in the studio. According to [[Bubba Knight]], Porter allowed the group to co-produce the album, saying Porter would bring them the songs and allowed them to \"mold[ed] it to the Gladys Knight & The Pips' way\" and upon hearing their arrangements, would tell engineers to just \"turn the tape on\".{{sfn|Dahl|2011|p=101}} Porter had given them the song titled \"Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)\", a song written and first recorded by fledgling country singer-songwriter [[Jim Weatherly]]. Porter had picked the song out from Weatherly's publishing company. Knight recorded her lead vocal in one take at MoWest Studios, with parts of the background by the group already done.{{sfn|Dahl|2011|p=101}}\n\nThe group then headed back from Los Angeles to Detroit but while in their car, Bubba Knight recounted that them singing the song prompted them to return to the studio to add more to the background, while Gladys redid her lead vocal.{{sfn|Dahl|2011|p=101}} During this time period, the group's contract was up for renewal in the winter of 1973. The group eventually refused to renew it after failing to get Motown to renew their contract in \"good faith\" and eventually asked to be released from their contract.{{sfn|Dahl|2011|p=101}}\n\n==Release and reaction==\nFollowing the completion of the recording, Motown issued it for promotional use in December 1972, not too long afterwards. After negotiations with Motown broke down, the group was allowed to leave the label in January 1973; shortly thereafter, the group signed a contract with [[Buddah Records]] the following month in February 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT11&dq=Gladys+Knight+%26+The+Pips+Neither+One+Of+Us&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijndCnyoLKAhXCQyYKHXerABwQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&q=Gladys%20Knight%20%26%20The%20Pips%20Neither%20One%20Of%20Us&f=false |title=Soul Sauce |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=February 17, 1973 |accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref> By that point, the song was already climbing the charts on both the pop and R&B charts, on its way to give the group their biggest hit since \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" roughly six years before. Motown issued the group's final contractual album, ''Neither One of Us'', that March.\n\nOn March 17, 1973, the song reached number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]] chart, staying there for four consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=330}}</ref> Due to the song's strong crossover appeal, it eventually peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with [[Vicki Lawrence]]'s \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" blocking it from number one. However, it went number one on the U.S. [[Record World]] and [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19730407.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 4/07/73 |work=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] |accessdate=January 17, 2016 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It also crossed over to the adult contemporary chart, peaking at number 15. Worldwide, it was also successful, peaking at number 9 in France, number 11 in Canada and number 31 in the UK.\n\nAround this time, the group had released their first Buddah single, \"Where Peaceful Waters Flow\", which also was written by Jim Weatherly. The song eventually peaked at number 28 on the pop chart, presumably because Motown kept pushing \"Neither One of Us\" to be played at more radio stations blocking the Buddah single from reaching bigger success. By the time \"Neither One of Us\" had begun to peak, Buddah issued the group's second single, the Weatherly-composed \"[[Midnight Train to Georgia]]\", in August 1973, where the song eventually topped both pop and R&B charts, pushing the group to superstardom. Despite efforts from Motown to stop \"Midnight Train\", the first \"posthumously\"-released Motown song \"Daddy Could Swear\" only peaked inside the top 20.\n\nOn March 2, 1974, at the [[16th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Awards ceremony]], Gladys Knight & The Pips won [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]] for \"Neither One of Us\". Previously that same night, they had won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|their first Grammy for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]] for \"Midnight Train to Georgia\".\n\n==Covers and samples==\n* [[Asha Puthli]] recorded a cover of this song on her 1973 self-titled second solo album for CBS. \n* In 1973 version of the song by Australian singer [[Linda George (Australian singer)|Linda George]] outsold the original in her home country.\n* In 1973 country singer [[Bob Luman]] recorded a successful cover version of \"Neither One of Us ... .\" His version reached number seven on the Billboard [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart, concurrent with the success of the Gladys Knight & the Pips' version.\n* Saxophonist [[David Sanborn]] covered the song from his 1982 album ''[[Backstreet (David Sanborn album)|Backstreet]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r146866|pure_url=yes}}|title=Backstreet overview|work=[[Allmusic|AllMusic.com]]}}</ref>\n* Country artist Linda Davis covered the song on her 1995 album ''[[Some Things Were Meant to Be]]''.\n* R&B singer [[Angie Stone]] sampled it for \"No More Rain (In This Cloud)\" from her 1999 album, ''[[Black Diamond (Angie Stone album)|Black Diamond]]''.\n* American rock and soul duo [[Hall & Oates]] covered the song on their 2004 album ''[[Our Kind of Soul]]''.\n* Filipina-Jamaican singer [[Jaya (singer)|Jaya]] covered the track on her 2011 album ''All Souled Out'', and has included the song in many live performances from the beginning of her singing career.\n* The German DJ, [[DJ Koze]], sampled the chorus in the single \u201cPick Up\u201d (released in 2018).\n\n==Personnel==\n*Lead vocals by [[Gladys Knight]]\n*Background vocals by Gladys Knight, [[Bubba Knight]], [[William Guest (singer)|William Guest]] and [[Edward Patten]]\n*Instrumentation by the [[Funk Brothers]] and assorted orchestra players\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1973)\n!Peak <br>position\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' Best Selling Soul Singles\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|U.S. ''Record World''\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|U.S. [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100 <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19730407.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, April 7, 1973 |access-date=August 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062134/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19730407.html |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|31\n|-\n|France Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|9\n|-\n|Canadian Singles Chart <ref>[https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.4812&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.4812.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.4812 May 5, 1973]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|16\n|-\n|Italy Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|15\n|}\n{{col-break}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1973)\n!

After negotiations with Motown broke down, the group was allowed to leave the label in January 1973; shortly thereafter, the group signed a contract with [[Buddah Records]] the following month in February 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT11&dq=Gladys+Knight+%26+The+Pips+Neither+One+Of+Us&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijndCnyoLKAhXCQyYKHXerABwQ6AEIVTAJ#v=onepage&q=Gladys%20Knight%20%26%20The%20Pips%20Neither%20One%20Of%20Us&f=false |title=Soul Sauce |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=February 17, 1973 |accessdate=December 29, 2015}}</ref> By that point, the song was already climbing the charts on both the pop and R&B charts, on its way to give the group their biggest hit since \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" roughly six years before. Motown issued the group's final contractual album, ''Neither One of Us'', that March.\n\nOn March 17, 1973, the song reached number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Soul Singles]] chart, staying there for four consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=330}}</ref> Due to the song's strong crossover appeal, it eventually peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with [[Vicki Lawrence]]'s \"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" blocking it from number one. However, it went number one on the U.S. [[Record World]] and [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] charts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19730407.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 4/07/73 |work=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] |accessdate=January 17, 2016 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It also crossed over to the adult contemporary chart, peaking at number 15. Worldwide, it was also successful, peaking at number 9 in France, number 11 in Canada and number 31 in the UK.\n\nAround this time, the group had released their first Buddah single, \"Where Peaceful Waters Flow\", which also was written by Jim Weatherly. The song eventually peaked at number 28 on the pop chart, presumably because Motown kept pushing \"Neither One of Us\" to be played at more radio stations blocking the Buddah single from reaching bigger success. By the time \"Neither One of Us\" had begun to peak, Buddah issued the group's second single, the Weatherly-composed \"[[Midnight Train to Georgia]]\", in August 1973, where the song eventually topped both pop and R&B charts, pushing the group to superstardom. Despite efforts from Motown to stop \"Midnight Train\", the first \"posthumously\"-released Motown song \"Daddy Could Swear\" only peaked inside the top 20.\n\nOn March 2, 1974, at the [[16th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Awards ceremony]], Gladys Knight & The Pips won [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]] for \"Neither One of Us\".

She experienced top 10 [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'']] placements at seventeen with her debut album ''[[VYP (Voice of the Young People)]]'' which sold 19,000 copies in its first week. The album spawned her four major singles including her staple song and dance anthem \"[[Lip Gloss]]\", earning her two [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[Monster Single of the Year]] nominations at the MTV VMA's. Lil Mama has sold over 1 million records worldwide. Lil Mama gained further attention in [[Pop music]] after a collaboration with [[Avril Lavigne]], for the song \"Girlfriend\u201d.\n\nLil Mama took a hiatus from music after success of her hit single \"Hustler Girl\" to stay focused on serving as a judge for total of seven seasons on MTV's [[America's Best Dance Crew]] at the age of nineteen from 2008-2012, which made her one of the youngest judges on any competitive television show in history. Working with producer and fellow judge [[Randy Jackson]], she served alongside [[JC Chasez]], [[Shane Sparks]], [[Mario Lopez]], and [[Layla Kayleigh]].\n\nShe was cast in her breakout role of the late Hip-Hop artist [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes]], in the [[VH1]] biographical film ''[[CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story]]'', which aired in October 2013 and garnered 4.5 million views in the first night. From the success of the film, Lil Mama joined [[TLC (group)]] on their tour for their Greatest Hits album. She got the opportunity to perform a tribute to the late rapper at the [[2013 American Music Awards]] performing the [[Grammy Award]] winning song \"[[Waterfalls (TLC song)|Waterfalls]]\".\n\nLil Mama continued to remain in the public eye, returning to music, making new tracks with fellow rapper [[MC Lyte]] on her single \"Ball\".

She moved back to Brooklyn and attended [[Edward R. Murrow High School]] until her Senior year where she continued her education through independent studies. Lil Mama is a third generation of West African, Trinidadian, and Jamaican descent and the third born child. Being the oldest daughter, she got her nickname \"Lil Mama\". She has two older brothers and three younger brothers, one of which is also a dancer and underground rapper along with her younger sister and last brother. She has one maternal aunt and several paternal uncles.\n\nKirkland faced personal and financial struggles at an early age and experienced even more poverty when her mother, Tara, was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]], which often led Kirkland to struggle in school as she had to care for her siblings and see her mother back and forth in hospitals from procedures. Both her parents had separated when she was a young child, but Lil Mama always maintained a close relationship with her father, visiting him consistently. Her family became homeless and their mother had moved her and her siblings into a shelter due to poverty at the time. Lil Mama told [[Power 105.1]] she stayed in the shelters for seven years from her kindergarten year until the beginning of her eighth grade year when they managed to get an apartment in the Bronx and gain more stability. Her younger sibling's father was deceased, so her mother was the Matriarch of her family. She contributed to helping her mother financially by taking up small jobs such as baking. Growing up, Kirkland witnessed many hardships in her community including gang & drug violence, teen pregnancy, and domestic violence.\n\nAfter her mother Tara's fight with cancer became more fatal, her mother moved in with Lil Mama's aunt and Tara's older sister. She stayed there so she could be cared for and help with the care of the younger children in her family.\n\nAs one of eight children, she began to express herself artistically by writing [[poetry]] and [[music]]. She even trained at dance schools for [[Ballet]], [[Jazz dance]], [[Tap dance]], South African dance, [[Hip-hop dance]], and [[Street dance]]; she was in many competitions and recitals making her a professional dancer. She was influenced by Mc Lyte, Lil Kim, Left Eye, Missy Elliot, Lauryn Hill, and her parents. Her mother was a talented singer and her father Allen Brunner was a musician and DJ. Lil Mama decided to explore her talents further when she took interest in the Rap Culture, and from then on she continued to perfect her talent in rapping and managed to become an avid free-stylist.

She became the ''Queen of Hip-Pop'' for mixing her rhymes with pop influences, which started after her collaboration with [[Avril Lavigne]]. She first introduced herself as the \"Birth of Hip-Pop\" at the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]] sporting a baby-styled look. She later told MTV how she intended to spread and influence more artists to spread the genre of hip-pop.

She then released two more singles entitled \"Scrawberry\" and \"Hustler Girl\", both singles were followed by music videos.

His godparents were members of the British royal family, [[King George VI]] and Princess Elizabeth, now [[Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref name=fenyvesi-211/>\n\nHis parents were relatively unable to take care of him, due to their various health and financial problems, so Alexander was raised by his maternal grandmother, [[Aspasia Manos]]. He was educated at Trinity School, [[Institut Le Rosey]], [[Culver Military Academy]], [[Gordonstoun]], [[Millfield]] and [[Mons Officer Cadet School]], Aldershot, and pursued a career in the [[British Armed Forces|British military]].\n\n==Military service==\nAlexander graduated from the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in 1966 and was commissioned as an officer into the British Army's [[16th/5th The Queen's Royal Lancers]] regiment, rising to the rank of [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]]. His tours of duty included [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. After leaving the army in 1972, Alexander, who speaks several languages, pursued a career in international business.<ref>[http://www.royalfamily.org/royal-family/hrh-crown-prince-alexander-ii/ The Royal Family of Serbia]</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010-Lejonbacken-031.jpg|thumb|200px|Alexander with his wife [[Katherine, Crown Princess of Yugoslavia|Katherine]].]]\n\nOn 1 July 1972 at [[Villamanrique de la Condesa]], near [[Seville]], Spain, he married [[Princess Maria da Gl\u00f3ria, Duchess of Segorbe|Princess Maria da Gloria of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], from the [[Brazilian imperial family]]. They had three sons: [[Peter, Hereditary Prince of Yugoslavia|Peter]] (born 5 February 1980), and fraternal twins: [[Prince Philip of Yugoslavia|Philip]] and [[Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia (born 1982)|Alexander]] (both born 15 January 1982).\n\nBy marrying a Roman Catholic, Alexander lost his place in [[line of succession to the British throne]], which he had held as a descendant of [[Queen Victoria]] through her second son [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alfred]], although forfeiture of succession rights on the basis of marriage to a Roman Catholic was retroactively rescinded in 2015. Alexander is also descended from Queen Victoria's eldest daughter [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]].<ref>Louda; Maclagan (1981), p. 286 Table 144</ref> His sons remain in the line of [[succession to the British throne]].\n\nAlexander and Maria da Gloria divorced in 1985. Crown Prince Alexander married for the second time, Katherine Clairy Batis, the daughter of Robert Batis and his wife, Anna Dosti, civilly on 20 September 1985, and religiously the following day, at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church, Notting Hill, London. Since their marriage, she is known as [[Katherine, Crown Princess of Yugoslavia|Princess Katherine]], as per the royal family's website.\n\n==Return to Yugoslavia==\n[[File:Vlade Divac.jpg|thumb|215px|left|World Heart Day in Belgrade, 2005.

The legislation may also have effectively annulled a decree stripping the family of its citizenship of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY) in 1947.\n\nThe annulment was the topic of some debate. Notably, the FRY was not the successor of the SFRY; rather the FRY was a new state (and was admitted to the United Nations as a new state on that basis). Therefore, the jurisdiction of a new state to annul an action of a different former state was questioned. In effect, the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family had FRY citizenship conferred upon them, not \"restored\" as such.\n\nThe FRY legislation also addresses restoration of property to the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family. In March 2001, the property seized from his family, including royal palaces, was returned for residential purposes with property ownership to be decided by parliament at some later date. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nHe currently lives in the [[Royal Palace (Belgrade)|Royal Palace]] (''Kraljevski Dvor'') in [[Dedinje]] which he has lived there since July 17, 2001 which is an exclusive area of Belgrade.

A monarchist proposal for the new Serbian constitution has been published alongside other proposals. The [[Constitution of Serbia|document]] [[Serbian constitutional referendum, 2006|approved]] in October 2006 is a republican one. The Serbian people have not had a chance to vote on the system of government.\n\nThe Crown Prince raised the issue of a royal restoration in the immediate aftermath of the vote.

Only if we have a form of governance close to the Serbian soul: the Kingdom of Serbia.\n\nSimply, the King is above daily politics, he is the guardian of national unity, political stability and continuity of the state. In Constitutional Parliamentary Monarchies the King is the protector of public interest: there is no personal or party interest. What is most important is the interest of Serbia.\n\nI am ready to meet all our politicians; we have to work together for the common good of Serbia, and to be friends in the name of the future of our country.

Yugoslavia]] and currently [[pretender|claimant]] to the [[abolished monarchy#Twentieth century|abolished throne]] of the precursor [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. He is the head of the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty|House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]]. Alexander is the only child of former [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] and his wife, [[Alexandra of Yugoslavia|Alexandra of Greece and Denmark]]. He held the position of [[crown prince]] in the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] for the first four-and-a-half months of his life, from his birth until the declaration of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] later in 1945.\n\nBorn and raised in the United Kingdom, he enjoys close relationships with his relatives in the [[British royal family]]. His godparents were [[King George VI]] of the United Kingdom and his daughter, the then-Princess Elizabeth (now [[Queen Elizabeth II]]). Alexander is a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, through his great-great-grandfather Prince Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Victoria's second eldest son. Alexander is known for his support of [[monarchism]] and his humanitarian work.\n\n==Status at birth==\nAs with many other European monarchs during [[World War II]], King Peter II left his country to establish a government-in-exile.<ref>Louda; Maclagan (1981), p. 296</ref> He left Yugoslavia in April 1941 and arrived in [[London]] in June 1941.

On 10 August 1945, less than a month after Alexander's birth, AVNOJ named the country [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]]. On 29 November 1945, the country was declared a communist republic and changed its name to [[People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].<ref>Fenyvesi (1981), p. 215</ref>\n\nIn 1947, all members of Alexander's family except for his grand-uncle [[George, Crown Prince of Serbia|Prince George]] were deprived of their Yugoslavian [[citizenship]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalfamily.org/decree-removing-royal-family-citizenship-and-properties/ |title=The decree on stripping the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family of citizenship (translation) |publisher=The Royal Family of Serbia}}</ref> and their property was confiscated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalfamily.org/decree-removing-royal-family-citizenship-and-properties/ |title=The royal family was stripped off their property (translation)|publisher=The Royal Family of Serbia}}</ref>\n\nAs of 8 July 2015 the High Court in Belgrade found that decree 392, issued by the Presidency of the Presidium of the National Assembly on 3 August 1947, which deprived King Peter II and other members of the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 of their citizenship, was null and void from the moment of its adoption, in the parts pertaining to Crown Prince Alexander, and that all of its legal consequences are thus null and void.<ref>[http://www.royalfamily.org/rehabilitation-of-crown-prince-alexander/ Rehabilitation of Crown Prince Alexander]</ref>\n\n==Birth and childhood==\nAlexander was born in Suite 212 of [[Claridge's Hotel]] in Brook Street, [[Mayfair]], [[London]].

He was educated at Trinity School, [[Institut Le Rosey]], [[Culver Military Academy]], [[Gordonstoun]], [[Millfield]] and [[Mons Officer Cadet School]], Aldershot, and pursued a career in the [[British Armed Forces|British military]].\n\n==Military service==\nAlexander graduated from the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in 1966 and was commissioned as an officer into the British Army's [[16th/5th The Queen's Royal Lancers]] regiment, rising to the rank of [[Captain (armed forces)|captain]]. His tours of duty included [[West Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. After leaving the army in 1972, Alexander, who speaks several languages, pursued a career in international business.<ref>[http://www.royalfamily.org/royal-family/hrh-crown-prince-alexander-ii/ The Royal Family of Serbia]</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010-Lejonbacken-031.jpg|thumb|200px|Alexander with his wife [[Katherine, Crown Princess of Yugoslavia|Katherine]].]]\n\nOn 1 July 1972 at [[Villamanrique de la Condesa]], near [[Seville]], Spain, he married [[Princess Maria da Gl\u00f3ria, Duchess of Segorbe|Princess Maria da Gloria of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], from the [[Brazilian imperial family]].

Alexander is also descended from Queen Victoria's eldest daughter [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]].<ref>Louda; Maclagan (1981), p. 286 Table 144</ref> His sons remain in the line of [[succession to the British throne]].\n\nAlexander and Maria da Gloria divorced in 1985. Crown Prince Alexander married for the second time, Katherine Clairy Batis, the daughter of Robert Batis and his wife, Anna Dosti, civilly on 20 September 1985, and religiously the following day, at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church, Notting Hill, London. Since their marriage, she is known as [[Katherine, Crown Princess of Yugoslavia|Princess Katherine]], as per the royal family's website.\n\n==Return to Yugoslavia==\n[[File:Vlade Divac.jpg|thumb|215px|left|World Heart Day in Belgrade, 2005.

The legislation may also have effectively annulled a decree stripping the family of its citizenship of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY) in 1947.\n\nThe annulment was the topic of some debate. Notably, the FRY was not the successor of the SFRY; rather the FRY was a new state (and was admitted to the United Nations as a new state on that basis). Therefore, the jurisdiction of a new state to annul an action of a different former state was questioned. In effect, the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family had FRY citizenship conferred upon them, not \"restored\" as such.\n\nThe FRY legislation also addresses restoration of property to the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family. In March 2001, the property seized from his family, including royal palaces, was returned for residential purposes with property ownership to be decided by parliament at some later date. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nHe currently lives in the [[Royal Palace (Belgrade)|Royal Palace]] (''Kraljevski Dvor'') in [[Dedinje]] which he has lived there since July 17, 2001 which is an exclusive area of Belgrade.
