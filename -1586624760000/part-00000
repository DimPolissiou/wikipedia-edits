Variations include the '''speed hump''', '''speed cushion''', and '''speed table'''.\n\nThe use of vertical deflection devices is widespread around the world, and they are most commonly found to enforce a low [[speed limit]], under {{cvt|40|km/h|mph}} or lower.\n\nAlthough speed bumps are effective in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial\u2014as they can increase traffic noise, may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed, and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed speed bumps that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle can be disruptive for drivers, and may be difficult to navigate for vehicles with low [[Ride height|ground clearance]], even at very low speeds. Many [[sports car]]s have this problem with such speed bumps. Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to [[motorcyclist]]s and [[bicyclist]]s if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment. Speed bumps cost $50\u2013200 and may need replacement over time due to wear.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catalog: Speed Bumps & Humps |url=http://www.speedbumpsandhumps.com/|publisher=Speed Bumps and Humps|access-date=29 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nEach of these devices can be made from a variety of materials, including [[asphalt]], [[concrete]], recycled [[plastic]], [[metal]], or [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]]. Several trade-offs must be made when selecting the material for a new speed cushion. Traditionally most vertical deflection devices have been constructed of asphalt or concrete. Due to the rigidity and durability of these materials, they have more permanence and are more effective at slowing traffic. However, they can be difficult to shape and form into consistent forms and precise dimensions.\n\nRubber products are pre-shaped to standard sizes to meet industry standards. Preformed rubber products are typically bolted down, making them easier to install or remove. Temporary bolt-down installations can be ideal for planners in testing the use and positioning of speed bumps before implementing them in a larger project. Bolt-down products can also be removed or relocated during winter snow periods\u2014where speed bumps are easily concealed and may be damaged by snowplows.\n\n==History==\nOn June 7, 1906, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on an early implementation of what might be considered speed bumps in [[Chatham, New Jersey]], which planned to raise its crosswalks five inches above the road level: \"This scheme of stopping automobile speeding has been discussed by different municipalities, but Chatham is the first place to put it in practice\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Democratic Rate Plan Favored by Roosevelt [and other news]|work=New York Times|date=1906-03-07|page=3}}</ref> The average automobile's top speed at the time was around {{cvt|30|mph|km/h}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n[[Arthur Holly Compton]] was a [[physicist]] and winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics in 1927 for his discoveries resulting in major changes in [[electromagnetic theory]]. He is commonly known for his work on the [[Compton Effect]] with [[X-ray]]s. He also invented what he called \"traffic control bumps,\" the basic design for the speed hump, in 1953. Compton began designs on the speed bump after noticing the speed at which motorists passed Brookings Hall at [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where he was [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Original Traffic control sketch made by Compton in 1953|url=http://library.wustl.edu/units/spec/archives/facts/images/traffic_control_sketch_1953.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615162332/http://library.wustl.edu/units/spec/archives/facts/images/traffic_control_sketch_1953.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-06-15|publisher=Washington University Libraries|accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>\n\nThe British Transport and Road Research Laboratory published a comprehensive report in 1973 examining vehicle behavior for a large variety of different bump geometries.<ref>Road humps for the control of vehicle speeds by G.R.

A speed bump is a bump in a roadway with heights typically ranging between {{convert|3|and|4|in|order=flip}}. The traverse distance of a speed bump is typically less than or near to {{cvt|1|ft|order=flip}}; contrasting with the wider speed humps, which typically have a traverse distance of {{cvt|10|to|14|ft|m|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web\n |author       = ITE\n |title        = Traffic Calming Measures\n |url          = http://www.ite.org/traffic/hump.asp\n |publisher    = Institute of Transportation Engineers\n |access-date  = 2014-09-09\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170729064350/http://www.ite.org/traffic/hump.asp\n |archive-date = 2017-07-29\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |author=TrafficCalming.org \n |title=Speed Humps (Road Humps, Undulations) \n |url=http://trafficcalming.org/speedhumps.html \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010219114026/http://www.trafficcalming.org/SPEEDHUMPS.html \n |url-status=dead \n |archive-date=2001-02-19 \n |publisher=Fehr & Peers \n}}</ref>\n\nSpeed bumps vary in length, but it is typical to leave space between the bump and either edge of an enclosed road (i.e. with curbs and gutters) to allow for drainage.

It also produced 47 per cent more particulate matter  (PM) and nearly 60 per cent more carbon monoxide (CO2) emissions. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/01/speed-bumps-could-removed-cut-traffic-pollution-save-lives/]\n<br>\nAnother study estimated that for a private automobile, the increase in fuel consumption due a pass over a speed bump is responsible for fuel waste of 10ml[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136192091500019X]. Multiply this with number of vehicles going over a speed bump every day, and you will come to more than 15 tons per year, fuel wasted on a single speed bump every year.\n\n===Dynamic speed bumps===\nDynamic speed bumps differ from conventional speed bumps in that they only activate if a vehicle is traveling above a certain speed. Vehicles traveling below this speed will not experience the discomfort of a conventional speed bump. Dynamic speed bumps may allow the passage of [[emergency vehicle]]s at higher speeds.\n\nThe [[Actibump]] system, successfully used in Sweden, is based on powered equipment integrated into the road surface, which operates a platform that is lowered a few centimeters when a speeding vehicle approaches. Any vehicle approaching at or under the speed limit will pass on a level road. The system measures the speed of an oncoming vehicle by using radar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Actibump|url=http://www.actibump.com|publisher=Edeva|accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThe [http://smartbumps.com/ SmartBumps] system, successfully used in several places uses a mechanical speed bump built in the road, that raises only for the speeding vehicles. The slow drivers, driving within the speed limit will practically not notice the speed bump. The system measures the speed of the vehicles using sensors on the road. \n\nIn another design, a rubber housing is fitted with a [[pressure relief valve]] that determines the speed of a vehicle. If the vehicle is traveling below the set speed, the valve opens allowing the bump to deflate as the vehicle drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast.

Studies show an average 18% reduction in traffic volume and an average 13% reduction in collisions.<ref name=\"ITE\"/>\n\n=== Comparison to speed bumps ===\nWhile similar to speed bumps, humps are less aggressive than speed bumps at low speeds. Humps are often used on streets, while bumps are used more in parking lots.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPEED BUMPS AND SPEED HUMPS|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-r-0567.htm|publisher=www.cga.ct.gov|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref> While speed bumps generally slow cars to {{cvt|5|-|10|mph|0|order=flip}}, humps slow cars to {{cvt|15|-|20|mph|order=flip}}. The narrow traverse distance of speed bumps often allows vehicles to pass over them at high speed with only mild disturbance to the wheels and suspension, and hardly affecting the vehicle cab and its occupants. The relatively long slopes of speed humps are less disruptive at low&ndash;moderate speeds, but they create a greater, more sustained vertical deflection; at higher speeds, a more sustained deflection is less-absorbed by vehicle suspensions and has a greater effect on the vehicle as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speed Humps vs. Speed Bumps|url=http://www.maine.gov/mdot/csd/mlrc/technical/shsb.htm|publisher=www.maine.gov|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Problems===\nOne problematic aspect of speed humps is their effect on [[emergency vehicles]]. Response time is slowed by 3&ndash;5 seconds per hump for [[Fire apparatus|fire trucks and fire engines]] and up to 10 seconds for [[ambulances]] with patients on board.<ref name=\"ITE\"/> Speed humps are thus usually not placed on primary response routes. Speed cushions may be placed on these routes instead.\n\nOccasionally, there is an increase in traffic noise from [[braking]] and [[acceleration]] of vehicles on streets with speed humps, particularly from buses and trucks. Other effects include increased fuel consumption and emissions{{Citatuion needed}} as well as increased wear and tear on brakes, engine and suspension components.\n\nDamage caused by [[snow plow]]s during the winter months is an additional concern.\n\nHeavy [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s, [[Pickup truck|trucks]], and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s are less affected by speed humps, and may not have to slow down as dramatically.\n\nThin cuts are sometimes placed in the middle of a hump in order to allow [[bicycle]] traffic to pass through. However, forcing cyclists to take a particular line on the road compromises their ability to position themselves safely according to the other traffic on the road at the time.\n\n==Speed cushions==\n[[File:Rubber speed cushions.jpg|thumb|right|Speed cushions in Canada. Gaps allow wide-track emergency vehicles to pass at higher speeds than they can through other traffic calming devices like speed humps.]]\n'''Speed cushions''' are a type of speed hump installation designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on emergency vehicle response times. Speed cushions installations are typically made up of several small speed humps installed across the width of the road with spaces between them. They force normal cars to slow down as they ride with one or both wheels over the humps. Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle the cushions without slowing down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nacto.org/docs/usdg/study_speed_humps_speed_slots_and_speed_cushions_johnson.pdf|title=A Comparative Study of Speed Humps, Speed Slots and Speed Cushions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nacto.org/docs/usdg/speed_cushions_grossepoint.pdf|title=\"SPEED CUSHIONS\" A TRAFFIC CALMING TECHNIQUE|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWider, American-style ambulances might also be able to straddle speed cushions. However, in Europe and Australia, where vehicles like the [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] are used most frequently as ambulances, there is no advantage. In these jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are sometimes placed between lanes to allow ambulances to pass unobstructed while driving over the [[Road surface marking|centre line]] during an emergency.\n\n===Advantages===\nSpeed cushions have several distinct advantages over similar [[traffic calming]] devices. Many [[municipalities]] are challenged by opposition to speed humps and speed tables since they slow down [[emergency vehicles]]. Speed cushions address this problem by allowing larger vehicles to straddle the cushion without slowing down. This is also an advantage for [[bus]]es, as lower floor vehicles can sometimes ground out on traditional humps.\n\nSpeed cushions are often less costly than speed humps or tables, and most cities report them to be just as effective. In some jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are placed at more frequent intervals to allow ambulances to pass while driving over the centre line. Large trucks are also not slowed down.\n\n=== Use in North America and Europe ===\nDevelopment of speed cushions has focused primarily on the European context. European vehicles typically have a narrower track width than American vehicles, meaning their left and right wheels are closer together. Emergency vehicles still feature a wide track width, and the difference between them makes speed cushions more applicable.\n\nIn North America, however, consumer vehicles have a track width of {{convert|50|-|59|in|order=flip}}. Many emergency vehicles are also equipped with dual tires on their rear axles. The additional tires limit track width to as narrow as {{convert|48|in|order=flip}}, meaning speed cushions may not be suitable for their intended use.\n\n== Speed tables ==\n[[File:Kurb Extension Nuffield Street.jpg|thumb|right|A less intrusive table in Auckland, New Zealand, which sacrifices some height and visual effect for integration into a high-quality road finish area. Note that part of the traffic calming effect is reached here via rough cobble stones.]]\nA '''speed table''' (or '''flat top hump''' or '''raised pedestrian crossing''')  is designed as a long speed hump with a flat section in the middle.

One sample of 8 sites found a 45% decrease in accidents per year with the use of speed tables.<ref name=\"trafficcalming.org\"/> Wombat crossings may reduce casualties by 63%.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advantages===\nSpeed tables are effective in calming traffic on streets where the speed limit needs to be maintained rather than slowing cars more significantly. Traffic speed, volumes, and accidents have been shown to decrease with the use of tables. Although not as responsive to emergency vehicles as speed cushions, speed tables cause less of a delay than humps and are typically preferred by fire departments over speed humps.<ref name=\"ite.org\"/>\n\n==In the United Kingdom==\nIn the UK, vertical deflection in highways for the purpose of [[traffic calming]] typically takes one of the following forms:\n* Road humps are the most common variety, and are usually round-topped.\n* Speed tables, a type of hump with a central plateau which is both long and broad, and which may include a [[pedestrian crossing]], junction or roundabout, are preferred by some emergency services and bus operators.\n* Speed cushions, a raised portion of road with a flat top only extending over part of the carriageway's width, are used singly, in a [[Curb extension|pinch point]], or in pairs or triples.\n* [[Rumble strip]]s, uneven road surfaces, are now only used in rural areas and retail parks because of the noise.\n\nThe [[Department for Transport]] defines the regulations for the design and use of road humps.<ref>{{cite web\n|publisher=UK Department of Transport\n|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/uksi_19991025_en.pdf\n|title=Highways (Road Humps) Regulations 1999 (replacing the 1996 regulations)\n}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\nSpeed bumps in some areas have been removed after protests by local residents.

Variations include the '''speed hump''', '''speed cushion''', and '''speed table'''.\n\nThe use of vertical deflection devices is widespread around the world, and they are most commonly found to enforce a low [[speed limit]], under {{cvt|40|km/h|mph}} or lower.\n\nAlthough speed bumps are effective in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial\u2014as they can increase traffic noise, may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed, and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed speed bumps that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle can be disruptive for drivers, and may be difficult to navigate for vehicles with low [[Ride height|ground clearance]], even at very low speeds. Many [[sports car]]s have this problem with such speed bumps. Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to [[motorcyclist]]s and [[bicyclist]]s if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment. Speed bumps cost $50\u2013200 and may need replacement over time due to wear.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catalog: Speed Bumps & Humps |url=http://www.speedbumpsandhumps.com/|publisher=Speed Bumps and Humps|access-date=29 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nEach of these devices can be made from a variety of materials, including [[asphalt]], [[concrete]], recycled [[plastic]], [[metal]], or [[Vulcanization|vulcanized rubber]]. Several trade-offs must be made when selecting the material for a new speed cushion. Traditionally most vertical deflection devices have been constructed of asphalt or concrete. Due to the rigidity and durability of these materials, they have more permanence and are more effective at slowing traffic. However, they can be difficult to shape and form into consistent forms and precise dimensions.\n\nRubber products are pre-shaped to standard sizes to meet industry standards. Preformed rubber products are typically bolted down, making them easier to install or remove. Temporary bolt-down installations can be ideal for planners in testing the use and positioning of speed bumps before implementing them in a larger project. Bolt-down products can also be removed or relocated during winter snow periods\u2014where speed bumps are easily concealed and may be damaged by snowplows.\n\n==History==\nOn June 7, 1906, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on an early implementation of what might be considered speed bumps in [[Chatham, New Jersey]], which planned to raise its crosswalks five inches above the road level: \"This scheme of stopping automobile speeding has been discussed by different municipalities, but Chatham is the first place to put it in practice\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Democratic Rate Plan Favored by Roosevelt [and other news]|work=New York Times|date=1906-03-07|page=3}}</ref> The average automobile's top speed at the time was around {{cvt|30|mph|km/h}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n[[Arthur Holly Compton]] was a [[physicist]] and winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics in 1927 for his discoveries resulting in major changes in [[electromagnetic theory]]. He is commonly known for his work on the [[Compton Effect]] with [[X-ray]]s. He also invented what he called \"traffic control bumps,\" the basic design for the speed hump, in 1953. Compton began designs on the speed bump after noticing the speed at which motorists passed Brookings Hall at [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where he was [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Original Traffic control sketch made by Compton in 1953|url=http://library.wustl.edu/units/spec/archives/facts/images/traffic_control_sketch_1953.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615162332/http://library.wustl.edu/units/spec/archives/facts/images/traffic_control_sketch_1953.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2010-06-15|publisher=Washington University Libraries|accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref>\n\nThe British Transport and Road Research Laboratory published a comprehensive report in 1973 examining vehicle behavior for a large variety of different bump geometries.<ref>Road humps for the control of vehicle speeds by G.R.

A speed bump is a bump in a roadway with heights typically ranging between {{convert|3|and|4|in|order=flip}}.

It also produced 47 per cent more particulate matter  (PM) and nearly 60 per cent more carbon monoxide (CO2) emissions. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/01/speed-bumps-could-removed-cut-traffic-pollution-save-lives/]\n<br>\nAnother study estimated that for a private automobile, the increase in fuel consumption due a pass over a speed bump is responsible for fuel waste of 10ml[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136192091500019X]. Multiply this with number of vehicles going over a speed bump every day, and you will come to more than 15 tons per year, fuel wasted on a single speed bump every year.\n\n===Dynamic speed bumps===\nDynamic speed bumps differ from conventional speed bumps in that they only activate if a vehicle is traveling above a certain speed. Vehicles traveling below this speed will not experience the discomfort of a conventional speed bump. Dynamic speed bumps may allow the passage of [[emergency vehicle]]s at higher speeds.\n\nThe [[Actibump]] system, successfully used in Sweden, is based on powered equipment integrated into the road surface, which operates a platform that is lowered a few centimeters when a speeding vehicle approaches. Any vehicle approaching at or under the speed limit will pass on a level road. The system measures the speed of an oncoming vehicle by using radar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Actibump|url=http://www.actibump.com|publisher=Edeva|accessdate=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\nThe [http://smartbumps.com/ SmartBumps] system, successfully used in several places uses a mechanical speed bump built in the road, that raises only for the speeding vehicles. The slow drivers, driving within the speed limit will practically not notice the speed bump. The system measures the speed of the vehicles using sensors on the road. \n\nIn another design, a rubber housing is fitted with a [[pressure relief valve]] that determines the speed of a vehicle. If the vehicle is traveling below the set speed, the valve opens allowing the bump to deflate as the vehicle drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast. The valve can also be set to allow heavy vehicles, such as [[Fire apparatus|fire trucks]], [[ambulance]]s, and [[bus]]es to cross at higher speeds.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1178 |journal=New Scientist |title=Smart speed bumps reward safe drivers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070326103037/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn1178 |archivedate=March 26, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1867157,00.html |work=The Times |title=Smart' road hump will smooth the way for safe drivers |location=London |first=Shirley |last=English |date=November 11, 2005 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113164245/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0%2C%2C2-1867157%2C00.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe use of intelligent speed bumps is not only beneficial for the drivers, but also reduces the bad side-effects of the traditional speed bumps, like excessive pollution and fuel waste.<ref>http://smartbumps.com/the-cost-of-speed-bumps/</ref>\n\n==Speed humps==\n[[File:Asphalt Speed Hump.jpg|thumb|right|Speed hump made of [[asphalt]]]]\nA '''speed hump''' (also called a '''road hump''', or '''undulation''',<ref name=\"ITE\">{{cite web|author=ITE |title=Traffic Calming Measures \u2013 Speed Hump |url=http://www.ite.org/traffic/hump.htm |publisher=Institute of Transportation Engineers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320152041/http://www.ite.org/traffic/hump.htm |archivedate=March 20, 2007 }}</ref> and '''speed ramp''') is a rounded [[traffic calming]] device used to reduce vehicle speed and volume on residential streets. Humps are placed across the road to slow traffic and are often installed in a series of several humps to prevent cars from speeding before and after the hump. Common speed hump shapes are [[parabola|parabolic]], circular, and [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]].<ref name=\"ITE\"/>\n\nGenerally, speed humps have a traverse distance of about {{cvt|12|to|14|ft|order=flip}} and span the width of the road. The height of each hump ranges from {{cvt|3|to|4|in|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"ITE\"/> The traverse distance and height of each hump determines the speed at which traffic will travel over the devices. Shorter traverse lengths and greater heights slow cars most drastically. When placed in a series {{cvt|350|-|550|ft|order=flip}} apart, humps will reduce 85th percentile speeds by {{cvt|8|-|10|mph|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Partington\n|title=Speed Humps\n|url=http://www.trafficcalming.net/speed_humps.htm\n|publisher=Trafficcalming.net\n|accessdate=2014-03-14\n}}</ref>\n\nWarning signs should be used to notify approaching motorists of upcoming humps.

Placement is generally mid-block between intersections.\n\n===Results===\nSpeed humps typically limit vehicle speeds to about {{cvt|15|-|20|mph|order=flip}} at the hump and {{cvt|25|-|30|mph|order=flip}} at the midpoint between humps, depending on spacing. Studies show an average 18% reduction in traffic volume and an average 13% reduction in collisions.<ref name=\"ITE\"/>\n\n=== Comparison to speed bumps ===\nWhile similar to speed bumps, humps are less aggressive than speed bumps at low speeds. Humps are often used on streets, while bumps are used more in parking lots.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPEED BUMPS AND SPEED HUMPS|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/2006/rpt/2006-r-0567.htm|publisher=www.cga.ct.gov|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref> While speed bumps generally slow cars to {{cvt|5|-|10|mph|0|order=flip}}, humps slow cars to {{cvt|15|-|20|mph|order=flip}}. The narrow traverse distance of speed bumps often allows vehicles to pass over them at high speed with only mild disturbance to the wheels and suspension, and hardly affecting the vehicle cab and its occupants. The relatively long slopes of speed humps are less disruptive at low&ndash;moderate speeds, but they create a greater, more sustained vertical deflection; at higher speeds, a more sustained deflection is less-absorbed by vehicle suspensions and has a greater effect on the vehicle as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speed Humps vs. Speed Bumps|url=http://www.maine.gov/mdot/csd/mlrc/technical/shsb.htm|publisher=www.maine.gov|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Problems===\nOne problematic aspect of speed humps is their effect on [[emergency vehicles]]. Response time is slowed by 3&ndash;5 seconds per hump for [[Fire apparatus|fire trucks and fire engines]] and up to 10 seconds for [[ambulances]] with patients on board.<ref name=\"ITE\"/> Speed humps are thus usually not placed on primary response routes. Speed cushions may be placed on these routes instead.\n\nOccasionally, there is an increase in traffic noise from [[braking]] and [[acceleration]] of vehicles on streets with speed humps, particularly from buses and trucks. Other effects include increased fuel consumption and emissions as well as increased wear and tear on brakes, engine and suspension components.\n\nDamage caused by [[snow plow]]s during the winter months is an additional concern.\n\nHeavy [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s, [[Pickup truck|trucks]], and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s are less affected by speed humps, and may not have to slow down as dramatically.\n\nThin cuts are sometimes placed in the middle of a hump in order to allow [[bicycle]] traffic to pass through. However, forcing cyclists to take a particular line on the road compromises their ability to position themselves safely according to the other traffic on the road at the time.\n\n==Speed cushions==\n[[File:Rubber speed cushions.jpg|thumb|right|Speed cushions in Canada. Gaps allow wide-track emergency vehicles to pass at higher speeds than they can through other traffic calming devices like speed humps.]]\n'''Speed cushions''' are a type of speed hump installation designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on emergency vehicle response times. Speed cushions installations are typically made up of several small speed humps installed across the width of the road with spaces between them. They force normal cars to slow down as they ride with one or both wheels over the humps. Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle the cushions without slowing down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nacto.org/docs/usdg/study_speed_humps_speed_slots_and_speed_cushions_johnson.pdf|title=A Comparative Study of Speed Humps, Speed Slots and Speed Cushions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nacto.org/docs/usdg/speed_cushions_grossepoint.pdf|title=\"SPEED CUSHIONS\" A TRAFFIC CALMING TECHNIQUE|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWider, American-style ambulances might also be able to straddle speed cushions. However, in Europe and Australia, where vehicles like the [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] are used most frequently as ambulances, there is no advantage. In these jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are sometimes placed between lanes to allow ambulances to pass unobstructed while driving over the [[Road surface marking|centre line]] during an emergency.\n\n===Advantages===\nSpeed cushions have several distinct advantages over similar [[traffic calming]] devices. Many [[municipalities]] are challenged by opposition to speed humps and speed tables since they slow down [[emergency vehicles]]. Speed cushions address this problem by allowing larger vehicles to straddle the cushion without slowing down. This is also an advantage for [[bus]]es, as lower floor vehicles can sometimes ground out on traditional humps.\n\nSpeed cushions are often less costly than speed humps or tables, and most cities report them to be just as effective. In some jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are placed at more frequent intervals to allow ambulances to pass while driving over the centre line. Large trucks are also not slowed down.\n\n=== Use in North America and Europe ===\nDevelopment of speed cushions has focused primarily on the European context. European vehicles typically have a narrower track width than American vehicles, meaning their left and right wheels are closer together. Emergency vehicles still feature a wide track width, and the difference between them makes speed cushions more applicable.\n\nIn North America, however, consumer vehicles have a track width of {{convert|50|-|59|in|order=flip}}. Many emergency vehicles are also equipped with dual tires on their rear axles. The additional tires limit track width to as narrow as {{convert|48|in|order=flip}}, meaning speed cushions may not be suitable for their intended use.\n\n== Speed tables ==\n[[File:Kurb Extension Nuffield Street.jpg|thumb|right|A less intrusive table in Auckland, New Zealand, which sacrifices some height and visual effect for integration into a high-quality road finish area. Note that part of the traffic calming effect is reached here via rough cobble stones.]]\nA '''speed table''' (or '''flat top hump''' or '''raised pedestrian crossing''')  is designed as a long speed hump with a flat section in the middle. Speed tables are generally long enough for the entire [[wheelbase]] of a passenger car to rest on top.<ref name=\"ite.org\">{{cite web|author=ITE |title=Traffic Calming Measures |url=http://www.ite.org/traffic/table.htm |publisher=Institute of Transportation Engineers |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414214406/http://www.ite.org/traffic/table.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2008 }}</ref> The long, flat design allows cars to pass without slowing as significantly as with speed humps or cushions.<ref name=\"trafficcalming.org\">{{cite web |author=trafficcalming.org|title=Speed Tables|url=http://trafficcalming.org/measures/speed-tables/ |publisher=Fehr and Peers |accessdate=2014-03-14}}</ref> Because they slow cars less than similar devices, speed tables are often used on roads with typical residential speed limits.\n\nSpeed tables can also be signed as [[pedestrian crossing]]s, namely [[Zebra crossing|zebra crossings]]. A raised zebra crossing is referred to as a  '''wombat  crossing''' in Australia.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/wombat-crossings-reduce-pedestrian-casualties-by-63-per-cent-says-new-study-20170516-gw5w2k.html|title='Wombat crossings' reduce pedestrian casualties by 63 per cent says new study|last=Power|first=Julie|date=May 16, 2017|website=Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref> Other road features may be included, such as [[junctions]], or even [[Roundabout|mini-roundabouts]]. Speed tables are used with zebra crossings repeatedly in [[Leighton Buzzard]].\n\n===Results===\nTypical speeds resulting from {{convert|22|ft|m|0|order=flip|adj=on}} speed tables are {{convert|20|-|30|mph|km/h|order=flip}}. One sample of 8 sites found a 45% decrease in accidents per year with the use of speed tables.<ref name=\"trafficcalming.org\"/> Wombat crossings may reduce casualties by 63%.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advantages===\nSpeed tables are effective in calming traffic on streets where the speed limit needs to be maintained rather than slowing cars more significantly. Traffic speed, volumes, and accidents have been shown to decrease with the use of tables. Although not as responsive to emergency vehicles as speed cushions, speed tables cause less of a delay than humps and are typically preferred by fire departments over speed humps.<ref name=\"ite.org\"/>\n\n==In the United Kingdom==\nIn the UK, vertical deflection in highways for the purpose of [[traffic calming]] typically takes one of the following forms:\n* Road humps are the most common variety, and are usually round-topped.\n* Speed tables, a type of hump with a central plateau which is both long and broad, and which may include a [[pedestrian crossing]], junction or roundabout, are preferred by some emergency services and bus operators.\n* Speed cushions, a raised portion of road with a flat top only extending over part of the carriageway's width, are used singly, in a [[Curb extension|pinch point]], or in pairs or triples.\n* [[Rumble strip]]s, uneven road surfaces, are now only used in rural areas and retail parks because of the noise.\n\nThe [[Department for Transport]] defines the regulations for the design and use of road humps.<ref>{{cite web\n|publisher=UK Department of Transport\n|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1999/uksi_19991025_en.pdf\n|title=Highways (Road Humps) Regulations 1999 (replacing the 1996 regulations)\n}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition===\nSpeed bumps in some areas have been removed after protests by local residents.

{"title_page": "DJ EFN", "text_new": "'''DJ EFN''' (born Eric Fernando Narciandi on May 28, 1975) is an American [[Music executive|record label executive]] and [[DJ]], based in [[Miami]], who specializes in [[hip-hop]]. Since the early 1990s, operating most often under the banner of Crazy Hood Productions, EFN has worked in the hip-hop industry in a variety of capacities, including as a mixtape producer, album producer and A&R consultant, radio host, marketing and promotions specialist, clothing retailer, artist manager, and film producer. He is currently best known as the co-host (with the rapper [[Noreaga]]) of \"Drink Champs,\" a weekly podcast carried by [[Sean \"Diddy\" Combs]]'s [[Revolt]] TV network.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn Eric Fernando Narciandi in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to parents of [[Cuban people|Cuban]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] backgrounds, DJ EFN moved with his family to [[Kendall, Florida]] (an unincorporated community in Miami-Dade County) in 1986.  He graduated from [[Miami Sunset Senior High School]] in 1993, and received and Associate in Arts degree from [[Miami Dade College]] in 2002.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Crazy Hood Mixtapes, Crazy Sounds Record Pool, Hood DJs===\nA fan of the mixtapes emanating from New York City, DJ EFN began producing mixtapes of his own in Miami.  \"There was no consistent mixtape DJ in Miami, no one who ever really played the music ''from'' Miami,\" he said in an interview with Julia Beverly of ''[[Ozone (magazine)|Ozone]]'' magazine. \"Everybody listened to [[DJ Clue]] or [[Tony Touch]].  It was good music, but I didn't want to hear shouts to Brooklyn or the Bronx.  I wanted to shout out Miami and help to put on the local cats.\"<ref>Beverly, Julia, \"DJ Profile,\" ''Ozone'', Memorial Day Weekend, 2005</ref>\n\nEFN's first Crazy Hood mixtape was issued in 1993. During the next two decades he produced 42 volumes of the mixtape, featuring hip-hop artists such as [[Outkast]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Capone-N-Noreaga]], [[KRS-One]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Bun B]], [[Ja Rule]], [[Sean Paul]], [[Joe Budden]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], and [[David Banner]].\n\nEFN founded Miami's Crazy Sounds Record Pool in 1997 (it operated through 2007) and Hood DJs, an international coalition.\n\nIn 2002, DJ EFN was named the Best New Mixtape DJ at the 7th Annual Justo Awards. In 2003, he was named Best Mixtape DJ at the First Annual Miami Urban Music Awards.\n\n===CHP Marketing and Promotions===\nThe effectiveness of EFN's street promotion for his Crazy Hood mixtapes eventually attracted the attention of various national brands in search of help with their products in the Miami market. Founded in 1997, CHP Marketing and Promotions has numbered [[Tommy Boy Records]], [[Slip-n-Slide Records]], [[Loud Records]], [[Epic Records]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Eck\u014d Unltd.]] among its clients over the years. Between 2001 and 2004, Crazy Hood ran [[Def Jam Recordings]]'s street teams in south Florida. Today, the firm counts [[Bad Boy Records]], Ciroc Entertainment, [[Sean John]], and [[YMCMB]]<ref>\"Marketing 101 \u2013 YMCMB's Christmas-Themed Street Marketing Campaign in Miami,\" The 305.com, December 29, 2011, http://the305.com/2011/12/29/marketing-101-ymcmbs-christmas-themed-street-marketing-campaign-in-miami</ref> among their most consistent clients.\n\nIn 2002 EFN was named a member of Eck\u014d Unltd.'s hip-hop dream team, a special feature of that year's edition of [[EA Sports]]' \"[[Madden NFL]]\" game. His teammates included [[De La Soul]], [[Xzibit]], and [[A Tribe Called Quest]].\n\n===College Radio, Pirate Radio, Satellite Radio, Digital Radio===\nDuring the 1990s, EFN deejayed on local pirate radio stations and at the [[University of Miami]]'s [[WVUM]].  Between 2009 and 2011, he teamed up with the rapper [[N.O.R.E.]] to host a satellite radio show for [[Sirius XM]] called \"Militainment Crazy Raw Radio,\" a title that gave equal weight to N.O.R.E.'s Militainment brand, to Crazy Hood, and to 66 Raw, the channel on Sirius XM which carried the show.<ref>\"Militainment Crazy Raw Radio on Hip-Hop Nation,\" 57thAve.com, November 11, 2008, {{cite web|url=http://57thave.com/?p%3D377 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 11, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192458/http://57thave.com/?p=377 |archivedate=January 2, 2014 }}</ref>  In 2015, EFN began hosting a weekly show called \"OG Radio\" for the [[Dash Radio]] digital broadcasting platform.\n\n===Crazy Goods===\nIn 1997, with the opening of the Crazy Goods store in West Kendall, EFN ventured into the world of hip-hop clothing and retailing. It thrived until EFN shut it down in 2000, allowing him to concentrate more fully on his musical activities.\n\n===Crazy Hood Productions===\nUnder the aegis of Crazy Hood Productions, DJ EFN has long been active as an artist manager and label executive. In the 1990s, Crazy Hood managed and made records for [[Da Alliance]] (a/k/a Da All)) and [[Poetik Symbolz]]. Today the firm manages and records Da Alliance (of which he is a member), [[Michael Garcia (rapper)|Garcia]], [[Heckler]], [[\u00a1Mayday!]], and [[Wrekonize]], as well as the producers [[Big Drain]], [[Hazardis Soundz]], and [[Beats-N-Da-Hood]].\n\nEFN was executive producer of ''Who's Crazy?'' by Da All,<ref>''Who's Crazy?'' by Da All, credits on allmusic.com, http://www.allmusic.com/album/whos-crazy-mw0000021509/credits</ref> and ''Anti-Social''<ref>''Anti-Social'' by Garcia, credits on allmusic.com, http://www.allmusic.com/album/anti-social-mw0000674813/credits</ref> and ''Life Unscripted''<ref>''Life Unscripted'' by Garcia, credits on CrazyHoodProductions.com, http://crazyhoodproductions.bandcamp.com/album/life-unscripted</ref> by Garcia.

Not a mixtape, but an album of all original music, the DJ has described it as \"a passion project.\" It features production by [[DJ Premier]], [[Buckwild]], Nomadic Trackz, BeatsNdaHood, Hazardis Soundz, Miami Beat Wave, Nonms, The Guild, Big Drain and Matt Harris, and rapping by [[Bun B]], Gunplay, [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[King Tee]], [[Mc Eiht]], [[Trick Daddy]], [[Dead Prez]], [[M.O.P.]], Denzel Curry, [[Inspectah Deck]], [[Sizzla]], [[Sean Price]], [[Milk Dee]], [[Killer Mike]], [[Umar Bin Hassan]], [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]] and others. Jacob Katel, writing in ''[[Miami New Times]]'', praised the album for matching \"the best underground talent in America with some of the godfathers of the genre to make an indelible classic.\"<ref>http://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/dj-efn-on-his-new-album-another-time-6475890</ref> Chosen as one of \"The 15 Best Hip-Hop Albums of 2015\" by [[Ambrosia For Heads]], EFN's work on ''Another Time'' was praised for deftly showing that \"the walls and categories used to separate MCs due to age, era, region, and style are self-inflicted.\"<ref>http://ambrosiaforheads.com/2015/12/ambrosia-for-heads-presents-our-15-best-hip-hop-albums-of-2015</ref>\n\n===EFN Visual Mixtapes and Crazy Hood Film Academy===\nIn collaboration with Miami-based [[Dre Films]], EFN established EFN Visual Mixtapes in 2010, when it became clear that the artists with whom he was working needed music videos to promote their recordings. The firm proceeded to produce videos featuring \u00a1Mayday!<ref>\"Nothin' (Remix),\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOpj0Z51DsE</ref> [[Ras Kass]],<ref>\"Corleone,\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCltUFSFiG4</ref> [[Gunplay (rapper)|Gunplay]], [[Tech N9ne]], and N.O.R.E.<ref>\"Talk to Em,\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZASaySOTao</ref>\t\n\nIn 2012, doing business as the Crazy Hood Film Academy, EFN and Garcia produced their first feature film. A documentary account of the hip-hop scene in Cuba entitled \"Coming Home,\"<ref>\"Coming Home\" Documentary teaser, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orEWQrdwpIs</ref> the film was named Best Documentary at The People's Film Festival in 2013.<ref>\"2013 TPFF Winners,\" http://thepeoplesfilmfestival.com/2013-tpff-winners/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731020916/http://thepeoplesfilmfestival.com/2013-tpff-winners/ |date=2013-07-31 }}</ref> Q. Salazar, writing for ''The Hollywood Shuffle'', described it as \"a powerful film that displays the influence hip-hop has given a people who are oppressed and suppressed.

Since the early 1990s, operating most often under the banner of Crazy Hood Productions, EFN has worked in the hip-hop industry in a variety of capacities, including as a mixtape producer, album producer and A&R consultant, radio host, marketing and promotions specialist, clothing retailer, artist manager, and film producer. He is currently best known as the co-host (with the rapper [[Noreaga]]) of \"Drink Champs,\" a weekly podcast carried by [[Sean \"Diddy\" Combs]]'s [[Revolt]] TV network.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn Eric Fernando Narciandi in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] to parents of [[Cuban people|Cuban]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] backgrounds, DJ EFN moved with his family to [[Kendall, Florida]] (an unincorporated community in Miami-Dade County) in 1986.  He graduated from [[Miami Sunset Senior High School]] in 1993, and received and Associate in Arts degree from [[Miami Dade College]] in 2002.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Crazy Hood Mixtapes, Crazy Sounds Record Pool, Hood DJs===\nA fan of the mixtapes emanating from New York City, DJ EFN began producing mixtapes of his own in Miami.  \"There was no consistent mixtape DJ in Miami, no one who ever really played the music ''from'' Miami,\" he said in an interview with Julia Beverly of ''[[Ozone (magazine)|Ozone]]'' magazine. \"Everybody listened to [[DJ Clue]] or [[Tony Touch]].  It was good music, but I didn't want to hear shouts to Brooklyn or the Bronx.  I wanted to shout out Miami and help to put on the local cats.\"<ref>Beverly, Julia, \"DJ Profile,\" ''Ozone'', Memorial Day Weekend, 2005</ref>\n\nEFN's first Crazy Hood mixtape was issued in 1993. During the next two decades he produced 42 volumes of the mixtape, featuring hip-hop artists such as [[Outkast]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Capone-N-Noreaga]], [[KRS-One]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Bun B]], [[Ja Rule]], [[Sean Paul]], [[Joe Budden]], [[Lil Jon]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], and [[David Banner]].\n\nEFN founded Miami's Crazy Sounds Record Pool in 1997 (it operated though 2007) and Hood DJs, an international coalition.\n\nIn 2002, DJ EFN was named the Best New Mixtape DJ at the 7th Annual Justo Awards. In 2003, he was named Best Mixtape DJ at the First Annual Miami Urban Music Awards.\n\n===CHP Marketing and Promotions===\nThe effectiveness of EFN's street promotion for his Crazy Hood mixtapes eventually attracted the attention of various national brands in search of help with their products in the Miami market. Founded in 1997, CHP Marketing and Promotions has numbered [[Tommy Boy Records]], [[Slip-n-Slide Records]], [[Loud Records]], [[Epic Records]], [[Coca-Cola]], and [[Eck\u014d Unltd.]] among its clients over the years. Between 2001 and 2004, Crazy Hood ran [[Def Jam Recordings]]'s street teams in south Florida.
