{"title_page": "Swinging (sexual practice)", "text_new": "{{Close Relationships}}\n'''Swinging''', sometimes called '''wife swapping''', '''husband swapping''' or '''partner swapping''', is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] in which both singles and partners in a [[committed relationship]] engage in such activities with others as a [[casual sex|recreational]] or social activity.<ref name=\"case_for_swingers\">{{cite journal\n |journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality\n |last=Bergstrand\n |first=Curtis\n |author2=Blevins Williams, Jennifer\n |date=2000-10-10\n |title=Today's Alternative Marriage Styles: The Case of Swingers\n |volume=3\n |accessdate=2010-01-24\n |url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume3/swing/body.htm}}\n</ref> Swinging is a form of [[non-monogamy]] and is an [[open relationship]]. People may choose a swinging lifestyle for a variety of reasons. Many cite an increased quality and quantity of sex. Some people may engage in swinging to add variety into their otherwise conventional sex lives or due to their curiosity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship.<ref name=\"case_for_swingers\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://swingershelp.com/why-start-swinging/|title=Why Start Swinging?|accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe phenomenon of swinging, or at least its wider discussion and practice, is regarded by some as arising from the freer attitudes to sexual activity after the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, the invention and availability of the [[contraceptive pill]], and the emergence of treatments for many of the [[sexually transmitted disease]]s that were known at that time. The adoption of [[safe sex]] practices became more common in the late 1980s.\n\nThe swinger community sometimes refers to itself as \"the lifestyle\", or as \"the alternative lifestyle\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bergstrand|first=Curtis R.|title=Swinging in America : love, sex, and marriage in the 21st century|year=2010|publisher=Praeger/ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0313379666|author2=Sinski, Jennifer Blevins }}</ref> <!-- not supported in article: Another term, \u201chotwife / hotwifing\u201d specifically refers to a married woman who often has sexual relations with different men, with the approval of her husband. -->\n\n== Description ==\n[[John Stossel]] produced an investigative news report into the swinging lifestyle. Stossel's report in 2005 cited [[Terry Gould]]'s research, which concluded that \"couples swing in order to not cheat on their partners\". When Stossel asked swinging couples whether they worry their spouse will \"find they like someone else better,\" one male replied, \"People in the swinging community swing for a reason. They don't swing to go out and find a new wife;\" a woman asserted, \"It makes women more confident \u2013 that they are the ones in charge.\" Stossel interviewed 12 marriage counselors. According to Stossel, \"not one of them said don't do it,\" though some said \"getting sexual thrills outside of marriage can threaten a marriage\". Nevertheless, swingers whom Stossel interviewed claimed \"their marriages are stronger because they don't have affairs and they don't lie to each other.\"<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Health/story?id=2395727&page=1#.UG4e3U3A_Jc |title=The 'Lifestyle' \u2013 Real-Life Wife Swaps |date=18 March 2005 |publisher=ABC 20/20}}</ref>\n\nSwinging can take place in a number of contexts, ranging from spontaneous sexual activity involving partner swapping or adding a third or more participants at an informal gathering of friends to planned regular social meetings to \"[[Casual sex|hooking up]]\" with like-minded people at a [[sex club]] (also known as a swinger club, not to be confused with a [[strip club]]). Different clubs offer varied facilities and atmospheres, and often hold \"theme\" nights.\n\nSwinging is also known to take place in semi-public venues such as hotels, resorts, or cruise ships, or often in private homes.<ref name=\"Goodman\">{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Hallie |title=Happily Married Swingers |url=http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/happy-swinger-couples |publisher=Redbook |accessdate=2 July 2013|date=September 2017 }}</ref> Furthermore, many websites that cater to swinging couples now exist, some boasting hundreds of thousands of members.<ref name=\"Goodman\"/>\n\nIn 2018, a study of the prevalence of nonmonogamous practices in the United States estimated that 2.35% of Americans currently self-identify as swingers and 4.76% had identified as swingers at some point in their lifetime.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.31234/osf.io/st2k5 |title=Counting polyamorists who count: Prevalence and definitions of an under-researched form of consensual nonmonogamy |last1=Burleigh |first1=Tyler |last2=Rubel |first2=Alicia |journal=PsyArXiv}}</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\n=== Relationship quality ===\nResearch on swinging has been conducted in the United States since the late 1960s. One 2000 study, based on an Internet questionnaire addressed to visitors of swinger-related sites, found swingers are happier in their relationships than the norm.<ref name=\"case_for_swingers\" />\n\n60% said that swinging improved their relationship; 1.7% said swinging made their relationship less happy. Approximately 50% of those who rated their relationship \"very happy\" before becoming swingers maintained their relationship had become happier. 90% of those with less happy relationships said swinging improved them. Almost 70% of swingers claimed no problem with jealousy; approximately 25% admitted \"I have difficulty controlling jealousy when swinging\" as \"somewhat true\", while 6% said this was \"yes, very much\" true. Swingers rate themselves happier (\"very happy\": 59% of swingers compared to 32% of non-swingers) and their lives more \"exciting\" (76% of swingers compared to 54% of non-swingers) than non-swingers, by significantly large margins. There was no significant difference between responses of men and women, although more males (70%) than females completed the survey. This study, which only polled self-identified swingers, is of limited use to a broader application to the rest of society ([[external validity]]) owing to [[self-selection bias|self-selected sampling]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSome believe sexual attraction is part of human nature and should be openly enjoyed by a committed or married couple. Some swingers cite divorce data in the US, claiming the lack of quality of sex and spousal infidelity are significant factors in divorce. One study showed 37% of husbands and 29% of wives admit at least one extramarital affair (Reinisch, 1990), and divorce rates for first marriages approached 60%.\n\n=== Sexually transmitted infections ===\nSwingers are exposed to the same types of risks as people who engage in [[casual sex]], with the main concerns being the risk of pregnancy and of contracting a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI). Some swingers engage in [[unprotected sex]], a practice known as [[barebacking]], while others follow [[safe sex]] practices and will not engage with others who do not also practice safe sex. Swingers may reduce the risk of STI by exchanging STI test results and [[serosorting]]. Proponents of swinging argue that safe sex is accepted within the swinging community and the risk of sexual disease is the same for them as for the general population&nbsp;\u2013 and that some populations of sexually non-monogamous people have clearly lower rates of STIs than the general population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26395880 |title=A Comparison of Sexual Health History and Practices among Monogamous and Consensually Nonmonogamous Sexual Partners. |accessdate=2020-04-02 |publisher=NCBI}}</ref> Opponents are also concerned about the risk of pregnancy and STIs such as [[HIV]], arguing that even protected sex is risky given that some STIs may be spread regardless of the use of condoms, such as [[Herpes]] and [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV]]. In a 1992 study, an overall 7% of swingers had quit swinging because of the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic. It was also stated that 62% of swingers changed their sex practices, by becoming more selective with partners or by practicing safe sex.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jenks|first1=Richard J.|date=|year=1998|title=Swinging: A Review of the Literature|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=27|issue=5|pages=507\u2013521|doi=10.1023/a:1018708730945|via=}}</ref>\n\nA Dutch study that compared the medical records of self-reported swingers to that of the general population found that STI prevalence was highest in young people, homosexual men, and swingers.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/sti.2009.041954 |pmid=20577016 |title=Older and swinging; need to identify hidden and emerging risk groups at STI clinics |journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=315\u2013317 |year=2010 |last1=Dukers-Muijrers |first1=N.

In addition, according to the conclusions of the report, the STI rates of swingers were in fact nearly identical to those of non-swinging straight couples, and concluded that the safest demographic for STI infection were female prostitutes. According to the Dutch study, \"the combined rates of [[chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]] were just over 10% among straight people, 14% among gay men, just under 5% in female prostitutes, and 10.4% among swingers.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/23/us-sex-diseases-swingers-idUSTRE65M6NX20100623 |work=Reuters |title=Disease risk higher for swingers than prostitutes |date=2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Pregnancy ===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\nPregnancy is regarded as a possible undesirable consequence of engaging in swinging sexual activities, which is the same as for monogamous sex. The chances of pregnancy can be minimized, including by a tubal ligation (female sterilization), vasectomy (male sterilization), or having a group entirely made of menopausal women. Other solutions include using condoms or the contraceptive pill. Proper use of a condom with an effective birth control method minimises the risk of pregnancy and transmission of STIs.<ref name=\"Condom Effectiveness\">{{cite web|title=Condom Effectiveness |url=https://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/index.html |work=cdc.gov |accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n== In Western society ==\nAccording to [[Terry Gould]]'s ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers'',<ref>Terry Gould, ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers''.

People may choose a swinging lifestyle for a variety of reasons. Many cite an increased quality and quantity of sex. Some people may engage in swinging to add variety into their otherwise conventional sex lives or due to their curiosity. Some couples see swinging as a healthy outlet and means to strengthen their relationship.<ref name=\"case_for_swingers\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.netcom.com/~jonnall/babylon/pattys.htm|title=Why Swing?|accessdate=4 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe phenomenon of swinging, or at least its wider discussion and practice, is regarded by some as arising from the freer attitudes to sexual activity after the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s, the invention and availability of the [[contraceptive pill]], and the emergence of treatments for many of the [[sexually transmitted disease]]s that were known at that time. The adoption of [[safe sex]] practices became more common in the late 1980s.\n\nThe swinger community sometimes refers to itself as \"the lifestyle\", or as \"the alternative lifestyle\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bergstrand|first=Curtis R.|title=Swinging in America : love, sex, and marriage in the 21st century|year=2010|publisher=Praeger/ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-0313379666|author2=Sinski, Jennifer Blevins }}</ref> <!-- not supported in article: Another term, \u201chotwife / hotwifing\u201d specifically refers to a married woman who often has sexual relations with different men, with the approval of her husband. -->\n\n== Description ==\n[[John Stossel]] produced an investigative news report into the swinging lifestyle. Stossel's report in 2005 cited [[Terry Gould]]'s research, which concluded that \"couples swing in order to not cheat on their partners\". When Stossel asked swinging couples whether they worry their spouse will \"find they like someone else better,\" one male replied, \"People in the swinging community swing for a reason. They don't swing to go out and find a new wife;\" a woman asserted, \"It makes women more confident \u2013 that they are the ones in charge.\" Stossel interviewed 12 marriage counselors. According to Stossel, \"not one of them said don't do it,\" though some said \"getting sexual thrills outside of marriage can threaten a marriage\". Nevertheless, swingers whom Stossel interviewed claimed \"their marriages are stronger because they don't have affairs and they don't lie to each other.\"<ref name=\"ABC\">{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Health/story?id=2395727&page=1#.UG4e3U3A_Jc |title=The 'Lifestyle' \u2013 Real-Life Wife Swaps |date=18 March 2005 |publisher=ABC 20/20}}</ref>\n\nSwinging can take place in a number of contexts, ranging from spontaneous sexual activity involving partner swapping or adding a third or more participants at an informal gathering of friends to planned regular social meetings to \"[[Casual sex|hooking up]]\" with like-minded people at a [[sex club]] (also known as a swinger club, not to be confused with a [[strip club]]). Different clubs offer varied facilities and atmospheres, and often hold \"theme\" nights.\n\nSwinging is also known to take place in semi-public venues such as hotels, resorts, or cruise ships, or often in private homes.<ref name=\"Goodman\">{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Hallie |title=Happily Married Swingers |url=http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/happy-swinger-couples |publisher=Redbook |accessdate=2 July 2013|date=September 2017 }}</ref> Furthermore, many websites that cater to swinging couples now exist, some boasting hundreds of thousands of members.<ref name=\"Goodman\"/>\n\nIn 2018, a study of the prevalence of nonmonogamous practices in the United States estimated that 2.35% of Americans currently self-identify as swingers and 4.76% had identified as swingers at some point in their lifetime.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.31234/osf.io/st2k5 |title=Counting polyamorists who count: Prevalence and definitions of an under-researched form of consensual nonmonogamy |last1=Burleigh |first1=Tyler |last2=Rubel |first2=Alicia |journal=PsyArXiv}}</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\n=== Relationship quality ===\nResearch on swinging has been conducted in the United States since the late 1960s. One 2000 study, based on an Internet questionnaire addressed to visitors of swinger-related sites, found swingers are happier in their relationships than the norm.<ref name=\"case_for_swingers\" />\n\n60% said that swinging improved their relationship; 1.7% said swinging made their relationship less happy. Approximately 50% of those who rated their relationship \"very happy\" before becoming swingers maintained their relationship had become happier. 90% of those with less happy relationships said swinging improved them. Almost 70% of swingers claimed no problem with jealousy; approximately 25% admitted \"I have difficulty controlling jealousy when swinging\" as \"somewhat true\", while 6% said this was \"yes, very much\" true. Swingers rate themselves happier (\"very happy\": 59% of swingers compared to 32% of non-swingers) and their lives more \"exciting\" (76% of swingers compared to 54% of non-swingers) than non-swingers, by significantly large margins. There was no significant difference between responses of men and women, although more males (70%) than females completed the survey. This study, which only polled self-identified swingers, is of limited use to a broader application to the rest of society ([[external validity]]) owing to [[self-selection bias|self-selected sampling]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSome believe sexual attraction is part of human nature and should be openly enjoyed by a committed or married couple. Some swingers cite divorce data in the US, claiming the lack of quality of sex and spousal infidelity are significant factors in divorce. One study showed 37% of husbands and 29% of wives admit at least one extramarital affair (Reinisch, 1990), and divorce rates for first marriages approached 60%.\n\n=== Sexually transmitted infections ===\nSwingers are exposed to the same types of risks as people who engage in [[casual sex]], with the main concerns being the risk of pregnancy and of contracting a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI). Some swingers engage in [[unprotected sex]], a practice known as [[barebacking]], while others follow [[safe sex]] practices and will not engage with others who do not also practice safe sex. Swingers may reduce the risk of STI by exchanging STI test results and [[serosorting]]. Proponents of swinging argue that safe sex is accepted within the swinging community and the risk of sexual disease is the same for them as for the general population&nbsp;\u2013 and that some populations of sexually non-monogamous people have clearly lower rates of STIs than the general population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aim-med.org/news/2009/10/20/1256052533/ |title=Superior Court Quashes CAL-OSHA'S Attempt to Subpoena Confidential AIM Medical Records |accessdate=2009-10-21 |date= 2009-10-20 |publisher=AIM Medical}}</ref> Opponents are also concerned about the risk of pregnancy and STIs such as [[HIV]], arguing that even protected sex is risky given that some STIs may be spread regardless of the use of condoms, such as [[Herpes]] and [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV]]. In a 1992 study, an overall 7% of swingers had quit swinging because of the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic. It was also stated that 62% of swingers changed their sex practices, by becoming more selective with partners or by practicing safe sex.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jenks|first1=Richard J.|date=|year=1998|title=Swinging: A Review of the Literature|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=27|issue=5|pages=507\u2013521|doi=10.1023/a:1018708730945|via=}}</ref>\n\nA Dutch study that compared the medical records of self-reported swingers to that of the general population found that STI prevalence was highest in young people, homosexual men, and swingers.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/sti.2009.041954 |pmid=20577016 |title=Older and swinging; need to identify hidden and emerging risk groups at STI clinics |journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections |volume=86 |issue=4 |pages=315\u2013317 |year=2010 |last1=Dukers-Muijrers |first1=N.

In addition, according to the conclusions of the report, the STI rates of swingers were in fact nearly identical to those of non-swinging straight couples, and concluded that the safest demographic for STI infection were female prostitutes. According to the Dutch study, \"the combined rates of [[chlamydia]] and [[gonorrhea]] were just over 10% among straight people, 14% among gay men, just under 5% in female prostitutes, and 10.4% among swingers.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/23/us-sex-diseases-swingers-idUSTRE65M6NX20100623 |work=Reuters |title=Disease risk higher for swingers than prostitutes |date=2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Pregnancy ===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2019}}\nPregnancy is regarded as a possible undesirable consequence of engaging in swinging sexual activities, which is the same as for monogamous sex. The chances of pregnancy can be minimized, including by a tubal ligation (female sterilization), vasectomy (male sterilization), or having a group entirely made of menopausal women. Other solutions include using condoms or the contraceptive pill. Proper use of a condom with an effective birth control method minimises the risk of pregnancy and transmission of STIs.<ref name=\"Condom Effectiveness\">{{cite web|title=Condom Effectiveness |url=http://www.advocatesforyouth.org/publications/416 |work=advocatesforyouth.org |accessdate=2016-05-16}}</ref>\n\n== In Western society ==\nAccording to [[Terry Gould]]'s ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers'',<ref>Terry Gould, ''The Lifestyle: a look at the erotic rites of swingers''.

He was known for his works on Greek literature, and translations, and in 1963 published, with [[Cyril Stanley Smith]], a translation of the works on [[metallurgy]] by [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Greenfield Hawthorne was born in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], England,<ref name=CT.19770312/><ref name=MTRN.19770312/> on 6 June 1915.{{sfn|Hawthorne|1949|p=1}} He had two brothers, Edward and [[William Hawthorne|William]].<ref name=CT.19770312/> In 1937 he graduated with an honours degree in classics from [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]],<ref name=MG.19370722/> and two years later received a [[master's degree]] from [[Harvard University]].<ref name=CT.19770312/><ref name=BG.19390622/> During [[World War II]] Hawthorne served in many diplomatic posts, including commercial [[attach\u00e9]] in the British Embassy in Belgium.<ref name=CT.19770312/> In 1946 he was awarded another master's, this one by Cambridge.<ref name=CT.19770312/>\n\nIn 1949, while a professor at the [[University of Chicago]], Hawthorne obtained a [[Ph.D.]] there, with guidance from [[Gertrude Smith]] and [[Benedict Einarson]].<ref name=CT.19770312/> At the time, Chicago was one of the very few schools to offer a doctorate in classics.<ref name=SLPD.19680212/> Hawthorne's dissertation, ''Gorgias of Leontini: A Critical Appraisal with Translation and Commentary of the Extant Fragments'', offered what he described as the first complete English translation of the fragmentary writings of [[Gorgias]] of [[Leontini]].{{sfn|Hawthorne|1949|p=ii}}\n\n== Career ==\nHawthorne was named an assistant professor at the University of Chicago in 1946.<ref name=CT.19770312/> In 1952 he was made an associate professor of classics, and from 1957 to 1960 he chaired the department.<ref name=CT.19770312/> From 1956 to 1963, he was also the president of the Chicago Society of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]].<ref name=CT.19770312/> In 1957 he was awarded a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholarship]] to undertake research at the American School of Classical Studies in [[Athens]], Greece,<ref name=CT.19570728/> where he also conducted excavations.<ref name=CT.19581030/><ref name=CC.19611005/><ref name=PI.19631009/> He lectured on the subject of archaeology, including as a visitor to places like the Universities of [[University of Iowa|Iowa]] and [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]].<ref name=ICPC.19611004/><ref name=MS.19680328/>\n\nIn 1963 Hawthorne, together with [[Cyril Stanley Smith]], published a translation of the works on [[metallurgy]] by [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]]. The book took a technical approach, and followed a 1961 translation by [[Charles Reginald Dodwell]] that took a [[Philology|philological]] approach.{{sfn|White Jr.|1964|pp=225, 232}} As [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.]] wrote, \"[h]enceforth anyone dealing with Theophilus must read both these books simultaneously, one in each hand. While Smith and Hawthorne built on Dodwell, the latter, save in specific instances, remains authoritative for the Latin text ... Smith, on the other hand, being one of the world's eminent metallurgists, approaches the text less in terms of philology than as one who shares Theophilus's own technical concerns.\"{{sfn|White Jr.|1964|p=225}}\n\nFollowing a student [[sit-in]] in 1969, Hawthorne called the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' to laud the university's \"pioneering\" approach.<ref name=CT.19690215/> As he said, \"[t]he sit-in at Chicago is now over, without bloodshed, beatings, or other violent acts ... Where other colleges here and abroad have called in the police, the national guard, the military, this university, dedicated as it is to the solution of problems by intellectual, reasoning, and patient 'confrontation' of human minds has arrived at a decent, fair, and honorable solution of this crisis.\"<ref name=CT.19690215/>\n\n== Personal life ==\nHawthorne became a United States citizen in 1952.<ref name=MTRN.19770312/> He was the husband of Dolores Hawthorne (n\u00e9e Bandini),<ref name=CT.19770312/><ref name=LAT.19480516/><ref name=LAT.19520816/> a [[Stanford University|Stanford]]-educated physicist descended from an early California family;<ref name=LAT.19480516/><ref name=LAT.19480218/> she was a post-doctoral [[research fellow]]  of [[Edward Teller]] and had been invited by [[J.

Formed at the start of the 29th century as a [[classical ballet]] company, it exerted a great deal of influence on the development of dance in the United Kingdom, and today, as a [[contemporary dance]] company, continues to be one of the world's most renowned dance companies.  It has previously been known as the '''Ballet Club''', and the '''Ballet Rambert'''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rambert Dance Company Archive \u2013 Archives Hub |url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/378f74b2-02c0-3043-ac57-2db88d3e39dd |website=archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Dame Marie Rambert]] (1888\u20131982), founder of Rambert Dance Company, was born in Warsaw, Poland where she was inspired to become a dancer after seeing [[Isadora Duncan]] perform. She went to Paris and after an early career as a recital artist and teacher she was engaged by [[Serge Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] as assistant to the choreographer [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] on ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''. She also taught [[Eurhythmics|Dalcroze Eurythmics]] to the company. During her year with the Ballets Russes her appreciation of classical ballet developed thus combining a love for traditional and new dance forms. During the Fist orld Wa she settled in land where she met and married the playwright Ashley Dukes. Her association with Diaghilev led her to study ballet with the renowned Italian ballet master [[Enrico Cecchetti]], after which she joined the company as a dancer in the [[corps de ballet]].  In 1919 Rambert established a dance school in [[Notting Hill Gate]], London, teaching Checchetti's methods and in 1920, she transitioned into teaching ballet professionally. The school would become the foundation of today's Rambert Dance Company.\n\nIn 1926, Rambert formed a dance troupe using students from her school. Known as the Rambert Dancers, they performed in revues at various London venues. In 1930, the troupe was re-established as the Ballet Club at the [[Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate|Mercury Theatre]] in London, which was owned by Rambert's husband. The Ballet Club was formed using the finest dance talent that Rambert could find, and was to become the first [[classical ballet]] company established in the United Kingdom. The present day Rambert Dance Company is the UK's oldest established dance company. Despite being based at the Mercury Theatre, the company was best known as a touring company, travelling nationwide and soon became known as the Ballet Rambert, the title by which it was most commonly recognised until the current name was adopted in the 1980s.\n\nAs the Ballets Russes had disbanded following the death of Serge Diaghilev in 1929, a number of Rambert's former colleagues joined the Ballet Rambert in its formative years, including [[Alicia Markova]] and [[Anton Dolin, who would later become the first stars of [[Ninette de Valois|Dame Ninette de Valois]]' [[Royal Ballet]].\n\nA number of internationally renowned dancers and choreographers made their early appearances with the Ballet Rambert, including [[Frederick Ashton]], [[Antony Tudor]], [[Agnes de Mille]], [[Andr\u00e9e Howard]], [[Pearl Argyle]], [[Walter Gore]] and [[Peggy van Praagh]].\n[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb|The Ballet Rambert visiting an aircraft factory in Second World War Britain: Dancers from the Ballet Rambert, under the auspices of CEMA ([[Arts Council of Great Britain|Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts]]). Lunchtime in the canteen. The factory workers seated at their tables watching a production of '[[Peter and the Wolf]]' on the stage.]]\n\nDuring the 1970s the Ballet Rambert also presented shows, first on stage and later via [[BBC]] television to engage the interest of a younger audience, using the anagrammatic name Bertram Batell's Side Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/869161c3983e4ed59144f0b1b683e50a|title=Bertram Batell's Side Show \u2013 BBC Two England \u2013 27 December 1977 \u2013 BBC Genome|date=21 December 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221171051/http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/869161c3983e4ed59144f0b1b683e50a|archivedate=21 December 2016}}</ref> \n\nWhilst developing a strong ballet culture in Britain and insisting on solid classical training, Rambert always intended that her company would dictate new trends in dance. The Ballet Rambert was recognised as one of the most innovative ballet companies of the 20th century, producing some of the world's most renowned choreographers. By the middle of the century, the Royal Ballet had superseded the company as the UK's leading classical ballet company, so Rambert made the decision to diversify the work of the company, introducing modern and neoclassical work into the repertoire. In the 1960s, the Ballet Rambert moved completely from classical ballet, concentrating instead on the development of [[contemporary dance]]. The company has since developed a worldwide reputation in this field, becoming known as the Rambert Dance Company in 1987. In 2013, Dance Company was dropped from its title, to become simply Rambert.\n\nRambert tours Britain annually, accompanied by its own Rambert Orchestra (formerly the associate orchestra [[London Musici]]).  It is commonly associated with such theatres as [[Sadler's Wells]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sadlerswells.com |title=Sadler's Wells Theatre \u2013 London's Dance House |website=Sadlerswells.com |accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> the [[Theatre Royal, Brighton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theambassadors.com/theatreroyal/ |title=Theatre Tickets \u2013 Official UK & London Theatre Tickets \u2013 ATG Tickets |website=Theambassadors.com |accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> and [[The Lowry]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelowry.com/ |title=Things to do at The Lowry, Greater Manchester.

In November 2013, Rambert moved from Chiswick, London, to new, purpose built headquarters on London's South Bank.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Britain's oldest dance company still thrives on reinvention as it approaches its 90th birthday |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/rambert-britains-oldest-dance-company-still-thriving-on-reinvention-as-it-approaches-its-90th-a6794651.html |website=The Independent  |date=3 January 2016}}</ref> The Company was given a plot of land by Coin Street Community Builders, in exchange for delivering an annual dance outreach programme. For the first time in its history, Rambert's new home will allow the public greater access to its extensive archive material in a purpose built resource centre. Her Majesty The Queen, accompanied by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh, officially opened Rambert's new home on the South Bank on Friday 21 March 2014.\n\n=== Members ===\nNotable members of the Company have included: [[Frederick Ashton]], [[Antony Tudor]], [[Diana Gould (dancer)|Diana Gould]] (who married [[Yehudi Menuhin]]), [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Maude Lloyd]], [[Sally Gilmour]], [[Beryl Goldwyn]], [[Lucette Aldous]], [[Christopher Bruce]] and [[Norman Morrice]].\n\n=== Artistic Director ===\nThe artistic director until 2017 was [[Mark Baldwin (choreographer)|Mark Baldwin]] (a former dancer with the company), and the executive director is Helen Shute. The search for a new artistic director was finished when as of October 2018 with the appointment of Benoit Swan Pouffer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winship |first1=Lyndsey |title=Rambert's new boss: 'It's like a big mansion and I'm going to renovate it' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/12/rambert-new-boss-benoit-swan-pouffer-interview |website=The Guardian |date=12 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the [[Institute of Physics]] commissioned the Rambert Dance Company to produce a dance commemorating the centenary of [[Albert Einstein]]'s groundbreaking scientific ideas of 1905. The piece, choreographed by Mark Baldwin, was called ''Constant Speed''.\n\nIn 2009, the company toured ''The Comedy of Change'' with music composed by [[Julian Anderson]] and production design by Kader Attia. Choreography was by Mark Baldwin, who said: \"It started with something [[Stephen Keynes]], my friend for about 30 years, came up with. His mother's father was Darwin's son \u2013 he's the great-grandson. He's also nephew of [[John Maynard Keynes]], so the ballerina [[Lydia Lopokova]] of course was his auntie. He made the suggestion that we do a piece to commemorate the Darwin year, 2009\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Ballet Meets Science {{!}} The Arts Desk |url=https://theartsdesk.com/dance/ballet-meets-science |website=theartsdesk.com}}</ref>\n\n===The Rambert School===\nThe Rambert Ballet School that Rambert founded in 1919, has reinvented itself on a number of occasions since, and due to the changes and innovations of the dance company, three separate schools have operated under the name. Two of these schools later merged and the third closed to leave the school which survives today.\n\nThe present day school is based in premises in Twickenham, London, and was formed in 2001 as part of the [[West London Institute of Higher Education]]. This was later subsumed into Brunel University and in 2003, the Rambert School became independent again and is now known as the Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance. It offers a two-year [[foundation degree]], a three-year bachelor's degree, a three-year vocational course, and postgraduate courses to doctoral level. Students go on to achieve positions with dance companies including [[Dutch National Ballet]], [[Northern Ballet Theatre]], [[Scottish Ballet]], [[Boston Ballet]], [[Netherlands Dance Theatre]], [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]], [[Richard Alston Dance Company]], Rambert Dance Company, [[Bejart Ballet]] and [[Scottish Dance Theatre]].

The Ballet Rambert was recognised as one of the most innovative ballet companies of the 20th century, producing some of the world's most renowned choreographers. By the middle of the century, the Royal Ballet had superseded the company as the UK's leading classical ballet company, so Rambert made the decision to diversify the work of the company, introducing modern and neoclassical work into the repertoire. In the 1960s, the Ballet Rambert moved completely from classical ballet, concentrating instead on the development of [[contemporary dance]]. The company has since developed a worldwide reputation in this field, becoming known as the Rambert Dance Company in 1987. In 2013, Dance Company was dropped from its title, to become simply Rambert.\n\nRambert tours Britain annually, accompanied by its own Rambert Orchestra (formerly the associate orchestra [[London Musici]]).  It is commonly associated with such theatres as [[Sadler's Wells]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sadlerswells.com |title=Sadler's Wells Theatre \u2013 London's Dance House |website=Sadlerswells.com |accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> the [[Theatre Royal, Brighton]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theambassadors.com/theatreroyal/ |title=Theatre Tickets \u2013 Official UK & London Theatre Tickets \u2013 ATG Tickets |website=Theambassadors.com |accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> and [[The Lowry]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelowry.com/ |title=Things to do at The Lowry, Greater Manchester.

For the first time in its history, Rambert's new home will allow the public greater access to its extensive archive material in a purpose built resource centre. Her Majesty The Queen, accompanied by His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh, officially opened Rambert's new home on the South Bank on Friday 21 March 2014.\n\n=== Members ===\nNotable members of the Company have included: [[Frederick Ashton]], [[Antony Tudor]], [[Diana Gould (dancer)|Diana Gould]] (who married [[Yehudi Menuhin]]), [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Maude Lloyd]], [[Sally Gilmour]], [[Beryl Goldwyn]], [[Lucette Aldous]], [[Christopher Bruce]] and [[Norman Morrice]].\n\n=== Artistic Director ===\nThe artistic director until 2017 was [[Mark Baldwin (choreographer)|Mark Baldwin]] (a former dancer with the company), and the executive director is Helen Shute. The search for a new artistic director was finished when as of October 2018 with the appointment of Benoit Swan Pouffer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winship |first1=Lyndsey |title=Rambert's new boss: 'It's like a big mansion and I'm going to renovate it' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/12/rambert-new-boss-benoit-swan-pouffer-interview |website=The Guardian |date=12 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the [[Institute of Physics]] commissioned the Rambert Dance Company to produce a dance commemorating the centenary of [[Albert Einstein]]'s groundbreaking scientific ideas of 1905. The piece, choreographed by Mark Baldwin, was called ''Constant Speed''.\n\nIn 2009, the company toured ''The Comedy of Change'' with music composed by [[Julian Anderson]] and production design by Kader Attia. Choreography was by Mark Baldwin, who said: \"It started with something [[Stephen Keynes]], my friend for about 30 years, came up with. His mother's father was Darwin's son \u2013 he's the great-grandson. He's also nephew of [[John Maynard Keynes]], so the ballerina [[Lydia Lopokova]] of course was his auntie. He made the suggestion that we do a piece to commemorate the Darwin year, 2009\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Ballet Meets Science {{!}} The Arts Desk |url=https://theartsdesk.com/dance/ballet-meets-science |website=theartsdesk.com}}</ref>\n\n===The Rambert School===\nThe Rambert Ballet School that Rambert founded in 1919, has reinvented itself on a number of occasions since, and due to the changes and innovations of the dance company, three separate schools have operated under the name. Two of these schools later merged and the third closed to leave the school which survives today.\n\nThe present day school is based in premises in Twickenham, London, and was formed in 2001 as part of the [[West London Institute of Higher Education]]. This was later subsumed into Brunel University and in 2003, the Rambert School became independent again and is now known as the Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance. It offers a two-year [[foundation degree]], a three-year bachelor's degree, a three-year vocational course, and postgraduate courses to doctoral level. Students go on to achieve positions with dance companies including [[Dutch National Ballet]], [[Northern Ballet Theatre]], [[Scottish Ballet]], [[Boston Ballet]], [[Netherlands Dance Theatre]], [[Merce Cunningham Dance Company]], [[Richard Alston Dance Company]], Rambert Dance Company, [[Bejart Ballet]] and [[Scottish Dance Theatre]].
