Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts competition on Han's private island to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that the man responsible for his sister's death, O'Hara, is working as Han's bodyguard on the island. Also fighting in the competition are Roper, an indebted gambling addict, and fellow Vietnam war veteran Williams.\n\nAt the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms. Lee makes contact with undercover operative Mei Ling and sneaks into Han's compound, looking for evidence. He is discovered by several guards but manages to escape. The next morning, Han orders his giant guard Bolo to kill the guards in public for failing their duties. After the execution, Lee faces O'Hara in the competition and ends up killing him. With the day's competition over, Han confronts Williams, who had also left his room the previous night to exercise. Han believes Williams to be the intruder and beats him to death when he refuses to cooperate. Han then reveals his drug operation to Roper, hoping that he will join his organisation. He also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper, along with all the other martial artists who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper refuses. Despite being initially intrigued, Roper refuses after learning of Williams's fate.\n\nLee sneaks out again that night and manages to send a message to Braithwaite, but he is captured after a prolonged battle with the guards. The next morning, Han arranges for Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses. As a punishment, Roper has to fight Bolo instead, whom he manages to overpower and beat after a gruelling encounter. Enraged by the unexpected failure, Han commands his remaining men to kill Lee and Roper. Facing insurmountable odds, they are soon aided by the island's prisoners, who had been freed by Mei Ling. Han escapes and is pursued by Lee, who finally corners him in his museum. After a brutal fight, Han runs away into a hidden mirror room. The mirrors give Han an advantage, but Lee breaks all the room's mirrors to reveal Han's location, and eventually kills him. Lee returns outside to the main battle, which is now over.

Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts competition on Han's private island to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that the man responsible for his sister's death, O'Hara, is working as Han's bodyguard on the island. Also fighting in the competition are Roper, an indebted gambling addict, and fellow Vietnam war veteran Williams.\n\nAt the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms. Lee makes contact with undercover operative Mei Ling and sneaks into Han's compound, looking for evidence. He is discovered by several guards but manages to escape. The next morning, Han orders his giant guard Bolo to kill the guards in public for failing their duties. After the execution, Lee faces O'Hara in the competition and ends up killing him. With the day's competition over, Han confronts Williams, who had also left his room the previous night to exercise. Han believes Williams to be the intruder and beats him to death when he refuses to cooperate. Han then reveals his drug operation to Roper, hoping that he will join his organisation. He also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper, along with all the other martial artists who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper refuses. Despite being initially intrigued, Roper refuses after learning of Williams' fate.\n\nLee sneaks out again that night and manages to send a message to Braithwaite, but he is captured after a prolonged battle with the guards. The next morning, Han arranges for Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses. As a punishment, Roper has to fight Bolo instead, whom he manages to overpower and beat after a gruelling encounter. Enraged by the unexpected failure, Han commands his remaining men to kill Lee and Roper. Facing insurmountable odds, they are soon aided by the island's prisoners, who had been freed by Mei Ling. Han escapes and is pursued by Lee, who finally corners him in his museum. After a brutal fight, Han runs away into a hidden mirror room. The mirrors give Han an advantage, but Lee breaks all the room's mirrors to reveal Han's location, and eventually kills him. Lee returns outside to the main battle, which is now over. A bruised and bloodied Roper sits victorious while the military finally arrive to take control of the island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bruce Lee]] as Lee\n* [[John Saxon]] as Roper\n* [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]] as Williams<ref>{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/10/entertainment/la-ca-secondlook10-2010jan10/2|title= DVD set is devoted to '70s martial arts star Jim Kelly |newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= 10 January 2010|accessdate=28 January 2011 | first=Steve | last=Ryfle|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180715233633/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/10/entertainment/la-ca-secondlook10-2010jan10/2 |archive-date= 15 July 2018 }}</ref>\n* [[Ahna Capri]] as Tania<ref>{{cite news |title=Car Accident Claims Ahna Capri |publisher=[[Inside Kung Fu]] |url=http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/212/37/ |accessdate=10 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311115341/http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/212/37 |archivedate=11 March 2011  }}</ref>\n* [[Shih Kien]] as Han (voice dubbed by [[Keye Luke]])<ref>{{cite news|title= Lee's Dragon co-star dies at 96 |publisher= [[BBC]]|date=5 June 2009|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8085659.stm|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Robert Wall]] as O'Hara (as Bob Wall)<ref>{{cite news|title= Bob Wall Interview: \"Pulling No Punches\"|publisher= [[Black Belt Magazine|Black Belt]]|url= http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/564|accessdate=2 December 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220214509/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/564|archive-date= 20 December 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Angela Mao]] as Su Lin, Lee's sister (as Angela Mao Ying) \n* [[Betty Chung]] as Mei Ling\n* [[Geoffrey Weeks]] as Braithwaite\n* [[Bolo Yeung]] as Bolo (as Yang Sze)\n* [[Peter Archer (actor)|Peter Archer]] as Parsons\n* Ho Lee Yan as Old Man \n* [[Marlene Clark]] as Secretary\n* Allan Kent as Golfer\n* William Keller as L.A.

Rebalancing the job market in the private sector will also prove to be a challenge since it is currently majority staffed by expatriates. One of the difficulties is that the private sector has lower paying salaries and expats are easier to hire and fire. Currently twice as many Saudi nationals work in the public sector than in the private sector. The challenge lies in getting a larger portion of the nationals to accept lower paying jobs that could require higher working hours than that of the public sector.

Rebalancing the job market in the private sector will also prove to be a challenge since it is currently majority staffed by expatriates. One of the difficulties is that the private sector has lower paying salaries and expats are easier to hire and fire. Currently twice as many Saudi nationals work in the public sector than in the private sector. The challenge lies in getting a larger portion of the nationals to accept lower paying jobs that could require higher working hours than that of the public sector. Another aspect to be considered is moving the private sector away from the business activities that require very low-cost labor.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/publications/research/2017-07-20-vision-2030-saudi-kinninmont.pdf |title=Vision 2030 and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Social Contract Austerity and Transformation |last= |first= |date= |website=Chathamhouse|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hilal Khashan from the American conservative think tank [[Middle East Forum]], to have the 2030 plan succeed ignoring the relationship between economic and political development is no longer a viable option, the developments required to increase the GDP as planned will encourage the breakage of the tribal system taking place.
