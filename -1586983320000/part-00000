Its origins date from the 12th century, based on a former [[Cluniac]] [[monastery]]. Following the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century, it became a Church of Scotland [[parish]] [[kirk]].\n\n==History==\nIt is believed that [[Saint Mirin]] (or Saint Mirren) founded a community on this site in 7th century. Some time after his death a shrine to the Saint was established, becoming a popular site of pilgrimage and veneration. The name Paisley may derive from the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] (old Welsh ) ''Passeleg'', 'basilica' (derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]]), i.e. 'major church', recalling an early, though undocumented, ecclesiastical importance.\n\nIn 1163, [[Walter fitz Alan]], the first [[High Steward of Scotland]] issued a [[charter]] for a [[priory]] to be set up on land owned by him in Paisley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/paisley/abbey/index.html|title=Paisley Abbey Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland|last=info@undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|first=Undiscovered Scotland|website=www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> It was dedicated to SS. [[Virgin Mary|Mary]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], Mirin and [[Milburga]]. Around 13 monks came from the Cluniac priory at [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]] to found the community. Paisley grew so rapidly that it was raised to the status of [[abbey]] in 1245. Monks from Paisley founded [[Crossraguel Abbey]] in [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick, Ayrshire]], in 1244.\n\nIn 1307, [[Edward I of England]] had the abbey burned down. However, it was rebuilt later in the 14th century. [[William Wallace]], born in nearby Elderslie, is widely believed to have been educated for some time when he was a boy in the abbey.<ref>[http://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/abbeyhistory.htm Paisley Abbey website]</ref>\n\nIn 1316, [[Marjorie Bruce]], daughter of [[Robert I of Scotland]] and wife of [[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland|Walter Stewart]], the sixth [[High Steward of Scotland]], was out riding near the abbey. During the ride, she fell from her horse and as she was heavily pregnant at the time, she was taken to Paisley Abbey for medical care. There, [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] was born by [[caesarean section]], in a time when [[Anesthesia|anaesthesia]] wouldn't have been available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historyandotherthoughts.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-tragic-life-of-marjorie-bruce.html|title=The Tragic Life Of Marjorie Bruce, Princess Of Scotland|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/women/wih10.htm|title=Women in History of Scots Descent - Marjory Bruce|website=www.electricscotland.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> She was later buried at the abbey. A [[cairn]], at the junction of Dundonald Road and Renfrew Road, approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north of the Abbey, marks the spot where she reputedly fell from her horse.\n\nIn 1491, absolution was granted by Abbot George Shaw, representing the [[Pope]] and in the presence of the relics, to [[James IV of Scotland]] and others implicated in the death of [[James III of Scotland|James III]] at the [[Battle of Sauchieburn]]. By 1499 Shaw had had built a new, larger pilgrims' chapel and added the sculptured stone frieze which can still be seen today, showing scenes from the life of St Miren. It was originally brightly painted and may have been part of a rear panel of an altar before being put up as a frieze on the wall.<ref>\"Pilgrimage in Medieval Scotland\" by Peter Yeoman, Historic Scotland 1999</ref>\n\n[[File:Paisley Abbey from the south east.jpg|thumb|640px|center|Paisley Abbey from the south west]]\nA succession of fires and the collapse of the tower in the 15th and 16th centuries left the building in a partially ruined state. Although the western section was still used for worship, the eastern section was widely plundered for its stone. From 1858 to 1928 the north [[porch]] and the eastern [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] were reconstructed on the remains of the ruined walls by the architect Macgregor Chalmers. After his death, work on the choir was completed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].<ref>[http://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/abbeyhistory.htm Paisley Abbey website, ibid.]</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\nPaisley Abbey is the burial place of all six [[House of Stuart|High Stewards]] of Scotland, [[Marjorie Bruce]] who was the mother of [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] and the wives of Robert II and [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III]]. The [[Celt]]ic [[Barochan Cross]], once sited near the village of [[Houston, Scotland|Houston]], Renfrewshire, is now inside the abbey itself. The cross is thought to date from the 10th century. In the abbey's nave, the Wallace Memorial Window, which depicts the image of Samson, was donated in 1873.\n\n=== The Paisley Abbey Drain ===\nIn the early 1990s an ancient vaulted drain of extremely fine construction, probably 13th century in date, was rediscovered running from the abbey to the White Cart. Archaeological investigations and excavations took place in 1996,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://canmore.org.uk/event/771807|title = Archaeology Notes|date = |accessdate = 3 December 2015|website = |publisher = |last = CANMORE}}</ref> 3\u201316 September 2009, 2\u201312 September 2011 and 4 September 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://canmore.org.uk/site/71769/paisley-abbey-drain|title = Paisley Abbey, Drain|date = |accessdate = 3 December 2013|website = |publisher = |last = CANMORE}}</ref> and many items discovered.<ref name=\"malden\">Malden, John (2000).

Although there is no evidence that she is buried at exactly that location, her remains are thought to be within the abbey.

This is one of only six in the UK.<ref>On the website Organlive.com, which has almost 1800 albums of organ music (as of late 2018) only four organs are listed outside France: in Argentina, Denmark, the Netherlands and Paisley</ref> Since 1872 it has been rebuilt and extended four times. The organ as rebuilt by Walkers in 1968 has 4 manuals, 65 stops and 5448 pipes.(National Pipe Organ Register; \"The Organ at Paisley Abbey\", booklet pub. Paisley Abbey) In 2009 the instrument underwent a major restoration by Harrison and Harrison of Durham. The work included major cleaning and servicing, the provision of a new wind system and the addition of a 32&nbsp;ft contre bombarde. The latter was part of the 1968 scheme by Ralph Downes but not included in the work actually undertaken.\n\n=== Internal architectural details ===\nThe twelve angel corbels and stone communion table are by [[Pilkington Jackson]], sculptor of the iconic [[Robert the Bruce]] statue at [[Bannockburn]].

Its origins date from the 12th century, based on a former [[Cluniac]] [[monastery]]. Following the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century, it became a Church of Scotland [[parish]] [[kirk]].\n\n==History==\nIt is believed that [[Saint Mirin]] (or Saint Mirren) founded a community on this site in 7th century. Some time after his death a shrine to the Saint was established, becoming a popular site of pilgrimage and veneration. The name Paisley may derive from the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] (old Welsh ) ''Passeleg'', 'basilica' (derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]]), i.e. 'major church', recalling an early, though undocumented, ecclesiastical importance.\n\nIn 1163, [[Walter fitz Alan]], the first [[High Steward of Scotland]] issued a [[charter]] for a [[priory]] to be set up on land owned by him in Paisley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/paisley/abbey/index.html|title=Paisley Abbey Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland|last=info@undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|first=Undiscovered Scotland|website=www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> It was dedicated to SS. [[Virgin Mary|Mary]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], Mirin and [[Milburga]]. Around 13 monks came from the Cluniac priory at [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]] to found the community. Paisley grew so rapidly that it was raised to the status of [[abbey]] in 1245. Monks from Paisley founded [[Crossraguel Abbey]] in [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick, Ayrshire]], in 1244.\n\nIn 1307, [[Edward I of England]] had the abbey burned down. However, it was rebuilt later in the 14th century. [[William Wallace]], born in nearby Elderslie, is widely believed to have been educated for some time when he was a boy in the abbey.<ref>[http://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/abbeyhistory.htm Paisley Abbey website]</ref>\n\nIn 1316, [[Marjorie Bruce]], daughter of [[Robert I of Scotland]] and wife of [[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland|Walter Stewart]], the sixth [[High Steward of Scotland]], was out riding near the abbey. During the ride, she fell from her horse and as she was heavily pregnant at the time, she was taken to Paisley Abbey for medical care. There, [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] was born by [[caesarean section]], in a time when [[Anesthesia|anaesthesia]] wouldn't have been available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historyandotherthoughts.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-tragic-life-of-marjorie-bruce.html|title=The Tragic Life Of Marjorie Bruce, Princess Of Scotland|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/women/wih10.htm|title=Women in History of Scots Descent - Marjory Bruce|website=www.electricscotland.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> She was later buried at the abbey. A [[cairn]], at the junction of Dundonald Road and Renfrew Road, approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north of the Abbey, marks the spot where she reputedly fell from her horse.\n\nIn 1491, absolution was granted by Abbot George Shaw, representing the [[Pope]] and in the presence of the relics, to [[James IV of Scotland]] and others implicated in the death of [[James III of Scotland|James III]] at the [[Battle of Sauchieburn]]. By 1499 Shaw had had built a new, larger pilgrims' chapel and added the sculptured stone frieze which can still be seen today, showing scenes from the life of St Miren. It was originally brightly painted and may have been part of a rear panel of an altar before being put up as a frieze on the wall.<ref>\"Pilgrimage in Medieval Scotland\" by Peter Yeoman, Historic Scotland 1999</ref>\n\n[[File:Paisley Abbey from the south east.jpg|thumb|640px|center|Paisley Abbey from the south west]]\nA succession of fires and the collapse of the tower in the 15th and 16th centuries left the building in a partially ruined state. Although the western section was still used for worship, the eastern section was widely plundered for its stone. From 1858 to 1928 the north [[porch]] and the eastern [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] were reconstructed on the remains of the ruined walls by the architect Macgregor Chalmers. After his death, work on the choir was completed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].<ref>[http://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/abbeyhistory.htm Paisley Abbey website, ibid.]</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\nPaisley Abbey is the burial place of all six [[House of Stuart|High Stewards]] of Scotland, [[Marjorie Bruce]] who was the mother of [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] and the wives of Robert II and [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III]]. The [[Celt]]ic [[Barochan Cross]], once sited near the village of [[Houston, Scotland|Houston]], Renfrewshire, is now inside the abbey itself. The cross is thought to date from the 10th century. In the abbey's nave, the Wallace Memorial Window, which depicts the image of Samson, was donated in 1873.\n\n=== The Paisley Abbey Drain ===\nIn the early 1990s an ancient vaulted drain of extremely fine construction, probably 13th century in date, was rediscovered running from the abbey to the White Cart. Archaeological investigations and excavations took place in 1996,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://canmore.org.uk/event/771807|title = Archaeology Notes|date = |accessdate = 3 December 2015|website = |publisher = |last = CANMORE}}</ref> 3\u201316 September 2009, 2\u201312 September 2011 and 4 September 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://canmore.org.uk/site/71769/paisley-abbey-drain|title = Paisley Abbey, Drain|date = |accessdate = 3 December 2013|website = |publisher = |last = CANMORE}}</ref> and many items discovered.<ref name=\"malden\">Malden, John (2000).

This is one of only six in the UK.<ref>On the website Organlive.com, which has almost 1800 albums of organ music (as of late 2018) only four organs are listed outside France: in Argentina, Denmark, the Netherlands and Paisley</ref> Since 1872 it has been rebuilt and extended four times. The organ as rebuilt by Walkers in 1968 has 4 manuals, 65 stops and 5448 pipes.(National Pipe Organ Register; \"The Organ at Paisley Abbey\", booklet pub. Paisley Abbey) In 2009 the instrument underwent a major restoration by Harrison and Harrison of Durham. The work included major cleaning and servicing, the provision of a new wind system and the addition of a 32&nbsp;ft contre bombarde. The latter was part of the 1968 scheme by Ralph Downes but not included in the work actually undertaken.\n\n=== Internal architectural details ===\nThe twelve angel corbels and stone communion table are by [[Pilkington Jackson]], sculptor of the iconic [[Robert the Bruce]] statue at [[Bannockburn]].
