After early adoption by the Scandinavian Scout organisations, the song became eventually (starting in the 1940s and 1950s) a global hit among Scouts.

The on-screen writer credit is given to Robin Bland, a pseudonym for script writer [[Terrance Dicks]] and script editor [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]]. It is the first serial to feature the [[Sisterhood of Karn]].\n\nThe serial is set on the planet Karn. In the serial, the surgeon [[List of Doctor Who villains#Mehendri Solon|Mehendri Solon]] ([[Philip Madoc]]) seeks to create a body for the [[Time Lord]] war criminal [[List of Doctor Who villains#Morbius|Morbius]] ([[Stuart Fell]] and [[Michael Spice]]) from parts of other creatures that have come to the planet.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{plot|date=March 2011}}\n}}\nOn the planet Karn, an [[insect]]-like [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] is killed by Condo, a man with a hook for a hand, who takes its head to a castle and his master Solon. However, the head is unsuitable&nbsp;\u2014 Solon needs a head from a [[warm-blooded]] [[humanoid]].\n\nThe [[TARDIS]] materialises in the middle of a lightning storm, and the [[Fourth Doctor]] rushes out, ranting at the [[Time Lord]]s for diverting him to this planet. [[Sarah Jane Smith]] finds the alien's escape pod and sees a valley filled with wrecked spacecraft, as well as the headless body of an alien which the Doctor identifies as a [[The Mutants|Mutt]]. She and the Doctor make for a castle that she spots. The travellers are welcomed by Solon, complimenting the Doctor on his \"magnificent\" head.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Sisterhood of Karn]] discover the TARDIS and [[Teleportation|teleport]] it to their temple. Their elderly leader, Maren, identifies it as a Time Lord vessel, and believes that the Doctor has come to steal their [[Elixir of Life]]. \n\nThe Doctor knows of Solon as an authority on [[microsurgery|microsurgical]] techniques and [[tissue transplant]]. The Doctor recognises a clay bust as that of [[List of Doctor Who villains#Morbius|Morbius]], one of the Time Lords' greatest criminals.\n\nBefore he can say anything further, a drug takes effect, and the Doctor passes out. Sarah Jane pretends that she has succumbed. In the laboratory, Solon's examination of the Doctor confirms that he is a Time Lord. As he and Condo leave the room, the Doctor vanishes. Sarah Jane keeps hidden and enters the lab. She draws back the curtain on a bed, thinking it is the Doctor, but as the lights come up, she sees a headless, patchwork creature made from various body parts.\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943592255).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Morbius, on display at the Doctor Who Experience]]\n\nThe Doctor regains consciousness to find himself surrounded by members of the Sisterhood. The Doctor realises that just before he passed out, he felt the mind of Morbius. Maren refuses to believe him.\n\nSarah Jane follows Solon and Condo as they make their way towards the temple. They interrupt the ceremony, Solon asking them to spare the Doctor, or at least give him the Doctor's head. A disguised Sarah frees the Doctor, but she is blinded by the energy from Maren's ring, the Doctor assuring her that she will recover. Despite Sarah Jane telling him about the headless body, they return to the castle. The Doctor asks Solon to examine Sarah Jane's eyes. Solon tells him that Sarah's retinas have been almost completely destroyed, but there is one chance: the Elixir of Life. The Doctor goes to the Sisterhood.\n\nElsewhere, Sarah Jane hears a voice calling for Solon. Following the sound, she enters a hidden laboratory and stumbles blindly towards  a glowing brain in a tank, which accuses her of being sent by the Sisterhood to destroy it. Solon enters and drags her away. As he closes the door, she hears Solon address the voice as \"Morbius\" and hears how Solon has sent the Doctor into a trap. She locks Solon in the laboratory and, still blind, makes her way out of the castle.\n\nThe Doctor is captured by the Sisterhood. When he explains why he came back, Maren tells him that the ray's effect is not permanent, and Solon knows that. The Doctor believes that something evil related to Morbius is happening. Maren affirms that she saw Morbius dispersed. The Doctor asks if Solon was present. Morbius had led an army of mercenaries, promising them the Elixir and immortality and revealing its existence to the cosmos. The Doctor reignites the flame with a \"Little Demon.\"\n\nSarah Jane is captured and taken back to the castle. Learning that the Doctor is a Time Lord, Morbius fears the Time Lords have tracked him down and will return in force. Morbius insists that he be transferred into the patchwork body now, with an artificial brain casing that Solon constructed. Solon protests, as there may be severe pain and seizures, but Morbius insists. Back in the castle, Solon prepares to operate, but Condo is enraged when he recognises his lost arm attached to the patchwork body. He attacks Solon before being shot in the stomach, their struggle knocking Morbius' brain to the floor. Not knowing what damage has been done, Solon places the fallen brain in the casing, releasing Sarah Jane so she can assist in the operation. He threatens her into doing so, saying that if Morbius dies, then so does she.\n\nThe wounded Condo crawls into the hallway as outside, the Sisters carry the Doctor's seemingly dead body through the lightning storm. In the meantime, the operation is finished&nbsp;\u2014 within minutes Morbius will live again. Solon goes to answer the doorbell, and sees the Sisters leaving the Doctor's body in the parlour. In the laboratory, Sarah Jane's eyesight starts to clear, but the monstrous body of Morbius gets off the operating table and lumbers towards her.\n\nSarah Jane screams as she sees the Morbius creature, and dodges out of the way. She warns Solon that the creature is loose and he runs back to the laboratory. Sarah Jane notices the Doctor's body, but as she approaches, the Doctor wakes up and smiles at her. He is here to stop Solon, but Sarah Jane tells him it is too late. But Morbius is revealed to not be in his right mind as he knocks Solon out and then the Doctor. Morbius chases Sarah Jane, but Condo intervenes, knocking Sarah Jane down the stairs into the cellar while he grapples with Morbius. However, Morbius is too strong, and he kills Condo instead. Morbius wanders out of the castle as the Doctor regains consciousness. He carries Sarah Jane into the secret laboratory to let her recover.\n\nSolon, too, has awakened, and assembles a tranquilliser gun. He tells the Doctor that the operation was not complete, only the motor functions are working, the rest on an instinctual level. Knowing Morbius' hatred, he will seek out the Sisterhood. Sure enough, Morbius finds one of the Sisters in some ruins nearby and kills her. The Doctor and Solon find the body and they search the ruins. Morbius attacks the Doctor, but is knocked out by Solon's tranquilliser. As they carry the creature back to the castle, the Doctor tells Solon that Morbius's brain will be detached and returned to the Time Lords.\n\nThe body of the dead Sister is brought back to Maren. Ohica reports that witnesses saw a creature and then the Doctor and Solon hunting for it. Maren realises that Solon has succeeded in his experiments and resurrected their ancient enemy. But Maren is too old and weak to leave the shrine, and she gives Ohica permission to lead the Sisters to the castle.\n\nThe Doctor gives Solon five minutes to disconnect the brain as he goes and checks on Sarah Jane. However, Solon locks them in the secret laboratory instead and begins to repair Morbius. Using materials from the secret laboratory, the Doctor makes [[cyanogen]] gas, which he then pipes through a vent that leads to the operating room above. Though Solon dies from exposure to the gas upon finishing the operation, Morbius' lungs filter out the poison as he goes to confront Sarah Jane and the Doctor&nbsp;\u2014 he claims that when the knowledge of his resurrection spreads, his followers will rise in their millions. The Doctor and Sarah Jane mock Morbius in an attempt to overheat his brain, and the Doctor challenges him to a mindbending contest.\n\nThey grab hold of the appropriate apparatus in the laboratory and begin. The machine's display begins to show Morbius' brain casing head, then his previous face, then the Doctor, then the Doctor's [[Third Doctor|previous incarnation]]. After going through the Doctor's previous incarnations, a series of eight other faces are shown before Morbius' brain case shorts out. The Doctor collapses, as Morbius stumbles out in a daze. The Sisterhood arrive and chase Morbius over a cliff, and Ohica finds Sarah Jane crying over the Doctor.\n\nTaking the Doctor back to the shrine, Maren says only the Elixir of Life can save him, but there is none left. However, the revived Flame has gathered enough Elixir. There is enough for the Doctor, but not for Maren, who accepts that the Doctor was right: there should be an end. The Elixir is given to the Doctor, who revives almost immediately. Maren steps into the Flame of Life, becoming younger, and then vanishes.\n\nOhica starts to thank the Doctor, but he stops her, saying that he and Sarah Jane have another engagement. Before they leave, he gives her a pair of curious objects in case they need to relight the Flame again. When Ohica asks what they are, the Doctor answers, \"A mighty atom and a thunderflash.\" He explains that the writing on the cardboard tubes reads: \"Light the blue touch paper and stand clear.\" This time, the TARDIS vanishes in a puff of light and smoke.\n\n===Continuity===\nThe 2020 series finale \"[[The Timeless Children]]\" revealed that The Doctor is in fact a transdimensional foundling originally known as the Timeless Child, possessing an infinite capacity to regenerate but now retaining only memories from the incarnation known as the \"First Doctor\" (Hartnell) forward. The Time Lords developed the ability to regenerate by studying the Timeless Child's natural ability. The episode included a sequence where scenes from throughout the programme's run are used to represent the Doctor's recollection of her past incarnations, with the incarnations from ''The Brain of Morbius'' specifically included.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-03-01/doctor-who-more-doctors-morbius/ | title = Doctor Who\u2019s big reveal just solved a 44-year-old mystery | first = Morgan | last=  Jeffrey | date = 1 March 2020 | accessdate = 1 March 2020 | work = [[Radio Times]] }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe original script was written by Terrance Dicks, using some ideas from his script of the stage play ''[[Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday]]'' to a requirement from Hinchcliffe for a story about a human/robot relationship. However, after delivery Dicks was out of the country when it was decided that the robot, core to the story, could not be realised under the budget constraints. In excising the character [[Script editor]] Robert Holmes had to undertake the substantial rewrites without informing Dicks, who could not be contacted. The robot character was replaced with Solon who required a different motivation\u2014that of a mad scientist. Dicks later said of the decision that it was not original but it was the \"only one available\". Upon his return to the United Kingdom, Dicks learnt of the changes and angrily phoned Holmes. Since the work was more Holmes than his own, Dicks demanded the removal of his name from the credits saying it could go out under a \"bland [[pseudonym]]\".<ref name=\"codenames\"/> This ended up being the name ''Robin Bland''.<ref name=\"codenames\">{{cite web|first=William|last=Gallagher|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-27/doctor-whos-secret-history-of-codenames-revealed|title=Doctor Who's secret history of codenames revealed|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=27 March 2012|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref><ref>Howe, Walker and Stammers ''Doctor Who the Handbook: The Fourth Doctor'' pp 175-176</ref> \nThe episodes were recorded entirely in studios during October 1975.\n\n===Cast notes===\nPhilip Madoc had already appeared in ''[[The Krotons]]'' (1968\u201369) and ''[[The War Games]]'' (1969) and would appear afterwards in ''[[The Power of Kroll]]'' (1978\u201379).

The on-screen writer credit is given to Robin Bland, a pseudonym for script writer [[Terrance Dicks]] and script editor [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]]. It is the first serial to feature the [[Sisterhood of Karn]].\n\nThe serial is set on the planet Karn. In the serial, the surgeon [[List of Doctor Who villains#Mehendri Solon|Mehendri Solon]] ([[Philip Madoc]]) seeks to create a body for the [[Time Lord]] war criminal [[List of Doctor Who villains#Morbius|Morbius]] ([[Stuart Fell]] and [[Michael Spice]]) from parts of other creatures that have come to the planet.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{plot|date=March 2011}}\n}}\nOn the planet Karn, an [[insect]]-like [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] is killed by Condo, a man with a hook for a hand, who takes its head to a castle and his master Solon. However, the head is unsuitable&nbsp;\u2014 Solon needs a head from a [[warm-blooded]] [[humanoid]].\n\nThe [[TARDIS]] materialises in the middle of a lightning storm, and the [[Fourth Doctor]] rushes out, ranting at the [[Time Lord]]s for diverting him to this planet. [[Sarah Jane Smith]] finds the alien's escape pod and sees a valley filled with wrecked spacecraft, as well as the headless body of an alien which the Doctor identifies as a [[The Mutants|Mutt]]. She and the Doctor make for a castle that she spots. The travellers are welcomed by Solon, complimenting the Doctor on his \"magnificent\" head.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Sisterhood of Karn]] discover the TARDIS and [[Teleportation|teleport]] it to their temple. Their elderly leader, Maren, identifies it as a Time Lord vessel, and believes that the Doctor has come to steal their [[Elixir of Life]]. \n\nThe Doctor knows of Solon as an authority on [[microsurgery|microsurgical]] techniques and [[tissue transplant]]. The Doctor recognises a clay bust as that of [[List of Doctor Who villains#Morbius|Morbius]], one of the Time Lords' greatest criminals.\n\nBefore he can say anything further, a drug takes effect, and the Doctor passes out. Sarah Jane pretends that she has succumbed. In the laboratory, Solon's examination of the Doctor confirms that he is a Time Lord. As he and Condo leave the room, the Doctor vanishes. Sarah Jane keeps hidden and enters the lab. She draws back the curtain on a bed, thinking it is the Doctor, but as the lights come up, she sees a headless, patchwork creature made from various body parts.\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943592255).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Morbius, on display at the Doctor Who Experience]]\n\nThe Doctor regains consciousness to find himself surrounded by members of the Sisterhood. The Doctor realises that just before he passed out, he felt the mind of Morbius. Maren refuses to believe him.\n\nSarah Jane follows Solon and Condo as they make their way towards the temple. They interrupt the ceremony, Solon asking them to spare the Doctor, or at least give him the Doctor's head. A disguised Sarah frees the Doctor, but she is blinded by the energy from Maren's ring, the Doctor assuring her that she will recover. Despite Sarah Jane telling him about the headless body, they return to the castle. The Doctor asks Solon to examine Sarah Jane's eyes. Solon tells him that Sarah's retinas have been almost completely destroyed, but there is one chance: the Elixir of Life. The Doctor goes to the Sisterhood.\n\nElsewhere, Sarah Jane hears a voice calling for Solon. Following the sound, she enters a hidden laboratory and stumbles blindly towards  a glowing brain in a tank, which accuses her of being sent by the Sisterhood to destroy it. Solon enters and drags her away. As he closes the door, she hears Solon address the voice as \"Morbius\" and hears how Solon has sent the Doctor into a trap. She locks Solon in the laboratory and, still blind, makes her way out of the castle.\n\nThe Doctor is captured by the Sisterhood. When he explains why he came back, Maren tells him that the ray's effect is not permanent, and Solon knows that. The Doctor believes that something evil related to Morbius is happening. Maren affirms that she saw Morbius dispersed. The Doctor asks if Solon was present. Morbius had led an army of mercenaries, promising them the Elixir and immortality and revealing its existence to the cosmos. The Doctor reignites the flame with a \"Little Demon.\"\n\nSarah Jane is captured and taken back to the castle. Learning that the Doctor is a Time Lord, Morbius fears the Time Lords have tracked him down and will return in force. Morbius insists that he be transferred into the patchwork body now, with an artificial brain casing that Solon constructed. Solon protests, as there may be severe pain and seizures, but Morbius insists. Back in the castle, Solon prepares to operate, but Condo is enraged when he recognises his lost arm attached to the patchwork body. He attacks Solon before being shot in the stomach, their struggle knocking Morbius' brain to the floor. Not knowing what damage has been done, Solon places the fallen brain in the casing, releasing Sarah Jane so she can assist in the operation. He threatens her into doing so, saying that if Morbius dies, then so does she.\n\nThe wounded Condo crawls into the hallway as outside, the Sisters carry the Doctor's seemingly dead body through the lightning storm. In the meantime, the operation is finished&nbsp;\u2014 within minutes Morbius will live again. Solon goes to answer the doorbell, and sees the Sisters leaving the Doctor's body in the parlour. In the laboratory, Sarah Jane's eyesight starts to clear, but the monstrous body of Morbius gets off the operating table and lumbers towards her.\n\nSarah Jane screams as she sees the Morbius creature, and dodges out of the way. She warns Solon that the creature is loose and he runs back to the laboratory. Sarah Jane notices the Doctor's body, but as she approaches, the Doctor wakes up and smiles at her. He is here to stop Solon, but Sarah Jane tells him it is too late. But Morbius is revealed to not be in his right mind as he knocks Solon out and then the Doctor. Morbius chases Sarah Jane, but Condo intervenes, knocking Sarah Jane down the stairs into the cellar while he grapples with Morbius. However, Morbius is too strong, and he kills Condo instead. Morbius wanders out of the castle as the Doctor regains consciousness. He carries Sarah Jane into the secret laboratory to let her recover.\n\nSolon, too, has awakened, and assembles a tranquilliser gun. He tells the Doctor that the operation was not complete, only the motor functions are working, the rest on an instinctual level. Knowing Morbius' hatred, he will seek out the Sisterhood. Sure enough, Morbius finds one of the Sisters in some ruins nearby and kills her. The Doctor and Solon find the body and they search the ruins. Morbius attacks the Doctor, but is knocked out by Solon's tranquilliser. As they carry the creature back to the castle, the Doctor tells Solon that Morbius's brain will be detached and returned to the Time Lords.\n\nThe body of the dead Sister is brought back to Maren. Ohica reports that witnesses saw a creature and then the Doctor and Solon hunting for it. Maren realises that Solon has succeeded in his experiments and resurrected their ancient enemy. But Maren is too old and weak to leave the shrine, and she gives Ohica permission to lead the Sisters to the castle.\n\nThe Doctor gives Solon five minutes to disconnect the brain as he goes and checks on Sarah Jane. However, Solon locks them in the secret laboratory instead and begins to repair Morbius. Using materials from the secret laboratory, the Doctor makes [[cyanogen]] gas, which he then pipes through a vent that leads to the operating room above. Though Solon dies from exposure to the gas upon finishing the operation, Morbius' lungs filter out the poison as he goes to confront Sarah Jane and the Doctor&nbsp;\u2014 he claims that when the knowledge of his resurrection spreads, his followers will rise in their millions. The Doctor and Sarah Jane mock Morbius in an attempt to overheat his brain, and the Doctor challenges him to a mindbending contest.\n\nThey grab hold of the appropriate apparatus in the laboratory and begin. The machine's display begins to show Morbius' brain casing head, then his previous face, then the Doctor, then the Doctor's [[Third Doctor|previous incarnation]]. After going through the Doctor's previous incarnations, a series of eight other faces are shown before Morbius' brain case shorts out. The Doctor collapses, as Morbius stumbles out in a daze. The Sisterhood arrive and chase Morbius over a cliff, and Ohica finds Sarah Jane crying over the Doctor.\n\nTaking the Doctor back to the shrine, Maren says only the Elixir of Life can save him, but there is none left. However, the revived Flame has gathered enough Elixir. There is enough for the Doctor, but not for Maren, who accepts that the Doctor was right: there should be an end. The Elixir is given to the Doctor, who revives almost immediately. Maren steps into the Flame of Life, becoming younger, and then vanishes.\n\nOhica starts to thank the Doctor, but he stops her, saying that he and Sarah Jane have another engagement. Before they leave, he gives her a pair of curious objects in case they need to relight the Flame again. When Ohica asks what they are, the Doctor answers, \"A mighty atom and a thunderflash.\" He explains that the writing on the cardboard tubes reads: \"Light the blue touch paper and stand clear.\" This time, the TARDIS vanishes in a puff of light and smoke.\n\n===Continuity===\nThe 2020 series finale \"[[The Timeless Children]]\" revealed that The Doctor is in fact a transdimensional foundling originally known as the Timeless Child, possessing an infinity capacity to regenerate but now retaining only memories from the incarnation known as the \"First Doctor\" (Hartnell) forward. The Time Lords developed the ability to regenerate by studying the Timeless Child's natural ability. The episode included a sequence where scenes from throughout the programme's run are used to represent the Doctor's recollection of her past incarnations, with the incarnations from ''The Brain of Morbius'' specifically included.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-03-01/doctor-who-more-doctors-morbius/ | title = Doctor Who\u2019s big reveal just solved a 44-year-old mystery | first = Morgan | last=  Jeffrey | date = 1 March 2020 | accessdate = 1 March 2020 | work = [[Radio Times]] }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe original script was written by Terrance Dicks, using some ideas from his script of the stage play ''[[Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday]]'' to a requirement from Hinchcliffe for a story about a human/robot relationship. However, after delivery Dicks was out of the country when it was decided that the robot, core to the story, could not be realised under the budget constraints. In excising the character [[Script editor]] Robert Holmes had to undertake the substantial rewrites without informing Dicks, who could not be contacted. The robot character was replaced with Solon who required a different motivation\u2014that of a mad scientist. Dicks later said of the decision that it was not original but it was the \"only one available\". Upon his return to the United Kingdom, Dicks learnt of the changes and angrily phoned Holmes. Since the work was more Holmes than his own, Dicks demanded the removal of his name from the credits saying it could go out under a \"bland [[pseudonym]]\".<ref name=\"codenames\"/> This ended up being the name ''Robin Bland''.<ref name=\"codenames\">{{cite web|first=William|last=Gallagher|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-27/doctor-whos-secret-history-of-codenames-revealed|title=Doctor Who's secret history of codenames revealed|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=27 March 2012|accessdate=31 March 2013}}</ref><ref>Howe, Walker and Stammers ''Doctor Who the Handbook: The Fourth Doctor'' pp 175-176</ref> \nThe episodes were recorded entirely in studios during October 1975.\n\n===Cast notes===\nPhilip Madoc had already appeared in ''[[The Krotons]]'' (1968\u201369) and ''[[The War Games]]'' (1969) and would appear afterwards in ''[[The Power of Kroll]]'' (1978\u201379).

Inland, the countryside was largely under the control of Gaelic Chieftains, such as the O'Toole and O'Byrne clans. Bray features on the 1598 map \"A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles\"<ref name=\"map\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/104/zoom.html|title=A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> by [[Abraham Ortelius]] as \"Brey\". The [[Earl of Meath]] purchased the [[Killruddery House|Killruddery Estate]] in Bray in 1627 with the establishment of the Earl title.

Inland, the countryside was largely under the control of Gaelic Chieftains, such as the O'Toole and O'Byrne clans. Bray features on the 1598 map \"A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles\"<ref name=\"map\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/104/zoom.html|title=A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> by [[Abraham Ortelius]] as \"Brey\". The [[Earl of Meath]] purchased the [[Killruddery House|Killruddery Estate]] in Bray in 1627 with the establishment of the Earl title. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Bray was a small manorial village, but during the latter part of the 18th century, the Dublin middle-classes began to move to Bray.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway]], the first in Ireland, opened in 1834 and was extended as far as Bray in 1854. With the coming of the railway, the town grew to become a seaside resort. Hotels and residential terraces were built in the vicinity of the seafront. Railway entrepreneur [[William Dargan]] developed the Turkish baths, designed in a [[Moorish Revival architecture|Moorish style]] at a cost of \u00a310,000; these were demolished in 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.historyireland.com/volumes/volume15/issue6/news/?id=114148 |title=Bray's Turkish Baths |journal=[[History Ireland]] |volume=15 |issue=6 |date=16 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315011606/http://www.historyireland.com/volumes/volume15/issue6/news/?id=114148 |archivedate=15 March 2011}}</ref> By the mid-20th century, the town's use as a resort had declined when foreign travel became an option for holiday-makers.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} However, day-trippers continued to come to Bray during the summer months.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Braybeach.jpg|thumb|Seafront and Bray Head]]\n\nThe town is situated on the east [[Irish Sea|coast]] to the south of County Dublin.
