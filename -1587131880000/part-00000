The express service was discontinued in 1959. From 1989 to 2005, the 1 ran in a [[skip-stop]] service pattern during rush hours, with the [[9 (New York City Subway service)|9]] providing the complementary skip-stop service on the same route. The 1 and 9 trains were rerouted after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001; although they had mostly resumed their normal route by 2002, the 1 train skipped the [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street]] station until 2018.\n\n== Service history ==\n=== Early service ===\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\">\n{| width=\"80\"\n[[File:R12 IRT 1.svg|64px]]\n|-\n|<div class=\"thumbcaption\">Original [[R12 (New York City Subway car)|R12]] to [[R36 (New York City Subway car)|R36]] end rollsign</div>\n|}\n</div>\n\nWhen the New York City Subway [[Early history of the IRT subway|began operation]] between 1904 and 1908, one of the main service patterns was the West Side Branch, which the modern 1 train uses.

However, the agency settled on skip-stop service because the center track existed in two discontinuous segments, which would require complicated track-switching maneuvers to accommodate the express trains. Most passengers would not have to wait longer for a train: previously, one-third of 1 trains had terminated at 137th Street, but under the new service pattern, these trains would run the full route to 242nd Street instead.<ref name=\":02\" /> Previously, stations north of 137th Street were served by a train every 10 minutes.

The goals of skip-stop service were to extend all trips to 242nd Street, to provide faster travel times for a majority of riders, and to improve service reliability through evenly loaded and spaced trains. During 1987 and 1988, analysis was conducted to determine various options for express service along the 1, including using the center express track. As part of the plan, express service was to operate weekdays between 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and 7 p.m.. Trips that ended at 137th Street were extended to 242nd Street, which eliminated the need for a significant reduction in service levels at local stops. The 125th Street station, which is located south of 137th Street, would have experienced a reduction in service. The location of all-stop stations and skip-stop stations was done to evenly distribute passengers between the 1 and the 9, and to accommodate reverse commuting patterns. Stops with ridership greater than 8,000 daily passengers were designated all-stop stations, while less patronized stops were served by either 1 or 9 trains. One change was made from the 1988 plan: due to community input 181st Street was added as an all-stop station. Express service was expected to save up to 2.5 minutes of travel time, while all-stop stations would see an additional 2.5 minute reduction in waiting time. This would save between six and nine minutes or a 19% travel time reduction. Running express service via the center track was dismissed since the track had not been designed for express service. The track south of 145th Street is not long enough to allow an express train to pass a local, resulting in merging delays at 103rd Street which would eliminate any time saved. In addition, the busiest stops on the route north of 96th Street would be bypassed without any time savings. Extending all-local service to 242nd Street or adding additional trains were dismissed since they would require additional subway cars, which were not available at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/Koch_FILES/08.005.0000.0000268.05.PDF#undefined|title=#1 Broadway/7th Ave Line Skip-Stop Express Service|date=May 4, 1989|website=laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn July 28, 1989, the MTA Board approved a revised 1/9 skip-stop plan unanimously, with the plan scheduled to take effect on August 21, 1989.

a [[rapid transit]] service in the [[A Division (New York City Subway)|A Division]] of the [[New York City Subway]].

Initially, there were two main service patterns south of 96th Street: a local service to [[South Ferry (Manhattan)|South Ferry]] in [[Manhattan]], and an express service to [[Brooklyn]]. The express service was discontinued in 1959. From 1989 to 2005, the '''1''' ran in a [[skip-stop]] service pattern during rush hours, with the '''[[9 (New York City Subway service)|9]]''' providing the complementary skip-stop service on the same route. The '''1''' and '''9''' trains were rerouted after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001; although they had mostly resumed their normal route by 2002, the '''1''' train skipped the [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street]] station until 2018.\n\n== Service history ==\n=== Early service ===\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\">\n{| width=\"80\"\n[[File:R12 IRT 1.svg|64px]]\n|-\n|<div class=\"thumbcaption\">Original [[R12 (New York City Subway car)|R12]] to [[R36 (New York City Subway car)|R36]] end rollsign</div>\n|}\n</div>\n\nWhen the New York City Subway [[Early history of the IRT subway|began operation]] between 1904 and 1908, one of the main service patterns was the West Side Branch, which the modern '''1''' train uses.

There was both local and express service with express trains using the express tracks south of [[96th Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|96th Street]]. Some express trains ran to [[Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Atlantic Avenue]] in Brooklyn via the [[Joralemon Street Tunnel]] during rush hours while all other trains terminated at [[City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|City Hall]] or the [[South Ferry\u2013Whitehall Street (New York City Subway)|South Ferry outer loop]].<ref>{{cite book|work=Commerce and Industry Association of New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC09291039&id=2OXifdf0CbUC|title=Pocket Guide to New York|date=1906|pages=19\u201326}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1908/04/30/archives/bronx-to-montauk-one-change-of-cars-this-trip-made-possible-by-the.html|issn=0362-4331|title=Bronx to Montauk; One Change of Cars|date=April 30, 1908|page=4}}</ref><ref name=BDE1916>{{cite book|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxknlr&view=1up&seq=151|title=Brooklyn Daily Eagle Almanac. 1916: A Book of Information, General of the World, and Special of New York City and Long Island|date=1916|page=119}}</ref>\n\nOn June 3, 1917, the first portion of the Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line south of [[Times Square\u201342nd Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Times Square\u201342nd Street]] (to [[34th Street\u2013Penn Station (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|34th Street\u2013Penn Station]]) opened.

The goals of skip-stop service were to extend all trips to 242nd Street, to provide faster travel times for a majority of riders, and to improve service reliability through evenly loaded and spaced trains. During 1987 and 1988, analysis was conducted to determine various options for express service along the '''1''', including using the center express track. As part of the plan, express service was to operate weekdays between 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and 7 p.m.. Trips that ended at 137th Street were extended to 242nd Street, which eliminated the need for a significant reduction in service levels at local stops. The 125th Street station, which is located south of 137th Street, would have experienced a reduction in service. The location of all-stop stations and skip-stop stations was done to evenly distribute passengers between the '''1''' and the '''9''', and to accommodate reverse commuting patterns. Stops with ridership greater than 8,000 daily passengers were designated all-stop stations, while less patronized stops were served by either '''1''' or '''9''' trains. One change was made from the 1988 plan: due to community input 181st Street was added as an all-stop station. Express service was expected to save up to 2.5 minutes of travel time, while all-stop stations would see an additional 2.5 minute reduction in waiting time. This would save between six and nine minutes or a 19% travel time reduction. Running express service via the center track was dismissed since the track had not been designed for express service. The track south of 145th Street is not long enough to allow an express train to pass a local, resulting in merging delays at 103rd Street which would eliminate any time saved. In addition, the busiest stops on the route north of 96th Street would be bypassed without any time savings. Extending all-local service to 242nd Street or adding additional trains were dismissed since they would require additional subway cars, which were not available at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/Koch_FILES/08.005.0000.0000268.05.PDF#undefined|title=#1 Broadway/7th Ave Line Skip-Stop Express Service|date=May 4, 1989|website=laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn July 28, 1989, the MTA Board approved a revised '''1'''/'''9''' skip-stop plan unanimously, with the plan scheduled to take effect on August 21, 1989.

{"title_page": "Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More footnotes|date=February 2018}}\n{{Missing information|Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|date=December 2019}}\n{{Second person|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Gameplay of ''Pok\u00e9mon''}}\nThe gameplay of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series]] involves the catching and training of fictional creatures called \"Pok\u00e9mon\" and using them to battle other Trainers. Each successive [[Pok\u00e9mon#Generations|generation]] of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pok\u00e9mon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere in the franchise before being introduced to the games; double battles appeared in the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|anime]] long before appearing in the games, and [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Pok\u00e9mon Abilities]] are similar to the Pok\u00e9mon Powers introduced in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', which also introduced [[#Shiny Pok\u00e9mon|Shiny Pok\u00e9mon]], different colors of that type of the original Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nSome Pok\u00e9mon with very high stats and good moves are used in [[Pok\u00e9mon competitive play]], which requires more complex strategies than picking supereffective moves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/strategy/making-the-jump-to-video-game-competitive-play/|title=Making the Jump to Video Game Competitive Play - Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Game structure ==\nEach game in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series takes place in a fictional region of the Pok\u00e9mon world and begins with the player receiving a [[#Starter Pok\u00e9mon|starter Pok\u00e9mon]] from that region's Pok\u00e9mon Professor. By traveling around the world, [[#Catching Pok\u00e9mon|catching]] and [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolving]] Pok\u00e9mon, and defeating other Trainers in [[#Pok\u00e9mon battles|battle]], the player increases the size and strength of their Pok\u00e9mon collection. A major subplot of each game is to defeat a [[criminal organization]], whose intents are usually trying to take over the world through the misuse of Pok\u00e9mon. These organizations include [[Team Rocket]], Neo Team Rocket, [[Team Aqua]] and [[Team Magma]], [[Team Galactic]], [[Team Plasma]], Neo Team Plasma, [[Team Flare]], [[Team Skull]], [[Team Rainbow Rocket]], the [[Aether Foundation]], [[Team Yell]], and [[Macro Cosmos]].\n\nVarious facilities can be found throughout the Pok\u00e9mon world such as Pok\u00e9mon Centers, Pok\u00e9 Marts, and Gyms. At a Pok\u00e9mon Center, the player can have their Pok\u00e9mon healed for free and access the PC, where players can organize their collection of Pok\u00e9mon, store and withdraw items, and have their Pok\u00e9dex rated. Before ''X'' and ''Y'', this is also where players can link up with other game cartridges or cards to battle or [[#Pok\u00e9mon trades|trade]] with other players. Pok\u00e9 Marts are shops where players can buy [[#Items|items]] with the money they win during battles; certain cities may have specialized shops, like a pharmacy or a department store. Periodically, a town will contain a [[#Pok\u00e9mon Gyms|Pok\u00e9mon Gym]], which houses a powerful Trainer known as a [[Gym Leader]]. Victory against them grants the player a Gym Badge; after collecting eight Gym Badges, the player may challenge the region's [[Elite Four]] and Champion. Gyms are absent in ''Sun'', ''Moon'', ''Ultra Sun'' , and ''Ultra Moon'', being replaced by trials which serve a similar purpose. Upon completion of a Trial, the player receives a Z-Crystal, which grants a Pok\u00e9mon access to an extremely powerful move called a Z-Move. The trend of Gyms continues in ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.\n\nCompleting the main storyline opens up other features in the games; this is primarily done by allowing passage into otherwise inaccessible places. Afterward, the game remains virtually open-ended, with the ultimate goal of the player being to obtain at least one member of each of the different species of Pok\u00e9mon, thus completing the [[Pok\u00e9dex]]. The number of Pok\u00e9mon increases with each game generation, starting from 151 in the first generation to 890 as of ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Gyms ===\n{{nihongo|Pok\u00e9mon Gyms|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b8\u30e0|Pok\u00e9mon Jimu}} are buildings situated throughout the Pok\u00e9mon world, where Pok\u00e9mon Trainers can train or compete to qualify for Pok\u00e9mon League competitions. Although the internal organizations of Pok\u00e9mon Gyms may vary, the majority specialize in one certain type of Pok\u00e9mon, and all are manned by a {{nihongo4|[[Gym Leader]]|\u30b8\u30e0\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|Jimu R\u012bd\u0101}}, a formidable Trainer that acts as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. Pok\u00e9mon Gyms can be found in many towns and cities in the Pok\u00e9mon world.\n\nIn each Gym, there are various Gym Trainers that the player may face before battling the Gym Leader. These Gym Trainers are often placed so that the player is forced into battle with them. When a Trainer defeats a Gym Leader in battle, the former wins a {{nihongo4|Badge|\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8|Bajji}}, which serves as proof of a Trainer's skill and is a key part of advancing the plot. In ''Sword'' and ''Shield'', a Trainer must complete a Gym Challenge, which is essentially a minigame, in order to continue through the Gym. Also, this will earn the former a [[Technical and Hidden Machines|Technical Machine]] (prior to ''Sun'' and ''Moon''), which allows the player to teach their Pok\u00e9mon a certain move. It also usually enables the player to utilize the overworld effects of one of the various Hidden Machines, such as the ability to cross bodies of water with the move Surf or the ability to remove some trees from paths with the move Cut. As the player collects Gym Badges, the maximum level at which traded Pok\u00e9mon obey their commands increases. \n\nAfter a player defeats the eight Gym Leaders, they can travel through Victory Road, and then proceed to the Pok\u00e9mon League and challenge the {{nihongo4|[[Elite Four]]|\u56db\u5929\u738b|Shitenn\u014d}} and the region's Pok\u00e9mon League {{nihongo4|Champion|\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30aa\u30f3|Champion}}. Defeating the Champion is considered to be the goal of the game.\n\n=== Island Trials ===\nIn ''Sun'', ''Moon'', ''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'', there are no Gyms or Gym Leaders. The player is instead given various \"trials\" by characters known as Trial Captains. A trial usually presents the player with a task they must complete to summon a Totem Pok\u00e9mon, a more powerful version of a certain species of Pok\u00e9mon. Once the player has summoned and defeated the Totem Pok\u00e9mon, they receive a Z-Crystal, an item that allows Pok\u00e9mon to use powerful moves known as \"Z-Moves\". Completing all of the trials on an island allows the player to challenge that island's \"kahuna\" in a standard Pok\u00e9mon battle. The player can challenge the Pok\u00e9mon League after they have completed all four Grand Trials. After defeating the Elite Four, the player can defend their title as Champion by defeating a challenger.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon battles ==\n[[File:Pok\u00e9mon FireRed first battle.png|left|frame|In a battle scene in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version]]'', the Pok\u00e9mon at the top right of the screen is the opponent's; the bottom left is the player's. The player's options are shown at the bottom right.]]\n\nBattles between Pok\u00e9mon are the central game mechanic of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games. They are used to train Pok\u00e9mon to become stronger, like competitions, and to reach certain objectives within the game. Battling can also be done between players by connecting two games.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon'' uses a [[turn-based]] system. When the player challenges a Trainer or encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the screen changes to a battle scene with the player's Pok\u00e9mon, the opposing Pok\u00e9mon, their respective [[Health (gaming)|HP]] bars, and an option menu. At any time, the player may carry up to six Pok\u00e9mon in his or her active party; the first Pok\u00e9mon in the lineup is automatically sent into battle. At the start of each turn, both sides can choose to [[#Pok\u00e9mon moves|attack]], use an [[#Items|item]], switch the Pok\u00e9mon for another in their party, or attempt to flee from battle (against a wild Pok\u00e9mon). If both sides attack, the one who goes first is determined by [[#Stats|Speed]], although some moves, items, and effects can override this. If either side chooses any other option, that action is performed before the attacks.\n\nEach Pok\u00e9mon uses moves to reduce their opponent's HP to zero, at which point the Pok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|faints|\u3072\u3093\u3057|hinshi}} and is unable to battle. If the player's Pok\u00e9mon wins, it receives [[experience point]]s; when enough have accumulated, the Pok\u00e9mon's level increases. If the player's Pok\u00e9mon faints, he/she may use another Pok\u00e9mon; in battles against wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may attempt to flee instead. If all of a player's Pok\u00e9mon faint, the player loses the battle. This causes the player to lose some money and return to the last Pok\u00e9mon Center they visited.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond Version'' instruction booklet. p.&nbsp;15.</ref>\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] introduced {{nihongo4|Double Battles|\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Daburu Batoru}}, in which the opposing teams battle with two Pok\u00e9mon at a time. Though the basic mechanics remain the same, moves may have multiple targets, and some affect the ally as well as the opponents. Additionally, some [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Abilities]] work only in Double Battles. {{nihongo4|Multi Battles|\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Maruchi Batoru}} were also introduced, with four Trainers in teams of two.

This means that an attack which would normally deal double damage instead deals half damage, and vice versa.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'' also introduce a new battle type, the SOS Battle. In these battles, the opposing Pok\u00e9mon may call for allies to assist them, making the battle two-on-one against the player.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon types ===\n[[File:Pokemon Type Chart.svg|thumb|275px|This chart shows the current eighteen Pok\u00e9mon types (as of ''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'') and their strengths, weaknesses, and immunities against one another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-x-and-pokemon-y/|title=Pok\u00e9mon X and Pok\u00e9mon Y &#124; Video Games & Apps|website=www.pokemon.com}}</ref>]]\nA Pok\u00e9mon's {{nihongo4|type|\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7|taipu}} is an elemental attribute determining the strengths and weaknesses of each Pok\u00e9mon and its moves. Pok\u00e9mon take double damage from attacking moves of types they are weak to and half damage from moves they resist. These type matchups offset one another in [[rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors]]-style relationships. Some Pok\u00e9mon types grant full immunity to certain attack types; for instance, Ghost types take no damage from Normal or Fighting-type moves. Some Pok\u00e9mon Abilities can change these interactions, such as Levitate making Pok\u00e9mon immune to Ground-type moves.\n\nIn the original ''Red'', ''Green'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'' games, there are a total of 15 Pok\u00e9mon types: Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, and Dragon. The Dark and Steel types were added in ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', and the Fairy type was introduced in ''X'' and ''Y''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/why-game-freak-introduced-the-fairy-type-in-pokemon-512779904|title=Why Game Freak Introduced The Fairy Type In Pokemon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> Some types have special properties unrelated to the damage chart; for example, Electric types are immune to being paralyzed.\n\nThe console RPGs ''Colosseum'' and ''XD'' featured a unique move type known as Shadow, but it does not appear outside these games. Shadow Pok\u00e9mon can be considered to be of this type, but they still retain their regular typing as well. In ''Pok\u00e9mon XD'', Shadow moves are super effective against non-Shadow Pok\u00e9mon and not very effective against Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon moves ===\nLike the characters in many [[role-playing video game]]s, Pok\u00e9mon can learn a wide variety of {{nihongo4|moves|\u6280|waza}}. These moves may inflict damage, induce status problems, restore health, or perform actions that in some way affect the battle. The general strength of and resistance to these moves are determined by the various [[#Stats|statistics]] a particular Pok\u00e9mon has. All moves have a type, {{nihongo4|power|\u5a01\u529b|Iryoku}}, accuracy, and a number of Power Points (PP). The moves that one Pok\u00e9mon may learn are different from another depending on the species of Pok\u00e9mon; even those that [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] from others do not necessarily learn all the same moves that their predecessors learn. Each Pok\u00e9mon may only know a total of four moves at any one time. Moves may be learned through leveling up, using [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|TMs and HMs]], [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]], and move tutors ([[Non-player character|NPC]]s that teach moves).\n\nEach move is classified as one of the 18 [[#Pok\u00e9mon types|Pok\u00e9mon types]]. The effectiveness of a move is dependent on how susceptible the target Pok\u00e9mon's type is to the move's type. Phrases associated with this aspect are \"It's super effective!\" (damage is at least doubled), \"It's not very effective\u2026\" (damage is at least halved), and \"It doesn't affect [defending Pok\u00e9mon]...\" (damage and all effects are negated). A Pok\u00e9mon with the same type as the move it uses will receive a 50% bonus to its damage, referred to as a \"Same-Type Attack Bonus\" (STAB). Moves are further defined as \"physical\" or \"special\"; before the ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' games, moves' status of being either physical or special depended on the type, rather than on the individual move. There are also \"status\" moves, which deal no damage and often inflict status changes on the defending or attacking Pok\u00e9mon. Damage-inflicting moves remove a certain number of [[Health (gaming)|Health Points]] from the target Pok\u00e9mon based on the types of the move and its target, and on the statistics of the two Pok\u00e9mon. The damage can also be affected by [[#Items|items]] held by either Pok\u00e9mon or by their [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Abilities]].\n\nEach move has a specific {{nihongo4|accuracy|\u547d\u4e2d|Meich\u016b}}, which determines the chance of hitting the target Pok\u00e9mon assuming no changes are made to user's [[#Stats|accuracy]] or the target's evasiveness. Very powerful moves often have below-average accuracy. Moves with standard 100% accuracy ratings are susceptible to changes in accuracy and evasiveness, but some moves bypass both and always land.\n\nThe PP (Power Points) of a move indicate how many times a Pok\u00e9mon may use that move. As with accuracy, a powerful move is often offset by having a low number of PP. Once a Pok\u00e9mon uses up all the PP for a certain move, it can no longer use that move. If a Pok\u00e9mon expends all the PP for all of its moves, it then resorts to a move called Struggle, which damages the user as well as the target. Depleted PP can be restored by using certain items or by visiting a Pok\u00e9mon Center.\n\nMany moves have effects beyond inflicting damage. A common secondary effect is a chance to induce a certain {{nihongo4|[[status effect]]|\u72b6\u614b\u7570\u5e38|j\u014dtai ij\u014d}} on the target: {{nihongo4|paralysis|\u307e\u3072|Mahi}}, {{nihongo4|burn|\u3084\u3051\u3069|Yakedo}}, {{nihongo4|freeze|\u3053\u304a\u308a|K\u014dri}}, {{nihongo4|poison|\u3069\u304f|Doku}}, or {{nihongo4|sleep|\u306d\u3080\u308a|Nemuri}}; each negatively affects how the afflicted Pok\u00e9mon performs in battle. Some moves have negative side-effects for the user, such as forcing the player to wait a turn before or after use or causing recoil damage. A few moves, such as Splash, does nothing whatsoever except when used as a Z-Move.\n\n=== Z-Moves ===\nOnce per battle, if a Pok\u00e9mon holds a Z-Crystal, a powerful object you get from completing island trials, it can use an upgraded version of one of its moves, called a Z-Move. Z-Moves based on attacking moves tend to have much higher power than normal; those based on status moves usually incur a benefit on the user before executing the move.\n\n=== Moves outside of battles ===\nCertain moves can also be used in the overworld to bypass obstacles, quickly travel between locations, escape dungeons, or heal Pok\u00e9mon. Usually, Pok\u00e9mon will learn these moves with the use of the [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|HM]] items and will be able to use them in the aforementioned ways after certain Badges are obtained.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon abilities ===\nPok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Abilities|\u7279\u6027|Tokusei}} are special attributes which were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]. Specific species of Pok\u00e9mon have one to three possible Abilities, with individual Pok\u00e9mon exhibiting one Ability each. Unlike the moves a Pok\u00e9mon knows, its Ability cannot normally change (except sometimes during evolution, and by using the Ability Capsule, which was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']]).\n\nMost Pok\u00e9mon use their Abilities in battle. Abilities can strengthen a Pok\u00e9mon's statistics or weaken a foe, inflict [[status effect]]s such as paralysis or poisoning, or perform other effects. Some Abilities also grant immunities or resistances, such as Water Absorb - when a Pokemon with this Ability gets hit by a Water-type attack, it absorbs the attack upon contact, recovering HP in the process, rather than losing HP as normal. Not all Abilities are helpful and may be implemented to hinder a Pok\u00e9mon. For example, [[Slaking (Pok\u00e9mon)|Slaking]], which would otherwise be extraordinarily powerful, has the Truant Ability, which only lets it attack every other turn.\n\nSome Abilities have effects outside of Pok\u00e9mon battles. For example, Pok\u00e9mon with the Pickup Ability will sometimes retrieve items off the ground. A Pok\u00e9mon with the Ability Intimidate, mentioned above, will cause the player to encounter lower-level wild Pok\u00e9mon less often.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;277</ref>\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'' introduced Hidden Abilities, which initially could only be found on Pok\u00e9mon acquired from the Pok\u00e9mon Global Link, either through the Pok\u00e9mon Dream World feature or through promotional releases. There are also rare instances of Hidden Abilities available in the main game, either as a special encounter or as a Trade with an NPC. ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' introduced the game mechanic of {{nihongo4|Hidden Grottoes|\u96a0\u3057\u7a74|Kakushi Ana}}, areas where the player has a chance to find a Pok\u00e9mon that has its Hidden Ability. Subsequent games introduced more means of obtaining Pok\u00e9mon with Hidden Abilities; for instance, Pok\u00e9mon encountered in Horde Battles have a small chance of having their Hidden Ability.\n\n== Stats ==\nAll Pok\u00e9mon have six {{nihongo4|[[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]]|\u80fd\u529b|N\u014dryoku|\"Attribute\"}} which affect their performance in battle. These are HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-natures-tips-tricks-guide-synchronise-everstone/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Natures: How Personality Changes Stats And Abilities|date=12 April 2019|website=TheGamer|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> These statistics can be temporarily modified during battle by Abilities, items, and moves.\n* '''HP''' (short for Health Points): <!-- the official Pok\u00e9mon Emerald website says it's \"Health Points\" in Tucker's trivia; can we add this as a citation? --> A Pok\u00e9mon faints when its HP reaches zero, and it cannot be used in battle again until it is revived at a Pok\u00e9mon Center, or with a special item.

With some exceptions, Pok\u00e9mon with higher Speed make their moves before those with lower Speed.\n\nThere are also two other statistics, {{nihongo4|Accuracy|\u547d\u4e2d\u7387|Meich\u016britsu}} and {{nihongo4|Evasiveness|\u56de\u907f\u7387|Kaihiritsu}}, which are not affected when Pok\u00e9mon level up. No Pok\u00e9mon has innately higher Accuracy or Evasiveness than any other, but they can be modified during battle like other statistics. Increasing Accuracy makes a move more likely to hit while increasing Evasiveness makes the opponent's move more likely to miss. A Pok\u00e9mon's Accuracy, the opponent's Evasiveness, and the accuracy value of a given move affect the probability that the move will hit. Evasiveness was called \"Evade\" in the first generation and \"Evasion\" in the second.\n\nIn ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'', both the Special Attack and Special Defense stats were a single stat, named the \"Special\" stat, which determined both power with and resistance against special attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/pokemon-red-blue-things-wrong/|title=25 Things Wrong With Pok\u00e9mon Red And Blue Everyone Chooses To Ignore|date=29 March 2019|website=ScreenRant|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pok\u00e9mon level up, their statistics increase, as determined by the Pok\u00e9mon's base stat values, effort values, Pok\u00e9mon Nature, and individual values. These variables working in tandem provide each Pok\u00e9mon with its unique stats.\n\n=== Base stat values ===\nThe Base stat values determine the natural statistical strengths of the various Pok\u00e9mon species. Every species is assigned a number in each of the six stats; the higher the number, the higher the stat can potentially be. While these values may greatly vary between species, they are the same for each member of that species. It is the difference among species which explains why all [[List of generation I Pok\u00e9mon#Aerodactyl|Aerodactyl]] will have a higher Speed than any [[Snorlax]] of the same level; however, it is the combination of other factors that causes some Snorlax to be faster than others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/smog/issue6/base_stats|title=Base Stat Ratings - Smogon University|website=www.smogon.com|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> Adding up all the base stat values for a certain species generates the base stat total, which players use to determine approximately how strong that species is.\n\n=== Effort values ===\n{{nihongo4|Effort values|\u52aa\u529b\u5024|doryokuchi|EVs}} are hidden values that affect the strengths of a Pok\u00e9mon in particular statistical areas. Differing effort value levels between two Pok\u00e9mon can create a significant difference in the two Pok\u00e9mon's statistical strengths. When a Pok\u00e9mon battles and defeats an opponent, they gain experience points and also receive a number and type of EVs according to the defeated Pok\u00e9mon's species. Every defeated Pok\u00e9mon gives at least one EV to each of the Pok\u00e9mon that fought it. Certain factors, like holding the Macho Brace item, can increase the rate at which EVs are gained in battle. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], a condition known as {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9rus|\u30dd\u30b1\u30eb\u30b9|Pokerusu}} was introduced which doubles the rate at which EVs are obtained, and will be contagious for a certain number of days, allowing it to spread to other Pok\u00e9mon. Also, consuming certain items can increase a Pok\u00e9mon's EVs, and certain Berries decrease EVs while increasing a Pok\u00e9mon's friendship value. There is a limit on the number of EVs Pok\u00e9mon can have, which prevents stats from increasing indefinitely. The total limit allows for maximum Effort Values in two stats simultaneously.\n\nIn the first- and second-generation games, a similar system usually referred to as Stat Experience or Stat Exp. was used. As with Effort Values, there is a limit to how much Stat Exp. a Pok\u00e9mon can have in each stat; however, unlike Effort Values, there is no limit to the total Stat Exp. a Pok\u00e9mon can have across all stats, meaning that a Pok\u00e9mon can have maximum Stat Exp. in every stat. Also of note is that, for Pok\u00e9mon from the first and second generation to be forward and backward compatible for trading, Stat Exp. was not tracked separately for Special Attack and Special Defense in the second generation games. Instead, the Special Stat Exp. value was used to calculate both Special Attack and Special Defense.\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], a minigame known as {{nihongo4|Super Training|\u30b9\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec|Supatore}} is introduced that allows players to more accurately manage the effort values. The player can do this by playing a [[Association football|soccer]]-like minigame, which also rewards the player with training bags to continue the training passively. The Pok\u00e9mon's effort values can also be viewed in the Super Training interface, which includes an \"Effort-o-Meter\" to allow the player to see the maximum capability of increasing the Pok\u00e9mon's effort values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/super_training/ |title=Super Training |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/system/05.html |title=\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u3092\u7279\u8a13\u3060\uff01 \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u306e\u80b2\u3066\u65b9\u3001\u300c\u30b9\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec\u300d\uff01\uff5c\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30ef\u30a4\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |publisher=Pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], a graph of a Pok\u00e9mon's EVs along with its base stats can be seen by pressing the Y button while viewing the summary of a Pok\u00e9mon. A sparkling stat shows that the Pok\u00e9mon had obtained the maximum number of EVs for the stat. Pok\u00e9mon can gain EVs passively through a feature called \"Pok\u00e9 Pelago\".\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Natures ===\nPok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Natures|\u6027\u683c|Seikaku}} were first introduced in ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Each Pok\u00e9mon has a Nature, randomly assigned when it is generated, which cannot be changed. A Pok\u00e9mon's Nature affects the rate at which some of its stats increase: out of the twenty-five possible Natures, twenty will increase one stat's growth rate but decrease another's. The other five modify the same stat in both increases and decreases, and thus the Pok\u00e9mon's overall growth is unaffected.<ref name=\"smogon.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/ingame/guides/breeding_guide_part1|title=The Breeding Guide Part I - Smogon University|website=www.smogon.com|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> Natures also determine which flavor of [[#Pok\u00e9mon Contests|Pok\u00e9blocks or Poffins]] that Pok\u00e9mon likes and dislikes.\n\n=== Individual values ===\n{{nihongo4|Individual values|\u500b\u4f53\u5024|kotaichi}} or IVs are a hidden value for each statistic which determine a Pok\u00e9mon's maximum potential. These values are randomly generated along with each Pok\u00e9mon when it is encountered or bred, and set in stone for the rest of the game. These hidden values are why even Pok\u00e9mon that seem identical and have been raised the same way may have different stats. IVs range from 0 to 31,<ref name=\"smogon.com\"/> and their Generations I and II predecessors, \"determinant values\", ranged from 0 to 15.\n\n== Items ==\nItems can be found in the world, given to the player by NPCs, or bought at shops for in-game currency.\n\n=== Recovery items ===\nMany items received in the game are used to heal Pok\u00e9mon during and outside of battles. A range of items cure various status conditions, such as Antidotes for poisoning and Awakenings for sleep. Revives restore a Pok\u00e9mon back to health after it has lost all of its HP. Ethers and Elixirs restore the PP of a Pok\u00e9mon's moves to varying degrees.\n\n=== Technical and Hidden Machines ===\n{{nihongo4|Technical Machines|\u308f\u3056\u30de\u30b7\u30f3|Waza Mashin}} and {{nihongo4|Hidden Machines|\u3072\u3067\u3093\u30de\u30b7\u30f3|Hiden Mashin}}, commonly abbreviated as TMs and HMs, can be used to teach moves to Pok\u00e9mon, including some moves that they would otherwise not learn by increasing in level. TMs are commonly found in the field, in shops, and as rewards for defeating a Gym Leader. HMs are often vital to game progression as they have important effects outside of battle, allowing the player to traverse certain obstacles. For example, Pok\u00e9mon who learn the HM move Surf can transport the protagonist over water, which is necessary to reach island locations. When a Pok\u00e9mon learns an HM move, the move cannot be deleted or replaced unless the player uses the services of an NPC known as the Move Deleter.  \n\n=== Key items ===\nKey items are rarer than regular items and are usually given to the player rather than found. These include [[fishing rod]]s which are used to find water-dwelling Pok\u00e9mon, a bicycle which allows the protagonist to move around faster, a dowsing machine, and keys which open locked doors leading to important areas. These items cannot be thrown away, sold, or given to a Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n=== Held items ===\nStarting with [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], each Pok\u00e9mon is able to hold a single item. Items carried by Pok\u00e9mon can have a range of effects. Some, like Berries, are consumed after one use and boost HP or stats. Others persistently boost move power, defense, Speed, and more. Just like moves, some items hinder the user to compensate their power; for instance, the Life Orb boosts the damage of the holder's attacks, but hurts it after each successful attack. Others items solely harm the user except in rare situations, such as the Toxic Orb, which badly poisons it. [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|Pok\u00e9mon ''X'' and ''Y'']] introduced Mega Stones used to [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] members of the stone's species, and [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'' and ''Moon'']] introduced Z-Crystals, which give the holder access to Z-Moves. Items like the Razor Claw and Razor Fang [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] certain Pok\u00e9mon when held while a condition is met. Most items, including [[#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s and [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Items|Potions]], can be held but have no effect when given to a Pok\u00e9mon. Items can be moved between, removed from, and neutralized on Pok\u00e9mon through moves like Trick, Knock Off, and Embargo, or consumed to damage the opponent through the attacks Fling and Natural Gift.  \n\n== Catching Pok\u00e9mon ==\n[[File:Pok\u00e9ball.png|thumb|left|150px|The standard Pok\u00e9 Ball is a well-known icon of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' franchise.]]\nBecause each player begins the game with only one starter Pok\u00e9mon, catching is one of the most fundamental aspects of Pok\u00e9mon, and the primary method of recruiting new Pok\u00e9mon to the player's party.\n\nIn a battle against a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may attempt to catch it by using one of many different types of [[#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s. The odds of success vary, but are increased if the target Pok\u00e9mon's HP is low, if the target is affected by a status-altering effect like sleep or paralysis, and if a stronger or specially-suited Pok\u00e9 Ball is used.\n\nIf the catch is successful, the caught Pok\u00e9mon's data is added to the [[#Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9dex]], the player may give the Pok\u00e9mon a nickname, and the Pok\u00e9mon is added to the player's party. However, if the player's party is filled to its maximum of six Pok\u00e9mon, the caught Pok\u00e9mon is instead sent to a storage box accessible at Pok\u00e9mon Centers. In the first- and second-generation games, if the current PC box is full, the player will be unable to catch any new Pok\u00e9mon until he or she accesses a PC and switches to a different box. In more recent games, new Pok\u00e9mon are automatically transferred to the next available box.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9 Ball ===\nThe {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9 Ball'''|\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Monsut\u0101b\u014dru|\"Monster Ball\"}} is a spherical device used by Pok\u00e9mon Trainers to catch wild Pok\u00e9mon and store them in the player's inventory when not active. Upon contact, the balls draw a Pok\u00e9mon inside and then close automatically. Wild Pok\u00e9mon are able to resist and break free; however, weakened Pok\u00e9mon and those with status conditions are less able to struggle and therefore more easily caught. [[Legendary Pok\u00e9mon]] are much more capable of resisting being caught, and will often require many Pok\u00e9 Balls or more powerful Pok\u00e9 Balls to catch them. If the player attempts to catch a non-player character's Pok\u00e9mon, the opponent will block the Ball to prevent its theft. Ultra beasts require a different pokeball altogether.\n\nAs depicted in the anime and manga series, the Pok\u00e9 Ball, when not in use, is the size of a [[golf ball]] and, with a press of the central button, enlarges to the size of a [[baseball]]. The Pok\u00e9mon is released for battle by throwing the ball; when retrieving a Pok\u00e9mon, a beam of red light converts the Pok\u00e9mon into energy to reclaim it. Pok\u00e9 Balls are explained as being incredibly comfortable for Pok\u00e9mon, so much that they would willingly enter one without any sort of encouragement.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hilliard |first1=Kyle |last2=Masuda |first2=Junichi |date=December 2012 |title=Pok\u00e9mon's Burning Questions |journal=[[Game Informer]] |issue=236 |pages=112}}</ref> The Pok\u00e9mon [[Voltorb]], [[Electrode (Pok\u00e9mon)|Electrode]], [[Foongus]], and [[Amoonguss]] are often mistaken for Pok\u00e9 Balls, due to their shape and color schemes which highly resemble Pok\u00e9 Balls.\n\nVarious types of Pok\u00e9 Balls exist. Introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] are the Pok\u00e9 Ball, {{nihongo4|Great Ball|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|S\u016bp\u0101 B\u014dru|\"Super Ball\"}}, {{nihongo4|Ultra Ball|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Haip\u0101 B\u014dru|\"Hyper Ball\"}}, and {{nihongo4|Master Ball|\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Masut\u0101 B\u014dru}}. The Master Ball always succeeds against any Pok\u00e9mon that can be caught, and of which typically only one is available in the game. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], there are fruits called '''Apricorns''', which, when given to Kurt in Azalea Town, make one of seven special types of Pok\u00e9 Balls, depending on the Apricorn's color. The seven kinds of Pok\u00e9 Balls Kurt can make (and the seven color Apricorns they are made out of) are Level (Red), Moon (Yellow), Lure (Blue), Friend (Green), Love (Pink), Fast (White), and Heavy (Black). Beginning in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'', ''Sapphire'', and ''Emerald'']], other specialized balls appear, including the Timer Ball, which becomes more effective as the number of turns in the current battle rises, and the Net Ball, which has a better chance of catching Water and Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon, among others. In addition, in several games there exists an area called the Safari Zone in which only Safari Balls can be used; these cannot be obtained or used elsewhere in the game. [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] introduced the Beast Ball, which is designed for capturing Ultra Beasts and is much more effective at capturing them than standard Pok\u00e9 Balls. There is also a special kind of Pok\u00e9 Ball known as the Cherish Ball, which can only be obtained through special distribution events.\n\nIn the [[Nintendo GameCube]] RPGs, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness]]'', the player is able to catch non-player characters' Pok\u00e9mon through the use of the Snag Machine, which turns Pok\u00e9 Balls into Snag Balls. Snag Balls are capable of catching any Pok\u00e9mon, and are developed by the antagonists to steal Pok\u00e9mon where they are not common in the wild. Snag Balls can also be used by the player to catch Shadow Pok\u00e9mon who have been tainted by the antagonist group and that the player is required to purify for game completion.\n\nPok\u00e9 Balls have appeared in every installment of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, releasing a Pok\u00e9mon to assist the player who grabbed it. ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' also introduces the Master Ball, which almost always releases a legendary Pok\u00e9mon, with a small chance of releasing Goldeen instead.\n\n[[UGO.com]] listed the Pok\u00e9 Ball eighteenth on their list of \"Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups\" citing how everybody runs to get it in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |title=Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups - UGO.com |publisher=[[UGO.com]] |author=Chris Littler |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019184843/http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |archivedate=2010-10-19 }}</ref>\n\n[[Category:Fictional items which are larger inside than outside]]\n\n=== Pok\u00e9dex ===\nThe {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9dex'''|[[:ja:\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u56f3\u9451|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u56f3\u9451]]|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan|lit. \"Pok\u00e9mon Encyclopedia\"}} is an [[electronics|electronic]] device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pok\u00e9mon.

Each region has its own Pok\u00e9dex, which differ in appearance, species of Pok\u00e9mon catalogued, and functions such as the ability to sort the list of Pok\u00e9mon based on [[alphabetical order]] or display the Pok\u00e9mon's size compared to the player character. The \"National Pok\u00e9dex\" allows Pok\u00e9mon from all regions to be catalogued. The Nintendo 3DS application ''[[Pok\u00e9dex 3D Pro]]'' features all of the Pok\u00e9mon with all of its forms and each one has its own animation.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon evolution ==\n[[File:Pokemon evolution.png|right|thumb|150px|A series of screenshots depicting an [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Abra evolving into a Kadabra]] in ''Pok\u00e9mon Emerald''.]]\n\n{{nihongo4|Evolution|\u9032\u5316|shinka}} is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in [[#Stats|stat]] values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's [[#Friendship|friendship]] level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\nThe player can choose to halt evolution at any time before the animation is finished by pressing the B button, unless the evolution was initiated by using an evolutionary stone on the Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9mon whose evolutions are canceled will attempt to evolve again after the condition for evolution is met again. Preventing evolution for a time can be useful, as many Pok\u00e9mon learn moves sooner in their unevolved form than in their evolved form.\n\nThe ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'' introduced the idea of numerical stages for referring to different points in a Pok\u00e9mon's evolution. This has translated into colloquial usage among fans of the games. All Pok\u00e9mon can be placed at one of four evolutionary stages (though no existing Pok\u00e9mon line includes more than three out of the four stages): Basic Pok\u00e9mon, Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon which evolve from Basic Pok\u00e9mon, Stage 2 Pok\u00e9mon which evolve from Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon, and [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|Baby Pok\u00e9mon]] which are acquired by breeding certain Basic or Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon and hatching their Eggs. A Pok\u00e9mon higher up on this evolutionary scale is sometimes called an evolved form of the previous stages; likewise, a Pok\u00e9mon lower down on the scale is said to be a pre-evolved form of later Pok\u00e9mon in the chain.\n\n=== Leveling up ===\nThis is the most common method of evolution across all Pok\u00e9mon generations, and involves Pok\u00e9mon acquiring experience points through battling other Pok\u00e9mon. \n\n=== Evolutionary stones ===\nEvolutionary stones are items which can be found throughout the games. Some Pok\u00e9mon can have particular evolutionary stones used on them, and doing so will cause the Pok\u00e9mon to evolve. Initially five evolutionary stones were introduced into the game: the Water, Thunder, Leaf, Moon and Fire Stones. Later generations introduced more kinds, bringing the total to ten in Generation VII.\n\n=== Trading ===\nSome Pok\u00e9mon, like [[Machoke]] and [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Kadabra]], evolve when [[#Pok\u00e9mon trades|traded]] between players. Additional evolutionary requirements can also exist; for instance, [[Seadra]] only evolves into [[Kingdra]] if it holds a Dragon Scale when traded, and [[Shelmet]] and [[Karrablast]] only evolve when traded for each other.\n\n=== Friendship ===\nA Pok\u00e9mon's {{nihongo4|friendship|\u306a\u3064\u304d\u5ea6|Natsuki-do|lit. \"Degree of Emotional Attachment\"; nicknamed \"Happiness\" by players}} is an attribute that can rise or fall based upon several conditions and events. This aspect, introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow]]'', determined Pikachu's stat growth and affected the outcome of certain NPC events. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] it is a means to evolve several Pok\u00e9mon. When Pok\u00e9mon like [[Chansey]] or [[Golbat]] level up and have very high Friendship, they will evolve.\n\nIn addition to its use in certain evolutions, the moves Return and Frustration base their power on the Pok\u00e9mon's friendship value, with Return's power rising the higher the friendship value is and Frustration's power rising the lower the friendship level is.\n\n=== Affection ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], a feature known as {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9mon-Amie'''|\u30dd\u30b1\u30d1\u30eb\u30ec|Pokeparure|\"Pok\u00e9Parler\"}} was introduced; in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'']], the feature is known as '''Pok\u00e9mon Refresh'''. It allows players to interact with and care for Pok\u00e9mon in a manner similar to some [[digital pet]] games. This minigame utilizes the touchscreen to allow players to pet their Pok\u00e9mon and feed them sweets to raise their affection value. In battle, Pok\u00e9mon with high Affection may turn to their Trainer to await orders and express emotions. Additionally, they can receive certain benefits such as an increased chance to land [[critical hit]]s if their affection reaches a high enough value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/pokemon_amie/ |title=At Play with Pok\u00e9mon-Amie! |publisher=pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/system/01.html |script-title=ja:\u304b\u308f\u3044\u304c\u3063\u3066\u7d46\u3092\u6df1\u3081\u308b\u3001\u300c\u30dd\u30b1\u30d1\u30eb\u30ec\u300d!\uff5c\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30ef\u30a4\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |publisher=pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-09-05|language=Japanese}}</ref> Eevee must have high affection and must know a Fairy-type move to evolve into Sylveon.\n\n=== Mega Evolution ===\n{{For|the concept in biology|Megaevolution}}\n{{nihongo4|Mega Evolution|\u30e1\u30ac\u30b7\u30f3\u30ab|Mega Shinka}} is a mechanic introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], which further increases the abilities of specific Pok\u00e9mon.

Like Mega Evolution, Bond Phenomenon, and Primal Reversion, Ultra Burst increases Necrozma's stats and is a temporary transformation.\n\n=== Dynamax & Gigantamax ===\nDynamax (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Daimax'') and Gigantamax (\u30ad\u30e7\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Kyodaimax'') are mechanics introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']]. If the player character possesses an item called the Dynamax Band (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30d0\u30f3\u30c9 ''Daimax Band''), it drastically increases the Pok\u00e9mon's size, it's HP by 50%, and can use Max Moves. The Pok\u00e9mon can further increase its HP by 5% from using Dynamax Candy (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30a2\u30e1''Daimax Candy'') to increase it's Dynamax Level. Gigantamax is similar to Dynamax, but it changes the Pok\u00e9mon's form, similar to Mega Evolution. Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon use G-Max Moves, exclusive to the 26 Pok\u00e9mon capable of Gigantamaxing. Each Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon must have their respective move type in order to use their respective G-Max Move. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion, Z-Moves, and Ultra Burst, Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing can only be used in Gym Stadiums, Max Raid Battles, and other areas except for wild or trainer battles. \n\n[[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Zacian|Zacian]], [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Zamazenta|Zamazenta]], and [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Eternatus|Eternatus]] are the only Pok\u00e9mon that cannot Dynamax.\n\n=== Eternamax ===\nEternamax (\u30e0\u30b2\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Mugendaimax'') is a mechanic introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']], exclusive to the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Eternatus|Eternatus]]. Eternatus changes into his Eternamax form after you defeat it for the first time. It's power prevents the player's and Hop's Pok\u00e9mon from attacking. Eternatus is attackable after the player summons the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Zacian|Zacian]] and [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Zamazenta|Zamazenta]], resulting in a Max Raid Battle where the player can capture Eternatus, and end its transformation.\n\nEternamax Eternatus can be used in battle, but the player cannot currently obtain this form of Eternatus.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon groups ==\n=== Starter Pok\u00e9mon ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left;font-size:85%\"\n|+ List of starter Pok\u00e9mon\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Game(s)\n! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\" | Starter Pok\u00e9mon\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Red'', ''Green'', ''Blue'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Bulbasaur]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| [[Charmander]]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Squirtle]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Gold'', ''Silver'']], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal|Crystal]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Chikorita]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| [[Cyndaquil]]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Totodile]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'', ''Sapphire'']], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|Emerald]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Treecko]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| [[Torchic]]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Mudkip]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'', ''Pearl'']] and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum|Platinum]]''\n| align=\"center\" | [[Turtwig]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| [[Chimchar]]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Piplup]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Black'', ''White'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Black 2'' and ''White 2'']]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Snivy]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| [[Tepig]]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Oshawott]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''X'' and ''Y'']]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Chespin]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| [[Fennekin]]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Froakie]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'']]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Rowlet]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| [[Litten (Pok\u00e9mon)|Litten]]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Popplio]]\n|-\n| scope=\"row\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Sword'' and ''Shield'']]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Grookey]]\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| [[Scorbunny]]\n| align=\"center\" | [[Sobble]]\n|}\n\nOne of the reoccurring aspects of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series of role-playing games is the choice of one of three different Pok\u00e9mon at the start of the player's adventures.  Players have the option to choose one of three different [[#Pok\u00e9mon types|types]] of Pok\u00e9mon: a Grass type, a Fire type, and a Water type, though many starter Pok\u00e9mon gain an additional type upon evolution.<ref name=spy>{{cite web |url=http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html |title=Pok\u00e9mon Ruby/Sapphire |last=Padilla |first=Raymond |publisher=GameSpy |access-date=2006-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002205143/http://uk.gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/pokemon-ruby-version/498107p1.html |archive-date=2013-10-02}}</ref> These Pok\u00e9mon are supposedly indigenous to their regions, yet otherwise unattainable except through trading with another game.

The Eevee will evolve into one of its three different evolved states depending on how well the player fares in battles with the rival at the beginning of the game.\n\n=== Legendary Pok\u00e9mon ===\n{{nihongo4|\"Legendary Pok\u00e9mon\"|\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3|Densetsu no Pok\u00e9mon}} is a [[technical terminology|term of art]]. Since the ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' versions of the games, the main series' game package features one Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, usually the Pok\u00e9mon most involved in the main storyline of that game. Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are often described as being exceptionally rare. In most cases, Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are exceptionally powerful, difficult to catch, and unable to [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]], and no known Legendary Pok\u00e9mon is capable of [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]]. Many Legendary Pok\u00e9mon also lack a gender. Certain Legendary Pok\u00e9mon colloquially termed \"roaming Pok\u00e9mon\" randomly move around the world map and flee from battle, making them even harder to obtain.\n\n=== Mythical Pok\u00e9mon ===\n{{nihongo4|\"Mythical Pok\u00e9mon\"|\u5e7b\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3|Maboroshi no Pok\u00e9mon}} is a separate group of Pok\u00e9mon. The term is commonly associated with Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, requiring an external mechanic to obtain them; however, some Mythical Pok\u00e9mon have been made obtainable in later releases, notably [[Deoxys]]. These Pok\u00e9mon are usually placed at the end of their respective games' Pok\u00e9dex and can only be obtained through distribution events set up by Nintendo. The first of these Mythical Pok\u00e9mon was [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]], who was programmed into the ''Red'' and ''Green'' games as a secret character by [[Shigeki Morimoto]] without any knowledge of the other members of the development team, and was not announced until several months after the games' release in a special promotion. Since then, the games have continued to feature Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, but the programming that allow the player to catch them within the games can be activated by special items (or other Pok\u00e9mon) distributed by Nintendo. The first of these such items was the GS Ball in ''Crystal'', which was distributed to players in Japan through the mobile phone connector, allowing them to encounter [[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]]. Like Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Mythical Pok\u00e9mon are powerful and difficult to catch, are usually not part of an evolutionary line, and cannot breed (with the exception of [[Manaphy]]).\n\n=== Shiny Pok\u00e9mon ===\n[[File:ShinyZubatEncounter.JPG|thumb|left|The player finds a green Zubat in ''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version''.]]\n\n'''Shiny Pok\u00e9mon''' were first introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Gold'' and ''Silver'']] as a way to demonstrate the new color capabilities of the [[Game Boy Color]] system. These are Pok\u00e9mon which have a different coloration than normal; in earlier games, this was done by means of a [[palette swap]]. Encountering a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon is extremely rare; the probability under normal conditions is 1 in 8,192 (1 in 4,096 from the sixth generation onwards).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/one-mans-five-year-quest-to-find-a-shiny-pokemon-1603763304|title=One Man's Five-Year Quest To Find A Shiny Pok\u00e9mon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> There are some major exceptions to this rule, such as a red [[Gyarados]] present in ''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'', ''HeartGold'', and ''SoulSilver'', and three Pok\u00e9mon present in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Pok\u00e9mon Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], all of which are guaranteed to be Shiny.\n\nThere are various ways of increasing the chance of getting a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. In second-generation games, breeding a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon with a regular Pok\u00e9mon has a higher chance (1 in 64) of producing a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. In ''Diamond'', ''Pearl'', ''Platinum'', ''X'', and ''Y'', the Pok\u00e9 Radar can be used to \"chain\" Pok\u00e9mon of the same species, improving the odds of a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon with each link (up to 40 links, when the odds are 1 in 200). Since Generation IV, [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]] Pok\u00e9mon that originated in games of two different languages results in Eggs with a 1 in 1,638 (Generation IV games) or 1 in 1365 (Black and White onwards) chance to contain a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon; this method of increasing odds has been dubbed the \"Masuda method\" after developer [[Junichi Masuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-to-get-a-shiny-pokemon-in-pokemon-x-and-y |title=How to Get a Shiny Pokemon In Pokemon X and Y |last=Khaw |first=Cassandra |publisher=USgamer |access-date=2016-06-17}}</ref> Additionally, an item introduced in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called the Shiny Charm increases the probability of finding Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. However, this item is only accessible long after completing the game, as the player must have completed the National Pok\u00e9dex (excluding Mythical Pok\u00e9mon). Beginning in ''Black'' and ''White'', certain Pok\u00e9mon in each game are 'Shiny-locked', meaning the player cannot obtain a Shiny variant of them in normal gameplay.\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|Pok\u00e9mon ''Sun'' and ''Moon'']]'s SOS Battle mechanic created a new way to \"hunt\" for Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. If a wild Pok\u00e9mon calls allies to help and the ally is continually of the same species in a \"chain\", the chance that it calls a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon rises up to a base of 13 in 4096 after the 30th is called, as do the chances of Hidden Ability and perfect [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Stats|IVs]], though they are capped at four perfect IVs maximum. In their [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|sequels']] Ultra Warp Ride [[minigame]], by successfully traveling more [[light-year]]s through the wormhole and entering wormholes with more rings, the player can increase the chance of finding Shiny Pok\u00e9mon in the Ultra Space Wilds. Generation 7 also introduced an upgrade to the \"Masuda method\" referred to as \"Swap Breeding\"; the game is continually saved and soft-reset until a fast-hatching, dummy Pok\u00e9mon is hatched shiny within the first thirty attempts, and shininess is transplanted to the new Pok\u00e9mon hatched in the same position as the dummy was.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/guides/2018/6/8/17409856/shiny-pokemon-guide|title=How to build an army of competitive shiny Pok\u00e9mon|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-09-18}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', Shiny Pok\u00e9mon have slightly above-average stats, but this is because their Shininess is determined by their [[#Individual values|determinant values]] in those games. In the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video games)#Game Boy Advance era|third generation]] and onward, however, Shininess is determined by another value, and Shiny Pok\u00e9mon are not stronger than any other Pok\u00e9mon in battle. Most fans consider Shiny Pok\u00e9mon to be collectors' items because of their rarity.\n\nThe term \"Shiny\" was initially a term invented by the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' fan community due to the flash of stars that appear when such a Pok\u00e9mon enters a battle, implying a sheen property to the colors of the Pok\u00e9mon. The term \"Shiny Pok\u00e9mon\" was later officially acknowledged in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], but it has been used in the anime and in a few strategy guides before this. The term {{nihongo3|\"shining\"|\u5149\u308b|hikaru}} was also a widely used slang term in Japan; Ken Sugimori uses ''hikaru'' in the title of a piece of artwork featuring a Shiny Charizard. The alternate term {{nihongo4|\"Alt. Color\"|\u8272\u9055\u3044|Iro Chigai}} appears among the options the player can choose when filling out forms in the third generation of games.\n\nShiny Pok\u00e9mon have appeared in the anime, including the aforementioned red Gyarados and a Noctowl that protagonist Ash Ketchum catches. A pink Butterfree was also featured in an episode of the first season of the anime, but this alternate coloration is not what appears in the subsequent video games where the Shiny feature has been implemented.\n\n== Connectivity ==\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon trades ===\n[[File:Game Boy(RTSide).png|thumb|right|The game link port is located above the volume control on the original [[Game Boy]] handheld system.]]\n\nPlayers have the ability to trade their Pok\u00e9mon with one another by connecting two compatible games. Trading is an important aspect to the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games, being the crux upon which much of the franchise is based. This is because the slogan, and consequently the goal, \"Gotta catch 'em All,\" is logistically impossible without trading. Each game released in a [[Pok\u00e9mon (video games)#Generations|generation]] has certain Pok\u00e9mon that are exclusive to that version. For example, in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' players can catch the Pok\u00e9mon [[Ekans]] and its evolved form, Arbok, while both are absent in the wild in both ''Pok\u00e9mon Blue'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''. Other Pok\u00e9mon are only available when offered up as a choice. The most obvious example is the choice between three [[#Starter Pok\u00e9mon|starter Pok\u00e9mon]] at the beginning of the game; the only way to get the other two is by trading. Some [[Non-player character|NPC]]s offer to trade Pok\u00e9mon with the player, allowing them to acquire Pok\u00e9mon otherwise unavailable without connecting to another game. For example, the only way to get a [[Jynx]] in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'' (other than trading with another game cartridge) is through an in-game trade. The other way that trading is made instrumental in gameplay is that some Pok\u00e9mon, like [[Haunter]] and [[Machoke]], only [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into their final forms when traded.\n\nTrading between games on the Game Boy and related systems is accomplished through a [[Game Link cable]] that attaches to ports found on all [[Game Boy line|Game Boy incarnations]]. The size of the ports varies between consoles, so several hybrid cables have been created that allow, for example, linking between the original [[Game Boy]] and the [[Game Boy Color]]. [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']] include a special wireless dongle which plugs into the game link port for local wireless communication. On the [[Nintendo DS]], DS Wireless Communications is used instead.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;240\u2013245</ref> [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] also introduced the Global Trade Station/System (or GTS), a place where people all around the world may trade Pok\u00e9mon using the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. In the GTS hall, the player can input their own location and pinpoint the locations of other players they have interacted with. The Nintendo WFC records this data when they trade successfully with someone over the GTS or in their Pal Pad.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;254</ref> For the [[Nintendo 3DS family|Nintendo 3DS line]], two successors to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection were implemented in each generation. In the Player Search System in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' & ''Y'']] and [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']], the function is simply called Trade, while in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'']] in the Festival Plaza, the function is called Link Trade. The second successor is called Wonder Trade; players choose a Pok\u00e9mon to trade and are randomly paired with another player around the world.\n\n== Mystery Gift ==\nMystery Gift, a means by which players can receive items from other people, was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] and has appeared in every handheld ''Pok\u00e9mon'' game since. To use Mystery Gift, the feature must first be activated in a specific way.\n\nIn ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', if two players line up the infrared ports on their [[Game Boy Color]] units and activate Mystery Gift from the intro menu, each will receive an item. This process also sends a record of each player's party Pok\u00e9mon to the other player's game for a daily event in Viridian City in which they can battle the other player's Pok\u00e9mon (controlled by the computer). Players can use Mystery Gift an unlimited number of times, but only once per day for each person. In addition, a player of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2]]'' with a ''Gold'', ''Silver'', or ''Crystal'' cartridge plugged into the [[Transfer Pak]] can use Mystery Gift with a girl in [[Pok\u00e9mon regions#Stadium regions|White City]]. A Mystery Gift can also be received by connecting with a [[Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu#Versions|Pocket Pikachu 2 GS]].\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], Mystery Gift is replaced with Mystery Event. This feature utilizes the now defunct [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] accessory. Using special [[Nintendo e-Reader#e-Reader cards|e-cards]], the player could obtain special items such as rare Berries or the Eon Ticket. In [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''LeafGreen'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|''Emerald'']], Mystery Gift is a means to obtain special items at Nintendo's promotional events through the use of the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter|Wireless Adapter]], which allow the player to catch otherwise unobtainable Pok\u00e9mon, such as [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]] and [[Deoxys]].\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] expanded Mystery Gift to include a variety of transferring options. After enabling Mystery Gift, players may obtain items via wireless or [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], and may also transfer them to friends. Wireless connection also allows the player to transfer items from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution]]''. Currently, Mystery Gift via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|Nintendo WFC]] has only been implemented in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]'' and [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']]. However, this was changed when the shiny Pichu was distributed to all version games via WFC. Also, with the creation of the Pok\u00e9walker, in [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], came another way to Mystery Gift. By pressing the connect button on two Pok\u00e9walkers and pointing them at each other, both Pok\u00e9walkers will receive an item, which the player will receive upon connecting with his or her game. Beginning with [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], an option to receive Mystery Gifts by single-use serial code or password over [[Nintendo Network]] was added. Single-use codes are given out in participating retailers and via the Pok\u00e9mon Global Link and are usually region locked. Wireless and infrared events are no longer region locked, allowing any region console to receive events distributed by those methods.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Bank ===\n{{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9mon Bank'''|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30d0\u30f3\u30af|Pok\u00e9mon Banku}} is an application which allows players to store up to 3,000 Pok\u00e9mon in an online [[cloud storage]] service. Players can deposit and withdraw Pok\u00e9mon from both physical and downloaded versions of compatible games, allowing players to exchange Pok\u00e9mon between the two versions without the need for a second system. Additionally, an application called {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9 Transporter|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e0\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc|Poke M\u016bb\u0101|\"Pok\u00e9 Mover\"}} allows players to upload Pok\u00e9mon from ''Pok\u00e9mon Black'', ''White'', ''Black 2'', and ''White 2'' to the Pok\u00e9mon Bank, after which they can be imported into newer games.

The update allows players to send their Pok\u00e9mon from their core sixth generation games to ''Sun'' and ''Moon'', though when transferred, they cannot return to the older games. Additionally, the Pok\u00e9 Transporter was also updated to allow players to transfer Pok\u00e9mon caught in the [[Virtual Console]] editions of [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'']], and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow|Yellow]]'' to ''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon''. The update also added a new in-app National Pok\u00e9dex, presumably to make up for the lack of one in Sun and Moon.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon Officially Announced|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/26/pokemon-sun-and-moon-officially-announced|website=IGN|publisher=IGN|accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/pokemon-bank-getting-national-pokedex-feature-with-sun-and-moon-support-20456791/|title=Pokemon Bank getting National Poked feature with Sun and Moon support - SlashGear|website=www.slashgear.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Pokemon Bank Now Compatible With Sun and Moon|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/25/pokemon-bank-now-compatible-with-sun-and-moon|website=IGN|accessdate=January 25, 2017|date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn November 17, 2017, coinciding with the release of ''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'', it was announced that the games would support ''Pok\u00e9mon Bank'' later the same month. The update, which came three days later, also added compatibility with the Virtual Console versions of [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] as well as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal|Crystal]]'' (which was not re-released until January 26, 2018) to the Pok\u00e9 Transporter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/17/pokmon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-will-get-pokmon-bank-compatibility-update-late-november/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon Will Get Pok\u00e9mon Bank Compatibility Update In Late November|website=Siliconera|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Home ===\nOn May 28, 2019, Pok\u00e9mon Home was revealed as the successor application to Pok\u00e9mon Bank. Scheduled for release in February 2020, the app will be available on [[Nintendo Switch]] and smartphone devices, and will have connectivity with Pok\u00e9mon Bank, [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|''Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']], and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Phillip|title=POK\u00c9MON HOME IS NEW POK\u00c9MON BANK THAT CONNECTS 'SWORD AND SHIELD, 'POK\u00c9MON GO' AND MORE|url=https://www.newsweek.com/pokemon-home-bank-sword-shield-go-1437721}}</ref> Players can get a free version that can store up to 30 Pokemon, or they can buy the premium pass which will let them store up to 6,000, twice as much as ''Pokemon Bank''.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon breeding ==\nPok\u00e9mon breeding was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]. Pok\u00e9mon can be bred in-game at a {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Day Care|\u80b2\u3066\u5c4b|Sodateya}}. These are businesses generally run by an elderly person or couple, which raise Trainers' Pok\u00e9mon for a fee. If two compatible Pok\u00e9mon are left there, they will eventually produce a Pok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Egg|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4|tamago}}, which the Trainer can pick up for free. After being carried by the Trainer for some distance, the Egg will hatch into a young Pok\u00e9mon, usually of the lowest stage in its mother's [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolutionary line]].\n\nSome Pok\u00e9mon have pre-evolutions that are usually only obtainable by hatching them from Eggs. Known as \"baby Pok\u00e9mon\", these Pok\u00e9mon are unable to breed but have evolutions that can breed baby Pok\u00e9mon. For most baby Pok\u00e9mon introduced after ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', the parent can only produce these Pok\u00e9mon when holding a certain item.<ref name=\"PBreeding\">Marcus, p.&nbsp;13</ref>\n\n=== Compatibility ===\nCompatibility is usually restricted to one male and one female. In addition, Pok\u00e9mon species are assigned to {{nihongo4|Egg Groups|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7|Tamago Gur\u016bpu}}, which determines their breeding compatibility with other species. Pok\u00e9mon may belong to up to two Egg Groups; in order to breed, they must share at least one Egg Group. Nearly all Pok\u00e9mon species, even those that are all-male or genderless, are able to breed with the shapeshifting Pok\u00e9mon [[Ditto (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ditto]]. The Egg produced will yield a hatchling from the non-Ditto Pok\u00e9mon's evolutionary line. Two Ditto cannot breed to produce another Ditto.\n\nA select group of species cannot breed at all, which includes all Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, all Ultra Beasts, most Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, Nidorina and Nidoqueen (but not Nidoran\u2640), Unown, and all \"baby\" Pok\u00e9mon. This is called the \"Undiscovered\" Egg Group. Although some Legendary Pok\u00e9mon have genders, they still cannot breed. An unusual circumstance involves the relation of the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Manaphy and Phione; both can breed with Ditto to create an Egg which hatches into Phione, yet Phione does not evolve into Manaphy. Manaphy itself is obtained from an Egg from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Ranger]]'' games, but it will never breed to produce another Manaphy Egg.\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nPok\u00e9mon hatched from Eggs can {{nihongo4|inherit|\u907a\u4f1d|iden}} stats from their parents. Three of the Pok\u00e9mon's [[#Individual values|individual values]] are inherited from one or the other of its parents, and the other three IVs are generated randomly.<ref name=\"Hbreeding2\">Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&nbsp;18.</ref>\n\nMoves can also be inherited through breeding. Moves that a newly hatched Pok\u00e9mon begins with are divided into three categories: learned moves, inherited moves, and hereditary moves or \"Egg Moves\". Learned moves are moves that the Pok\u00e9mon would have naturally at its starting level; inherited moves are those that the Pok\u00e9mon would be able to learn at later levels or through TMs; and {{nihongo4|Egg Moves|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u308f\u3056|Tamago Waza}}, inherited from the father (or either parent beginning in ''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y''), are those that the Pok\u00e9mon would not be able to learn normally. The Pok\u00e9mon can learn the move on this occasion as it receives the move from a parent of a different species. Upon birth, the young Pok\u00e9mon's move slots are filled with learned moves. However, if there are any inherited moves or Egg Moves available for the Pok\u00e9mon to learn, they replace the learned moves.<ref name=\"Hbreeding2\" /><ref>Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&nbsp;19.</ref>\n\n== Battle facilities ==\n{{redirect|Battle Frontier|the season of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime]]|List of Pok\u00e9mon: Battle Frontier episodes}}\nIn addition to the Pok\u00e9mon Gyms and other battles to advance the plot, side games and post-game areas have been introduced in subsequent editions of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games that extend the gameplay.\n\nFirst introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]]'', the {{nihongo4|Battle Tower|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc|Batoru Taw\u0101}} is a game feature accessible outside of the main storyline where the player faces several Trainers in succession with a limited set of their Pok\u00e9mon and receive prizes in the form of otherwise rare items. The Japanese version of ''Crystal'' which had a [[mobile phone]] adapter allowed for players to challenge other players to Battle Tower fights. The next Battle Towers appear in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], which is similar to the ''Crystal'' Battle Tower, and in [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], which has a boss character and a point system similar to the Battle Frontiers.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Frontier|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2|Batoru Furontia}} was introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'', replacing the Battle Tower as found in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games. In addition to having its own Battle Tower with the same rules as the previous ones, the Battle Frontier adds several other game mechanics that make [[#Pok\u00e9mon battles|battles]] unique in the end game. Examples include the Battle Palace's prohibition on choosing what moves the Pok\u00e9mon uses and the Battle Factory's random rental Pok\u00e9mon. Instead of prizes, the player is awarded Battle Points (BP) which can be traded for rare items or TMs. The ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' Battle Tower uses this same system, and it is replaced by a Battle Frontier in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]''. The [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] games also have a Battle Frontier, identical to that of the ''Platinum'' version, where the Battle Tower was found in ''Crystal''. After a series of battles in each venue, players encounter {{nihongo4|[[Frontier Brains]]|\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3|Furontia Bur\u0113n}} who are challenged in the same fashion as all other battles, and the player will either earn a {{nihongo4|Symbol|\u30b7\u30f3\u30dc\u30eb|Shinboru|''Emerald''}} or a {{nihongo4|Commemorative Print|\u304d\u306d\u3093\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8|Kinen Purinto|''Platinum'', ''HeartGold'', ''SoulSilver''}} for winning. The Frontier Brains can be challenged a second time to more advanced versions of the Symbols or Prints (advancing from Silver to Gold). The Frontier Brains have very powerful Pok\u00e9mon, often including [[#Legendary Pok\u00e9mon|Legendary Pok\u00e9mon]], making a victory even more difficult than in the main storyline.\n\n''Emerald'' also features {{nihongo4|Battle Tents|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c6\u30f3\u30c8|Batoru Tento}}, which allow the player to encounter some of the unique battle mechanics of three of the Battle Frontier venues. Rather than Battle Points, the player is awarded with an item that is rare or expensive.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Subway|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4|Batoru Sabuwei}} is unique to the [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Black'' and ''White'']] games and serves as the games' Battle Tower, taking on the form of a [[Rapid transit|subway]] to match the games' [[New York City]]-styled setting. In the same vein as the Battle Tower in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' and the various Battle Frontiers, players earn BP and after a certain number of battles they challenge one or both of the two Subway Bosses ({{nihongo4|Subway Masters|\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Sabuwei Masut\u0101}} in Japan), depending on what type of battles (Single, Double, or Multi) the player was competing in.\n\nThe Battle Subway returns in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], but it is joined by two new sets of areas. The first one introduced in the games is the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ca\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8|Pok\u00e9mon W\u0101rudo T\u014dnamento}}, wherein the player participates in a tournament-style setting with various NPC Trainers, set to a particular theme of a level limit, using randomly assigned teams, or using teams downloaded from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, to earn BP. The more advanced side of the Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament is a tournament-style setting in battling the Gym Leaders and Pok\u00e9mon League Champions from all over the Pok\u00e9mon World, enabling players to challenge characters such as Brock and Misty from ''Red'' and ''Blue'', Volkner from ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Lance from ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', or Steven from ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Also introduced in the games are the {{nihongo4|Black Tower|\u9ed2\u306e\u6469\u5929\u697c|Kuro no Matenr\u014d}} in ''Black 2''{{'}}s Black City and the {{nihongo4|White Treehollow|\u767d\u306e\u6a39\u6d1e|Shiro no Jud\u014d}} in ''White 2''{{'}}s White Forest. In these facilities, the player must battle a series of Trainers without using items, and only relying on Doctor or Nurse Trainers to restore their team's health. At the end, the player challenges the leader and later is awarded a rare Pok\u00e9mon for succeeding.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Maison|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30cf\u30a6\u30b9|Batoru Hausu|\"Battle House\"}} is introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''X'' and ''Y'']], and can only be accessed after the player completes the main story. Similar to the Battle Frontier and the Battle Subway, there are different types of battling methods to choose from: single, double, triple, rotation, and multi battles. Then the player is drawn to a tournament where he/she is challenged to numerous battles with random Trainers. After winning a battle the player receives one BP (battle point) which can later be used to by items, vitamins, and TMs. After winning 21 battles the player must battle the strongest Trainer or referred to as the Battle Chatelaine. It depends on what battle style you choose. If the player beats 50 Trainers, they have the chance to battle one of the Battle Chatelaines again. Only this time do they use legendary Pok\u00e9mon (e.g. Zapdos, Moltres, Articuno). Another similar feature is the {{nihongo4|Battle Chateau|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b7\u30e3\u30c8\u30fc|Batoru Shat\u014d}}, where the player advances through a ranking system based on the [[French nobility]] system after battling increasingly difficult Trainers, including being able to battle the Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and Champion in the same system.\n\nIn ''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'', the Battle Maison returns, but the Battle Frontier, which was featured in the original ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games, is hinted to be in production. The Battle Maison is very similar to the one in ''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'', but TMs (Technical Machines) cannot be bought; they are replaced by other items.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Royal|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Battle Royal}} is introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], which involves four Trainers all battling each other at the same time. After becoming Champion, the player is given access to the {{nihongo4|Battle Tree|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc|Battle Tree}} on Poni Island. The Battle Tree is similar to the Battle Maison, Battle Subway, and Battle Towers from the previous generations. On the 20th battle of normal challenges and 50th battle of Super challenges, a powerful Trainer known as a Battle Legend will be challenged.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon Competitions ==\nIn addition to battling, several Pok\u00e9mon competitions have been introduced throughout the series to provide an alternate set of mini-games.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Contests ===\n{{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Contests|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8|Pok\u00e9mon Kontesuto}} are competitions of skill among Pok\u00e9mon Trainers and their Pok\u00e9mon partners. Pok\u00e9mon Contests are different from [[Pok\u00e9mon battle]]s, testing talent rather than power. They were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] and later appeared in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|Emerald]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum|Platinum]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Omega Ruby'', and ''Alpha Sapphire'']].\n\nThere are five categories that a Pok\u00e9mon can be entered into: Beauty, Cute, Cool, Tough, and Smart. In addition, there are four ranks of contests: Normal, Super, Hyper, and Master Rank. To enter, a Trainer must go to the contest hall that holds contests of the appropriate rank, and in ranks higher than Normal, the participating Pok\u00e9mon must have won the contest of the selected category in the previous rank. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Contests are renamed Super Contests, and the four ranks are named Normal, Great, Ultra, and Master.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;227</ref>\n\nIn the first round (called \"Visual Competition\" in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'') the Pok\u00e9mon is shown to the audience, who then vote on their favorite. Pok\u00e9mon will gain more points here if they have good condition in the selected category, which can be increased by using Pok\u00e9blocks. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Pok\u00e9blocks are replaced by Poffins, and the player can also use the stylus to dress up their Pok\u00e9mon in certain {{nihongo4|Accessories|\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc|Akusesar\u012b}} to fit the theme of the contest.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;229\u2013233</ref>\n\nThe second round, called \"Dance Competition\", was introduced in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl''. The participating Pok\u00e9mon join in a dance routine. The leading Pok\u00e9mon gets rated based on following the rhythm, and the rest of the Pok\u00e9mon have to mimic the leader's steps. All four participants take turns to be the leader.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;234</ref>\n\nThe final round (\"Acting Competition\") comprises a few rounds, and the Pok\u00e9mon are ordered in sequence based on their performance in the previous round. Each round, the player chooses one Pok\u00e9mon move to perform before the judge, and in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' players also choose which of three judges to appeal to. Each move has a category, appeal value, and effect. Using a good combination will gain the Pok\u00e9mon more appeal points, but using the same move twice consecutively will be less effective. Moves can have many effects, such as \"jamming\" previous Pok\u00e9mon to reduce their appeal, or randomizing the order of appeals in the next round.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;235\u2013236</ref> After appeals are concluded, the results are shown, and the Pok\u00e9mon with the most total points wins a ribbon.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;237</ref>\n\n==== Pok\u00e9blocks and Poffins ====\nPok\u00e9blocks ({{nihongo4|Polock|\u30dd\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Porokku}}), introduced in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', are [[candy]]-like treats used to increase the contest condition and Loyalty of Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9blocks are created from Berries in the \"Berry Blender\" minigame, which can be played by two to four human or computer-controlled players. The types of berries blended by all participants affect the category and effectiveness of the resulting Pok\u00e9block. Pok\u00e9blocks are also used in the games' Safari Zone to attract wild Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n{{nihongo4|Poffins|\u30dd\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3|Pofin}}, a type of baked goods, were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] as replacements for Pok\u00e9blocks. Poffins are made by adding a Berry to some batter in a pot, and stirring it with a stylus using the [[Nintendo DS]]'s touch screen. Poffins can be mixed only with human partners and can be done solo or with two to four players wirelessly.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9athlon ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], the contest minigame is replaced with an athletic competition called the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9athlon|\u30dd\u30b1\u30b9\u30ed\u30f3|Pokesuron}}. The competitions range from [[track and field]] events such as [[hurdling]] or a [[relay race]] to a [[snowball fight]] and a game resembling [[pachinko]].\n\nA Pok\u00e9mon's stats may be increased by consuming {{nihongo4|\"Aprijuice\"|\u30dc\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3\u30af|Bon Dorinku|\"Bon Drink\"}} made from fruits known as Apricorns that the player can find throughout the world. By putting a number of Apricorns in a [[blender]] and making the player character run a certain number of steps, the Apricorns are mixed into a [[milkshake]]-like blend. The process can be repeated multiple times, each time adding more Apricorns to the mixture and running to blend them. The number of times this is done, along with the variety of Apricorns used, affects the type and effectiveness of the resulting Aprijuice. Aprijuice will increase one of five additional statistics that only exist for the Pok\u00e9athlon which consist of Speed, Power, Skill, Jump, and Stamina.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Musicals ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], the contest minigame is replaced by the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Musicals|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb|Pok\u00e9mon My\u016bjikaru}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system03.html|title=\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb {{!}} \u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Rather than grooming Pok\u00e9mon with Pok\u00e9blocks, Poffins, or Aprijuice, the player's Pok\u00e9mon is only dressed in Accessories which can be waved around on stage when the Pok\u00e9mon dances to various pieces of music; the player does not control the Pok\u00e9mon during this time, other than Appealing with special props. If the audience likes the performance, they give more props to the player in person post-performance. The player can, in fact, control the camera angle during the performance.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9star Studios ===\nAnother minigame is added in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9star Studios|\u30dd\u30b1\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9|Pokeuddo|\"Pok\u00e9wood\"}}. The player joins the cast of a movie and participates in a mock battle with a [[chroma key]] opponent, while picking line options that match the script of the film and completing an objective within a particular set of turns.

Each successive [[Pok\u00e9mon#Generations|generation]] of games builds upon this concept by introducing new Pok\u00e9mon, items, and gameplay concepts. Some of the general concepts were featured elsewhere in the franchise before being introduced to the games; double battles appeared in the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|anime]] long before appearing in the games, and [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Pok\u00e9mon Abilities]] are similar to the Pok\u00e9mon Powers introduced in the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', which also introduced [[#Shiny Pok\u00e9mon|Shiny Pok\u00e9mon]], different colors of that type of the original Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nSome Pok\u00e9mon with very high stats and good moves are used in [[Pok\u00e9mon competitive play]], which requires more complex strategies than picking supereffective moves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/strategy/making-the-jump-to-video-game-competitive-play/|title=Making the Jump to Video Game Competitive Play - Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Game structure ==\nEach game in the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series takes place in a fictional region of the Pok\u00e9mon world and begins with the player receiving a [[#Starter Pok\u00e9mon|starter Pok\u00e9mon]] from that region's Pok\u00e9mon Professor. By traveling around the world, [[#Catching Pok\u00e9mon|catching]] and [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolving]] Pok\u00e9mon, and defeating other Trainers in [[#Pok\u00e9mon battles|battle]], the player increases the size and strength of their Pok\u00e9mon collection. A major subplot of each game is to defeat a [[criminal organization]], whose intents are usually trying to take over the world through the misuse of Pok\u00e9mon. These organizations include [[Team Rocket]], Neo Team Rocket, [[Team Aqua]] and [[Team Magma]], [[Team Galactic]], [[Team Plasma]], Neo Team Plasma, [[Team Flare]], [[Team Skull]], [[Team Rainbow Rocket]], the [[Aether Foundation]], [[Team Yell]], and [[Macro Cosmos]].\n\nVarious facilities can be found throughout the Pok\u00e9mon world such as Pok\u00e9mon Centers, Pok\u00e9 Marts, and Gyms. At a Pok\u00e9mon Center, the player can have their Pok\u00e9mon healed for free and access the PC, where players can organize their collection of Pok\u00e9mon, store and withdraw items, and have their Pok\u00e9dex rated. Before ''X'' and ''Y'', this is also where players can link up with other game cartridges or cards to battle or [[#Pok\u00e9mon trades|trade]] with other players. Pok\u00e9 Marts are shops where players can buy [[#Items|items]] with the money they win during battles; certain cities may have specialized shops, like a pharmacy or a department store. Periodically, a town will contain a [[#Pok\u00e9mon Gyms|Pok\u00e9mon Gym]], which houses a powerful Trainer known as a [[Gym Leader]]. Victory against them grants the player a Gym Badge; after collecting eight Gym Badges, the player may challenge the region's [[Elite Four]] and Champion. Gyms are absent in ''Sun'', ''Moon'', ''Ultra Sun'' , and ''Ultra Moon'', being replaced by trials which serve a similar purpose. Upon completion of a Trial, the player receives a Z-Crystal, which grants a Pok\u00e9mon access to an extremely powerful move called a Z-Move. The trend of Gyms continues in ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.\n\nCompleting the main storyline opens up other features in the games; this is primarily done by allowing passage into otherwise inaccessible places. Afterward, the game remains virtually open-ended, with the ultimate goal of the player being to obtain at least one member of each of the different species of Pok\u00e9mon, thus completing the [[Pok\u00e9dex]]. The number of Pok\u00e9mon increases with each game generation, starting from 151 in the first generation to 890 as of ''Sword'' and ''Shield''.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Gyms ===\n{{nihongo|Pok\u00e9mon Gyms|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b8\u30e0|Pok\u00e9mon Jimu}} are buildings situated throughout the Pok\u00e9mon world, where Pok\u00e9mon Trainers can train or compete to qualify for Pok\u00e9mon League competitions. Although the internal organizations of Pok\u00e9mon Gyms may vary, the majority specialize in one certain type of Pok\u00e9mon, and all are manned by a {{nihongo4|[[Gym Leader]]|\u30b8\u30e0\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30fc|Jimu R\u012bd\u0101}}, a formidable Trainer that acts as a [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. Pok\u00e9mon Gyms can be found in many towns and cities in the Pok\u00e9mon world.\n\nIn each Gym, there are various Gym Trainers that the player may face before battling the Gym Leader. These Gym Trainers are often placed so that the player is forced into battle with them. When a Trainer defeats a Gym Leader in battle, the former wins a {{nihongo4|Badge|\u30d0\u30c3\u30b8|Bajji}}, which serves as proof of a Trainer's skill and is a key part of advancing the plot. In ''Sword'' and ''Shield'', a Trainer must complete a Gym Challenge, which is essentially a minigame, in order to continue through the Gym. Also, this will earn the former a [[Technical and Hidden Machines|Technical Machine]] (prior to ''Sun'' and ''Moon''), which allows the player to teach their Pok\u00e9mon a certain move. It also usually enables the player to utilize the overworld effects of one of the various Hidden Machines, such as the ability to cross bodies of water with the move Surf or the ability to remove some trees from paths with the move Cut. As the player collects Gym Badges, the maximum level at which traded Pok\u00e9mon obey their commands increases. \n\nAfter a player defeats the eight Gym Leaders, they can travel through Victory Road, and then proceed to the Pok\u00e9mon League and challenge the {{nihongo4|[[Elite Four]]|\u56db\u5929\u738b|Shitenn\u014d}} and the region's Pok\u00e9mon League {{nihongo4|Champion|\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30aa\u30f3|Champion}}. Defeating the Champion is considered to be the goal of the game.\n\n=== Island Trials ===\nIn ''Sun'', ''Moon'', ''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'', there are no Gyms or Gym Leaders. The player is instead given various \"trials\" by characters known as Trial Captains. A trial usually presents the player with a task they must complete to summon a Totem Pok\u00e9mon, a more powerful version of a certain species of Pok\u00e9mon. Once the player has summoned and defeated the Totem Pok\u00e9mon, they receive a Z-Crystal, an item that allows Pok\u00e9mon to use powerful moves known as \"Z-Moves\". Completing all of the trials on an island allows the player to challenge that island's \"kahuna\" in a standard Pok\u00e9mon battle. The player can challenge the Pok\u00e9mon League after they have completed all four Grand Trials. After defeating the Elite Four, the player can defend their title as Champion by defeating a challenger.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon battles ==\n[[File:Pok\u00e9mon FireRed first battle.png|left|frame|In a battle scene in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version]]'', the Pok\u00e9mon at the top right of the screen is the opponent's; the bottom left is the player's. The player's options are shown at the bottom right.]]\n\nBattles between Pok\u00e9mon are the central game mechanic of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games. They are used to train Pok\u00e9mon to become stronger, like competitions, and to reach certain objectives within the game. Battling can also be done between players by connecting two games.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon'' uses a [[turn-based]] system. When the player challenges a Trainer or encounters a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the screen changes to a battle scene with the player's Pok\u00e9mon, the opposing Pok\u00e9mon, their respective [[Health (gaming)|HP]] bars, and an option menu. At any time, the player may carry up to six Pok\u00e9mon in his or her active party; the first Pok\u00e9mon in the lineup is automatically sent into battle. At the start of each turn, both sides can choose to [[#Pok\u00e9mon moves|attack]], use an [[#Items|item]], switch the Pok\u00e9mon for another in their party, or attempt to flee from battle (against a wild Pok\u00e9mon). If both sides attack, the one who goes first is determined by [[#Stats|Speed]], although some moves, items, and effects can override this. If either side chooses any other option, that action is performed before the attacks.\n\nEach Pok\u00e9mon uses moves to reduce their opponent's HP to zero, at which point the Pok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|faints|\u3072\u3093\u3057|hinshi}} and is unable to battle. If the player's Pok\u00e9mon wins, it receives [[experience point]]s; when enough have accumulated, the Pok\u00e9mon's level increases. If the player's Pok\u00e9mon faints, he/she may use another Pok\u00e9mon; in battles against wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may attempt to flee instead. If all of a player's Pok\u00e9mon faint, the player loses the battle. This causes the player to lose some money and return to the last Pok\u00e9mon Center they visited.<ref>''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond Version'' instruction booklet. p.&nbsp;15.</ref>\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] introduced {{nihongo4|Double Battles|\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Daburu Batoru}}, in which the opposing teams battle with two Pok\u00e9mon at a time. Though the basic mechanics remain the same, moves may have multiple targets, and some affect the ally as well as the opponents. Additionally, some [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Abilities]] work only in Double Battles. {{nihongo4|Multi Battles|\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Maruchi Batoru}} were also introduced, with four Trainers in teams of two. The third-generation games only included Double Battles against other Trainers, but [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] introduced Double Battles with wild Pok\u00e9mon under certain circumstances.\n\n''Black'' and ''White'' also introduced Triple Battles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02.html|title=\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb {{!}} \u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> and Rotation Battles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system02-02.html|title=\u30ed\u30fc\u30c6\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb {{!}} \u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> In {{nihongo4|Triple Battles|\u30c8\u30ea\u30d7\u30eb\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Toripuru Batoru}}, both teams send out three Pok\u00e9mon at once, with all three battling simultaneously.

The Pok\u00e9mon which is battling can be switched out with the other two without using up a turn.\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']] introduced three new battling mechanics. {{nihongo4|Sky Battles|\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Sukai Batoru}} are performed against Sky Trainers and can only be performed with Flying-type Pok\u00e9mon or those with the Levitate Ability. {{nihongo4|Horde Encounters|\u7fa4\u308c\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Mure Batoru|\"Group Battle\"}} are battles where five wild Pok\u00e9mon attack at once, encouraging the use of moves that hit multiple targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/new_battles/ |title=New Ways to Battle! |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/battle/02.html |title=\u300c\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u300d\u3068\u300c\u7fa4\u308c\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u300d\uff5c\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30ef\u30a4\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |publisher=Pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4421350/pokemon-x-and-ys-horde-battles-and-sky-battles-revealed |title=Pokemon X and Y's Horde Battles and Sky Battles revealed |publisher=Polygon |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref> {{nihongo4|Inverse Battles|\u3055\u304b\u3055\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb|Sakasa Batoru|\"Reverse Battle\"}} are like normal battles, but the entire [[#Pok\u00e9mon types|type]] chart is inverted. This means that an attack which would normally deal double damage instead deals half damage, and vice versa.\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'' also introduce a new battle type, the SOS Battle. In these battles, the opposing Pok\u00e9mon may call for allies to assist them, making the battle two-on-one against the player.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon types ===\n[[File:Pokemon Type Chart.svg|thumb|275px|This chart shows the current eighteen Pok\u00e9mon types (as of ''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'') and their strengths, weaknesses, and immunities against one another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-x-and-pokemon-y/|title=Pok\u00e9mon X and Pok\u00e9mon Y &#124; Video Games & Apps|website=www.pokemon.com}}</ref>]]\nA Pok\u00e9mon's {{nihongo4|type|\u30bf\u30a4\u30d7|taipu}} is an elemental attribute determining the strengths and weaknesses of each Pok\u00e9mon and its moves. Pok\u00e9mon take double damage from attacking moves of types they are weak to and half damage from moves they resist. These type matchups offset one another in [[rock\u2013paper\u2013scissors]]-style relationships. Some Pok\u00e9mon types grant full immunity to certain attack types; for instance, Ghost types take no damage from Normal or Fighting-type moves. Some Pok\u00e9mon Abilities can change these interactions, such as Levitate making Pok\u00e9mon immune to Ground-type moves.\n\nIn the original ''Red'', ''Green'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'' games, there are a total of 15 Pok\u00e9mon types: Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, and Dragon. The Dark and Steel types were added in ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', and the Fairy type was introduced in ''X'' and ''Y''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/why-game-freak-introduced-the-fairy-type-in-pokemon-512779904|title=Why Game Freak Introduced The Fairy Type In Pokemon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> Some types have special properties unrelated to the damage chart; for example, Electric types are immune to being paralyzed.\n\nThe console RPGs ''Colosseum'' and ''XD'' featured a unique move type known as Shadow, but it does not appear outside these games. Shadow Pok\u00e9mon can be considered to be of this type, but they still retain their regular typing as well. In ''Pok\u00e9mon XD'', Shadow moves are super effective against non-Shadow Pok\u00e9mon and not very effective against Shadow Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon moves ===\nLike the characters in many [[role-playing video game]]s, Pok\u00e9mon can learn a wide variety of {{nihongo4|moves|\u6280|waza}}. These moves may inflict damage, induce status problems, restore health, or perform actions that in some way affect the battle. The general strength of and resistance to these moves are determined by the various [[#Stats|statistics]] a particular Pok\u00e9mon has. All moves have a type, {{nihongo4|power|\u5a01\u529b|Iryoku}}, accuracy, and a number of Power Points (PP). The moves that one Pok\u00e9mon may learn are different from another depending on the species of Pok\u00e9mon; even those that [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] from others do not necessarily learn all the same moves that their predecessors learn. Each Pok\u00e9mon may only know a total of four moves at any one time. Moves may be learned through leveling up, using [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|TMs and HMs]], [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]], and move tutors ([[Non-player character|NPC]]s that teach moves).\n\nEach move is classified as one of the 18 [[#Pok\u00e9mon types|Pok\u00e9mon types]]. The effectiveness of a move is dependent on how susceptible the target Pok\u00e9mon's type is to the move's type. Phrases associated with this aspect are \"It's super effective!\" (damage is at least doubled), \"It's not very effective\u2026\" (damage is at least halved), and \"It doesn't affect [defending Pok\u00e9mon]...\" (damage and all effects are negated). A Pok\u00e9mon with the same type as the move it uses will receive a 50% bonus to its damage, referred to as a \"Same-Type Attack Bonus\" (STAB). Moves are further defined as \"physical\" or \"special\"; before the ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' games, moves' status of being either physical or special depended on the type, rather than on the individual move. There are also \"status\" moves, which deal no damage and often inflict status changes on the defending or attacking Pok\u00e9mon. Damage-inflicting moves remove a certain number of [[Health (gaming)|Health Points]] from the target Pok\u00e9mon based on the types of the move and its target, and on the statistics of the two Pok\u00e9mon. The damage can also be affected by [[#Items|items]] held by either Pok\u00e9mon or by their [[#Pok\u00e9mon Abilities|Abilities]].\n\nEach move has a specific {{nihongo4|accuracy|\u547d\u4e2d|Meich\u016b}}, which determines the chance of hitting the target Pok\u00e9mon assuming no changes are made to user's [[#Stats|accuracy]] or the target's evasiveness. Very powerful moves often have below-average accuracy. Moves with standard 100% accuracy ratings are susceptible to changes in accuracy and evasiveness, but some moves bypass both and always land.\n\nThe PP (Power Points) of a move indicate how many times a Pok\u00e9mon may use that move. As with accuracy, a powerful move is often offset by having a low number of PP. Once a Pok\u00e9mon uses up all the PP for a certain move, it can no longer use that move. If a Pok\u00e9mon expends all the PP for all of its moves, it then resorts to a move called Struggle, which damages the user as well as the target. Depleted PP can be restored by using certain items or by visiting a Pok\u00e9mon Center.\n\nMany moves have effects beyond inflicting damage. A common secondary effect is a chance to induce a certain {{nihongo4|[[status effect]]|\u72b6\u614b\u7570\u5e38|j\u014dtai ij\u014d}} on the target: {{nihongo4|paralysis|\u307e\u3072|Mahi}}, {{nihongo4|burn|\u3084\u3051\u3069|Yakedo}}, {{nihongo4|freeze|\u3053\u304a\u308a|K\u014dri}}, {{nihongo4|poison|\u3069\u304f|Doku}}, or {{nihongo4|sleep|\u306d\u3080\u308a|Nemuri}}; each negatively affects how the afflicted Pok\u00e9mon performs in battle. Some moves have negative side-effects for the user, such as forcing the player to wait a turn before or after use or causing recoil damage. A few moves, such as Splash, does nothing whatsoever except when used as a Z-Move.\n\n=== Z-Moves ===\nOnce per battle, if a Pok\u00e9mon holds a Z-Crystal, a powerful object you get from completing island trials, it can use an upgraded version of one of its moves, called a Z-Move. Z-Moves based on attacking moves tend to have much higher power than normal; those based on status moves usually incur a benefit on the user before executing the move.\n\n=== Moves outside of battles ===\nCertain moves can also be used in the overworld to bypass obstacles, quickly travel between locations, escape dungeons, or heal Pok\u00e9mon. Usually, Pok\u00e9mon will learn these moves with the use of the [[#Technical and Hidden Machines|HM]] items and will be able to use them in the aforementioned ways after certain Badges are obtained.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon abilities ===\nPok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Abilities|\u7279\u6027|Tokusei}} are special attributes which were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']]. Specific species of Pok\u00e9mon have one to three possible Abilities, with individual Pok\u00e9mon exhibiting one Ability each. Unlike the moves a Pok\u00e9mon knows, its Ability cannot normally change (except sometimes during evolution, and by using the Ability Capsule, which was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']]).\n\nMost Pok\u00e9mon use their Abilities in battle. Abilities can strengthen a Pok\u00e9mon's statistics or weaken a foe, inflict [[status effect]]s such as paralysis or poisoning, or perform other effects. Some Abilities also grant immunities or resistances, such as Water Absorb - when a Pokemon with this Ability gets hit by a Water-type attack, it absorbs the attack upon contact, recovering HP in the process, rather than losing HP as normal. Not all Abilities are helpful and may be implemented to hinder a Pok\u00e9mon. For example, [[Slaking (Pok\u00e9mon)|Slaking]], which would otherwise be extraordinarily powerful, has the Truant Ability, which only lets it attack every other turn.\n\nSome Abilities have effects outside of Pok\u00e9mon battles. For example, Pok\u00e9mon with the Pickup Ability will sometimes retrieve items off the ground. A Pok\u00e9mon with the Ability Intimidate, mentioned above, will cause the player to encounter lower-level wild Pok\u00e9mon less often.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;277</ref>\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'' introduced Hidden Abilities, which initially could only be found on Pok\u00e9mon acquired from the Pok\u00e9mon Global Link, either through the Pok\u00e9mon Dream World feature or through promotional releases. There are also rare instances of Hidden Abilities available in the main game, either as a special encounter or as a Trade with an NPC. ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' introduced the game mechanic of {{nihongo4|Hidden Grottoes|\u96a0\u3057\u7a74|Kakushi Ana}}, areas where the player has a chance to find a Pok\u00e9mon that has its Hidden Ability. Subsequent games introduced more means of obtaining Pok\u00e9mon with Hidden Abilities; for instance, Pok\u00e9mon encountered in Horde Battles have a small chance of having their Hidden Ability.\n\n== Stats ==\nAll Pok\u00e9mon have six {{nihongo4|[[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]]|\u80fd\u529b|N\u014dryoku|\"Attribute\"}} which affect their performance in battle. These are HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-natures-tips-tricks-guide-synchronise-everstone/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Natures: How Personality Changes Stats And Abilities|date=12 April 2019|website=TheGamer|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> These statistics can be temporarily modified during battle by Abilities, items, and moves.\n* '''HP''' (short for Health Points): <!-- the official Pok\u00e9mon Emerald website says it's \"Health Points\" in Tucker's trivia; can we add this as a citation? --> A Pok\u00e9mon faints when its HP reaches zero, and it cannot be used in battle again until it is revived at a Pok\u00e9mon Center, or with a special item. However, they can still use moves in the field.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Attack'''|\u3053\u3046\u3052\u304d|K\u014dgeki}}: Determines the strength of a Pok\u00e9mon's physical [[#Pok\u00e9mon moves|attacks]].\n* {{nihongo4|'''Defense'''|\u307c\u3046\u304e\u3087|B\u014dgyo}}: Determines the Pok\u00e9mon's resistance against physical attacks.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Special Attack'''|\u3068\u304f\u3053\u3046|Tokuk\u014d}}: Determines the power of a Pok\u00e9mon's special attacks.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Special Defense'''|\u3068\u304f\u307c\u3046|Tokub\u014d}}: Determines the Pok\u00e9mon's resilience to special attacks.\n* {{nihongo4|'''Speed'''|\u3059\u3070\u3084\u3055|Subayasa}}: After battle commands are entered, the Speed statistics of the participating Pok\u00e9mon are compared. With some exceptions, Pok\u00e9mon with higher Speed make their moves before those with lower Speed.\n\nThere are also two other statistics, {{nihongo4|Accuracy|\u547d\u4e2d\u7387|Meich\u016britsu}} and {{nihongo4|Evasiveness|\u56de\u907f\u7387|Kaihiritsu}}, which are not affected when Pok\u00e9mon level up. No Pok\u00e9mon has innately higher Accuracy or Evasiveness than any other, but they can be modified during battle like other statistics. Increasing Accuracy makes a move more likely to hit while increasing Evasiveness makes the opponent's move more likely to miss. A Pok\u00e9mon's Accuracy, the opponent's Evasiveness, and the accuracy value of a given move affect the probability that the move will hit. Evasiveness was called \"Evade\" in the first generation and \"Evasion\" in the second.\n\nIn ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'', and ''Yellow'', both the Special Attack and Special Defense stats were a single stat, named the \"Special\" stat, which determined both power with and resistance against special attacks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/pokemon-red-blue-things-wrong/|title=25 Things Wrong With Pok\u00e9mon Red And Blue Everyone Chooses To Ignore|date=29 March 2019|website=ScreenRant|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhen Pok\u00e9mon level up, their statistics increase, as determined by the Pok\u00e9mon's base stat values, effort values, Pok\u00e9mon Nature, and individual values. These variables working in tandem provide each Pok\u00e9mon with its unique stats.\n\n=== Base stat values ===\nThe Base stat values determine the natural statistical strengths of the various Pok\u00e9mon species. Every species is assigned a number in each of the six stats; the higher the number, the higher the stat can potentially be. While these values may greatly vary between species, they are the same for each member of that species. It is the difference among species which explains why all [[List of generation I Pok\u00e9mon#Aerodactyl|Aerodactyl]] will have a higher Speed than any [[Snorlax]] of the same level; however, it is the combination of other factors that causes some Snorlax to be faster than others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/smog/issue6/base_stats|title=Base Stat Ratings - Smogon University|website=www.smogon.com|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> Adding up all the base stat values for a certain species generates the base stat total, which players use to determine approximately how strong that species is.\n\n=== Effort values ===\n{{nihongo4|Effort values|\u52aa\u529b\u5024|doryokuchi|EVs}} are hidden values that affect the strengths of a Pok\u00e9mon in particular statistical areas. Differing effort value levels between two Pok\u00e9mon can create a significant difference in the two Pok\u00e9mon's statistical strengths. When a Pok\u00e9mon battles and defeats an opponent, they gain experience points and also receive a number and type of EVs according to the defeated Pok\u00e9mon's species. Every defeated Pok\u00e9mon gives at least one EV to each of the Pok\u00e9mon that fought it. Certain factors, like holding the Macho Brace item, can increase the rate at which EVs are gained in battle. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], a condition known as {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9rus|\u30dd\u30b1\u30eb\u30b9|Pokerusu}} was introduced which doubles the rate at which EVs are obtained, and will be contagious for a certain number of days, allowing it to spread to other Pok\u00e9mon. Also, consuming certain items can increase a Pok\u00e9mon's EVs, and certain Berries decrease EVs while increasing a Pok\u00e9mon's friendship value. There is a limit on the number of EVs Pok\u00e9mon can have, which prevents stats from increasing indefinitely. The total limit allows for maximum Effort Values in two stats simultaneously.\n\nIn the first- and second-generation games, a similar system usually referred to as Stat Experience or Stat Exp. was used. As with Effort Values, there is a limit to how much Stat Exp. a Pok\u00e9mon can have in each stat; however, unlike Effort Values, there is no limit to the total Stat Exp. a Pok\u00e9mon can have across all stats, meaning that a Pok\u00e9mon can have maximum Stat Exp. in every stat. Also of note is that, for Pok\u00e9mon from the first and second generation to be forward and backward compatible for trading, Stat Exp. was not tracked separately for Special Attack and Special Defense in the second generation games. Instead, the Special Stat Exp. value was used to calculate both Special Attack and Special Defense.\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], a minigame known as {{nihongo4|Super Training|\u30b9\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec|Supatore}} is introduced that allows players to more accurately manage the effort values. The player can do this by playing a [[Association football|soccer]]-like minigame, which also rewards the player with training bags to continue the training passively. The Pok\u00e9mon's effort values can also be viewed in the Super Training interface, which includes an \"Effort-o-Meter\" to allow the player to see the maximum capability of increasing the Pok\u00e9mon's effort values.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/whats_new/super_training/ |title=Super Training |publisher=Pokemonxy.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/xy/system/05.html |title=\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u3092\u7279\u8a13\u3060\uff01 \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u306e\u80b2\u3066\u65b9\u3001\u300c\u30b9\u30d1\u30c8\u30ec\u300d\uff01\uff5c\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30a8\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u300f\u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30ef\u30a4\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |publisher=Pokemon.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], a graph of a Pok\u00e9mon's EVs along with its base stats can be seen by pressing the Y button while viewing the summary of a Pok\u00e9mon. A sparkling stat shows that the Pok\u00e9mon had obtained the maximum number of EVs for the stat. Pok\u00e9mon can gain EVs passively through a feature called \"Pok\u00e9 Pelago\".\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Natures ===\nPok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Natures|\u6027\u683c|Seikaku}} were first introduced in ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Each Pok\u00e9mon has a Nature, randomly assigned when it is generated, which cannot be changed. A Pok\u00e9mon's Nature affects the rate at which some of its stats increase: out of the twenty-five possible Natures, twenty will increase one stat's growth rate but decrease another's. The other five modify the same stat in both increases and decreases, and thus the Pok\u00e9mon's overall growth is unaffected.<ref name=\"smogon.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/ingame/guides/breeding_guide_part1|title=The Breeding Guide Part I - Smogon University|website=www.smogon.com|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref> Natures also determine which flavor of [[#Pok\u00e9mon Contests|Pok\u00e9blocks or Poffins]] that Pok\u00e9mon likes and dislikes.\n\n=== Individual values ===\n{{nihongo4|Individual values|\u500b\u4f53\u5024|kotaichi}} or IVs are a hidden value for each statistic which determine a Pok\u00e9mon's maximum potential. These values are randomly generated along with each Pok\u00e9mon when it is encountered or bred, and set in stone for the rest of the game. These hidden values are why even Pok\u00e9mon that seem identical and have been raised the same way may have different stats. IVs range from 0 to 31,<ref name=\"smogon.com\"/> and their Generations I and II predecessors, \"determinant values\", ranged from 0 to 15.\n\n== Items ==\nItems can be found in the world, given to the player by NPCs, or bought at shops for in-game currency.\n\n=== Recovery items ===\nMany items received in the game are used to heal Pok\u00e9mon during and outside of battles. A range of items cure various status conditions, such as Antidotes for poisoning and Awakenings for sleep. Revives restore a Pok\u00e9mon back to health after it has lost all of its HP. Ethers and Elixirs restore the PP of a Pok\u00e9mon's moves to varying degrees.\n\n=== Technical and Hidden Machines ===\n{{nihongo4|Technical Machines|\u308f\u3056\u30de\u30b7\u30f3|Waza Mashin}} and {{nihongo4|Hidden Machines|\u3072\u3067\u3093\u30de\u30b7\u30f3|Hiden Mashin}}, commonly abbreviated as TMs and HMs, can be used to teach moves to Pok\u00e9mon, including some moves that they would otherwise not learn by increasing in level. TMs are commonly found in the field, in shops, and as rewards for defeating a Gym Leader. HMs are often vital to game progression as they have important effects outside of battle, allowing the player to traverse certain obstacles. For example, Pok\u00e9mon who learn the HM move Surf can transport the protagonist over water, which is necessary to reach island locations. When a Pok\u00e9mon learns an HM move, the move cannot be deleted or replaced unless the player uses the services of an NPC known as the Move Deleter.  \n\n=== Key items ===\nKey items are rarer than regular items and are usually given to the player rather than found. These include [[fishing rod]]s which are used to find water-dwelling Pok\u00e9mon, a bicycle which allows the protagonist to move around faster, a dowsing machine, and keys which open locked doors leading to important areas. These items cannot be thrown away, sold, or given to a Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n=== Held items ===\nStarting with [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], each Pok\u00e9mon is able to hold a single item. Items carried by Pok\u00e9mon can have a range of effects. Some, like Berries, are consumed after one use and boost HP or stats. Others persistently boost move power, defense, Speed, and more. Just like moves, some items hinder the user to compensate their power; for instance, the Life Orb boosts the damage of the holder's attacks, but hurts it after each successful attack. Others items solely harm the user except in rare situations, such as the Toxic Orb, which badly poisons it. [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|Pok\u00e9mon ''X'' and ''Y'']] introduced Mega Stones used to [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] members of the stone's species, and [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'' and ''Moon'']] introduced Z-Crystals, which give the holder access to Z-Moves. Items like the Razor Claw and Razor Fang [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] certain Pok\u00e9mon when held while a condition is met. Most items, including [[#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s and [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Items|Potions]], can be held but have no effect when given to a Pok\u00e9mon. Items can be moved between, removed from, and neutralized on Pok\u00e9mon through moves like Trick, Knock Off, and Embargo, or consumed to damage the opponent through the attacks Fling and Natural Gift.  \n\n== Catching Pok\u00e9mon ==\n[[File:Pok\u00e9ball.png|thumb|left|150px|The standard Pok\u00e9 Ball is a well-known icon of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' franchise.]]\nBecause each player begins the game with only one starter Pok\u00e9mon, catching is one of the most fundamental aspects of Pok\u00e9mon, and the primary method of recruiting new Pok\u00e9mon to the player's party.\n\nIn a battle against a wild Pok\u00e9mon, the player may attempt to catch it by using one of many different types of [[#Pok\u00e9 Ball|Pok\u00e9 Ball]]s. The odds of success vary, but are increased if the target Pok\u00e9mon's HP is low, if the target is affected by a status-altering effect like sleep or paralysis, and if a stronger or specially-suited Pok\u00e9 Ball is used.\n\nIf the catch is successful, the caught Pok\u00e9mon's data is added to the [[#Pok\u00e9dex|Pok\u00e9dex]], the player may give the Pok\u00e9mon a nickname, and the Pok\u00e9mon is added to the player's party. However, if the player's party is filled to its maximum of six Pok\u00e9mon, the caught Pok\u00e9mon is instead sent to a storage box accessible at Pok\u00e9mon Centers. In the first- and second-generation games, if the current PC box is full, the player will be unable to catch any new Pok\u00e9mon until he or she accesses a PC and switches to a different box. In more recent games, new Pok\u00e9mon are automatically transferred to the next available box.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9 Ball ===\nThe {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9 Ball'''|\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Monsut\u0101b\u014dru|\"Monster Ball\"}} is a spherical device used by Pok\u00e9mon Trainers to catch wild Pok\u00e9mon and store them in the player's inventory when not active. Upon contact, the balls draw a Pok\u00e9mon inside and then close automatically. Wild Pok\u00e9mon are able to resist and break free; however, weakened Pok\u00e9mon and those with status conditions are less able to struggle and therefore more easily caught. [[Legendary Pok\u00e9mon]] are much more capable of resisting being caught, and will often require many Pok\u00e9 Balls or more powerful Pok\u00e9 Balls to catch them. If the player attempts to catch a non-player character's Pok\u00e9mon, the opponent will block the Ball to prevent its theft. Ultra beasts require a different pokeball altogether.\n\nAs depicted in the anime and manga series, the Pok\u00e9 Ball, when not in use, is the size of a [[golf ball]] and, with a press of the central button, enlarges to the size of a [[baseball]]. The Pok\u00e9mon is released for battle by throwing the ball; when retrieving a Pok\u00e9mon, a beam of red light converts the Pok\u00e9mon into energy to reclaim it. Pok\u00e9 Balls are explained as being incredibly comfortable for Pok\u00e9mon, so much that they would willingly enter one without any sort of encouragement.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hilliard |first1=Kyle |last2=Masuda |first2=Junichi |date=December 2012 |title=Pok\u00e9mon's Burning Questions |journal=[[Game Informer]] |issue=236 |pages=112}}</ref> The Pok\u00e9mon [[Voltorb]], [[Electrode (Pok\u00e9mon)|Electrode]], [[Foongus]], and [[Amoonguss]] are often mistaken for Pok\u00e9 Balls, due to their shape and color schemes which highly resemble Pok\u00e9 Balls.\n\nVarious types of Pok\u00e9 Balls exist. Introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] are the Pok\u00e9 Ball, {{nihongo4|Great Ball|\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|S\u016bp\u0101 B\u014dru|\"Super Ball\"}}, {{nihongo4|Ultra Ball|\u30cf\u30a4\u30d1\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Haip\u0101 B\u014dru|\"Hyper Ball\"}}, and {{nihongo4|Master Ball|\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb|Masut\u0101 B\u014dru}}. The Master Ball always succeeds against any Pok\u00e9mon that can be caught, and of which typically only one is available in the game. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], there are fruits called '''Apricorns''', which, when given to Kurt in Azalea Town, make one of seven special types of Pok\u00e9 Balls, depending on the Apricorn's color. The seven kinds of Pok\u00e9 Balls Kurt can make (and the seven color Apricorns they are made out of) are Level (Red), Moon (Yellow), Lure (Blue), Friend (Green), Love (Pink), Fast (White), and Heavy (Black). Beginning in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'', ''Sapphire'', and ''Emerald'']], other specialized balls appear, including the Timer Ball, which becomes more effective as the number of turns in the current battle rises, and the Net Ball, which has a better chance of catching Water and Bug-type Pok\u00e9mon, among others. In addition, in several games there exists an area called the Safari Zone in which only Safari Balls can be used; these cannot be obtained or used elsewhere in the game. [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] introduced the Beast Ball, which is designed for capturing Ultra Beasts and is much more effective at capturing them than standard Pok\u00e9 Balls. There is also a special kind of Pok\u00e9 Ball known as the Cherish Ball, which can only be obtained through special distribution events.\n\nIn the [[Nintendo GameCube]] RPGs, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Colosseum]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon XD: Gale of Darkness]]'', the player is able to catch non-player characters' Pok\u00e9mon through the use of the Snag Machine, which turns Pok\u00e9 Balls into Snag Balls. Snag Balls are capable of catching any Pok\u00e9mon, and are developed by the antagonists to steal Pok\u00e9mon where they are not common in the wild. Snag Balls can also be used by the player to catch Shadow Pok\u00e9mon who have been tainted by the antagonist group and that the player is required to purify for game completion.\n\nPok\u00e9 Balls have appeared in every installment of the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, releasing a Pok\u00e9mon to assist the player who grabbed it. ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U]]'' also introduces the Master Ball, which almost always releases a legendary Pok\u00e9mon, with a small chance of releasing Goldeen instead.\n\n[[UGO.com]] listed the Pok\u00e9 Ball eighteenth on their list of \"Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups\" citing how everybody runs to get it in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |title=Our 50 Favorite Video Game Power-ups - UGO.com |publisher=[[UGO.com]] |author=Chris Littler |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019184843/http://www.ugo.com/games/50-best-video-game-powerups?page=7 |archivedate=2010-10-19 }}</ref>\n\n[[Category:Fictional items which are larger inside than outside]]\n\n=== Pok\u00e9dex ===\nThe {{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9dex'''|[[:ja:\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u56f3\u9451|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u56f3\u9451]]|Pok\u00e9mon Zukan|lit. \"Pok\u00e9mon Encyclopedia\"}} is an [[electronics|electronic]] device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pok\u00e9mon. The name ''Pok\u00e9dex'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Pok\u00e9mon ''and ''index''.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;28</ref> In the video games, whenever a Pok\u00e9mon is first caught, its height, weight, species type, and a short description will be added to a player's Pok\u00e9dex. Each region has its own Pok\u00e9dex, which differ in appearance, species of Pok\u00e9mon catalogued, and functions such as the ability to sort the list of Pok\u00e9mon based on [[alphabetical order]] or display the Pok\u00e9mon's size compared to the player character. The \"National Pok\u00e9dex\" allows Pok\u00e9mon from all regions to be catalogued. The Nintendo 3DS application ''[[Pok\u00e9dex 3D Pro]]'' features all of the Pok\u00e9mon with all of its forms and each one has its own animation.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon evolution ==\n[[File:Pokemon evolution.png|right|thumb|150px|A series of screenshots depicting an [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Abra evolving into a Kadabra]] in ''Pok\u00e9mon Emerald''.]]\n\n{{nihongo4|Evolution|\u9032\u5316|shinka}} is a sudden change in form of a Pok\u00e9mon, usually accompanied by an increase in [[#Stats|stat]] values. There are several different conditions which can trigger evolution in different species; the most common is gaining enough battle experience. There are many other factors that can determine if, when, and into what, different Pok\u00e9mon will evolve. The original alternate methods were the use of items called evolutionary stones or by trading the Pok\u00e9mon to another player. Later additions to the pool of conditions for evolution include dependence on the Pok\u00e9mon's [[#Friendship|friendship]] level, the time of day in the game, carrying a unique item while being traded, the gender, the area in the game where the Pok\u00e9mon levels up, having a separate specific Pok\u00e9mon in the player's party, trading for a specific Pok\u00e9mon, knowing a certain move, or holding the game console upside down.\n\nThe player can choose to halt evolution at any time before the animation is finished by pressing the B button, unless the evolution was initiated by using an evolutionary stone on the Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9mon whose evolutions are canceled will attempt to evolve again after the condition for evolution is met again. Preventing evolution for a time can be useful, as many Pok\u00e9mon learn moves sooner in their unevolved form than in their evolved form.\n\nThe ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'' introduced the idea of numerical stages for referring to different points in a Pok\u00e9mon's evolution. This has translated into colloquial usage among fans of the games. All Pok\u00e9mon can be placed at one of four evolutionary stages (though no existing Pok\u00e9mon line includes more than three out of the four stages): Basic Pok\u00e9mon, Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon which evolve from Basic Pok\u00e9mon, Stage 2 Pok\u00e9mon which evolve from Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon, and [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|Baby Pok\u00e9mon]] which are acquired by breeding certain Basic or Stage 1 Pok\u00e9mon and hatching their Eggs. A Pok\u00e9mon higher up on this evolutionary scale is sometimes called an evolved form of the previous stages; likewise, a Pok\u00e9mon lower down on the scale is said to be a pre-evolved form of later Pok\u00e9mon in the chain.\n\n=== Leveling up ===\nThis is the most common method of evolution across all Pok\u00e9mon generations, and involves Pok\u00e9mon acquiring experience points through battling other Pok\u00e9mon. \n\n=== Evolutionary stones ===\nEvolutionary stones are items which can be found throughout the games. Some Pok\u00e9mon can have particular evolutionary stones used on them, and doing so will cause the Pok\u00e9mon to evolve. Initially five evolutionary stones were introduced into the game: the Water, Thunder, Leaf, Moon and Fire Stones. Later generations introduced more kinds, bringing the total to ten in Generation VII.\n\n=== Trading ===\nSome Pok\u00e9mon, like [[Machoke]] and [[Abra, Kadabra, and Alakazam|Kadabra]], evolve when [[#Pok\u00e9mon trades|traded]] between players. Additional evolutionary requirements can also exist; for instance, [[Seadra]] only evolves into [[Kingdra]] if it holds a Dragon Scale when traded, and [[Shelmet]] and [[Karrablast]] only evolve when traded for each other.\n\n=== Friendship ===\nA Pok\u00e9mon's {{nihongo4|friendship|\u306a\u3064\u304d\u5ea6|Natsuki-do|lit. \"Degree of Emotional Attachment\"; nicknamed \"Happiness\" by players}} is an attribute that can rise or fall based upon several conditions and events. This aspect, introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow]]'', determined Pikachu's stat growth and affected the outcome of certain NPC events. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] it is a means to evolve several Pok\u00e9mon.

The only Pok\u00e9mon capable of this transformation is [[Greninja]] with the Battle Bond Ability. Greninja will transform into Ash-Greninja if it knocks out a Pok\u00e9mon during battle, giving it an appearance similar to [[Ash Ketchum]], increased stats, and a stronger Water Shuriken. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion, and Ultra Burst, Bond Phenomenon does not require an item to activate.\n\n=== Ultra Burst ===\nUltra Burst (\u30a6\u30eb\u30c8\u30e9\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8 ''Ultra Burst'') is a mechanic introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'']], exclusive to the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[List of generation VII Pok\u00e9mon#Necrozma|Necrozma]]. Necrozma may undergo Ultra Burst if it is in its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings form and holding the Ultranecrozium Z Z-Crystal, which will allow it to transform into Ultra Necrozma. Like Mega Evolution, Bond Phenomenon, and Primal Reversion, Ultra Burst increases Necrozma's stats and is a temporary transformation.\n\n=== Dynamax & Gigantamax ===\nDynamax (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Daimax'') and Gigantamax (\u30ad\u30e7\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Kyodaimax'') are mechanics introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']].

The Pok\u00e9mon can further increase its HP by 5% from using Dynamax Candy (\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30a2\u30e1''Daimax Candy'') to increase it's Dynamax Level. Gigantamax is similar to Dynamax, but it changes the Pok\u00e9mon's form, similar to Mega Evolution. Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon use G-Max Moves, exclusive to the 26 Pok\u00e9mon capable of Gigantamaxing. Each Gigantamax Pok\u00e9mon must have their respective move type in order to use their respective G-Max Move. Unlike Mega Evolution, Primal Reversion, Z-Moves, and Ultra Burst, Dynamaxing and Gigantamaxing can only be used in Gym Stadiums, Max Raid Battles, and other areas except for wild or trainer battles. \n\n[[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Zacian|Zacian]], [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Zamazenta|Zamazenta]], and [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Eternatus|Eternatus]] are the only Pok\u00e9mon that cannot Dynamax.\n\n=== Eternamax ===\nEternamax (\u30e0\u30b2\u30f3\u30c0\u30a4\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''Mugendaimax'') is a mechanic introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']], exclusive to the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon [[List of generation VIII Pok\u00e9mon#Eternatus|Eternatus]].

The Eevee will evolve into one of its three different evolved states depending on how well the player fares in battles with the rival at the beginning of the game.\n\n=== Legendary Pok\u00e9mon ===\n{{nihongo4|\"Legendary Pok\u00e9mon\"|\u4f1d\u8aac\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3|Densetsu no Pok\u00e9mon}} is a [[technical terminology|term of art]]. Since the ''Gold'' and ''Silver'' versions of the games, the main series' game package features one Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, usually the Pok\u00e9mon most involved in the main storyline of that game. Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are often described as being exceptionally rare. In most cases, Legendary Pok\u00e9mon are exceptionally powerful, difficult to catch, and unable to [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]], and no known Legendary Pok\u00e9mon is capable of [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]]. Many Legendary Pok\u00e9mon also lack a gender. Certain Legendary Pok\u00e9mon colloquially termed \"roaming Pok\u00e9mon\" randomly move around the world map and flee from battle, making them even harder to obtain.\n\n=== Mythical Pok\u00e9mon ===\n{{nihongo4|\"Mythical Pok\u00e9mon\"|\u5e7b\u306e\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3|Maboroshi no Pok\u00e9mon}} is a separate group of Pok\u00e9mon. The term is commonly associated with Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, requiring an external mechanic to obtain them; however, some Mythical Pok\u00e9mon have been made obtainable in later releases, notably [[Deoxys]]. These Pok\u00e9mon are usually placed at the end of their respective games' Pok\u00e9dex and can only be obtained through distribution events set up by Nintendo. The first of these Mythical Pok\u00e9mon was [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]], who was programmed into the ''Red'' and ''Green'' games as a secret character by [[Shigeki Morimoto]] without any knowledge of the other members of the development team, and was not announced until several months after the games' release in a special promotion. Since then, the games have continued to feature Pok\u00e9mon that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay, but the programming that allow the player to catch them within the games can be activated by special items (or other Pok\u00e9mon) distributed by Nintendo. The first of these such items was the GS Ball in ''Crystal'', which was distributed to players in Japan through the mobile phone connector, allowing them to encounter [[Celebi (Pok\u00e9mon)|Celebi]]. Like Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Mythical Pok\u00e9mon are powerful and difficult to catch, are usually not part of an evolutionary line, and cannot breed (with the exception of [[Manaphy]]).\n\n=== Shiny Pok\u00e9mon ===\n[[File:ShinyZubatEncounter.JPG|thumb|left|The player finds a green Zubat in ''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version''.]]\n\n'''Shiny Pok\u00e9mon''' were first introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Gold'' and ''Silver'']] as a way to demonstrate the new color capabilities of the [[Game Boy Color]] system. These are Pok\u00e9mon which have a different coloration than normal; in earlier games, this was done by means of a [[palette swap]]. Encountering a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon is extremely rare; the probability under normal conditions is 1 in 8,192 (1 in 4,096 from the sixth generation onwards).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/one-mans-five-year-quest-to-find-a-shiny-pokemon-1603763304|title=One Man's Five-Year Quest To Find A Shiny Pok\u00e9mon|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> There are some major exceptions to this rule, such as a red [[Gyarados]] present in ''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'', ''Silver'', ''Crystal'', ''HeartGold'', and ''SoulSilver'', and three Pok\u00e9mon present in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Pok\u00e9mon Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], all of which are guaranteed to be Shiny.\n\nThere are various ways of increasing the chance of getting a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. In second-generation games, breeding a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon with a regular Pok\u00e9mon has a higher chance (1 in 64) of producing a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. In ''Diamond'', ''Pearl'', ''Platinum'', ''X'', and ''Y'', the Pok\u00e9 Radar can be used to \"chain\" Pok\u00e9mon of the same species, improving the odds of a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon with each link (up to 40 links, when the odds are 1 in 200). Since Generation IV, [[#Pok\u00e9mon breeding|breeding]] Pok\u00e9mon that originated in games of two different languages results in Eggs with a 1 in 1,638 (Generation IV games) or 1 in 1365 (Black and White onwards) chance to contain a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon; this method of increasing odds has been dubbed the \"Masuda method\" after developer [[Junichi Masuda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/how-to-get-a-shiny-pokemon-in-pokemon-x-and-y |title=How to Get a Shiny Pokemon In Pokemon X and Y |last=Khaw |first=Cassandra |publisher=USgamer |access-date=2016-06-17}}</ref> Additionally, an item introduced in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called the Shiny Charm increases the probability of finding Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. However, this item is only accessible long after completing the game, as the player must have completed the National Pok\u00e9dex (excluding Mythical Pok\u00e9mon). Beginning in ''Black'' and ''White'', certain Pok\u00e9mon in each game are 'Shiny-locked', meaning the player cannot obtain a Shiny variant of them in normal gameplay.\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|Pok\u00e9mon ''Sun'' and ''Moon'']]'s SOS Battle mechanic created a new way to \"hunt\" for Shiny Pok\u00e9mon. If a wild Pok\u00e9mon calls allies to help and the ally is continually of the same species in a \"chain\", the chance that it calls a Shiny Pok\u00e9mon rises up to a base of 13 in 4096 after the 30th is called, as do the chances of Hidden Ability and perfect [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Stats|IVs]], though they are capped at four perfect IVs maximum. In their [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|sequels']] Ultra Warp Ride [[minigame]], by successfully traveling more [[light-year]]s through the wormhole and entering wormholes with more rings, the player can increase the chance of finding Shiny Pok\u00e9mon in the Ultra Space Wilds. Generation 7 also introduced an upgrade to the \"Masuda method\" referred to as \"Swap Breeding\"; the game is continually saved and soft-reset until a fast-hatching, dummy Pok\u00e9mon is hatched shiny within the first thirty attempts, and shininess is transplanted to the new Pok\u00e9mon hatched in the same position as the dummy was.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/guides/2018/6/8/17409856/shiny-pokemon-guide|title=How to build an army of competitive shiny Pok\u00e9mon|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-09-18}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', Shiny Pok\u00e9mon have slightly above-average stats, but this is because their Shininess is determined by their [[#Individual values|determinant values]] in those games. In the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video games)#Game Boy Advance era|third generation]] and onward, however, Shininess is determined by another value, and Shiny Pok\u00e9mon are not stronger than any other Pok\u00e9mon in battle. Most fans consider Shiny Pok\u00e9mon to be collectors' items because of their rarity.\n\nThe term \"Shiny\" was initially a term invented by the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' fan community due to the flash of stars that appear when such a Pok\u00e9mon enters a battle, implying a sheen property to the colors of the Pok\u00e9mon. The term \"Shiny Pok\u00e9mon\" was later officially acknowledged in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], but it has been used in the anime and in a few strategy guides before this. The term {{nihongo3|\"shining\"|\u5149\u308b|hikaru}} was also a widely used slang term in Japan; Ken Sugimori uses ''hikaru'' in the title of a piece of artwork featuring a Shiny Charizard. The alternate term {{nihongo4|\"Alt. Color\"|\u8272\u9055\u3044|Iro Chigai}} appears among the options the player can choose when filling out forms in the third generation of games.\n\nShiny Pok\u00e9mon have appeared in the anime, including the aforementioned red Gyarados and a Noctowl that protagonist Ash Ketchum catches. A pink Butterfree was also featured in an episode of the first season of the anime, but this alternate coloration is not what appears in the subsequent video games where the Shiny feature has been implemented.\n\n== Connectivity ==\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon trades ===\n[[File:Game Boy(RTSide).png|thumb|right|The game link port is located above the volume control on the original [[Game Boy]] handheld system.]]\n\nPlayers have the ability to trade their Pok\u00e9mon with one another by connecting two compatible games. Trading is an important aspect to the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games, being the crux upon which much of the franchise is based. This is because the slogan, and consequently the goal, \"Gotta catch 'em All,\" is logistically impossible without trading. Each game released in a [[Pok\u00e9mon (video games)#Generations|generation]] has certain Pok\u00e9mon that are exclusive to that version. For example, in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' players can catch the Pok\u00e9mon [[Ekans]] and its evolved form, Arbok, while both are absent in the wild in both ''Pok\u00e9mon Blue'' and ''Pok\u00e9mon Yellow''. Other Pok\u00e9mon are only available when offered up as a choice. The most obvious example is the choice between three [[#Starter Pok\u00e9mon|starter Pok\u00e9mon]] at the beginning of the game; the only way to get the other two is by trading. Some [[Non-player character|NPC]]s offer to trade Pok\u00e9mon with the player, allowing them to acquire Pok\u00e9mon otherwise unavailable without connecting to another game. For example, the only way to get a [[Jynx]] in ''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'' (other than trading with another game cartridge) is through an in-game trade. The other way that trading is made instrumental in gameplay is that some Pok\u00e9mon, like [[Haunter]] and [[Machoke]], only [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolve]] into their final forms when traded.\n\nTrading between games on the Game Boy and related systems is accomplished through a [[Game Link cable]] that attaches to ports found on all [[Game Boy line|Game Boy incarnations]]. The size of the ports varies between consoles, so several hybrid cables have been created that allow, for example, linking between the original [[Game Boy]] and the [[Game Boy Color]]. [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pok\u00e9mon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']] include a special wireless dongle which plugs into the game link port for local wireless communication. On the [[Nintendo DS]], DS Wireless Communications is used instead.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;240\u2013245</ref> [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] also introduced the Global Trade Station/System (or GTS), a place where people all around the world may trade Pok\u00e9mon using the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. In the GTS hall, the player can input their own location and pinpoint the locations of other players they have interacted with. The Nintendo WFC records this data when they trade successfully with someone over the GTS or in their Pal Pad.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;254</ref> For the [[Nintendo 3DS family|Nintendo 3DS line]], two successors to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection were implemented in each generation. In the Player Search System in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' & ''Y'']] and [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'']], the function is simply called Trade, while in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Sun'', ''Moon'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|''Ultra Sun'', and ''Ultra Moon'']] in the Festival Plaza, the function is called Link Trade. The second successor is called Wonder Trade; players choose a Pok\u00e9mon to trade and are randomly paired with another player around the world.\n\n== Mystery Gift ==\nMystery Gift, a means by which players can receive items from other people, was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] and has appeared in every handheld ''Pok\u00e9mon'' game since. To use Mystery Gift, the feature must first be activated in a specific way.\n\nIn ''Gold'', ''Silver'', and ''Crystal'', if two players line up the infrared ports on their [[Game Boy Color]] units and activate Mystery Gift from the intro menu, each will receive an item. This process also sends a record of each player's party Pok\u00e9mon to the other player's game for a daily event in Viridian City in which they can battle the other player's Pok\u00e9mon (controlled by the computer). Players can use Mystery Gift an unlimited number of times, but only once per day for each person. In addition, a player of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium 2]]'' with a ''Gold'', ''Silver'', or ''Crystal'' cartridge plugged into the [[Transfer Pak]] can use Mystery Gift with a girl in [[Pok\u00e9mon regions#Stadium regions|White City]]. A Mystery Gift can also be received by connecting with a [[Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu#Versions|Pocket Pikachu 2 GS]].\n\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], Mystery Gift is replaced with Mystery Event. This feature utilizes the now defunct [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-Reader]] accessory. Using special [[Nintendo e-Reader#e-Reader cards|e-cards]], the player could obtain special items such as rare Berries or the Eon Ticket. In [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|''LeafGreen'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|''Emerald'']], Mystery Gift is a means to obtain special items at Nintendo's promotional events through the use of the [[Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter|Wireless Adapter]], which allow the player to catch otherwise unobtainable Pok\u00e9mon, such as [[Mew (Pok\u00e9mon)|Mew]] and [[Deoxys]].\n\n[[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] expanded Mystery Gift to include a variety of transferring options. After enabling Mystery Gift, players may obtain items via wireless or [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], and may also transfer them to friends. Wireless connection also allows the player to transfer items from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Battle Revolution]]''. Currently, Mystery Gift via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection|Nintendo WFC]] has only been implemented in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]'' and [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']]. However, this was changed when the shiny Pichu was distributed to all version games via WFC. Also, with the creation of the Pok\u00e9walker, in [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], came another way to Mystery Gift. By pressing the connect button on two Pok\u00e9walkers and pointing them at each other, both Pok\u00e9walkers will receive an item, which the player will receive upon connecting with his or her game. Beginning with [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'']], an option to receive Mystery Gifts by single-use serial code or password over [[Nintendo Network]] was added. Single-use codes are given out in participating retailers and via the Pok\u00e9mon Global Link and are usually region locked. Wireless and infrared events are no longer region locked, allowing any region console to receive events distributed by those methods.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Bank ===\n{{nihongo4|'''Pok\u00e9mon Bank'''|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30d0\u30f3\u30af|Pok\u00e9mon Banku}} is an application which allows players to store up to 3,000 Pok\u00e9mon in an online [[cloud storage]] service. Players can deposit and withdraw Pok\u00e9mon from both physical and downloaded versions of compatible games, allowing players to exchange Pok\u00e9mon between the two versions without the need for a second system. Additionally, an application called {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9 Transporter|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e0\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc|Poke M\u016bb\u0101|\"Pok\u00e9 Mover\"}} allows players to upload Pok\u00e9mon from ''Pok\u00e9mon Black'', ''White'', ''Black 2'', and ''White 2'' to the Pok\u00e9mon Bank, after which they can be imported into newer games. The service requires an annual subscription fee, and there are plans to continue to utilize it for future Pok\u00e9mon titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/strategy/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Bank|work=pokemonxy.com}}</ref>\n\nIntended for release on December 27, 2013, Pok\u00e9mon Bank was postponed due to unforeseen traffic levels on the [[Nintendo Network]] service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.es/Noticias/2013/diciembre/Banco-Pokemon-y-Poke-Trasladador-845138.html|title=Banco ''Pok\u00e9mon y'' Pok\u00e9 Trasladador|work=Nintendo of Europe GmbH}}</ref> Pok\u00e9mon Bank was fully released on the [[Nintendo eShop]] on January 22, 2014 in Japan, February 4, 2014 in Europe, and February 5, 2014 in North America.\n\nAs of an update released on January 24, 2017, [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']] have also gained compatibility with Pok\u00e9mon Bank. The update allows players to send their Pok\u00e9mon from their core sixth generation games to ''Sun'' and ''Moon'', though when transferred, they cannot return to the older games. Additionally, the Pok\u00e9 Transporter was also updated to allow players to transfer Pok\u00e9mon caught in the [[Virtual Console]] editions of [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'', ''Blue'']], and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Yellow|Yellow]]'' to ''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon''. The update also added a new in-app National Pok\u00e9dex, presumably to make up for the lack of one in Sun and Moon.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon Officially Announced|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/26/pokemon-sun-and-moon-officially-announced|website=IGN|publisher=IGN|accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/pokemon-bank-getting-national-pokedex-feature-with-sun-and-moon-support-20456791/|title=Pokemon Bank getting National Poked feature with Sun and Moon support - SlashGear|website=www.slashgear.com|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=Pokemon Bank Now Compatible With Sun and Moon|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/25/pokemon-bank-now-compatible-with-sun-and-moon|website=IGN|accessdate=January 25, 2017|date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn November 17, 2017, coinciding with the release of ''Ultra Sun'' and ''Ultra Moon'', it was announced that the games would support ''Pok\u00e9mon Bank'' later the same month. The update, which came three days later, also added compatibility with the Virtual Console versions of [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']] as well as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal|Crystal]]'' (which was not re-released until January 26, 2018) to the Pok\u00e9 Transporter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/17/pokmon-ultra-sun-ultra-moon-will-get-pokmon-bank-compatibility-update-late-november/|title=Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon Will Get Pok\u00e9mon Bank Compatibility Update In Late November|website=Siliconera|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Home ===\nOn May 28, 2019, Pok\u00e9mon Home was revealed as the successor application to Pok\u00e9mon Bank. Scheduled for release in February 2020, the app will be available on [[Nintendo Switch]] and smartphone devices, and will have connectivity with Pok\u00e9mon Bank, [[Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|''Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu!'' and ''Let's Go, Eevee!'']], [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']], and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Phillip|title=POK\u00c9MON HOME IS NEW POK\u00c9MON BANK THAT CONNECTS 'SWORD AND SHIELD, 'POK\u00c9MON GO' AND MORE|url=https://www.newsweek.com/pokemon-home-bank-sword-shield-go-1437721}}</ref> Players can get a free version that can store up to 30 Pokemon, or they can buy the premium pass which will let them store up to 6,000, twice as much as ''Pokemon Bank''.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon breeding ==\nPok\u00e9mon breeding was introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]. Pok\u00e9mon can be bred in-game at a {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Day Care|\u80b2\u3066\u5c4b|Sodateya}}. These are businesses generally run by an elderly person or couple, which raise Trainers' Pok\u00e9mon for a fee. If two compatible Pok\u00e9mon are left there, they will eventually produce a Pok\u00e9mon {{nihongo4|Egg|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4|tamago}}, which the Trainer can pick up for free. After being carried by the Trainer for some distance, the Egg will hatch into a young Pok\u00e9mon, usually of the lowest stage in its mother's [[#Pok\u00e9mon evolution|evolutionary line]].\n\nSome Pok\u00e9mon have pre-evolutions that are usually only obtainable by hatching them from Eggs. Known as \"baby Pok\u00e9mon\", these Pok\u00e9mon are unable to breed but have evolutions that can breed baby Pok\u00e9mon. For most baby Pok\u00e9mon introduced after ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', the parent can only produce these Pok\u00e9mon when holding a certain item.<ref name=\"PBreeding\">Marcus, p.&nbsp;13</ref>\n\n=== Compatibility ===\nCompatibility is usually restricted to one male and one female. In addition, Pok\u00e9mon species are assigned to {{nihongo4|Egg Groups|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7|Tamago Gur\u016bpu}}, which determines their breeding compatibility with other species. Pok\u00e9mon may belong to up to two Egg Groups; in order to breed, they must share at least one Egg Group. Nearly all Pok\u00e9mon species, even those that are all-male or genderless, are able to breed with the shapeshifting Pok\u00e9mon [[Ditto (Pok\u00e9mon)|Ditto]]. The Egg produced will yield a hatchling from the non-Ditto Pok\u00e9mon's evolutionary line. Two Ditto cannot breed to produce another Ditto.\n\nA select group of species cannot breed at all, which includes all Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, all Ultra Beasts, most Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, Nidorina and Nidoqueen (but not Nidoran\u2640), Unown, and all \"baby\" Pok\u00e9mon. This is called the \"Undiscovered\" Egg Group. Although some Legendary Pok\u00e9mon have genders, they still cannot breed. An unusual circumstance involves the relation of the Mythical Pok\u00e9mon Manaphy and Phione; both can breed with Ditto to create an Egg which hatches into Phione, yet Phione does not evolve into Manaphy. Manaphy itself is obtained from an Egg from ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Ranger]]'' games, but it will never breed to produce another Manaphy Egg.\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nPok\u00e9mon hatched from Eggs can {{nihongo4|inherit|\u907a\u4f1d|iden}} stats from their parents. Three of the Pok\u00e9mon's [[#Individual values|individual values]] are inherited from one or the other of its parents, and the other three IVs are generated randomly.<ref name=\"Hbreeding2\">Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&nbsp;18.</ref>\n\nMoves can also be inherited through breeding. Moves that a newly hatched Pok\u00e9mon begins with are divided into three categories: learned moves, inherited moves, and hereditary moves or \"Egg Moves\". Learned moves are moves that the Pok\u00e9mon would have naturally at its starting level; inherited moves are those that the Pok\u00e9mon would be able to learn at later levels or through TMs; and {{nihongo4|Egg Moves|\u30bf\u30de\u30b4\u308f\u3056|Tamago Waza}}, inherited from the father (or either parent beginning in ''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y''), are those that the Pok\u00e9mon would not be able to learn normally. The Pok\u00e9mon can learn the move on this occasion as it receives the move from a parent of a different species. Upon birth, the young Pok\u00e9mon's move slots are filled with learned moves. However, if there are any inherited moves or Egg Moves available for the Pok\u00e9mon to learn, they replace the learned moves.<ref name=\"Hbreeding2\" /><ref>Hollinger, ''Crystal'', p.&nbsp;19.</ref>\n\n== Battle facilities ==\n{{redirect|Battle Frontier|the season of the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime]]|List of Pok\u00e9mon: Battle Frontier episodes}}\nIn addition to the Pok\u00e9mon Gyms and other battles to advance the plot, side games and post-game areas have been introduced in subsequent editions of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' games that extend the gameplay.\n\nFirst introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Crystal]]'', the {{nihongo4|Battle Tower|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc|Batoru Taw\u0101}} is a game feature accessible outside of the main storyline where the player faces several Trainers in succession with a limited set of their Pok\u00e9mon and receive prizes in the form of otherwise rare items. The Japanese version of ''Crystal'' which had a [[mobile phone]] adapter allowed for players to challenge other players to Battle Tower fights. The next Battle Towers appear in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], which is similar to the ''Crystal'' Battle Tower, and in [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], which has a boss character and a point system similar to the Battle Frontiers.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Frontier|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2|Batoru Furontia}} was introduced in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald]]'', replacing the Battle Tower as found in the ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games. In addition to having its own Battle Tower with the same rules as the previous ones, the Battle Frontier adds several other game mechanics that make [[#Pok\u00e9mon battles|battles]] unique in the end game. Examples include the Battle Palace's prohibition on choosing what moves the Pok\u00e9mon uses and the Battle Factory's random rental Pok\u00e9mon. Instead of prizes, the player is awarded Battle Points (BP) which can be traded for rare items or TMs. The ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' Battle Tower uses this same system, and it is replaced by a Battle Frontier in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum]]''. The [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']] games also have a Battle Frontier, identical to that of the ''Platinum'' version, where the Battle Tower was found in ''Crystal''. After a series of battles in each venue, players encounter {{nihongo4|[[Frontier Brains]]|\u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30d6\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3|Furontia Bur\u0113n}} who are challenged in the same fashion as all other battles, and the player will either earn a {{nihongo4|Symbol|\u30b7\u30f3\u30dc\u30eb|Shinboru|''Emerald''}} or a {{nihongo4|Commemorative Print|\u304d\u306d\u3093\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30c8|Kinen Purinto|''Platinum'', ''HeartGold'', ''SoulSilver''}} for winning. The Frontier Brains can be challenged a second time to more advanced versions of the Symbols or Prints (advancing from Silver to Gold). The Frontier Brains have very powerful Pok\u00e9mon, often including [[#Legendary Pok\u00e9mon|Legendary Pok\u00e9mon]], making a victory even more difficult than in the main storyline.\n\n''Emerald'' also features {{nihongo4|Battle Tents|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c6\u30f3\u30c8|Batoru Tento}}, which allow the player to encounter some of the unique battle mechanics of three of the Battle Frontier venues. Rather than Battle Points, the player is awarded with an item that is rare or expensive.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Subway|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4|Batoru Sabuwei}} is unique to the [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Black'' and ''White'']] games and serves as the games' Battle Tower, taking on the form of a [[Rapid transit|subway]] to match the games' [[New York City]]-styled setting. In the same vein as the Battle Tower in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' and the various Battle Frontiers, players earn BP and after a certain number of battles they challenge one or both of the two Subway Bosses ({{nihongo4|Subway Masters|\u30b5\u30d6\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Sabuwei Masut\u0101}} in Japan), depending on what type of battles (Single, Double, or Multi) the player was competing in.\n\nThe Battle Subway returns in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2|''Black 2'' and ''White 2'']], but it is joined by two new sets of areas. The first one introduced in the games is the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ca\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8|Pok\u00e9mon W\u0101rudo T\u014dnamento}}, wherein the player participates in a tournament-style setting with various NPC Trainers, set to a particular theme of a level limit, using randomly assigned teams, or using teams downloaded from the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, to earn BP. The more advanced side of the Pok\u00e9mon World Tournament is a tournament-style setting in battling the Gym Leaders and Pok\u00e9mon League Champions from all over the Pok\u00e9mon World, enabling players to challenge characters such as Brock and Misty from ''Red'' and ''Blue'', Volkner from ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Lance from ''Gold'' and ''Silver'', or Steven from ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''. Also introduced in the games are the {{nihongo4|Black Tower|\u9ed2\u306e\u6469\u5929\u697c|Kuro no Matenr\u014d}} in ''Black 2''{{'}}s Black City and the {{nihongo4|White Treehollow|\u767d\u306e\u6a39\u6d1e|Shiro no Jud\u014d}} in ''White 2''{{'}}s White Forest. In these facilities, the player must battle a series of Trainers without using items, and only relying on Doctor or Nurse Trainers to restore their team's health. At the end, the player challenges the leader and later is awarded a rare Pok\u00e9mon for succeeding.\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Maison|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30cf\u30a6\u30b9|Batoru Hausu|\"Battle House\"}} is introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|''X'' and ''Y'']], and can only be accessed after the player completes the main story. Similar to the Battle Frontier and the Battle Subway, there are different types of battling methods to choose from: single, double, triple, rotation, and multi battles. Then the player is drawn to a tournament where he/she is challenged to numerous battles with random Trainers. After winning a battle the player receives one BP (battle point) which can later be used to by items, vitamins, and TMs. After winning 21 battles the player must battle the strongest Trainer or referred to as the Battle Chatelaine. It depends on what battle style you choose. If the player beats 50 Trainers, they have the chance to battle one of the Battle Chatelaines again. Only this time do they use legendary Pok\u00e9mon (e.g. Zapdos, Moltres, Articuno). Another similar feature is the {{nihongo4|Battle Chateau|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30b7\u30e3\u30c8\u30fc|Batoru Shat\u014d}}, where the player advances through a ranking system based on the [[French nobility]] system after battling increasingly difficult Trainers, including being able to battle the Gym Leaders, Elite Four members, and Champion in the same system.\n\nIn ''Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby'' and ''Alpha Sapphire'', the Battle Maison returns, but the Battle Frontier, which was featured in the original ''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' games, is hinted to be in production. The Battle Maison is very similar to the one in ''Pok\u00e9mon X'' and ''Y'', but TMs (Technical Machines) cannot be bought; they are replaced by other items.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe {{nihongo4|Battle Royal|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Battle Royal}} is introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon|''Pok\u00e9mon Sun'' and ''Moon'']], which involves four Trainers all battling each other at the same time. After becoming Champion, the player is given access to the {{nihongo4|Battle Tree|\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc|Battle Tree}} on Poni Island. The Battle Tree is similar to the Battle Maison, Battle Subway, and Battle Towers from the previous generations. On the 20th battle of normal challenges and 50th battle of Super challenges, a powerful Trainer known as a Battle Legend will be challenged.\n\n== Pok\u00e9mon Competitions ==\nIn addition to battling, several Pok\u00e9mon competitions have been introduced throughout the series to provide an alternate set of mini-games.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Contests ===\n{{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Contests|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9\u30c8|Pok\u00e9mon Kontesuto}} are competitions of skill among Pok\u00e9mon Trainers and their Pok\u00e9mon partners. Pok\u00e9mon Contests are different from [[Pok\u00e9mon battle]]s, testing talent rather than power. They were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] and later appeared in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Emerald|Emerald]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Diamond'', ''Pearl'']], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Platinum|Platinum]]'', [[Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|''Omega Ruby'', and ''Alpha Sapphire'']].\n\nThere are five categories that a Pok\u00e9mon can be entered into: Beauty, Cute, Cool, Tough, and Smart. In addition, there are four ranks of contests: Normal, Super, Hyper, and Master Rank. To enter, a Trainer must go to the contest hall that holds contests of the appropriate rank, and in ranks higher than Normal, the participating Pok\u00e9mon must have won the contest of the selected category in the previous rank. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Contests are renamed Super Contests, and the four ranks are named Normal, Great, Ultra, and Master.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;227</ref>\n\nIn the first round (called \"Visual Competition\" in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'') the Pok\u00e9mon is shown to the audience, who then vote on their favorite. Pok\u00e9mon will gain more points here if they have good condition in the selected category, which can be increased by using Pok\u00e9blocks. In ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', Pok\u00e9blocks are replaced by Poffins, and the player can also use the stylus to dress up their Pok\u00e9mon in certain {{nihongo4|Accessories|\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b5\u30ea\u30fc|Akusesar\u012b}} to fit the theme of the contest.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;229\u2013233</ref>\n\nThe second round, called \"Dance Competition\", was introduced in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl''. The participating Pok\u00e9mon join in a dance routine. The leading Pok\u00e9mon gets rated based on following the rhythm, and the rest of the Pok\u00e9mon have to mimic the leader's steps. All four participants take turns to be the leader.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;234</ref>\n\nThe final round (\"Acting Competition\") comprises a few rounds, and the Pok\u00e9mon are ordered in sequence based on their performance in the previous round. Each round, the player chooses one Pok\u00e9mon move to perform before the judge, and in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' players also choose which of three judges to appeal to. Each move has a category, appeal value, and effect. Using a good combination will gain the Pok\u00e9mon more appeal points, but using the same move twice consecutively will be less effective. Moves can have many effects, such as \"jamming\" previous Pok\u00e9mon to reduce their appeal, or randomizing the order of appeals in the next round.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;235\u2013236</ref> After appeals are concluded, the results are shown, and the Pok\u00e9mon with the most total points wins a ribbon.<ref>Official Pok\u00e9mon Scenario Guide Diamond and Pearl version p.&nbsp;237</ref>\n\n==== Pok\u00e9blocks and Poffins ====\nPok\u00e9blocks ({{nihongo4|Polock|\u30dd\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Porokku}}), introduced in ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'', are [[candy]]-like treats used to increase the contest condition and Loyalty of Pok\u00e9mon. Pok\u00e9blocks are created from Berries in the \"Berry Blender\" minigame, which can be played by two to four human or computer-controlled players. The types of berries blended by all participants affect the category and effectiveness of the resulting Pok\u00e9block. Pok\u00e9blocks are also used in the games' Safari Zone to attract wild Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n{{nihongo4|Poffins|\u30dd\u30d5\u30a3\u30f3|Pofin}}, a type of baked goods, were introduced in [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] as replacements for Pok\u00e9blocks. Poffins are made by adding a Berry to some batter in a pot, and stirring it with a stylus using the [[Nintendo DS]]'s touch screen. Poffins can be mixed only with human partners and can be done solo or with two to four players wirelessly.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9athlon ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], the contest minigame is replaced with an athletic competition called the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9athlon|\u30dd\u30b1\u30b9\u30ed\u30f3|Pokesuron}}. The competitions range from [[track and field]] events such as [[hurdling]] or a [[relay race]] to a [[snowball fight]] and a game resembling [[pachinko]].\n\nA Pok\u00e9mon's stats may be increased by consuming {{nihongo4|\"Aprijuice\"|\u30dc\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3\u30af|Bon Dorinku|\"Bon Drink\"}} made from fruits known as Apricorns that the player can find throughout the world. By putting a number of Apricorns in a [[blender]] and making the player character run a certain number of steps, the Apricorns are mixed into a [[milkshake]]-like blend. The process can be repeated multiple times, each time adding more Apricorns to the mixture and running to blend them. The number of times this is done, along with the variety of Apricorns used, affects the type and effectiveness of the resulting Aprijuice. Aprijuice will increase one of five additional statistics that only exist for the Pok\u00e9athlon which consist of Speed, Power, Skill, Jump, and Stamina.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon Musicals ===\nIn [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']], the contest minigame is replaced by the {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9mon Musicals|\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb|Pok\u00e9mon My\u016bjikaru}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pokemon-sp.jp/series/bw/#/system/system03.html|title=\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30ab\u30eb {{!}} \u300e\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8\u300f\u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Rather than grooming Pok\u00e9mon with Pok\u00e9blocks, Poffins, or Aprijuice, the player's Pok\u00e9mon is only dressed in Accessories which can be waved around on stage when the Pok\u00e9mon dances to various pieces of music; the player does not control the Pok\u00e9mon during this time, other than Appealing with special props. If the audience likes the performance, they give more props to the player in person post-performance. The player can, in fact, control the camera angle during the performance.\n\n=== Pok\u00e9star Studios ===\nAnother minigame is added in ''Black 2'' and ''White 2'' called {{nihongo4|Pok\u00e9star Studios|\u30dd\u30b1\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9|Pokeuddo|\"Pok\u00e9wood\"}}. The player joins the cast of a movie and participates in a mock battle with a [[chroma key]] opponent, while picking line options that match the script of the film and completing an objective within a particular set of turns.

{"title_page": "Sports in North America", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=September 2017}}\n\nThere is a wide variety of organized sports in the continent of North America. The continent is the birthplace of several of these organized sports, such as [[basketball]], [[gridiron football]] (including both [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football|Canadian]] games), [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[racquetball]], [[rodeo]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and [[volleyball]]. The modern versions of [[baseball]] and [[softball]], [[skateboarding]], [[snowboarding]], [[stock car racing]], and [[surfing]] also developed in North America.\n\nSports leagues in Canada and the United States use a closed, franchise model which has the same teams playing every year, with occasional additions of [[expansion team]]s or [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocations of existing teams]]. Leagues in other North American countries use [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two divisions based on their performance at the end of each season.\n\nThe [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] dominate organized men's professional team sports in those two countries: [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). [[Liga MX]], the top level Association football in Mexico is also widely popular.  [[Caribbean]], where [[Cricket in the West Indies|cricket is popular]], that region's major domestic competitions include the [[Regional Four Day Competition]], the [[Regional Super50]], and the [[Caribbean Premier League]].\n\n[[Major women's sport leagues in North America|Women's professional sports]] in the U.S. and Canada include the [[Women's National Basketball Association]], the [[National Women's Soccer League]], and the [[National Women's Hockey League]]. Individual professional sports organizations based in North America include [[INDYCAR]] and [[NASCAR]] in [[auto racing]], the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[LPGA Tour]] in golf, and the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA). [[College athletics]] in Canada are organized by [[U Sports]] and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] (CCAA). In the U.S., they are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) and the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA).\n\n==Franchise organization in the U.S. and Canada==\n{{main|Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|Promotion and relegation#United States and Canada}}\n\nA distinct feature in American and Canadian professional sports leagues, compared to many other countries around the world, is the lack of [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two levels based on their performance for the completed [[Season (sports)|season]]. Other North American countries, such as the [[Mexican football league system|Mexico's football league system]], may have a promotion and relegation process, where, for example, teams may transfer between the Mexican top level [[Liga MX]] and the second level [[Ascenso MX]].\n\nInstead, professional sports leagues in the U.S. and Canada use a closed, franchise model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of [[expansion teams]] and [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation of existing teams]], and with no team movement between the top level, the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]]s, and the lower levels, the [[minor league]]s. The minor league system then can be generally viewed as an informal relegation system based on ''individual players'' rather than teams. Many minor league teams are generally affiliated with major league teams. Players remain employees of, or under contract to, the parent organization and are assigned to the minor league level appropriate to their skill and development. Skillful players are often promoted, or 'called up', to the parent major league team while under-performing players or players recovering from a major injury are 'sent down' to an affiliated minor league team.\n\n[[College athletics]] act as the primary suppliers of players to the professional leagues. Many [[College athletics in the United States|college sports in the U.S.]] are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), which divides schools into three divisions based on the size and organization of each institution: [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] for large schools, [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] for smaller schools, and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] for schools who do not offer any [[athletic scholarship]] to students. In Canada, college sports are organized by [[U Sports]] for universities and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] for colleges. The [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) has members in both the U.S. and Canada.\n\n==Team sports==\n===Football===\n{{see also|Football#North American football codes}}\nNorth America is the birthplace of [[gridiron football]], the form of [[football]] that originally developed, and is primarily played, in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"Britannica-Gridiron\">{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football | title=Gridiron football | publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] | accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> Both major forms, [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], developed in the late 19th century out of the original games now known as [[rugby football]] and [[association football]].

[[College football]] in the U.S. is primarily organized by the NCAA. The NCAA further divides its Division I football teams into the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] and the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]]. The Football Bowl Subdivision has the largest and most competitive schools, and is noted for its system of postseason [[bowl game]]s.\n\n[[USA Football]] is the [[Sports governing body|governing body]] for amateur American football in the U.S., and is a member of the [[International Federation of American Football]] (IFAF), the international governing body of American football associations.

Teams from Canadian universities compete in [[U Sports football]]. The [[Canadian Junior Football League]] and [[Quebec Junior Football League]] field teams with players aged 18\u201322.\n\n[[Football Canada]] is the governing body for amateur Canadian football. Although it primarily focuses on the Canadian form of the game, it is also a member of the International Federation of American Football.\n\n====Association football====\n[[CONCACAF]] is the continental governing body for association football in North America, and runs two visible tournaments: the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] and the Champions League <ref name=\"concacaf.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.concacaf.com/concacaf|title=CONCACAF|work=CONCACAF}}</ref> The Gold Cup is competed every two years among the [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] to determine the regional champion of North America. The [[CONCACAF Champions League|Champions League]] is an annual continental competition for the top football clubs in North America, with the winner advancing to the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].\n\n[[Liga MX]] is North America's most popular association football league with an average attendance of 25,557 during the [[2014-15 Liga MX season|2014\u201315 season]].<ref>{{cite web|title=A quick primer on Mexico's Liga MX |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/quick-primer-mexicos-liga-mx/ |publisher=Media Life Magazine |accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref> It forms the top level of the [[Mexican football league system|Mexican men's, four-level league system]], with [[Ascenso MX]], [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]], and [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]]. This Mexican league system uses [[promotion and relegation]], where teams are transferred between levels based on their final records at the end of the season. For women, the [[Super Liga Femenil de F\u00fatbol]] is at the top level.\n\nThe men's professional soccer league systems in both [[United States soccer league system|the U.S.]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canada]] instead primarily use the closed, franchise model which primarily always has the same teams playing. [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) represents the highest level, while the second level consists of the the [[USL Championship]]. Although the MLS has teams in both countries, they are only sanctioned by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF), the governing body of soccer in the United States. The [[Canadian Soccer Association]], the governing body in Canada, instead sanctions two third-level semi-pro all-Canadian leagues at the third level: [[League1 Ontario]] and [[Premi\u00e8re Ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec]], as well as a separate level-one league, the [[Canadian Premier League]]. The United States has the [[USL League One]] and [[National Independent Soccer Association]], which are both professional. For women' professional soccer, the [[National Women's Soccer League]] is at the top level, and [[United Women's Soccer]] and [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] are at the second level. [[College soccer]] is played both in the U.S. and Canada, with top players often going on to play professional.\n\nOther countries with multi-level professional league systems include [[Football in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Football in El Salvador#League System|El Salvador]], [[Football in Guatemala#League system|Guatemala]], [[Football in Honduras#Football competitions|Honduras]], [[Jamaican football league system|Jamaica]], [[Football in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], and [[Football in Panama|Panama]]. Most of these use promotion and regulation.\n\n===Baseball===\n{{see also|List of organized baseball leagues#Americas}}\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the United States. The sport is currently popular in various other North American countries.\n\nIn the U.S. and Canada, [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) is the top professional level of baseball, while [[Minor League Baseball]] (MiLB) comprises several levels and multiple component leagues below MLB. MiLB also has teams and component leagues in Mexico (such as the [[Mexican League|Mexican Baseball League]]) and the Dominican Republic (such as the [[Dominican Summer League]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/milb/info/teams.jsp|title=Teams by Name \u2013 MiLB.com Official Info \u2013 The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|work=MiLB.com|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}</ref> The relationship between MLB and MilB is also the closed, franchise model, which has the same teams playing, and where the ''players'' are transferred between levels. Several more independent leagues operate in the U.S. and Canada. Primarily because of MiLB, [[college baseball]] plays a smaller role in developing professional players than what college football does with its players.\n\nOther professional leagues in North America include the [[Dominican Professional Baseball League]], [[Liga Mexicana del Pac\u00edfico]] in Mexico, the [[Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League]], the [[Panamanian Professional Baseball League]], and the [[Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]] in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe [[Cuban National Series]] is the primary domestic amateur baseball competition in Cuba. It forms part of the [[Cuban baseball league system]], run by the [[Baseball Federation of Cuba]], the governing body of baseball in that country. Amateur baseball in Canada includes [[Ligue de Baseball \u00c9lite du Qu\u00e9bec]], the [[New Brunswick Senior Baseball League]], and the [[Nova Scotia Senior Baseball League]].

[[Tennis Canada]], the [[Central American & Caribbean Tennis Confederation]], and the [[United States Tennis Association]] are the regional member organizations of the [[International Tennis Federation]], and help organize various events in their respective areas of North America.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Americas topic|Sport in}}\n\n[[Category:Sport in North America| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date=September 2017}}\n\nThere is a wide variety of organized sports in the continent of North America. The continent is the birthplace of several of these organized sports, such as [[basketball]], [[gridiron football]] (including both [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football|Canadian]] games), [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[racquetball]], [[rodeo]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and [[volleyball]]. The modern versions of [[baseball]] and [[softball]], [[skateboarding]], [[snowboarding]], [[stock car racing]], and [[surfing]] also developed in North America.\n\nSports leagues in Canada and the United States use a closed, franchise model which has the same teams playing every year, with occasional additions of [[expansion team]]s or [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocations of existing teams]]. Leagues in other North American countries use [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two divisions based on their performance at the end of each season.\n\nThe [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] dominate organized men's professional team sports in those two countries: [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) and the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). [[Liga MX]], the top level Association football in Mexico is also widely popular.  [[Caribbean]], where [[Cricket in the West Indies|cricket is popular]], that region's major domestic competitions include the [[Regional Four Day Competition]], the [[Regional Super50]], and the [[Caribbean Premier League]].\n\n[[Major women's sport leagues in North America|Women's professional sports]] in the U.S. and Canada include the [[Women's National Basketball Association]], the [[National Women's Soccer League]], and the [[National Women's Hockey League]]. Individual professional sports organizations based in North America include [[INDYCAR]] and [[NASCAR]] in [[auto racing]], the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[LPGA Tour]] in golf, and the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA). [[College athletics]] in Canada are organized by [[U Sports]] and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] (CCAA). In the U.S., they are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) and the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA).\n\n==Franchise organization in the U.S. and Canada==\n{{main|Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|Promotion and relegation#United States and Canada}}\n\nA distinct feature in American and Canadian professional sports leagues, compared to many other countries around the world, is the lack of [[promotion and relegation]] systems, where teams are transferred between two levels based on their performance for the completed [[Season (sports)|season]]. Other North American countries, such as the [[Mexican football league system|Mexico's football league system]], may have a promotion and relegation process, where, for example, teams may transfer between the Mexican top level [[Liga MX]] and the second level [[Ascenso MX]].\n\nInstead, professional sports leagues in the U.S. and Canada use a closed, franchise model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of [[expansion teams]] and [[Relocation of professional sports teams|relocation of existing teams]], and with no team movement between the top level, the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]]s, and the lower levels, the [[minor league]]s. The minor league system then can be generally viewed as an informal relegation system based on ''individual players'' rather than teams. Many minor league teams are generally affiliated with major league teams. Players remain employees of, or under contract to, the parent organization and are assigned to the minor league level appropriate to their skill and development. Skillful players are often promoted, or 'called up', to the parent major league team while under-performing players or players recovering from a major injury are 'sent down' to an affiliated minor league team.\n\n[[College athletics]] act as the primary suppliers of players to the professional leagues. Many [[College athletics in the United States|college sports in the U.S.]] are primarily organized by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), which divides schools into three divisions based on the size and organization of each institution: [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] for large schools, [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] for smaller schools, and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] for schools who do not offer any [[athletic scholarship]] to students. In Canada, college sports are organized by [[U Sports]] for universities and the [[Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association]] for colleges. The [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) has members in both the U.S. and Canada.\n\n==Team sports==\n===Football===\n{{see also|Football#North American football codes}}\nNorth America is the birthplace of [[gridiron football]], the form of [[football]] that originally developed, and is primarily played, in the U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"Britannica-Gridiron\">{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football | title=Gridiron football | publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] | accessdate=October 20, 2010}}</ref> Both major forms, [[American football]] and [[Canadian football]], developed in the late 19th century out of the original games now known as [[rugby football]] and [[association football]].

For women, the [[Super Liga Femenil de F\u00fatbol]] is at the top level.\n\nThe men's professional soccer league systems in both [[United States soccer league system|the U.S.]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canada]] instead primarily use the closed, franchise model which primarily always has the same teams playing. [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS) represents the highest level, while the second level consists of the the [[USL Championship]]. Although the MLS has teams in both countries, they are only sanctioned by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] (USSF), the governing body of soccer in the United States. The [[Canadian Soccer Association]], the governing body in Canada, instead sanctions two third-level semi-pro all-Canadian leagues at the third level: [[League1 Ontario]] and [[Premi\u00e8re Ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec]], as well as a seperate level one league, the [[Canadian Premier League]]. The United States has the [[USL League One]] and [[National Independent Soccer Association]], which are both professional. For women' professional soccer, the [[National Women's Soccer League]] is at the top level, and [[United Women's Soccer]] and [[Women's Premier Soccer League]] are at the second level.

Several more independent leagues operate in the U.S. and Canada. Primarily because of MiLB, [[college baseball]] plays a smaller role in developing professional players than what college football does with its players.\n\nOther professional leagues in North America include the [[Dominican Professional Baseball League]], [[Liga Mexicana del Pac\u00edfico]] in Mexico, the [[Nicaraguan Professional Baseball League]], the [[Panamanian Professional Baseball League]], and the [[Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente]] in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe [[Cuban National Series]] is the primary domestic amateur baseball competition in Cuba.

It contains electronic influences. The song samples a beat from the song \"Take a Dive\" by Bryan Pringle. The \"woo-hoo\" line is sampled from [[The Police]]'s song \"[[Every Breath You Take]]\". Ann Powers of ''Los Angeles Times'' noted the song's similarities to [[Five Stairsteps]]' song \"[[Ooh Child]]\", writing that it emulates the song's \"use of a repetitive, warm vocal line to signify a good mood coming on.\"<ref name=powers/> According to Jimmy Iovine of the [[Interscope Geffen A&M]] label group, the melody was inspired by the [[U2]] song \"[[I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight]]\": \"I sent will.i.am over to the studio to do some remixes on I'll Go Crazy.
