{"title_page": "The Conformist", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{About||the 1970 Italian film adaptation|The Conformist (1970 film)|the 2017 Chinese film|The Conformist (2017 film)}}\n[[Image:The Conformist cover.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Reprinted Italian edition, featuring a still of [[Stefania Sandrelli]] and [[Dominique Sanda]] from the film.]]\n\n'''''The Conformist''''' (''Il conformista'') is a novel by [[Alberto Moravia]] published in [[1951 in literature|1951]], which details the life and desire for normality of a government official during [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|fascist period]]. It is also known for the [[The Conformist (film)|1970 film adaptation]] by [[Bernardo Bertolucci]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n===Prologue===\nIn the prologue, the reader witnesses numerous formative events from a short period in Marcello's childhood. In the first, Marcello coldly kills several lizards in the yard between his home and the home of his neighbor and friend, Roberto. He tries to coax Roberto into offering approval of this behavior, and when Roberto doesn\u2019t comply, they fight and Roberto leaves. Marcello later obtains a slingshot and fires a few stones through the ivy that covers the fence around Roberto's family's house, only to find that he has killed their family cat instead of Roberto. Marcello is mortified not so much by his actions but by what he perceives as the abnormality of his sentiments.\n\nMarcello also witnesses a fight between his parents that is later revealed to mark the beginning of his father's decline into mental illness. Marcello's mother and housemaid discover that his father has vandalized a photograph of Marcello and his mother by poking holes through their eyes and drawing streaks of blood on their faces. His father ultimately chases his mother around the house and attacks her in the bedroom, leaving Marcello torn between whether to rescue his mother or aid his father. It is revealed that Marcello's father often physically abuses the boy.\n\nThe final section of the prologue covers Marcello's torment at the hands of his classmates, who use his somewhat effeminate appearance to question his gender. One day, five classmates follow Marcello home from school and try to force him to wear a skirt, but their attack is interrupted by a chauffeur who happens on the scene and offers to drive Marcello home. En route, the chauffeur appears to proposition Marcello, offering him a pistol in exchange for unspecified actions. The chauffeur, who reveals himself to be a former priest de-frocked for indecent behavior, ultimately stops himself before initiating any actions with Marcello and begs the boy to ignore him if he tries to speak to him again. Marcello doesn\u2019t fully understand what is happening, and his desire for the pistol leads him to go with the chauffeur again a few days later. This time, the chauffeur, named Lino, locks himself in the room with Marcello and tells the boy that he won\u2019t be able to escape the (still unspoken) [[child sexual abuse|abuse]] to come. During the struggle, Lino's gun comes loose and Marcello grabs it. When Lino tells Marcello to shoot him, he complies and flees out the window.\n\n===Part I===\nPart I opens with Marcello, now a state employee of the Italian [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] government, looking through old newspaper clippings for information on the incident with Lino. He ultimately finds an obituary that blames the death on an accident during the cleaning of the gun. While Marcello does not feel true remorse, he does seek some absolution for this incident throughout the novel.\n\nA colleague of Marcello named Orlando asks Marcello to participate in a mission to [[Paris]]. A former professor of Marcello, named Quadri, is now an [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] agitator, and the Italian government would like to infiltrate his organization. Marcello is also due to be married shortly to a woman named Giulia, and offers to take his honeymoon in Paris so that his presence there would not be suspicious to Quadri.\n\nMarcello also takes confession, despite his apparent atheism, as a prelude to the [[Marriage in the Catholic Church|Catholic wedding]] his wife expects. He confesses to murdering Lino, and the priest indicates that he can seek absolution if he feels true remorse for his actions \u2013 an emotion that Marcello does not appear capable of feeling.\n\nThe section closes in the days leading up to Marcello's wedding, and we see his mother-in-law lavishing praise upon him, in stark contrast to his mother, who now lives alone in squalor. His father has been in an asylum for six years and suffers from the delusion that he is one of Mussolini's top aides. On the way to see his father, Marcello's mother gives him a wedding present but indicates that she won\u2019t be attending the ceremony. Marcello and his mother make their monthly visit to his father, who neither recognizes them nor even acknowledges their presence.\n\n===Part II===\nPart II covers the honeymoon and the odd interpersonal relationships that unfold between Marcello, Giulia, Quadri, and Quadri's voluptuous young wife, Anna. En route to [[Paris]], Marcello makes a scheduled stop at a brothel in a small, unnamed town in [[France]], where he is to meet Agent Orlando for further instructions. At the brothel, Marcello is mistaken for a client, causing him some embarrassment before Orlando arrives to tell him that the new plan is to kill Quadri. Marcello needs simply to confirm Quadri's identity to Orlando to fulfill his duties. As he is leaving, Marcello realizes he has forgotten his hat, but when he goes to retrieve it, he finds Orlando with his arm around a prostitute to whom Marcello feels a strange attraction.\n\nMarcello experiences the same feeling when he and Giulia head to Quadri's apartment, as Anna reminds him in some ways of that prostitute, and Marcello tells himself that he is in love with Anna despite her apparent dislike for him. Anna allows Marcello to begin to seduce her, but always keeps him at arm's length, even telling him that she and Quadri are aware that he is a spy there in service of the Italian government.\n\nWhile Anna and Giulia head out shopping, Marcello is accosted by an old man who first mistakes him for a beggar, and then mistakes him for a homosexual or perhaps a prostitute, revisiting the humiliation of the incident with Lino on Marcello. When the old man refuses to take Marcello back to his hotel, Marcello pulls his gun and demands to be let out of the vehicle.\n\nMarcello's feelings for Anna intensify alongside a growing contempt for her when he sees her attempting to seduce Giulia and realizes that her interest in him is merely for show. Anna's pursuit of Giulia leads to an argument in a nightclub where Giulia tells Anna that she is not a lesbian and has no interest in an affair.\n\nAt a dinner, Quadri asks Marcello to post a letter for him on his way back to Italy, as Quadri's activities are monitored and the letter might be intercepted otherwise. Marcello refuses, and Quadri takes this as a sign of solidarity, as Marcello could have taken the letter and turned it over to the authorities instead. However, Marcello does confirm Quadri's identity to Orlando, and on a trip to Savoy, Quadri \u2013 as well as Anna, who left with him in response to Giulia's rejection \u2013 is killed by Orlando and his men.\n\n===Epilogue===\nThe epilogue briefly explores Marcello's conflicted responses to his role in the murders of Quadri and Lino, including his attempts to rationalize away his culpability. The epilogue takes place years later, on the night that Mussolini falls from power. Giulia reveals that she has long suspected that Marcello was involved in the murders, but her sorrow is more for their own safety than for Marcello's victims or his duplicity.\n\nThe two go out for a drive and walk that evening, and while Giulia tries to convince Marcello to make love to her in a wooded area, a stranger arrives and calls to Marcello by name. Marcello is floored to see that it is Lino. Marcello shows real emotion for the first time in the book when he screams at Lino and blames him for ruining his life by taking his innocence. Lino defends himself by arguing that the loss of innocence is inevitable and is merely a part of the human experience. This speech leads Marcello to the beginning of acceptance of his own non-conformity.\n\nThe novel's closing passage has Marcello, Giulia, and their daughter driving to the mountains to evade possible reprisals for Marcello's role with the government. En route, they drive into an air raid, and their car is strafed with bullets. Giulia and the daughter are killed in the first wave, and Marcello falls out of the car, wounded. Realizing his wife and daughter are dead, he waits for the second wave to return. The novel ends with Marcello hearing the plane's approach.\n\n==Major themes==\nMarcello spends the entire novel in a search for what he perceives to be a normal life - normal activities, a normal appearance, normal emotions, and so on. However, he confuses normality with conformity, and in his quest to conform, subjugates his already-repressed emotions. When the natural course of his life presents him with ethical dilemmas - the assignment to betray Professor Quadri, his attraction to women other than his wife - he is ill-prepared to deal with them. Moravia also intimates a connection between sexual repression and fascism.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* ''[[The Garden of the Finzi-Continis]]'' - another Italian novel and film about life during Mussolini's regime.\n\n==External links==\n* {{imdb title | id=0065571 | title=The Conformist}}.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conformist, The}}\n[[Category:1951 novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Alberto Moravia]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian novels]]\n[[Category:Italian novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Italy]]\n[[Category:Works about Italian fascism]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{About||the 1970 Italian film adaptation|The Conformist (1970 film)|the 2017 Chinese film|The Conformist (2017 film)}}\n[[Image:The Conformist cover.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Reprinted Italian edition, featuring a still of [[Stefania Sandrelli]] and [[Dominique Sanda]] from the film.]]\n\n'''''The Conformist''''' (''Il conformista'') is a novel by [[Alberto Moravia]] published in [[1951 in literature|1951]], which details the life and desire for normalcy of a government official during [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s [[Kingdom of Italy under Fascism (1922\u20131943)|fascist period]]. It is also known for the [[The Conformist (film)|1970 film adaptation]] by [[Bernardo Bertolucci]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n===Prologue===\nIn the prologue, the reader witnesses numerous formative events from a short period in Marcello's childhood. In the first, Marcello coldly kills several lizards in the yard between his home and the home of his neighbor and friend, Roberto. He tries to coax Roberto into offering approval of this behavior, and when Roberto doesn\u2019t comply, they fight and Roberto leaves. Marcello later obtains a slingshot and fires a few stones through the ivy that covers the fence around Roberto's family's house, only to find that he has killed their family cat instead of Roberto. Marcello is mortified not so much by his actions but by what he perceives as the abnormality of his sentiments.\n\nMarcello also witnesses a fight between his parents that is later revealed to mark the beginning of his father's decline into mental illness. Marcello's mother and housemaid discover that his father has vandalized a photograph of Marcello and his mother by poking holes through their eyes and drawing streaks of blood on their faces. His father ultimately chases his mother around the house and attacks her in the bedroom, leaving Marcello torn between whether to rescue his mother or aid his father. It is revealed that Marcello's father often physically abuses the boy.\n\nThe final section of the prologue covers Marcello's torment at the hands of his classmates, who use his somewhat effeminate appearance to question his gender. One day, five classmates follow Marcello home from school and try to force him to wear a skirt, but their attack is interrupted by a chauffeur who happens on the scene and offers to drive Marcello home. En route, the chauffeur appears to proposition Marcello, offering him a pistol in exchange for unspecified actions. The chauffeur, who reveals himself to be a former priest de-frocked for indecent behavior, ultimately stops himself before initiating any actions with Marcello and begs the boy to ignore him if he tries to speak to him again. Marcello doesn\u2019t fully understand what is happening, and his desire for the pistol leads him to go with the chauffeur again a few days later. This time, the chauffeur, named Lino, locks himself in the room with Marcello and tells the boy that he won\u2019t be able to escape the (still unspoken) [[child sexual abuse|abuse]] to come. During the struggle, Lino's gun comes loose and Marcello grabs it. When Lino tells Marcello to shoot him, he complies and flees out the window.\n\n===Part I===\nPart I opens with Marcello, now a state employee of the Italian [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] government, looking through old newspaper clippings for information on the incident with Lino. He ultimately finds an obituary that blames the death on an accident during the cleaning of the gun.

Early in the ripening process, fruit synthesises compounds, including alkaloids and tannins. Alkaloids act as a stimulant and can be toxic when ingested. Tannins are biomolecules with anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These compounds fight infections and cause underripe fruit to taste bitter and astringent. Underripe fruits are also fibrous, less juicy and have tougher outer flesh than ripe fruits. These adaptations are an essential tool for the plants to ward off eager eaters who might take the fruit and the undeveloped seeds before they're ready. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/the-science-of-ripening.html|title=Why do bananas go bad so fast?|last=Lunawat|first=Dev|date=2019-05-06|website=Science ABC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n==Ripening agents==\n[[File:2017-10-26 Ripening lemons on a tree, Albufeira (2).JPG|thumb|left|Lemons turn yellow as they ripen]]\nRipening agents speed up the ripening process.\n\nThey allow many fruits to be picked prior to full ripening, which is useful, since ripened fruits do not ship well. For example, [[banana]]s are picked when green and artificially ripened after shipment by being gassed with [[ethylene]]. Ethylene glycol, a compound made up of ethylene gas and hydrogen peroxide, costs anywhere from $15 to $19 in the U.S. Unfortunately, there is evidence that when ingested, the compound is poisonous, and eating the compound can cause kidney failure. In a study, when 20% ethylene glycol and 80% water was used on twenty unripe apples, bananas, lemons, mangos, and nectarines, it took as little as 5 days for the bananas to ripen, and 6 days for the rest of the fruits to ripen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Effects of Diluted Ethylene Glycol as A Fruit-Ripening Agent|last=Goonatilake|first=Ruchitha|publisher=IDOSI Publications|year=2008|isbn=|location=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0000/58f7e1c8fb7546d4c3790218c3a9528bc679.pdf|pages={{!}}pages{{!}} = {{!}}1{{!}}, {{!}}2{{!}}, {{!}}3{{!}}, {{!}}4{{!}}}}</ref>\n\n[[Calcium carbide]] is also used in some countries for artificially ripening fruit. When calcium carbide comes in contact with moisture, it produces [[acetylene]] gas, which is quite similar in its effects to the natural ripening agent, ethylene. Acetylene acts like ethylene and accelerates the ripening process. Industrial-grade calcium carbide may also contain traces of [[arsenic]] and [[phosphorus]] which makes it a human health concern.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Calcium carbide poisoning via food in childhood |year=2007 |last1=Per |first1=H\u00fcseyin |last2=Kurto\u011flu |first2=Selim |last3=Ya\u011fmur |first3=Fatih |last4=G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f |first4=Hakan |last5=Kumanda\u015f |first5=Sefer |last6=Poyrazo\u011flu |first6=M.

Ethylene sensors can be used to precisely control the amount of gas.\n\nCovered fruit ripening bowls are commercially available. The manufacturers claim the bowls increase the amount of ethylene and carbon dioxide gases around the fruit, which promotes ripening.\n\n[[Climacteric fruits]] are able to continue ripening after being picked, a process accelerated by [[ethylene]] gas. Non-climacteric fruits can ripen only on the plant and thus have a short shelf life if harvested when they are ripe.\n\nSome fruits can be ripened by placing them in a plastic bag with a ripe banana, as the banana will release ethylene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/food-52/how-to-ripen-fruit-faster_b_3949628.html|title=How to Ripen Fruit Faster|date=2013-09-20}}</ref>\n\n==Ripening indicators==\n[[Iodine]] (I) can be used to determine whether fruit is ripening or rotting by showing whether the [[starch]] in the fruit has turned into [[sugar]]. For example, a drop of iodine on a slightly rotten part (not the skin) of an apple will stay yellow or orange, since starch is no longer present.  If the iodine is applied and takes 2\u20133 seconds to turn dark blue or black, then the process of ripening has begun but is not yet complete. If the iodine becomes black immediately, then most of the starch is still present at high concentrations in the sample, and hence the fruit hasn't fully started to ripen.\n\n==Ripening stages==\n[[File:Grape tomato cluster partially ripened.JPG|thumb|Ripening tomatoes]]\n[[Climacteric fruits]] undergo a number of changes during fruit ripening. The major changes include fruit softening, sweetening, decreased bitterness, and colour change. These changes begin in an inner part of the fruit, the locule, which is the gel-like tissue surrounding the seeds.

These adaptations are an essential tool for the plants to ward off eager eaters who might take the fruit and the undeveloped seeds before they\u2019re ready. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/the-science-of-ripening.html|title=Why do bananas go bad so fast?|last=Lunawat|first=Dev|date=2019-05-06|website=Science ABC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n==Ripening agents==\n[[File:2017-10-26 Ripening lemons on a tree, Albufeira (2).JPG|thumb|left|Lemons turn yellow as they ripen]]\nRipening agents speed up the ripening process.\n\nThey allow many fruits to be picked prior to full ripening, which is useful, since ripened fruits do not ship well. For example, [[banana]]s are picked when green and artificially ripened after shipment by being gassed with [[ethylene]]. Ethylene glycol, a compound made up of ethylene gas and hydrogen peroxide, costs anywhere from $15 to $19 in the U.S. Unfortunately, there is evidence that when ingested, the compound is poisonous, and eating the compound can cause kidney failure. In a study, when 20% ethylene glycol and 80% water was used on twenty unripe apples, bananas, lemons, mangos, and nectarines, it took as little as 5 days for the bananas to ripen, and 6 days for the rest of the fruits to ripen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Effects of Diluted Ethylene Glycol as A Fruit-Ripening Agent|last=Goonatilake|first=Ruchitha|publisher=IDOSI Publications|year=2008|isbn=|location=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0000/58f7e1c8fb7546d4c3790218c3a9528bc679.pdf|pages={{!}}pages{{!}} = {{!}}1{{!}}, {{!}}2{{!}}, {{!}}3{{!}}, {{!}}4{{!}}}}</ref>\n\n[[Calcium carbide]] is also used in some countries for artificially ripening fruit. When calcium carbide comes in contact with moisture, it produces [[acetylene]] gas, which is quite similar in its effects to the natural ripening agent, ethylene. Acetylene acts like ethylene and accelerates the ripening process. Industrial-grade calcium carbide may also contain traces of [[arsenic]] and [[phosphorus]] which makes it a human health concern.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Calcium carbide poisoning via food in childhood |year=2007 |last1=Per |first1=H\u00fcseyin |last2=Kurto\u011flu |first2=Selim |last3=Ya\u011fmur |first3=Fatih |last4=G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f |first4=Hakan |last5=Kumanda\u015f |first5=Sefer |last6=Poyrazo\u011flu |first6=M.

Ethylene sensors can be used to precisely control the amount of gas.\n\nCovered fruit ripening bowls are commercially available. The manufacturers claim the bowls increase the amount of ethylene and carbon dioxide gases around the fruit, which promotes ripening.\n\n[[Climacteric fruits]] are able to continue ripening after being picked, a process accelerated by [[ethylene]] gas. Non-climacteric fruits can ripen only on the plant and thus have a short shelf life if harvested when they are ripe.\n\nSome fruits can be ripened by placing them in a plastic bag with a ripe banana, as the banana will release ethylene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/food-52/how-to-ripen-fruit-faster_b_3949628.html|title=How to Ripen Fruit Faster|date=2013-09-20}}</ref>\n\n==Ripening indicators==\n[[Iodine]] (I) can be used to determine whether fruit is ripening or rotting by showing whether the [[starch]] in the fruit has turned into [[sugar]]. For example, a drop of iodine on a slightly rotten part (not the skin) of an apple will stay yellow or orange, since starch is no longer present.  If the iodine is applied and takes 2\u20133 seconds to turn dark blue or black, then the process of ripening has begun but is not yet complete. If the iodine becomes black immediately, then most of the starch is still present at high concentrations in the sample, and hence the fruit hasn't fully started to ripen.\n\n==Ripening stages==\n[[File:Grape tomato cluster partially ripened.JPG|thumb|Ripening tomatoes]]\n[[Climacteric fruits]] undergo a number of changes during fruit ripening. The major changes include fruit softening, sweetening, decreased bitterness, and colour change. These changes begin in an inner part of the fruit, the locule, which is the gel-like tissue surrounding the seeds. Ripening-related changes initiate in this region once seeds are viable enough for the process to continue, at which point ripening-related changes occur in the next successive tissue of the fruit called the pericarp<ref> {{cite journal | last1 = Shinozaki | first1 = Y. | display-authors = etal | year = 2018 | title = High Resolution spatiotemporal transcriptome mapping of tomato fruit development and ripening | url = | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 9 | issue = 1| page = 364 | doi=10.1038/s41467-017-02782-9| pmid = 29371663 | pmc = 5785480 }}</ref>.

Due to a severe drop in unfulfilled orders for durable goods and a decreasing demand for commodities and other materials, the recession of 1958 forced over five million people out of work.<ref name=\"ref4\" />\n*In the United States, unemployment rose but there was little to no decline in personal income. Overall, employment decreased by 6.2%, resulting in 2 million job losses and 1.3 million people drawing unemployment insurance.<ref name=\"ref3\" /> Unemployment was highest in industrial areas in the Northeast and Midwest and in mining areas in the Pennsylvania, West Virginia and the West. Michigan suffered the most of any state with an unemployment rate of 11%, as Detroit maintained a record high of 20%. In large part, this was a result of a 47% decline in automobile production. When unemployment rates rose beyond 5.1 million in January 1958, they were higher than at any point since 1941.<ref name=\"ref2\" />\n\n=== Price and costs===\n\n*The effect on prices and costs was an apparent paradox, as prices continued to rise while production and employment were declining.<ref name=\"ref3\" /> In past recessions, prices tended to fall during recessionary conditions, but this time they went up apart from raw materials. The U.S. consumer prices rose 2.7% from 1957 to 1958, and after a pause they continued to push up until November 1959. Wholesale prices rose 1.6% from 1957 to 1959. The continued upward creep of prices became a cause of concern among many well known economists analyzing the economy, such as [[Arthur F. Burns]].\n\n== Government actions==\nGovernment efforts to promote a prompt economic recovery played an important role in the moderation of the recession. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Raymond J. Saulnier]], [[Robert B. Anderson]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] were some of the important figures playing major roles in this effort.

Total employment had increased by about 1 million from its recession low while unemployment had been reduced by 1 million. Income and expenditures of individuals were at new high levels.

By 10:01, the aircraft had reached its cruising altitude of around {{convert|37000|ft}} and was maintaining a cruising speed of Mach&nbsp;0.82.\n\nThe incident started at 12:40:26 [[Time in Australia|WST]], when one of the aircraft\u2019s three [[air data inertial reference unit]]s (ADIRUs) started providing incorrect data to the flight computer. In response to the anomalous data, the [[autopilot]] disengaged automatically, and a few seconds later, the pilots received electronic messages on the aircraft's [[Electronic centralised aircraft monitor|ECAM]], warning them of an irregularity with the autopilot and inertial reference systems, and audible stall and overspeed warnings. During this time, the captain began to manually control the aircraft. The autopilot was then re-engaged and the aircraft started to return to the prior selected flight level. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew after about 15&nbsp;seconds and would remain disengaged for the remainder of the flight. \n\nAt 12:42:27, the aircraft made a sudden, uncommanded pitch down manoeuvre, experiencing \u20130.8&nbsp;''g'',<ref group=note>\"Normal\" ''g''-force (i.e. the force on an object due to the gravity of the Earth, if that object is on or near the surface of the Earth, and that object is not subject to other forces) is +1.0&nbsp;''g''. As an aircraft is accelerated downward (for example, as in this case, by a sudden, uncommanded pitch-down), the ''g''-force may decrease to 0 (zero), at which point weightlessness is experienced; if the downward acceleration is greater yet, the ''g''-force becomes negative. In the case of Qantas Flight 72, a ''g''-force of nearly one full negative ''g'' was experienced; from the in-cabin frame of reference, it can be thought of as if gravity had nearly completely \"reversed\", and anything not restrained \"fell upwards\".</ref> reaching 8.4&nbsp;degrees pitch down and rapidly descending {{convert|650|ft}}.

The aircraft was fitted with three ADIRUs to provide redundancy for fault tolerance, and the FCPCs used the three independent AOA values to check their consistency. In the usual case, when all three AOA values were valid and consistent, the average value of AOA 1 and AOA 2 was used by the FCPCs for their computations. If either AOA 1 or AOA 2 significantly deviated from the other two values, the FCPCs used a memorised value for 1.2 seconds. The FCPC algorithm was very effective, but it could not correctly manage a scenario where there were multiple spikes in either AOA 1 or AOA 2 that were 1.2 seconds apart.\n\nAs with other safety-critical systems, the development of the A330/A340 flight control system during 1991 and 1992 had many elements to minimise the risk of a design error. These included peer reviews, a system safety assessment (SSA), and testing and simulations to verify and validate the system requirements. None of these activities identified the design limitation in the FCPC\u2019s AOA algorithm.\n\nThe ADIRU failure mode had not been previously encountered, or identified by the ADIRU manufacturer in its safety analysis activities. Overall, the design, verification and validation processes used by the aircraft manufacturer did not fully consider the potential effects of frequent spikes in data from an ADIRU.\n\nAirbus has stated that it is not aware of a similar incident occurring previously on an Airbus aircraft.  Airbus has released an Operators Information [[Telex]] to operators of [[Airbus A330|A330]] and [[Airbus A340|A340]] aircraft with procedural recommendations and checklists to minimise risk in the event of a similar incident.<ref name=\"ATSB_MR_20081014\" />\n\n==Final report==\n===Analysis===\nAfter detailed forensic analysis of the FDR, the FCPC software, and the ADIRU, it was determined that the CPU of the ADIRU corrupted the angle of attack (AOA) data. The exact nature of the corruption was that the ADIRU CPU erroneously [[ARINC_429#Labels|re-labelled]] the altitude [[ARINC_429#Word_format|data word]] so that the binary data that represented 37,012 (the altitude at the time of the incident) would represent an angle of attack of 50.625 degrees. The FCPC then processed the erroneously high AOA data, triggering the [[Flight_control_modes#Flight_mode|high-AOA]] protection mode, which sent a command to the electrical flight control system (EFCS) to pitch the nose down.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/3532398/ao2008070.pdf|title=In-flight upset - 154 km west of Learmonth, WA, 7 October 2008, VH-QPA, Airbus A330-303,|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=Aviation Safety Investigation Report&nbsp;\u2013 Final|publisher=Australian Transport Safety Bureau|id=AO-2008-070|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref>\n\n===Potential trigger types===\nA number of potential trigger types were investigated, including software bugs, software corruption, hardware faults, electromagnetic interference and the secondary high energy particles generated by [[Cosmic_ray#Secondary_cosmic_rays|cosmic rays]]. Although a definitive conclusion could not be reached, there was sufficient information from multiple sources to conclude that most of the potential triggers were very unlikely to have been involved. A much more likely scenario was that a marginal hardware weakness of some form made the units susceptible to the effects of some type of environmental factor, which triggered the failure mode.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\nThe ATSB assessment of speculation that possible interference from [[Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt]] or passenger personal electronic devices could have been involved was 'extremely unlikely'.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe ATSB's final report, issued on 19 December 2011, concluded that the incident \"occurred due to the combination of a faulty design in the flight control primary computer (FCPC) software of the A330/A340, and a failure mode affecting one of the aircraft's three ADIRUs. The faulty design meant that, absence of QA covering for all possible scenarios, multiple spikes in angle of attack (AOA) data from one of the ADIRUs could result in the FCPCs commanding the aircraft to pitch down.\"<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\n===Subsequent Qantas Flight 71 incident===\n{{Main|Air data inertial reference unit#Failures and directives}}\nOn 27 December 2008, a Qantas A330-300 aircraft operating from Perth to Singapore was involved in an occurrence approximately {{convert|260|NM|km}} north-west of Perth and {{convert|350|NM|km}} south of Learmonth Airport at 1729 WST, while flying at [[flight level|FL360]].

By 10:01, the aircraft had reached its cruising altitude of around {{convert|37000|ft}} and was maintaining a cruising speed of Mach&nbsp;0.82.\n\nThe incident started at 12:40:26 [[Time in Australia|WST]], when one of the aircraft\u2019s three [[air data inertial reference unit]]s (ADIRUs) started providing incorrect data to the flight computer. In response to the anomalous data, the [[autopilot]] disengaged automatically, and a few seconds later, the pilots received electronic messages on the aircraft's [[Electronic centralised aircraft monitor|ECAM]], warning them of an irregularity with the autopilot and inertial reference systems, and audible stall and overspeed warnings. During this time, the captain began to manually control the aircraft. The autopilot was then re-engaged and the aircraft started to return to the prior selected flight level. The autopilot was disengaged by the crew after about 15&nbsp;seconds and would remain disengaged for the remainder of the flight. \n\nAt 12:42:27, the aircraft made a sudden, uncommanded pitch down manoeuvre, experiencing \u20130.8&nbsp;''g'',<ref group=note>\"Normal\" ''g''-force (i.e. the force on an object due to the gravity of the Earth, if that object is on or near the surface of the Earth, and that object is not subject to other forces) is +1.0&nbsp;''g''. As an aircraft is accelerated downward (for example, as in this case, by a sudden, uncommanded pitch-down), the ''g''-force may decrease to 0 (zero), at which point weightlessness is experienced; if the downward acceleration is greater yet, the ''g''-force becomes negative. In the case of Qantas Flight 72, a ''g''-force of nearly one full negative ''g'' was experienced; from the in-cabin frame of reference, it can be thought of as if gravity had nearly completely \"reversed\", and anything not restrained \"fell upwards\".</ref> reaching 8.4&nbsp;degrees pitch down and rapidly descending {{convert|650|ft}}. Twenty seconds later, the pilots were able to return the aircraft to the assigned cruise flight level, [[flight level|FL370]].

The aircraft was fitted with three ADIRUs to provide redundancy for fault tolerance, and the FCPCs used the three independent AOA values to check their consistency. In the usual case, when all three AOA values were valid and consistent, the average value of AOA 1 and AOA 2 was used by the FCPCs for their computations. If either AOA 1 or AOA 2 significantly deviated from the other two values, the FCPCs used a memorised value for 1.2 seconds. The FCPC algorithm was very effective, but it could not correctly manage a scenario where there were multiple spikes in either AOA 1 or AOA 2 that were 1.2 seconds apart.\n\nAs with other safety-critical systems, the development of the A330/A340 flight control system during 1991 and 1992 had many elements to minimise the risk of a design error. These included peer reviews, a system safety assessment (SSA), and testing and simulations to verify and validate the system requirements. None of these activities identified the design limitation in the FCPC\u2019s AOA algorithm.\n\nThe ADIRU failure mode had not been previously encountered, or identified by the ADIRU manufacturer in its safety analysis activities. Overall, the design, verification and validation processes used by the aircraft manufacturer did not fully consider the potential effects of frequent spikes in data from an ADIRU.\n\nAirbus has stated that it is not aware of a similar incident occurring previously on an Airbus aircraft.  Airbus has released an Operators Information [[Telex]] to operators of [[Airbus A330|A330]] and [[Airbus A340|A340]] aircraft with procedural recommendations and checklists to minimise risk in the event of a similar incident.<ref name=\"ATSB_MR_20081014\" />\n\n==Final report==\n===Analysis===\nAfter detailed forensic analysis of the FDR, the FCPC software, and the ADIRU, it was determined that the CPU of the ADIRU corrupted the angle of attack (AOA) data. The exact nature of the corruption was that the ADIRU CPU erroneously [[ARINC_429#Labels|re-labelled]] the altitude [[ARINC_429#Word_format|data word]] so that the binary data that represented 37,012 (the altitude at the time of the incident) would represent an angle of attack of 50.625 degrees. The FCPC then processed the erroneously high AOA data, triggering the [[Flight_control_modes#Flight_mode|high-AOA]] protection mode, which sent a command to the electrical flight control system (EFCS) to pitch the nose down.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsb.gov.au/media/3532398/ao2008070.pdf|title=In-flight upset - 154 km west of Learmonth, WA, 7 October 2008, VH-QPA, Airbus A330-303,|last=|first=|date=December 2011|website=Aviation Safety Investigation Report&nbsp;\u2013 Final|publisher=Australian Transport Safety Bureau|id=AO-2008-070|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref>\n\n===Potential trigger types===\nA number of potential trigger types were investigated, including software bugs, software corruption, hardware faults, electromagnetic interference and the secondary high energy particles generated by [[Cosmic_ray#Secondary_cosmic_rays|cosmic rays]]. Although a definitive conclusion could not be reached, there was sufficient information from multiple sources to conclude that most of the potential triggers were very unlikely to have been involved. A much more likely scenario was that a marginal hardware weakness of some form made the units susceptible to the effects of some type of environmental factor, which triggered the failure mode.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\nThe ATSB assessment of speculation that possible interference from [[Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt]] or passenger personal electronic devices could have been involved was 'extremely unlikely'.<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe ATSB's final report, issued on 19 December 2011, concluded that the incident \"occurred due to the combination of a faulty design in the flight control primary computer (FCPC) software of the A330/A340, and a failure mode affecting one of the aircraft's three ADIRUs. The faulty design meant that, absence of QA covering for all possible scenarios, multiple spikes in angle of attack (AOA) data from one of the ADIRUs could result in the FCPCs commanding the aircraft to pitch down.\"<ref name=\"ATSB_final\" />\n\n===Subsequent Qantas Flight 71 incident===\n{{Main|Air data inertial reference unit#Failures and directives}}\nOn 27 December 2008, a Qantas A330-300 aircraft operating from Perth to Singapore was involved in an occurrence approximately {{convert|260|NM|km}} north-west of Perth and {{convert|350|NM|km}} south of Learmonth Airport at 1729 WST, while flying at [[flight level|FL360]]. The autopilot disconnected and the crew received an alert indicating a problem with ADIRU #1. The crew performed the revised procedure released by Airbus after the earlier accident and returned to Perth uneventfully.
