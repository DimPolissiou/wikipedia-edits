Although eventually found to have made an emergency forced landing in Ecuador, three B-18s of the squadron conducted extensive searches of the area along the 80th meridian some 250 miles to sea. The aircraft carried enough fuel for a flight of 11 hours duration.  On 20 November 1940, the unit became the '''25th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy)<ref name=25SRSfacts/> in anticipation of the receipt of [[Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]]es.  By 25 August 1941, with its pre-war strength at but five B-18s, the Squadron was finally re-equipped with B-17E Flying Fortresses.\n\n===World War II===\n====Antisubmarine campaign====\n[[File: Boeing B-17E Fortress 41-2504 Panama 1942.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-17E Flying Fortress in Panama, 1942]]\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the squadron left its long time home at France Field for [[Rio Hato Airport]], Panama.  Little more than a month later, it began operations from [[Salinas Airfield]], Ecuador and the [[Galapagos Islands]] (shuttling patrols back and forth) with four of the B-17Es, flying antisubmarine patrols over the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal.  These aircraft being joined by a B-18 by February.  The main body of the Squadron left Salinas by 15 February and returned to [[Howard Field]] in early 1943, although a detachment was still in Ecuador as late as 30 June.\n\nOn 12 May 1943, the squadron was transferred to the [[40th Bombardment Group]] and, the following month, the main body of the squadron, which had been at Howard Field only briefly in the spring of 1943, ended its 21 years of service in the Canal Zone, and moved to the United States.\n\n====Strategic attacks on Japan====\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron - B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-29 Superfortress at Chakulia Airfield, India<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-29-10-BW Superfortress, serial 42-6331.

The aircraft was lost in combat, 1 December 1944.</ref>]]\nThe 25th was stationed at [[Pratt Army Air Field]], Kansas in July 1943 and remanned with new personnel.  It received prototype and early production-model [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombers.  It trained under [[Second Air Force]] for an extended period due to [[Boeing]] technicians making modifications to its B-29 aircraft.  It deployed with the new [[XX Bomber Command]] as part of the [[58th Bombardment Wing]] to the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], flying to bases in India via South Atlantic ferrying route; across central Africa and Arabia to [[Karachi]].  Additional modifications to its B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nFrom airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan.  The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 [[Doolittle raid]] on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at [[Yawata]] on [[Kyushu]] by using its forward staging base at [[Hsinching Airfield]] (A-1), China, for refueling.<ref name=\"B-29\">Mann, {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> It performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, [[Singapore]], [[Saigon]] and [[Cam Rahn Bay]], French Indochina.  It also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand, Malaya and French Indochina.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nThe advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan.  It moved to [[West Field (Tinian)]] in April 1945, becoming part of the new [[XXI Bomber Command]].  From the Marianas, it engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in [[Kure]].  Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area.  By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the [[Hikari, Yamaguchi|Hikari]] Naval Arsenal.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions.  The squadron returned to the United States in November 1945 and was inactivated at [[Davis-Monthan Field]], Arizona in the fall of 1946.<ref name=25SRSfacts/>\n\n===Strategic bombardment===\n[[File: 25th BS Smoky Hill AFB Kansas flight line.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-47s on Smoky Hill AFB flight line in 1956]]\nThe squadron was reactivated at [[Smoky Hill Air Force Base]], Kansasin 1952 as [[Strategic Air Command]] expanded its bomber force.  The 25th initially received what were by then second-line B-29s for training and organization.  The propeller-driven B-29s were replaced with new [[Boeing B-47E Stratojet]] swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The 25th began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964 and was one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet.  The squadron inactivated in September 1964 when the last B-47 aircraft was retired from SAC.\n\n===Strategic weapons training===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:25th STS Strategic Weapons Center.jpeg|thumb|25 STS's $5.4M Strategic Weapons Center at Ellsworth AFB in 1989]] -->\nThe 25th was reactivated in 1988 as a SAC training squadron.  From 1988 to 1992, the 25th supervised SAC [[Boeing B-52H Stratofortress]] bomber crew training and, from 1992 to 1995, [[Air Combat Command]] B-52H and then [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer]] bomber crew training at [[Ellsworth Air Force Base]], South Dakota.

The squadron finally received some British [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s, mostly armed with a single fuselage-mounted Vickers machine gun, and flew two missions in November 1918 days before the war ended.  The first patrol was uneventful and the other patrol targeted a truck convoy in [[Metz]] with 20 lb bombs hand-dropped from their S.E. 5a aircraft.

Although eventually found to have made an emergency forced landing in Ecuador, three B-18s of the squadron conducted extensive searches of the area along the 80th meridian some 250 miles to sea. The aircraft carried enough fuel for a flight of 11 hours duration.  On 20 November 1940, the unit became the '''25th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy)<ref name=25SRSfacts/> in anticipation of the receipt of [[Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]]es.  By 25 August 1941, with its pre-war strength at but five B-18s, the Squadron was finally re-equipped with B-17E Flying Fortresses.\n\n===World War II===\n====Antisubmarine campaign====\n[[File: Boeing B-17E Fortress 41-2504 Panama 1942.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-17E Flying Fortress in Panama, 1942]]\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the squadron left its long time home at France Field for [[Rio Hato Airport]], Panama.  Little more than a month later, it began operations from [[Salinas Airfield]], Ecuador and the [[Galapagos Islands]] (shuttling patrols back and forth) with four of the B-17Es, flying antisubmarine patrols over the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal.  These aircraft being joined by a B-18 by February.  The main body of the Squadron left Salinas by 15 February and returned to [[Howard Field]] in early 1943, although a detachment was still in Ecuador as late as 30 June.\n\nOn 12 May 1943, the squadron was transferred to the [[40th Bombardment Group]] and, the following month, the main body of the squadron, which had been at Howard Field only briefly in the spring of 1943, ended its 21 years of service in the Canal Zone, and moved to the United States.\n\n====Strategic attacks on Japan====\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron - B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-29 Superfortress at Chakulia Airfield, India<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-29-10-BW Superfortress, serial 42-6331.

It received prototype and early production-model [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombers.  It trained under [[Second Air Force]] for an extended period due to [[Boeing]] technicians making modifications to its B-29 aircraft.  It deployed with the new [[XX Bomber Command]] as part of the [[58th Bombardment Wing]] to the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], flying to bases in India via South Atlantic ferrying route; across central Africa and Arabia to [[Karachi]].  Additional modifications to its B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nFrom airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan.  The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 [[Doolittle raid]] on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at [[Yawata]] on [[Kyushu]] by using its forward staging base at [[Hsinching Airfield]] (A-1), China, for refueling.<ref name=\"B-29\">Mann, {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> It performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, [[Singapore]], [[Saigon]] and [[Cam Rahn Bay]], French Indochina.  It also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand, Malaya and French Indochina.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nThe advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan.  It moved to [[West Field (Tinian)]] in April 1945, becoming part of the new [[XXI Bomber Command]].  From the Marianas, it engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in [[Kure]].  Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area.  By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the [[Hikari, Yamaguchi|Hikari]] Naval Arsenal.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions.  The squadron returned to the United States in November 1945 and was inactivated at [[Davis-Monthan Field]], Arizona in the fall of 1946.<ref name=25SRSfacts/>\n\n===Strategic bombardment===\n[[File: 25th BS Smoky Hill AFB Kansas flight line.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-47s on Smoky Hill AFB flight line in 1956]]\nThe squadron was reactivated at [[Smoky Hill Air Force Base]], Kansasin 1952 as [[Strategic Air Command]] expanded its bomber force.  The 25th initially received what were by then second-line B-29s for training and organization.  The propeller-driven B-29s were replaced with new [[Boeing B-47E Stratojet]] swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The 25th began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964 and was one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet.  The squadron inactivated in September 1964 when the last B-47 aircraft was retired from SAC.\n\n===Strategic weapons training===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:25th STS Strategic Weapons Center.jpeg|thumb|25 STS's $5.4M Strategic Weapons Center at Ellsworth AFB in 1989]] -->\nThe 25th was reactivated in 1988 as a SAC training squadron.
