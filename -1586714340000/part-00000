The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. It is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the planned opening of [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas had been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started in 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option for the airport, benefitting both Singaporeans and tourists. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]]. Therefore, there were previously unsuccessful attempts to propose an extension to Changi Airport.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT Link to Airport: Not in next 10 years|date=17 May 1991|work=The Straits Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=No MRT Line to Changi yet|date=20 March 1992|work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of extending the Mass Rapid Transit system to Changi Airport was reconsidered when Terminal 3 was being built.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT extension to airport reconsidered.|date=2 August 1994|work=The Straits Times}}</ref> The earlier plans had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing [[East West MRT line|East West line]] at [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]],<ref>{{Cite news|title=Next Stop:Changi Airport?|date=2 August 1994|work=The New Paper}}</ref> with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment up to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back towards the city along the east coast of the island.

The final plan involved building only the first two stations, namely [[Expo MRT station|Expo]], and the Changi Airport station, the underground station built between Terminal 2 and [[Changi Airport Terminal 3|Terminal 3]]. The alignment of the station at the airport has been switched perpendicularly to an east\u2013west direction, such that the station leads to two of the terminals directly from either end of the station.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19961212-1.2.51.7 |title=MRT Line will not go beyond passenger terminals |website=The Straits Times |access-date=17 October 2019 |date=12 December 1996}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=changi+airport+mrt&KA=changi+airport+mrt&DF=02%2F01%2F1990&DT=01%2F09%2F2010&Display=0&NPT=&L=English&CTA=Article|title=Changi Airport MRT line details|date=12 December 1996|work=The Business Times|access-date=}}</ref> As part of the President's Challenge 2001, a part of a charity walk goes through the tunnel between Expo and Changi Airport stations.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Seng Kim|first=Lim|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Changi%20Airport%20Station&KA=Changi%20Airport%20Station&DF=01%2F04%2F2001&DT=01%2F08%2F2003&Display=0&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article#|title=Chairty walk to talk place underground|date=12 August 2001|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Changi%20Airport%20Station&KA=Changi%20Airport%20Station&DF=01%2F04%2F2001&DT=01%2F08%2F2003&Display=0&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article#|title=Perfectly legal, and for a good cause!|date=9 September 2001|work=The New Paper|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Tan|first=Terence|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Search?ST=1&AT=advanced&K=Changi%20Airport%20Station&KA=Changi%20Airport%20Station&DF=01%2F04%2F2001&DT=01%2F08%2F2003&Display=0&NPT=&L=&CTA=Article#|title=Tunnel walk a hit|date=9 September 2001|work=The Straits Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe Contract 504 for the construction of Changi Airport MRT station and its associated tunnels was awarded to Kumagai-Sembawang Joint Venture in October 1998.

The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. As the only MRT Station to serve the Changi planning area, it is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the opening of the [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas have been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started on 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Changi Airport Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]]. Therefore, there were previously unsuccessful attempts to propose an extension to Changi Airport.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT Link to Airport: Not in next 10 years|date=17 May 1991|work=The Straits Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=No MRT Line to Changi yet|date=20 March 1992|work=The Straits Times}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of extending the Mass Rapid Transit system to Changi Airport was reconsidered when Terminal 3 was being built.<ref>{{Cite news|title=MRT extension to airport reconsidered.|date=2 August 1994|work=The Straits Times}}</ref> The earlier plans had long been made for a new line branching off from the existing [[East West MRT line|East West line]] at [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]],<ref>{{Cite news|title=Next Stop:Changi Airport?|date=2 August 1994|work=The New Paper}}</ref> with some conceptual plans showing a tentative route alignment up to the airport along Airport Boulevard, continuing beyond the airport to Changi Point, before turning southwest back towards the city along the east coast of the island.

The final plan involved building only the first two stations, namely [[Expo MRT station|Expo]], and the Changi Airport station, the underground station built between Terminal 2 and [[Changi Airport Terminal 3|Terminal 3]].

Having met at [[Dartmouth College]], they are known for directing and writing the animated films ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'' (2009) and ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' (2014), as well as directing the live-action comedy film ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'' (2012) and its sequel, ''[[22 Jump Street]]'' (2014). Lord and Miller also won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] as producers of ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (2018), which was co-written by Lord, and co-produced the television series ''[[The Last Man on Earth (TV series)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (2015\u20132018) for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and ''[[Unikitty!]]'' for [[Cartoon Network]].\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Lord is from [[Miami]]; his mother is a [[Cubans|Cuban]]-born psychologist, and his father recently retired from the aviation business and before that directed a dance company, Fusion, for 10 years. Miller is from the [[Seattle]] area, where his father runs a lumber mill.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/movies/lord-and-miller-directors-with-a-golden-touch.html|title=Lord and Miller, Directors With a Golden Touch|first=Cara|last=Buckley|date=6 June 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLord and Miller both grew up making short films with an affinity for animation.  On campus, the two had separate columns in the school newspaper, The Dartmouth. Lord was a member of [[Dartmouth College student groups#Amarna|Amarna]], a co-ed undergraduate society while Miller was a brother at [[Alpha Chi Alpha]]. During his time in college, Christopher met his girlfriend, now wife.\n\nDuring their time at Dartmouth, the school paper published a profile on Miller, which caught the attention of then chairman of [[Disney]], [[Michael Eisner]]. According to Lord, Eisner brought the profile to the attention of his fellow Disney executives who then offered to set up a meeting with Miller. Miller agreed to the meeting as long as he could bring Lord. After three months, the two moved to Los Angeles and after one meeting were offered a two-year development deal for [[Disney Television Animation]].<ref>{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOQl8ZXcBqQ|title=Phil Lord (21 Jumpstreet, Clone High, Cloudy ...) - Breaking In To Hollywood With Chris Miller|publisher=Justin Dean|date=March 14, 2012|via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThough nothing they pitched made it to air, they produced the pilot to ''[[Clone High]]'', which was subsequently dropped by Fox. After they wrote and produced on a series of sitcoms, MTV informed the duo that they were interested in purchasing a 13-episode season of ''Clone High''. Although the show was met with acclaim, MTV canceled the series after hunger strike protests occurred in India over the show's portrayal of Gandhi as a motor-mouthed partier.<ref>{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Rf-8bBSJI|title=Phil Lord & Christopher Miller on the Very Long Hiatus of 'Clone High'|publisher=hollywoodoutbreak|date=September 12, 2009|via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the two were tapped to write a screenplay for what would become their first feature film, ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]''. After a year working on the script, they were fired for story issues and replaced with new writers, who after a year were also fired. Lord and Miller were then re-hired in 2006. The two completely redid the script, this time with the creative input of their crew. The new draft had the protagonist as a failed inventor who wanted to prove himself to his town. The two were almost fired again after [[Amy Pascal]], the head of [[Sony Pictures]] at the time, criticized the film for a lack of story. Although the film succeeded on the comedic front in the animatic stage, Pascal cited the lack of an anchoring relationship in the film as a failure in the story telling. Unable to create new characters and environments to suit the new story demands, the two elevated the character of the tackle shop extra to be the protagonist's father, thereby creating the relationship Pascal had requested. The pair's experience on ''Cloudy'' taught them two valuable lessons: the power of creative collaboration and the importance of emotion in a story.<ref>{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeP9fSlmgjc|title=Rewriting Collective Insights:  Phil Lord at TEDxCoconutGrove|publisher=TEDx Talks|date=October 11, 2012|via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'' was released in 2009 to positive to mixed reviews. After the film was released, the two sought to try to make something different from ''Cloudy'' and pitched themselves as possible directors for the ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'' script that [[Michael Bacall]] and [[Jonah Hill]] had written. The studio agreed and the two directed their first live-action R-rated film, released to critical and popular acclaim, which led to the production of a sequel titled ''[[22 Jump Street]]''.\n\nIn an interview with [[Robert K. Elder]] for his book ''[[The Best Film You've Never Seen]]'', Lord stated that \"in an animated feature, you remake the movie three or four times, and it's really easy to get bummed out that the way you did it before didn't get greenlit, didn't get paid, and you're making a totally different version of that movie.\"<ref>Elder, Robert K.

Print.</ref>\n\nDuring the production of ''21 Jump Street'', they pitched a take on a possible Lego film to [[Dan Lin]]. Lin and [[Warner Bros.]] loved the take, so Lord and Miller wrote and eventually directed their third feature film together, ''[[The Lego Movie]]''. The duo were picked by Warner Bros. to write the script for the upcoming superhero film ''[[The Flash (film)|The Flash]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2015/04/the-flash-superhero-movie-lord-miller-warner-bros-1201407459/|title='The Flash' Movie: 'Lego' Guys Phil Lord & Christopher Miller Building Warner Bros Pic|magazine=Deadline.com|last=Busch|first=Anita|date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> The duo were also picked up in 2015 by [[Sony Pictures Animation]] to make an animated [[Spider-Man]] film with the option to direct.

September 23, 1975) are an American filmmaking duo. Having met at [[Dartmouth College]], they are known for directing and writing the animated films ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'' (2009) and ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' (2014), as well as directing the live-action comedy film ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'' (2012) and its sequel, ''[[22 Jump Street]]'' (2014). Lord and Miller also won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] as producers of ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (2018), which was co-written by Lord, and co-produced the television series ''[[The Last Man on Earth (TV series)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (2015\u20132018) for [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] and ''[[Unikitty!]]'' for [[Cartoon Network]].\n\n==Early life==\nAccording to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Lord is from [[Miami]]; his mother is a [[Cubans|Cuban]]-born psychologist, and his father recently retired from the aviation business and before that directed a dance company, Fusion, for 10 years. Miller is from the [[Seattle]] area, where his father runs a lumber mill.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/movies/lord-and-miller-directors-with-a-golden-touch.html|title=Lord and Miller, Directors With a Golden Touch|first=Cara|last=Buckley|date=6 June 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLord and Miller both grew up making short films with an affinity for animation.  On campus, the two had separate columns in the school newspaper, The Dartmouth. Lord was a member of [[Dartmouth College student groups#Amarna|Amarna]], a co-ed undergraduate society while Miller was a brother at [[Alpha Chi Alpha]]. During his time in college, Christopher met his girlfriend, now wife.\n\nDuring their time at Dartmouth, the school paper published a profile on Miller, which caught the attention of then chairman of [[Disney]], [[Michael Eisner]]. According to Lord, Eisner brought the profile to the attention of his fellow Disney executives who then offered to set up a meeting with Miller. Miller agreed to the meeting as long as he could bring Lord. After three months, the two moved to Los Angeles and after one meeting were offered a two-year development deal for [[Disney Television Animation]].<ref>{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOQl8ZXcBqQ|title=Phil Lord (21 Jumpstreet, Clone High, Cloudy ...) - Breaking In To Hollywood With Chris Miller|publisher=Justin Dean|date=March 14, 2012|via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThough nothing they pitched made it to air, they produced the pilot to ''[[Clone High]]'', which was subsequently dropped by Fox. After they wrote and produced on a series of sitcoms, MTV informed the duo that they were interested in purchasing a 13-episode season of ''Clone High''. Although the show was met with acclaim, MTV canceled the series after hunger strike protests occurred in India over the show's portrayal of Gandhi as a motor-mouthed partier.<ref>{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3Rf-8bBSJI|title=Phil Lord & Christopher Miller on the Very Long Hiatus of 'Clone High'|publisher=hollywoodoutbreak|date=September 12, 2009|via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the two were tapped to write a screenplay for what would become their first feature film, ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]''. After a year working on the script, they were fired for story issues and replaced with new writers, who after a year were also fired. Lord and Miller were then re-hired in 2006. The two completely redid the script, this time with the creative input of their crew. The new draft had the protagonist as a failed inventor who wanted to prove himself to his town. The two were almost fired again after [[Amy Pascal]], the head of [[Sony Pictures]] at the time, criticized the film for a lack of story. Although the film succeeded on the comedic front in the animatic stage, Pascal cited the lack of an anchoring relationship in the film as a failure in the story telling. Unable to create new characters and environments to suit the new story demands, the two elevated the character of the tackle shop extra to be the protagonist's father, thereby creating the relationship Pascal had requested. The pair's experience on ''Cloudy'' taught them two valuable lessons: the power of creative collaboration and the importance of emotion in a story.<ref>{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeP9fSlmgjc|title=Rewriting Collective Insights:  Phil Lord at TEDxCoconutGrove|publisher=TEDx Talks|date=October 11, 2012|via=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'' was released in 2009 to positive to mixed reviews. After the film was released, the two sought to try to make something different from ''Cloudy'' and pitched themselves as possible directors for the ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'' script that [[Michael Bacall]] and [[Jonah Hill]] had written. The studio agreed and the two directed their first live-action R-rated film, released to critical and popular acclaim, which led to the production of a sequel titled ''[[22 Jump Street]]''.\n\nIn an interview with [[Robert K. Elder]] for his book ''[[The Best Film You've Never Seen]]'', Lord stated that \"in an animated feature, you remake the movie three or four times, and it's really easy to get bummed out that the way you did it before didn't get greenlit, didn't get paid, and you're making a totally different version of that movie.\"<ref>Elder, Robert K. ''The Best Film You've Never Seen: 35 Directors Champion the Forgotten or Critically Savaged Movies They Love''. Chicago, IL: Chicago Review, 2013. Print.</ref>\n\nDuring the production of ''21 Jump Street'', they pitched a take on a possible Lego film to [[Dan Lin]]. Lin and [[Warner Bros.]] loved the take, so Lord and Miller wrote and eventually directed their third feature film together, ''[[The Lego Movie]]''. The duo were picked by Warner Bros. to write the script for the upcoming superhero film ''[[The Flash (film)|The Flash]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://deadline.com/2015/04/the-flash-superhero-movie-lord-miller-warner-bros-1201407459/|title='The Flash' Movie: 'Lego' Guys Phil Lord & Christopher Miller Building Warner Bros Pic|magazine=Deadline.com|last=Busch|first=Anita|date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> The duo were also picked up in 2015 by [[Sony Pictures Animation]] to make an animated [[Spider-Man]] film with the option to direct.

He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist, who has served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the Galbin region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities).]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] refers to the Galbin region of the Gobi Desert.<ref name=\"Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Perle |first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Segnosauridae \u2013 novoe semeistvo teropod is posdnego mela Mongolii |trans-title=Segnosauridae \u2013 a new family of Theropoda from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |language=Russian |volume=8 |pages=45\u201355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128221548/http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-28 |translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

In 2010, however, the paleontologist [[Lindsay E. Zanno]] suggested these may refer to paratypes IGM 100/82 and IGM 100/83 (which had already been listed in 1979) because the Russian-to-English translation of Barsbold's article has several typographical errors in regard to specimen numbers. Zanno also noted that by the time of her study, there were numerous problems with the ''Segnosaurus'' IGM specimens, including damage caused since collection, the disappearance of elements of the holotype, incorrect identification of assigned elements, and more than one individual bearing the same specimen number. Holotype elements Zanno was able to access in 2010 included a severely damaged ilium, a sacrum missing the left sacral ribs with damage so it could not conjoin well with the rest of the ilium, and a pubic bone and ischium missing their upper portions. More bones bearing the specimen number IGM 100/82 were located but were not mentioned in Perle's description, while the whereabouts of some paratype elements was unknown.<ref name=\"barsbold1983\">{{Cite journal |last=Barsbold |first=R. |year=1983 |title=Khishchnye dinosavry mela Mongoliy|trans-title=Carnivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=https://paleoglot.org/files/Barsbold_83.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=19 |pages=51\u201352, 76, 108\u2013109 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313031010/http://paleoglot.org/files/barsbold_83.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-13 |access-date=2019-09-21|language=Russian|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30-degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two-thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]].]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

He found segnosaurs to be similar to prosauropods in the morphology of their snout, mandible, and hindfoot; to ornithischians in their cheek, palate, pubis, and ankle; and to early dinosaurs in other respects. He proposed that ornithischians were descended from prosauropods and that the segnosaurs were an intermediate relic of this transition, which supposedly took place during the [[Triassic period]]. In this way, he considered segnosaurians to have a comparable position to herbivorous dinosaurs in general, as [[monotremes]] have to mammals.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong, therefore, proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives. They concluded that therizinosaurs were tetanuran theropods, most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group [[Oviraptorosauria]] (because they found [[Maniraptora]]\u2014the conventional grouping of these\u2014invalid, and the higher-level taxonomy of theropods was in flux).<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\">{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=D.

The eggs were found in a single [[stratigraphic layer]], suggesting the dinosaurs nested at the site on a single occasion and did not exhibit [[site fidelity]] (always returning to the same site to breed).<ref name=\"MongoliaEggs\">{{cite journal |title=First record of a dinosaur nesting colony from Mongolia reveals nesting behavior of therizinosauroids |journal=Hokkaido University |url=https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/first-record-of-a-dinosaur-nesting-colony-from-mongolia-reveals-nesting-behavior-of-therizinosauroids/ |access-date=2019-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221194650/https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/first-record-of-a-dinosaur-nesting-colony-from-mongolia-reveals-nesting-behavior-of-therizinosauroids/ |archive-date=2019-12-21 |url-status=live |date=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Therizinosaurian mandibular morphology.png|thumb|left|Right half of the holotype mandible shown from the inner side (A), the top (C), and bottom (D), and the left half shown from the inner side (B), compared with the mandibles of other therizinosaurs (to scale in lower right)]]\n\nThe unusual features of therizinosaurs have led to several interpretations of their feeding behavior; there is no direct evidence of their diet, such as stomach contents and feeding traces. In 1970, [[Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky]] suggested ''Therizinosaurus''\u2014the only member of the group known at the time\u2014used its large claws to open [[termite mounds]] or gather fruits from trees.<ref name=\"Dinosauria2\"/> Barsbold and Perle pointed out in 1979 and 1980 that their peculiar features probably reflected a different evolutionary direction than those of more typical theropods, many of which were considered effective, active predators. Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could, therefore, crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish-eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs. Because therizinosaur remains are often found in [[sediments]] deposited in river and lake environments, Russell said they may have browsed on [[riparian]] bushes and trees.<ref name=Russell1997>{{cite book |last=Russell |first=D.

He found this consistent with Rozhdestvensky's suggestion that therizinosaurs may have fed on [[social insects]].<ref name=\"Nessov\" /> In a 2006 conference abstract, Sara Burch presented the inferred range of motion in the arms of the therizinosaur ''Neimongosaurus'' and concluded the overall motion at the {{Dinogloss|glenoid}}-humeral joint at the shoulder was roughly circular, and directed sideways and slightly downwards, which diverged from the more oval, backwards-and-downwards-directed ranges of other theropods.

These included small, densely packed, coarse serrations; lanceolate (lance-shaped) teeth with a low replacement rate; a beak at the front of the jaws; an inset tooth row that suggests fleshy cheeks; an elongated neck; a small skull; a very large gut capacity as indicated by the rib circumference at the trunk and the outwards flaring processes of the ilia; and the loss of [[cursorial]] (related to running) adaptations in the hind limbs, including development of functionally tetradactyl feet. Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora\u2014Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria\u2014had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans.<ref name=\"Zanno2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Zanno |first1=L.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards. While the larger gut associated with herbivory was able to push the shaft backwards, they suggested the pubic boot was restrained by [[ventilatory muscles]] that were crucial for cuirassal ventilation\u2014breathing with extra [[air sacs]]\u2014which shows the importance of this mode of respiration.<ref name=\"Macaluso\">{{cite journal |last1=Macaluso |first1=L. |last2=Tschopp |first2=E. |last3=Mannion |first3=P. |title=Evolutionary changes in pubic orientation in dinosaurs are more strongly correlated with the ventilation system than with herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2018 |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=703\u2013719 |doi=10.1111/pala.12362}}</ref> In a 2019 study of jaw musculature, Ali Nabavizadeh concluded therizinosaurs were mainly orthal feeders\u2014moving their jaws up and down\u2014and raised their jaws isognathously whereby the upper and lower teeth of each side [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occluded]] (contacted each other) at once.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the Galbin region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities).]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\").

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30-degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two-thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]].]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

Russell]] and [[Dong Zhi-Ming]] described the new genus ''Alxasaurus'' from China; at the time this was the most complete large theropod from its time and place. While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong, therefore, proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives. They concluded that therizinosaurs were tetanuran theropods, most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group [[Oviraptorosauria]] (because they found [[Maniraptora]]\u2014the conventional grouping of these\u2014invalid, and the higher-level taxonomy of theropods was in flux).<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\">{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=D.

The multiple clutches indicate some therizinosaurs were colonial nesters like [[hadrosaurs]], prosauropods, [[titanosaurs]], and birds.

In 1970, [[Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky]] suggested ''Therizinosaurus''\u2014the only member of the group known at the time\u2014used its large claws to open [[termite mounds]] or gather fruits from trees.<ref name=\"Dinosauria2\"/> Barsbold and Perle pointed out in 1979 and 1980 that their peculiar features probably reflected a different evolutionary direction than those of more typical theropods, many of which were considered effective, active predators. Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could, therefore, crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish-eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs.

Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora\u2014Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria\u2014had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans.<ref name=\"Zanno2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Zanno |first1=L.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards.
