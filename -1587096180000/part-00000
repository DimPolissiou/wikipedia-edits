Lindley ([[Robert Ryan]])\n* Dr. Bernhardt ([[Paul Lukas]]), a renowned German activist working for peace and the reunification of his country\n* Frenchman Henri Perrot ([[Charles Korvin]])\n* British teacher James Sterling ([[Robert Coote]])\n* Soviet Lieutenant Maxim Kiroshilov (Roman Toporow), and\n* German businessman Herr Otto Franzen ([[Fritz Kortner]])\n\nDr. Bernhardt tries to become better acquainted with the other passengers, but they all rebuff his overtures because he is a German until Sterling realises who he is, which immediately changes the atmosphere. When he retires to his compartment, he is killed by a bomb. While the others are questioned at the next stop, [[Frankfurt]], they learn that the dead man was actually one of the doctor's bodyguards. Bernhardt had been posing as another passenger, and Lucienne is his secretary.\n\nBernhardt's enemies are not foiled for long. He is kidnapped from the busy train station in broad daylight after he greets Walther ([[Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel]]), an old, trusted friend. The U.S. Army quickly institutes a search of the city, but when Lucienne begs her fellow travelers to help look for Bernhardt (as they know what he looks like), they at first all decline. One by one, however, they change their minds.\n\nLucienne suggests they go see Walther, unaware that he has betrayed Bernhardt in return for his missing wife's location. When they get there, they discover only Walther's body. He hanged himself after the kidnappers revealed his wife was dead all along.\n\nThe group then splits up to cover the city, with Lindley accompanying Lucienne to various illegal nightclubs. At the last one, Lindley notices a woman smoking an unusually long cigarette, just like the ones Bernhardt likes. He picks up a discarded butt and shows Lucienne that it has a \"B\" monogram on it. When the woman turns out to be an entertainer, pretending to know the answers of questions posed by the customers, Lindley asks her where Bernhardt is. Her clown assistant impedes Lindley, allowing her to get away. When Lindley and Lucienne question Sergeant Barnes (Michael Harvey), the American soldier who was sitting with the woman beforehand, he reluctantly agrees to lead them to where she lives.\n\nIt is a trap, however. When they get to an abandoned brewery, Barnes turns out to be working with the kidnappers. Now all three are prisoners. However, an undercover agent had knocked out the clown and taken his place, accompanying the others to the hideout. He is shot when the real clown shows up, but manages to get back to the nightclub and inform the authorities where Bernhardt is being held. American soldiers break in just as Bernhardt and Lucienne are about to be shot, and free the three unharmed. Kessler (Otto Waldis), the ringleader, is killed by Perrot, who turns out to be Bernhardt's would-be assassin.\n\nThe passengers board the connecting Berliner 2 train for Berlin. Perrot suggests that each of them take a turn guarding Bernhardt in his compartment, with him going first. Afterward, Lindley pieces together various lies Perrot had told and recalls that he knew that the bomb was made from a grenade, but the others dismiss his suspicions. Luckily, he sees Perrot strangling Bernhardt in the reflection from a passing train and saves the doctor's life. Perrot is shot dead as he tries to flee.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Merle Oberon]] as Lucienne\n* [[Robert Ryan]] as Robert Lindley\n* [[Charles Korvin]] as Perrot\n* [[Paul Lukas]] as Dr. Bernhardt\n* [[Robert Coote]] as Sterling\n* [[Reinhold Sch\u00fcnzel]] as Walther\n* Roman Toporow as Lt.

They ordered Woodworth to make a dictated apology and he refused. The assembly then passed a resolution charging Woodworth with contempt and ordered him to withdraw until the apology was made.

Woodworth====\nWoodworth sparked the landmark Canadian Supreme Court decision in ''Landers v. Woodworth (1878), 2 S.C.R. 158'', which justified the provincial legislatures passing statutes outlining the privileges of their members. This had a dramatic impact on the early governance of Canada, which continues into the modern era. The provincial legislatures previously had attempted to legislate their privileges, which were repeatedly rendered by the [[Canadian Privy Council|privy council]] as ''[[ultra vires]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=01UnO61ueOgC&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=landers+v.+woodworth&source=bl&ots=N83lyjfHEh&sig=08tOtmzc27kIMEVP0s7vb0CHomQ&hl=en&ei=KcXWSrvGC5WvlAfgnL35Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=landers%20v.%20woodworth&f=false \"A manual of constitutional history in Canada\"], Retrieved 15 oct 2009.</ref>\n\nThe case arose in 1874 when Woodworth charged the provincial secretary of the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] with falsifying a record. The charge was investigated and deemed unfounded. Subsequently, the assembly charged Woodworth with breach of privilege by making accusations without sufficient evidence to support it. They ordered Woodworth to make a dictated apology and he refused. The assembly then passed a resolution charging Woodworth with contempt and ordered him to withdraw until the apology was made. Woodworth refused to apology or withdraw, which then the assembly passed a resolution ordering the [[sergeant-at-arms]] to physically remove Woodworth for obstruction.<ref name=PP205>[https://books.google.com/books?id=f3ZDAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA205&dq=woodworth,+canada,+parliament&lr=#v=onepage&q=woodworth%2C%20canada%2C%20parliament&f=false \"Parliamentary procedure\"], p. 205, Retrieved 15 oct 2009.</ref>\n\nWoodworth then filed a complaint charging the speaker and other members with assault, where he won a $500 verdict.<ref name=PP206>[https://books.google.com/books?id=f3ZDAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA205&dq=woodworth,+canada,+parliament&lr=#v=onepage&q=woodworth%2C%20canada%2C%20parliament&f=false \"Parliamentary procedure\"], p. 206, Retrieved 15 oct 2009.</ref> Following an appeal where the verdict was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Nova Scotia]] in favor of Woodworth, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that absent an actual obstruction of business by Woodworth, the legislature had no authority to remove him and they were liable. The decision incorporated English law into the decision, which defined in Canada that a member of a legislature does not violate privilege by making a charge the assembly chose to investigate.<ref name=PP206 /> On the issue of privilege statutes passed by the provincial legislatures, the court ruled it was not ''ultra vires'' for them to pass statutes defining their privileges, and recognized their discretion in passing such laws.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=f3ZDAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA205&dq=woodworth,+canada,+parliament&lr=#v=onepage&q=woodworth%2C%20canada%2C%20parliament&f=false \"Parliamentary procedure\"], p. 209, Retrieved 15 oct 2009.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWoodworth died in [[Oakland, California]] at the age of 58.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7GbD_J57LbQC&pg=RA2-PA109&lpg=RA2-PA109 Warren, Charles ''History of the Harvard Law School and of Early Legal Conditions in America'' (1999)]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{Canadian Parliament links|ID=2382}}\n*[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?doc=91595 ''A Cyclop\u00e6edia of Canadian biography being chiefly men of the time ...'', GM Rose (1886)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Woodworth, Douglas Benjamin}}\n[[Category:1841 births]]\n[[Category:1900 deaths]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia MLAs]]\n[[Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942) MPs]]\n[[Category:Woodworth political family|Douglas]]\n[[Category:Canadian Queen's Counsel]]\n", "name_user": "M4CD0N4LD-D4N", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePublic service:added wikilink toKings (provincial electoral district)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Benjamin_Woodworth"}

The memorial is a [[fountain]] in the form of an asymmetric inverted stone [[cone (geometry)|cone]].  A film of water flows over the base of the cone, which contains the 41 names included. It is possible to touch the smooth film of water and to alter it temporarily, which quickly returns to smoothness. As such, the memorial represents the aspirations of the civil rights movement to end legal [[racial segregation]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Maya Lin Lets Healing Waters Flow Over Her Civil Rights Memorial|url=https://people.com/archive/maya-lin-lets-healing-waters-flow-over-her-civil-rights-memorial-vol-32-no-21/|date=1989-11-20|magazine=People|first1=Maya|last1=Lin|author-link=Maya Lin|first2=David|last2=Grogan |first3=Linda|last3=Kramer|accessdate=2019-07-19|quote=I'm trying to make people become involved with the piece on all levels, with the touch and sound of the water, with the words, with the memories.}}</ref>\n\n==Tours and location==\nThe memorial is in downtown Montgomery, at 400 Washington Avenue, in an open plaza in front of the Civil Rights Memorial Center, which was the offices of the Southern Poverty Law Center until it moved across the street into a new building in 2001.

Originally titled '''''Dr. Octagon''''', it was released on May 7, 1996, on Bulk Recordings in the United States and [[Mo' Wax]] in the United Kingdom. The album was later reissued with a different track listing by [[DreamWorks Records]] in 1997 under the title ''Dr. Octagonecologyst''. The album was produced by [[Dan the Automator|Dan \"The Automator\" Nakamura]] and featured the work of [[Turntablism|turntablist]] [[DJ Qbert]]. [[KutMasta Kurt]] provided additional production work. The artwork for ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' was drawn by [[Pushead|Brian \"Pushead\" Schroeder]].\n\n''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' introduces the character of [[Dr. Octagon]], a [[homicide|homicidal]], [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], [[Time travel|time-traveling]] [[Gynaecology|gynecologist]] and [[surgeon]]. The album's distinctive sound crosses genres such as [[psychedelic music]], [[trip hop]], [[old school hip hop]], [[horrorcore]], and [[electronic music]]. Thornton's lyrics are often [[abstract art|abstract]], [[absurdity|absurd]], and [[avant-garde]], using [[surrealism]], [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]]s, [[hallucination|hallucinatory]] [[Psychedelic experience|psychedelia]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[science-fiction]] imagery, as well as [[sexual humor]], [[Surreal humor|absurdist/surrealistic humor]], and [[Sophomoric humor|juvenile humor]]. The unique sound and lyrics of ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' helped revitalize [[alternative hip hop|alternative]] and [[underground hip hop]], gaining more attention than any contemporary independent hip hop album \"in quite a while\".<ref name=\"Huey\"/>\n\nAlthough it did not sell enough copies to reach the mainstream [[music chart]]s, the album was well received with positive reviews and recognition. Kool Keith's lyrics and Nakamura's production were highly praised, as was DJ Qbert's innovative [[scratching]]. ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' has since been ranked as one of the best hip hop albums of the 1990s. The character of Dr. Octagon has also appeared in Kool Keith projects like ''[[First Come, First Served]]'' (1999) and ''[[Dr. Dooom 2]]'' (2008), both of which contain tracks in which Octagon is murdered by Dr. Dooom.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Rap Genius, Kool Keith stated that the album sold around 200,000 copies without any major promotion or marketing budget.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Production ===\n[[Ultramagnetic MCs]] member Keith \"Kool Keith\" Thornton was seeking a new project after the release of his group's third album, ''[[The Four Horsemen (album)|The Four Horsemen]]'', in 1993. Keith and producer KutMasta Kurt \u2013 who were working on a variety of demos together \u2013 recorded two songs called \"Dr. Octagon\" and \"Technical Difficulties\".<ref name=\"Downs\">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/kool-keith-and-kutmasta-kurt,14335/|title=Kool Keith and KutMasta Kurt|accessdate=2009-01-27|last=Downs|first=David|date=November 21, 2008|newspaper=[[The A.V.

The album was later reissued with a different track listing by [[DreamWorks Records]] in 1997 under the title ''Dr. Octagonecologyst''. The album was produced by [[Dan the Automator|Dan \"The Automator\" Nakamura]] and featured the work of [[Turntablism|turntablist]] [[DJ Qbert]]. [[KutMasta Kurt]] provided additional production work. The artwork for ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' was drawn by [[Pushead|Brian \"Pushead\" Schroeder]].\n\n''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' introduces the character of [[Dr. Octagon]], a [[homicide|homicidal]], [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], [[Time travel|time-traveling]] [[Gynaecology|gynecologist]] and [[surgeon]]. The album's distinctive sound crosses genres such as [[psychedelic music]], [[trip hop]], [[old school hip hop]], [[horrorcore]], and [[electronic music]]. Thornton's lyrics are often [[abstract art|abstract]], [[absurdity|absurd]], and [[avant-garde]], using [[surrealism]], [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]]s, [[hallucination|hallucinatory]] [[Psychedelic experience|psychedelia]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[science-fiction]] imagery, as well as [[sexual humor]], [[Surreal humor|absurdist/surrealistic humor]], and [[Sophomoric humor|juvenile humor]]. The unique sound and lyrics of ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' helped revitalize [[alternative hip hop|alternative]] and [[underground hip hop]], gaining more attention than any contemporary independent hip hop album \"in quite a while\".<ref name=\"Huey\"/>\n\nAlthough it did not sell enough copies to reach the mainstream [[music chart]]s, the album was well received with positive reviews and recognition. Kool Keith's lyrics and Nakamura's production were highly praised, as was DJ Qbert's innovative [[scratching]]. ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' has since been ranked as one of the best hip hop albums of the 1990s. The character of Dr. Octagon has also appeared in Kool Keith projects like ''[[First Come, First Served]]'' (1999) and ''[[Dr. Dooom 2]]'' (2008), both of which contain tracks in which Octagon is murdered by Dr. Dooom.\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Rap Genius, Kool Keith stated that the album sold around 200,000 copies without any major promotion or marketing budget.\n\n== Music ==\n=== Production ===\n[[Ultramagnetic MCs]] member Keith \"Kool Keith\" Thornton was seeking a new project after the release of his group's third album, ''[[The Four Horsemen (album)|The Four Horsemen]]'', in 1993. Keith and producer KutMasta Kurt \u2013 who were working on a variety of demos together \u2013 recorded two songs called \"Dr. Octagon\" and \"Technical Difficulties\".<ref name=\"Downs\">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/kool-keith-and-kutmasta-kurt,14335/|title=Kool Keith and KutMasta Kurt|accessdate=2009-01-27|last=Downs|first=David|date=November 21, 2008|newspaper=[[The A.V.

In the ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]'', the album received a rating of four out of five stars.<ref name=\"larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|isbn=0-85712-595-8}}</ref> In ''[[Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'', Peter Relic described it as a \"slab of mondo bizzaro brilliance... totally unlike anything else and totally right\".<ref name=\"rsguide\"/> ''[[PopMatters]]'' columnist Michael Frauenhofer called it \"a landmark album of dope beats and mind-bending experimental flows.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/dr-octagon-the-return-of-dr-octagon/|title=Review of ''The Return of Dr. Octagon''|accessdate=January 27, 2009|last=Frauenhofer|first=Michael|date=June 29, 2006|magazine=[[PopMatters]]}}</ref> Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that the album \"remains as startling and original as the day it was released.\"<ref name=\"Huey\"/> In 2017, ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' reviewer Nate Patrin wrote that \"''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' still feels as much out of its time as it does out of its mind.\"<ref name=pitchfork/>\n\n''Dr. Octagonecologyst''  was re-released on triple vinyl in June 2017, which include the original album, unreleased tracks from the era and remixes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/arts/music/rap-reissues-dr-octagon-ugk-sick-rick.html | title = A Bounty of Hip-Hop Classics, Resurrected | date= 28 June 2017 | accessdate = 9 July 2017 | newspaper = New York Times | author = Jon Caramanica }}</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\nAllmusic reviewer Steve Huey wrote that ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' \"...attracted more attention than any non-mainstream rap album in quite a while, thanks to its inventive production and Keith's bizarre, free-associative rhymes.\" Huey also states that ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' represented \"...the first truly new, genuine alternative to commercial hip-hop since the [[Native Tongues]]' heyday. It appealed strongly to alternative audiences who'd grown up with rap music, but simply hadn't related to it since the rise of gangsta\".<ref name=\"Huey\"/> Thornton expressed some frustration with the Dr. Octagon nickname, saying, \"I just made a record.
