In the event of tied scores after both teams have faced their quota of overs, a [[super over]] is used to determine the match winner. In the group stage teams are ranked on the following criteria:\n\n# Higher number of points\n# If equal, better run rate\n# If equal, highest number of wins\n# If equal, fewest losses\n# If still equal, the results of head to head meeting\n\nIn any play-off match in which there is no result, a super over is used to determine the winner. If the super over is not possible or the result of the over is a tie, the team which finished in the highest league position at the end of the regular season is deemed the winner of the match.\n\n==Teams==\nAccording to a PCB press release, around 20 parties showed an interest in buying franchises for the league before the first season.<ref name=NDTVSPORTS>{{cite news|title=PSL promises IPL style Cricket|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/248904-pakistan-super-league-glitz-glamour-and-promises-of-ipl-style-cricket|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=NDTV Sports|date=21 September 2015}}</ref> On 18 October 2015 the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] began accepting tenders for franchises with a deadline for bids of 15 November.<ref>{{cite web|title=PCB invites bids for Pakistan Super League franchises|url=http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/sports/pc-invites-bids-for-pakistan-super-league-franchises/|website=Daily Pakistan|publisher=Ali Zain|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a statement by the PCB, bid winners would be granted the rights to a franchise for a term of ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=PCB initiates bids for Pakistan Super League franchises|url=http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/75259/pakistan-cricket-board-initiates-bids-for-pakistan-super-league-franchises|publisher=[[Cricbuzz]]|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> Interested parties included the ARY Group, Omar Associates, Arif Habib Group, [[Haier]], [[Mobilink]] as well as international groups including [[Leonine Global Sports]] and the Qatar Lubricants Company (QALCO).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1002853/p|title=Pakistan Super League: Seven companies fight it out to buy franchises|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=3 December 2015|accessdate=3 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nAll five franchises for the first season of the league were sold on 3 December 2015, for a total price of {{US$|93 million}}, after seven bidders presented formal proposals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pakistan Super League: Seven companies fight it out to buy franchises|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1002853/p|accessdate=3 December 2015|work=The Express Tribune|author=Nabeel Hashmi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=PCB sells five PSL teams for $93m|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/948267.html|accessdate=2 July 2017|date=3 December 2015|work=ESPNcricinfo|author=Umar Farooq}}</ref>\n[[File:PSL Map of Participating Nations.png|thumb|PSL Map of Participating Nations]]\nIn April 2017, PCB invited bids for the sixth team and the deadline set for the submission of both the financial and technical proposals was 30 May and as many as 40 national and international parties expressed an interest in buying the sixth franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pakobserver.net/pcb-invites-bids-sixth-psl-team/|title=PCB invites bids for sixth PSL team|newspaper=Pakistan Observer|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 June 2017, from five regions short-listed by PCB Multan was bought by [[Sch\u00f6n Properties]] for a price of {{US$|5.2 million}} per year becoming the most expensive team of the PSL.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1424861/m|title=Multan becomes PSL's sixth franchise as Schon Group buys franchise|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref> However, on 12 November 2018, its rights were terminated by PCB due to payment issues.

In the event of tied scores after both teams have faced their quota of overs, a [[super over]] is used to determine the match winner. In the group stage teams are ranked on the following criteria:\n\n# Higher number of points\n# If equal, better run rate\n# If equal, highest number of wins\n# If equal, fewest losses\n# If still equal, the results of head to head meeting\n\nIn any play-off match in which there is no result, a super over is used to determine the winner. If the super over is not possible or the result of the over is a tie, the team which finished in the highest league position at the end of the regular season is deemed the winner of the match.\n\n==Teams==\nAccording to a PCB press release, around 20 parties showed an interest in buying franchises for the league before the first season.<ref name=NDTVSPORTS>{{cite news|title=PSL promises IPL style Cricket|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/248904-pakistan-super-league-glitz-glamour-and-promises-of-ipl-style-cricket|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=NDTV Sports|date=21 September 2015}}</ref> On 18 October 2015 the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] began accepting tenders for franchises with a deadline for bids of 15 November.<ref>{{cite web|title=PCB invites bids for Pakistan Super League franchises|url=http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/sports/pc-invites-bids-for-pakistan-super-league-franchises/|website=Daily Pakistan|publisher=Ali Zain|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a statement by the PCB, bid winners would be granted the rights to a franchise for a term of ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=PCB initiates bids for Pakistan Super League franchises|url=http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/75259/pakistan-cricket-board-initiates-bids-for-pakistan-super-league-franchises|publisher=[[Cricbuzz]]|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> Interested parties included the ARY Group, Omar Associates, Arif Habib Group, [[Haier]], [[Mobilink]] as well as international groups including [[Leonine Global Sports]] and the Qatar Lubricants Company (QALCO).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1002853/p|title=Pakistan Super League: Seven companies fight it out to buy franchises|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=3 December 2015|accessdate=3 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nAll five franchises for the first season of the league were sold on 3 December 2015, for a total price of {{US$|93 million}}, after seven bidders presented formal proposals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pakistan Super League: Seven companies fight it out to buy franchises|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1002853/p|accessdate=3 December 2015|work=The Express Tribune|author=Nabeel Hashmi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=PCB sells five PSL teams for $93m|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/948267.html|accessdate=2 July 2017|date=3 December 2015|work=ESPNcricinfo|author=Umar Farooq}}</ref>\n[[File:PSL Map of Participating Nations.png|thumb|PSL Map of Participating Nations]]\nIn April 2017, PCB invited bids for the sixth team and the deadline set for the submission of both the financial and technical proposals was 30 May and as many as 40 national and international parties expressed an interest in buying the sixth franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pakobserver.net/pcb-invites-bids-sixth-psl-team/|title=PCB invites bids for sixth PSL team|newspaper=Pakistan Observer|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 June 2017, from five regions short-listed by PCB Multan was bought by [[Sch\u00f6n Properties]] for a price of {{US$|5.2 million}} per year becoming the most expensive team of the PSL.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1424861/m|title=Multan becomes PSL's sixth franchise as Schon Group buys franchise|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref> However, on 12 November 2018, its rights were terminated by PCB due to payment issues.

The thought behind this unusual editorial guideline was that readers would be challenged by the views of their peers and as a result engage with and learn from the articles published on ''Affairs Today''. In terms of style, ''Affairs Today'' sought to emulate the journalistic standards of long-established publications such as the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and ''[[The Economist]]''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n''Affairs Today'' was operated by more than 100 staffers based in over 15 different countries around the world.<ref name=\"collegecareerlife.net\"/> Every member of the staff had to be a university student.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite news|title=Meet Maximilian L Linhard of ''Affairs Today'', A Global Business Journal|url=http://withfivequestions.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/meet-maximilian-l-linhard-of-affairs.html|work=With 5 Questions}}</ref> As the founders moved on from their studies to their respective careers, they decided to close Affairs Today in March 2017. A part of the editorial staff went on to found a news outlet of their own known as Pynx Media, which was discontinued in 2018. \n\n==History==\n''Affairs Today'' was started in February 2013 by [[University of Glasgow]] students Alexandre Gianasso and Maximilian Linhard.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> However, it is only in November of that year that ''Affairs Today'' was formally incorporated. At the date of incorporation, Ferdinand Goetzen had joined the founding team in his capacity of Editor-in-Chief and COO.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> ''Affairs Today'' originally started as a blog operated from a student hall and was chiefly set up as a rival to [[The Gateway (student newspaper)|''The Gateway'']], a newspaper sometimes referred to as the \"Student FT\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> It is during a visit to the [[University of Edinburgh]] that Alexandre Gianasso and Maximilan Linhard read a ''Gateway'' newspaper for the first time, whereupon they decided that the same could be achieved by students themselves.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> At the time, most writers for the ''Gateway'' were professional journalists.

On top of those feats, the man is also one damn fine bassist. Effortlessly performing the genres of hard rock, funk, rhythm & blues, jazz, soul, pop, country, blues and blues rock, Rojas has shown that his musical depth knows no bounds. His talents were utilized by David Bowie from 1983-1987 both on tour and in the studio. He was featured on Bowie's top hits of that era, such as \u201cChina Girl\u201d, \u201cModern Love\u201d, and the chart-topping \u201cLet's Dance\u201d. A short stint touring with Julian Lennon preceded fifteen years spent working closely with Rod Stewart. Rojas\u2019 numerous talents had also been utilized by the likes of Billy Gibbons, Herbie Hancock, Billy Joel, Carlos Santana, John Hiatt, Tina Turner, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Bobby Womack, and the legend among legends, the great B.B. King. Beginning with 2005's You and Me, Joe Bonamassa has welcomed Carmine Rojas as a musical brother both in the recording studio and on hundreds upon hundreds of stages world over. Now, nearly ten years since he joined the family, Rojas has brought his sharpened skills as a bassist to several of Joe's releases and too many tours to count. His skills were brought into the soulful partnership that took flight in 2011 with singer Beth Hart and has continued with the Grammy-nominated Seesaw and the upcoming explosive Live in Amsterdam.\n\n==Discography==\n\n'''With [[Joe Bonamassa]]'''\n* ''[[You & Me (Joe Bonamassa album)|You & Me]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2006)\n* ''[[Sloe Gin (album)|Sloe Gin]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2007)\t\n* ''[[The Ballad of John Henry (album)|The Ballad of John Henry]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2009)\t\n* ''[[Black Rock (Joe Bonamassa album)|Black Rock]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2010)\n* ''[[Dust Bowl (album)|Dust Bowl]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2011)\n* ''[[Driving Towards the Daylight]]'' (Provogue Records, 2012)\t\t\t\t\n* ''[[Different Shades of Blue]]'' (Provogue Records, 2014)\n\n'''With [[Julian Lennon]]'''\n* ''[[Valotte]]'' (Atlantic Records, 1984)\n* ''[[The Secret Value of Daydreaming]]'' (Atlantic Records, 1986)\n\n'''With [[Rod Stewart]]'''\n* ''[[Vagabond Heart]]'' (Warner Bros.

On top of those feats, the man is also one damn fine bassist. Effortlessly performing the genres of hard rock, funk, rhythm & blues, jazz, soul, pop, country, blues and blues rock, Rojas has shown that his musical depth knows no bounds. His talents were utilized by David Bowie from 1983-1987 both on tour and in the studio. He was featured on Bowie's top hits of that era, such as \u201cChina Girl\u201d, \u201cModern Love\u201d, and the chart-topping \u201cLet's Dance\u201d. A short stint touring with Julian Lennon preceded fifteen years spent working closely with Rod Stewart. Rojas\u2019 numerous talents had also been utilized by the likes of Billy Gibbons, Herbie Hancock, Billy Joel, Carlos Santana, John Hiatt, Tina Turner, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Bobby Womack, and the legend among legends, the great B.B. King. Beginning with 2005's You and Me, Joe Bonamassa has welcomed Carmine Rojas as a musical brother both in the recording studio and on hundreds upon hundreds of stages world over. Now, nearly ten years since he joined the family, Rojas has brought his sharpened skills as a bassist to several of Joe's releases and too many tours to count. His skills were brought into the soulful partnership that took flight in 2011 with singer Beth Hart and has continued with the Grammy-nominated Seesaw and the upcoming explosive Live in Amsterdam.\n\n==Discography==\n\n'''With [[Joe Bonamassa]]'''\n* ''[[You & Me (Joe Bonamassa album)|You & Me]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2006)\n* ''[[Sloe Gin (album)|Sloe Gin]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2007)\t\n* ''[[The Ballad of John Henry (album)|The Ballad of John Henry]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2009)\t\n* ''[[Black Rock (Joe Bonamassa album)|Black Rock]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2010)\n* ''[[Dust Bowl (album)|Dust Bowl]]'' (J&R Adventures, 2011)\n* ''[[Driving Towards the Daylight]]'' (Provogue Records, 2012)\t\t\t\t\n* ''[[Different Shades of Blue]]'' (Provogue Records, 2014)\n\n'''With [[Julian Lennon]]'''\n* ''[[Valotte]]'' (Atlantic Records, 1984)\n* ''[[The Secret Value of Daydreaming]]'' (Atlantic Records, 1986)\n\n'''With [[Rod Stewart]]'''\n* ''[[Vagabond Heart]]'' (Warner Bros.

The Hengduan Mountains are primarily large north-south mountain ranges that effectively separate lowlands in northern [[Myanmar]] from the lowlands of the [[Sichuan Basin]].  These ranges are characterized by significant vertical relief originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]]'s collision with the [[Eurasian Plate]], and further carved out by the major rivers draining the eastern Tibetan Plateau. These rivers, the [[Yangtze]], [[Mekong]], and [[Salween]], are recognized today as the [[Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas|Three Parallel Rivers]] UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe Hengduan Mountains cover much of western present-day [[Sichuan]] province as well as the northwestern portions of [[Yunnan]], the easternmost section of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], and touching upon parts of southern [[Qinghai]].  Additionally, some parts of eastern [[Kachin State]] in neighbouring Myanmar are considered part of the Hengduan group.  The Hengduan Mountains are approximately {{convert|900|km}} long, stretching from 33\u00b0N to 25\u00b0N.  Depending on extent of the definition, the Hengduan Mountains are also approximately {{convert|400|km}} wide under the narrowest definition, ranging from 98\u00b0E to 102\u00b0E.

These mountain ranges, in turn, can be further divided into various subranges.  The component ranges of the Hengduan are separated by deep river valleys that channel the waters of many of Southeast Asia's great rivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/features/world/asia/china/china-hotspot-text#|title=China's Hengduan Mountains|last=Virginia Morell|date=April 2002|publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> The core of the Hengduan Mountains can be divided into four major component ranges, described below.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Atlas of China |url= |location=Beijing, China |publisher=SinoMaps Press |page= |date=2006 |isbn=9787503141782}}</ref>\n*The westernmost primary range of the Hengduan runs north-south between the [[Salween]] (Nu) and [[Mekong]] (Lancang) Rivers.  The northern half of this range, found in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], is called the [[Taniantaweng Mountains]] while the southern half, in [[Yunnan]], is called the [[Nu Mountains]].  A major subrange along this system is the [[Meili Snow Mountains]] and their highest peak, [[Kawagebo]].\n*Moving eastward, the next major subsection of the Hengduan Mountains is the range running between the Mekong (Lancang) and [[Yangtze]] (Jinsha) Rivers.

To the east, the [[Qionglai Mountains]] and the [[Min Mountains]] are sometimes included as part of the Hengduan Mountains as these two ranges form the eastern edges of the Tibetan Plateau.\n\n==Ecosystems==\nThe Hengduan Mountains support a range of [[habitat]]s, from subtropical to temperate to montane [[biome]]s.  The mountains are largely covered by [[subalpine]] [[coniferous forests]].<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0516|name=Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests}}</ref><ref>http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/cnhp/glgs/PDF/ChaplinG.2005_opt.pdf Physical Geography of the Gaoligong Shan Area of Southwest China in Relation to Biodiversity</ref>  Elevations range from {{convert|1300|to|6000|m|ft}}. The dense, pristine forests, the relative isolation, and the fact that most of the area remained free from [[glaciation]] during the [[ice age]]s provides a very complex habitat with a high degree of [[biological diversity]]. \n\nThe [[ecoregion]]s that coincide with the Hengduan Mountains are:\n*The [[Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows]] in the higher elevation and norther parts of the Hengduan\n*The [[Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests]] in northern Yunnan and western Sichuan parts of the central Hengduan\n*The [[Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests]] along the westernmost ranges of the Hengduan\n*The [[Qionglai-Minshan conifer forests]] in the east parts of the Hengduan along the edge of the Sichuan Basin\n*The [[Yunnan Plateau subtropical evergreen forests]] at the southern parts of the Hengduan where the mountains transition to the Yungui Plateau\n*The [[Northern Indochina subtropical forests]] in the Nu Mountains, a southwestern component range of the Hengduan in Yunnan\n\nAdditionally, the lowest elevation portions of the Jinsha (Yangtze) River and Nu (Salween) River valleys in the southern Hengduan ranges are classified by the Chinese government as a [[tropical savanna]] environment, but this has not been recognized by the WWF.<ref name=\"Physical Atlas\">{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=National Physical Atlas of China|date=1999|publisher=China Cartographic Publishing House|location=Beijing, China|isbn=7503120401}}</ref>\n\nThe easternmost ranges of the Hengduan are home to the rare and endangered [[giant panda]].

After performing in numerous successful local rock bands in Cape Town, becoming locally respected with bands like Hammak, he moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to further pursue his musical interests.  His formal education included studies at the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] in Boston, where he studied [[jazz]] and [[european classical music|classical]] disciplines, and graduated with honors in 1975. In 1976, he moved to New York City, where he began to establish a career as a freelance musician.\n\nFig was a member of the band [[Spider (American band)|Spider]] during both their album releases in 1980 and 1981 as well as on their 1982 album as newly-renamed band Shanghai, together with famed producer [[Beau Hill]] and songwriter [[Holly Knight]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/1490500|title=Shanghai (4)|website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\nFig had been the drummer on [[Ace Frehley]]'s 1978 solo album and subsequently became a member of the then ex-[[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] lead guitarist's solo project [[Frehley's Comet]] from 1984 to 1987.

When Letterman's show moved to [[CBS]] in 1993 and became ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', the band (and Fig) moved as well, adding a horn section and becoming known as the \"[[CBS Orchestra]]\".\n\nDuring this tenure, Fig and the rest of the band have played with scores of artists including [[Miles Davis]], [[James Brown]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], and [[Tony Bennett]]. Fig also played parts in several of the show's comic sketches, including the recurring gag, \"Anton Fig's Guess The Expiration Date\", in which Fig would be blindfolded and fed a perishable food product and attempt to guess the expiration date on the item solely from tasting it. The CBS Orchestra has also backed up a host of artists in other venues, such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Little Richard]], and also B. B. King at the closing ceremonies of the summer [[1996 Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta]]. They also backed [[Al Green]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [['N Sync]], and [[Eric Clapton]] for [[VH1]]'s Save the Music concert at the [[White House]].\n\nThe World's Most Dangerous Band is also the house band for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Additionally, they were the backup band for [[The Concert for New York City]] where they performed with [[David Bowie]], [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Buddy Guy]], [[Macy Gray]], and [[James Taylor]].\n\nOn occasions when Paul Shaffer has been absent from ''The Late Show'' or has guest-hosted, especially since the death of previous substitute bandleader [[Warren Zevon]] in 2003, Fig has filled in as bandleader.\n\n==Other projects==\nSome of the many recordings Fig has made include selections with [[Bob Dylan]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Gary Moore]], Shanghai, [[Ace Frehley]], [[Joan Armatrading]], [[Rosanne Cash]], [[Joe Cocker]], [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Sebastian Bach]], Oz Noy, [[Jed Davis]], [[Joe Satriani]], [[Paul Butterfield]], and [[Chris Spedding]]. He replaced [[Peter Criss]] on the [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] albums ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' (1979) and ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'' (1980), playing drums on all tracks for both albums (except Criss' song from ''Dynasty'', \"Dirty Livin'\"). Due to Kiss' management attempting to cover up any personnel problems within the band, Fig would not be credited until years later, and Criss appears in the video for \"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\" off the ''Unmasked'' album.\n\nAs a freelance drummer, Fig has also played live with [[Paul Simon]], [[Booker T and the MG's]], The [[Thompson Twins]] at [[Live Aid]], and [[Jim Keltner]] for Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert celebration. In 1996, Fig released a drum instructional video and book titled ''In the Groove'' and ''Late Night Drumming,'' respectively.\n\nIn 2002, Fig completed his first solo record, ''Figments''. Produced and co-written by Fig, the record represents three years of work and includes - among others singers and musicians - [[Richie Havens]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[Ivan Neville]], Sebastian Bach, Ace Frehley, [[Al Kooper]], [[Chris Spedding]], [[Donald Dunn|Donald 'Duck' Dunn]], [[Blondie Chaplin]], [[Paul Shaffer]], [[Chris Botti]], [[Randy Brecker]], and [[Richard Bona]]. In 2006, Fig worked with [[Blackmore's Night]] on ''[[The Village Lanterne]]''. In 2007, Fig worked with [[Joe Bonamassa]] on his ''Sloe Gin'' album, in 2009 on his ''Ballad of John Henry'' album, and in 2014 on ''Different Shades of Blue''. On 4 May 2009, Anton joined [[Joe Bonamassa]]'s band for their debut appearance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where Eric Clapton made a guest appearance. A DVD capturing this performance was subsequently released. Fig was featured on Ace Frehley's album ''[[Anomaly (Ace Frehley album)|Anomaly]]'', released on 15 September 2009.\n\n==Discography==\n{{expand section|date=June 2017}}\n'''With [[Andy LaVerne]]'''\n* ''[[Severe Clear (album)|Severe Clear]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Standard Eyes (Andy LaVerne album)|Standard Eyes]]'' (1990)\n'''With [[Bob Dylan]]'''\n* ''[[Empire Burlesque]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'' (1986)\n'''With [[Al Kooper]]'''\n* ''Rekooperation'' (1994)\n* ''Black Coffee'' (2005)\n* ''White Chocolate'' (2008)\n'''With [[Beth Hart]]'''\n* ''[[Bang Bang Boom Boom]]'' (2012)\n'''With [[Peter Frampton]]'''\n* ''[[Rise Up (Peter Frampton album)|Rise Up]]'' (1980)\n'''With [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'''\n* ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'' (1980)\n'''With [[Paul Shaffer]]'''\n* ''Coast to Coast'' (1989)\n* ''The World's Most Dangerous Party'' (1993)\n'''With [[Beth Hart]] and [[Joe Bonamassa]]'''\n* ''[[Don't Explain (Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa album)|Don't Explain]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Seesaw (album)|Seesaw]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Black Coffee (Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa album)|Black Coffee]]'' (2018)\n'''With [[Patty Smyth]]'''\n* ''[[Never Enough (Patty Smyth album)|Never Enough]]'' (1987)\n'''With [[Rosanne Cash]]'''\n* ''[[Rhythm & Romance (Rosanne Cash album)|Rhythm & Romance]]'' (1985)\n'''With [[Cyndi Lauper]]'''\n* ''[[She's So Unusual]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Hat Full of Stars]]'' (1993)\n'''With [[Garland Jeffreys]]'''\n* ''[[American Boy & Girl]]'' (1979)\n'''With [[Ace Frehley]]'''\n* ''[[Ace Frehley (album)|Ace Frehley]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Frehley's Comet (album)|Frehley's Comet]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[Live+1]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Trouble Walkin']]'' (1989)\n* ''[[12 Picks]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Anomaly (Ace Frehley album)|Anomaly]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Spaceman (album)|Spaceman]]'' (2018)\n'''With [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'''\n* ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' (1992)\n'''With [[Mick Jagger]]'''\n* ''[[She's the Boss]]'' (1985)\n'''With [[Warren Zevon]]'''\n* ''[[My Ride's Here]]'' (2002)\n'''With [[Joe Bonamassa]]'''\n* ''[[Sloe Gin (album)|Sloe Gin]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[The Ballad of John Henry (album)|The Ballad of John Henry]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Black Rock (Joe Bonamassa album)|Black Rock]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Dust Bowl (album)|Dust Bowl]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Driving Towards the Daylight]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Different Shades of Blue]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Blues of Desperation]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Redemption (Joe Bonamassa album)|Redemption]]'' (2018)\n'''With [[Joe Cocker]]'''\n* ''[[Cocker (album)|Cocker]]'' (1986)\n'''With [[Joan Armatrading]]'''\n* ''[[Me Myself I]]'' (1980)\n'''With [[Josh Groban]]'''\n* ''[[Awake (Josh Groban album)|Awake]]'' (2006)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.antonfig.com}}\n* [http://idhitthatpodcast.podomatic.com/entry/2014-07-30T10_02_00-07_00 2014 Audio Interview with Anton Fig from the Podcast \"I'd Hit That]\n* {{IMDb name|id=0276517|name=Anton Fig}}\n* Rockin in the USA -

Due to Kiss' management attempting to cover up any personnel problems within the band, Fig would not be credited until years later, and Criss appears in the video for \"[[Shandi (song)|Shandi]]\" off the ''Unmasked'' album.\n\nAs a freelance drummer, Fig has also played live with [[Paul Simon]], [[Booker T and the MG's]], The [[Thompson Twins]] at [[Live Aid]], and [[Jim Keltner]] for Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert celebration. In 1996, Fig released a drum instructional video and book titled ''In the Groove'' and ''Late Night Drumming,'' respectively.\n\nIn 2002, Fig completed his first solo record, ''Figments''. Produced and co-written by Fig, the record represents three years of work and includes - among others singers and musicians - [[Richie Havens]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[Ivan Neville]], Sebastian Bach, Ace Frehley, [[Al Kooper]], [[Chris Spedding]], [[Donald Dunn|Donald 'Duck' Dunn]], [[Blondie Chaplin]], [[Paul Shaffer]], [[Chris Botti]], [[Randy Brecker]], and [[Richard Bona]]. In 2006, Fig worked with [[Blackmore's Night]] on ''[[The Village Lanterne]]''. In 2007, Fig worked with [[Joe Bonamassa]] on his ''Sloe Gin'' album, in 2009 on his ''Ballad of John Henry'' album, and in 2014 on ''Different Shades of Blue''. On 4 May 2009, Anton joined [[Joe Bonamassa]]'s band for their debut appearance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, where Eric Clapton made a guest appearance. A DVD capturing this performance was subsequently released. Fig was featured on Ace Frehley's album ''[[Anomaly (Ace Frehley album)|Anomaly]]'', released on 15 September 2009.\n\n==Discography==\n{{expand section|date=June 2017}}\n'''With [[Andy LaVerne]]'''\n* ''[[Severe Clear (album)|Severe Clear]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Standard Eyes (Andy LaVerne album)|Standard Eyes]]'' (1990)\n'''With [[Bob Dylan]]'''\n* ''[[Empire Burlesque]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Knocked Out Loaded]]'' (1986)\n'''With [[Al Kooper]]'''\n* ''Rekooperation'' (1994)\n* ''Black Coffee'' (2005)\n* ''White Chocolate'' (2008)\n'''With [[Beth Hart]]'''\n* ''[[Bang Bang Boom Boom]]'' (2012)\n'''With [[Peter Frampton]]'''\n* ''[[Rise Up (Peter Frampton album)|Rise Up]]'' (1980)\n'''With [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'''\n* ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'' (1980)\n'''With [[Paul Shaffer]]'''\n* ''Coast to Coast'' (1989)\n* ''The World's Most Dangerous Party'' (1993)\n'''With [[Beth Hart]] and [[Joe Bonamassa]]'''\n* ''[[Don't Explain (Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa album)|Don't Explain]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Seesaw (album)|Seesaw]]'' (2013)\n* ''[[Black Coffee (Beth Hart and Joe Bonamassa album)|Black Coffee]]'' (2018)\n'''With [[Patty Smyth]]'''\n* ''[[Never Enough (Patty Smyth album)|Never Enough]]'' (1987)\n'''With [[Rosanne Cash]]'''\n* ''[[Rhythm & Romance (Rosanne Cash album)|Rhythm & Romance]]'' (1985)\n'''With [[Cyndi Lauper]]'''\n* ''[[She's So Unusual]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Hat Full of Stars]]'' (1993)\n'''With [[Garland Jeffreys]]'''\n* ''[[American Boy & Girl]]'' (1979)\n'''With [[Ace Frehley]]'''\n* ''[[Ace Frehley (album)|Ace Frehley]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Frehley's Comet (album)|Frehley's Comet]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[Live+1]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Trouble Walkin']]'' (1989)\n* ''[[12 Picks]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Anomaly (Ace Frehley album)|Anomaly]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Spaceman (album)|Spaceman]]'' (2018)\n'''With [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'''\n* ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]'' (1992)\n'''With [[Mick Jagger]]'''\n* ''[[She's the Boss]]'' (1985)\n'''With [[Warren Zevon]]'''\n* ''[[My Ride's Here]]'' (2002)\n'''With [[Joe Bonamassa]]'''\n* ''[[Sloe Gin (album)|Sloe Gin]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[The Ballad of John Henry (album)|The Ballad of John Henry]]'' (2009)\n* ''[[Black Rock (Joe Bonamassa album)|Black Rock]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[Dust Bowl (album)|Dust Bowl]]'' (2011)\n* ''[[Driving Towards the Daylight]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Different Shades of Blue]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[Blues of Desperation]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Redemption (Joe Bonamassa album)|Redemption]]'' (2018)\n'''With [[Joe Cocker]]'''\n* ''[[Cocker (album)|Cocker]]'' (1986)\n'''With [[Joan Armatrading]]'''\n* ''[[Me Myself I]]'' (1980)\n'''With [[Josh Groban]]'''\n* ''[[Awake (Josh Groban album)|Awake]]'' (2006)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.antonfig.com}}\n* [http://idhitthatpodcast.podomatic.com/entry/2014-07-30T10_02_00-07_00 2014 Audio Interview with Anton Fig from the Podcast \"I'd Hit That]\n* {{IMDb name|id=0276517|name=Anton Fig}}\n* Rockin in the USA - Bands Touched by KISS - By Anthony Camponelli - [https://web.archive.org/web/20061106161651/http://www.kissonline.com/news/index.php?mode=archive&id=1683 KISSONLINE.COM | Archive]\n\n{{Ace Frehley}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fig, Anton}}\n[[Category:1952 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:South African expatriates in the United States]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Cape Town]]\n[[Category:Musicians from New York City]]\n[[Category:American rock drummers]]\n[[Category:South African drummers]]\n[[Category:Kiss (band) personnel]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:Late Show with David Letterman]]\n[[Category:The World's Most Dangerous Band members]]\n[[Category:CBS Orchestra members]]\n[[Category:Booker T. & the M.G.'s members]]\n[[Category:20th-century American drummers]]\n[[Category:American male drummers]]\n[[Category:The Blues Brothers members]]\n[[Category:Frehley's Comet members]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toEric Johnson(link changed toEric Johnson (guitarist, born 1954)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Fig"}

With the passage of time, a Town came into being by drawing more and more dwellers and houses in last 50 years nearer to the railway station owing to better transport connectivity to more significant city centers like Jaipur, Jodhpur and Bikaner. The city now has headquarters for administrative units of the sub-division. Degana is 44 km From Makrana Railway station and 15 km from Gachhipura Railway station.\n\n==Demography==\nAs of 2011 India census, Degana had a population of 34,315. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Degana has an average literacy rate of 70%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 75%, and female literacy is 51%.\n\n==Mineral==\nWolfram ([[Wolframite]]) deposits are found in Renwat Hill at Degana. In this mineral the [[tungstate]] of iron and manganese occurs, in the veins and lodes of granite and [[philite]]s. A reserve of the order of 3,400 tones has been established. Until 1994 [[Hindustan Zinc]] (Vedanta Group) was mining here in collaboration with government of Rajasthan, but as the depth of mineral is now very deep it is not that economical to mine mineral from this reservoir so they decided to stop mining for a certain time and started to import.\n\n==Religious sites==\nThe village has the temples of [[ambe mata mandir soni bhawan]], [[Shitala Mata]], Karni Mata [[Chaumunda mata]], [[Charbhuja]], [[Deonarayan]], [[Shree Venkatesh Satyanarayan Temple]],\nTemple was inaugurated on 13 May 1994 to fulfill the dream of Late Jainarayanji Karwa By his son Shri Sriniwasji Karwa. The idols are Lord Venkatesh, Lord Satyanarayan, Goddess Laxmi and Lord hanunman. Main functions are on the Anniversary of Temple, Shiv Mandir, [[Gaytari Mandir]], [[Veer Teja ji Mandir]], [[Dharmshala hanuman mandir]] etc. There is an annual cattle-fair in village from Rajathani month Asoja Krishna 1 to 10 Dashahara. Village also has got three Mosques, One Eidgaah for Muslims. Also Muslim Dargaah (Kasnau Baba - Ilahibaksh baba).\n\n==Geography==\nDegana is located at {{Coord|26.895052|N|74.322166|E|}}. It has an average elevation of 353&nbsp;metres (1161&nbsp;ft).\n\n==Education==\nThere is a Govt. Senior Secondary School with Science, Commerce and Arts faculties situated at Degana-Chandaroon Road. School was developed by Shri Bhanwar Lal Karwa, Chandarun and Hon'ble Citizens of Degana Junction and Chandaroon Village. \n\nDegana city has Girls school up to Senior classes and Girls school attached with Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati University for '''ARTS''' Subject situated at Sadar Bazar, Deagna Junction.\n\nSome Schools of Degana Region:\n*Gaytri Bal Niketan\n*Sharda Bal Niketan\n*Rana International School\n*Veer teja school\n*Vivekanand sr school \n*Blue rose school\n*Vidhya sagar\n*Saraswati Bal Niketan Sr Sec School, Tilanesh\n*Rajasthan Secondary School\n\nColleges in Degana:\n*Government college, degana \n*Marwar college, nagaur fatak, degana \n*Sharada Mahavidyalaya offering science and Arts course.\n*JaiShree College is a private degree college\n\n==Transport==\nDegana is a town populated around a railway junction on Jaipur-Jodhpur Broad-gauge line of North-Westorn Railway. Thence it has good connectivity to [[Jaipur]] (165&nbsp;km), [[Jodhpur]](149&nbsp;km), Delhi (473&nbsp;km) and [[Bikaner]] (218&nbsp;km) through the railway network. Its location is Latitude 26\u00b0 53' 45\" N and Longitude 74\u00b0 19' 15\" E.\n\nAnother railway line from Degana Junction to Ratangarh now upgraded to Broad-gauge has also elevated the importance of this town Station. This line runs through Deedwana, Ladnun, Sujangarh and joins the Bikaner-Delhi Railway line at [[Ratangarh, Churu|Ratangarh]]. Direct trains are available on a daily and weekly basis to Mumbai, Chennai, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Kota, Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad, Bhopal, Nagpur, Varanasi, Puri and Kolkata.\n\nDegana is also connected to nearby towns by 1 National Highway, 2 State Highways and many less-maintained MDR (Major District Roads) but \"sadly\" with negligible presence of State Transport services on this network. The city falls on midway on the State Highway from [[Ajmer]] to [[Nagaur]] SH-60 and another State Highway Ajmer to Deedwana SH-59.\nRecently a new National Highway Link NH-65A is constructed through this town. It is an alternate route of existing NH-65 [Pali to Ambala]. The new Link NH-65A will divert from Main NH-65 at Nimbi Jodha near Ladnun and run through Banthari, Khatu, Sanju, Langod, Degana, Idwa etc. It will be a much shorter route towards Pali for all traffic from Haryana. \n\nPrivate Buses runs from Degana to Ajmer, Nagaur, Deedwana, Merta, Makrana, Parbatsar and Jodhpur but with very unpleasant service and an oligopolistic system of bus operators running on approx hourly basis connecting most of the villages of this Sub-division.\n\n==Politics and governance==\nNagaur district has the oldest history of Panchyati Raj institutions in independent India as they were inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru on 2 October 1959. And Degana being the first among few Panchayats which had elections. Degana was then part of a very large but single Gram Panchayat of 19 villages. \n\nJajunda had a long political and social influence ever since until his demise on 29 August 2007. During last 12 years Kana Ram Jajunda did lot of organizing work to spread the message and vision of his political ideology since he joined Bharatiya Janata Party in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, BJP recorded its first victory on Nagaur MP seat and then grew from strength to strength.\n\nThe Degana Assembly Constituency is representsted in Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha by Ajay Singh Kilak of [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] who defeated [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]] 4 times MLA and stalwart of [[Indian National Congress]] by a narrow margin of 1174 votes in 2008 Assembly elections and again went on to defeat Richhpal Singh Mirdha this time decisively by a margin of 14482 votes in the 2013 General Elections. Ajay Singh Kilak secured more than 53% votes in these elections. [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]] had won four times from Degana constituency (1990\u20132008).\n\nDegana assembly constituency now forms part of newly created Parliamentary Constituency [[Rajsamand]] represented by [[Hari Om Singh Rathore]] of [[Bhartiya Janta Party]] since last General Elections to the Lok Sabha in 2014.\n\nlist of representatives of degana.\n* Candidate\t  Party\t    Year\n* GAURI PUNIA INC\t (1957)\n* GAURI PUNIA\t  RRP\t (1962)\n* GAURI PUNIA INC\t (1967)\n* RAM RAGHUNATH\t  INC\t (1972)\n* RAM RAGHUNATH\t  INC\t (1977)\n* RAM RAGHUNATH\t  INC(U  (1980)\n* KALYAN SINGH\t  JP\t  (1985)\n* [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]]  Janta Dal (1990)\n* [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]]   INC\t(1993)\n* [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]]   Independent (1998)\n* [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]]   INC\t(2003)\n* [[Ajay Singh Kilak]]   BJP     (2008)\n* [[Ajay Singh Kilak]]    BJP     (2013)\n* [[Vijay pal mirdha]]   INC     (2018)\nThe city has sub-division headquarters with SDM, tehsil headquarters with 237+ revenue villages and judicial headquarters with ADJ court.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of villages in Degana Tehsil]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Nagaur district}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Nagaur district]]\n[[Category:Villages in Nagaur district]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=February 2019}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup|date=September 2010}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=July 2019}}\n}}{{Unreferenced|date=September 2019}}{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Degana\n| native_name             = \n| native_name_lang        = hi\n| other_name              = \n| nickname                = \n| settlement_type         = Town\n| image_skyline           = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| pushpin_map             = India Rajasthan#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Rajasthan, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|26.895052|N|74.322166|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = [[India]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Rajasthan]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name2       = Nagaur\n| established_title       = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| government_type         = \n| governing_body          = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_rank               = \n| area_total_km2          = \n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = 353\n| population_total        = 34,315\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_rank         = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_demonym      = \n| population_footnotes    = \n| demographics_type1      = Languages\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = [[Hindi language|Hindi]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code             = 341503\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| area_code               = 911587\n| registration_plate      = RJ 21\n| blank1_name_sec1        = Nearest city\n| blank1_info_sec1        = Ajmer\n| blank2_name_sec1        = [[Human sex ratio|Sex ratio]]\n| blank2_info_sec1        = 878/1000 [[male|\u2642]]/[[female|\u2640]]\n| blank3_name_sec1        = Literacy\n| blank3_info_sec1        = 65%\n| blank4_name_sec1        = [[Lok Sabha]] constituency\n| blank4_info_sec1        = Rajsamand\n\n| blank5_name_sec1        = [[Vidhan Sabha]] constituency\n| blank5_info_sec1        = Vijaypal singh mirdha\n| website                 = {{URL|https://www.facebook.com/degana.raj}}\n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Degana''' is a town [[municipality]] and headquarter to Sub-Division and Tehsil located in [[Nagaur district]] of [[Rajasthan]], [[India]].\n\nDegana Railway Junction was made at a small village in the pre-independence era on the Jaipur-Jodhpur railway track solely for the reason of having a railway-node for better operational control as there was a stretch of more than 300&nbsp;km without any station in-between.

School was developed by Shri Bhanwar Lal Karwa, Chandarun and Hon'ble Citizens of Degana Junction and Chandaroon Village. \n\nDegana city has Girls school up to Senior classes and Girls school attached with Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati University for '''ARTS''' Subject situated at Sadar Bazar, Deagna Junction.\n\nSome Schools of Degana Region:\n*Rajasthan Secondary School\n*Sharda Bal Niketan\n*Rana International School\n*Veer teja school\n*Vivekanand sr school \n*Blue rose school\n*Vidhya sagar\n*Saraswati Bal Niketan Sr Sec School, Tilanesh\n\nColleges in Degana:\n*Government college, degana \n*Marwar college, nagaur fatak, degana \n*Sharada Mahavidyalaya offering science and Arts course.\n*JaiShree College is a private degree college\n\n==Transport==\nDegana is a town populated around a railway junction on Jaipur-Jodhpur Broad-gauge line of North-Westorn Railway. Thence it has good connectivity to [[Jaipur]] (165&nbsp;km), [[Jodhpur]](149&nbsp;km), Delhi (473&nbsp;km) and [[Bikaner]] (218&nbsp;km) through the railway network. Its location is Latitude 26\u00b0 53' 45\" N and Longitude 74\u00b0 19' 15\" E.\n\nAnother railway line from Degana Junction to Ratangarh now upgraded to Broad-gauge has also elevated the importance of this town Station. This line runs through Deedwana, Ladnun, Sujangarh and joins the Bikaner-Delhi Railway line at [[Ratangarh, Churu|Ratangarh]]. Direct trains are available on a daily and weekly basis to Mumbai, Chennai, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Kota, Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Allahabad, Bhopal, Nagpur, Varanasi, Puri and Kolkata.\n\nDegana is also connected to nearby towns by 1 National Highway, 2 State Highways and many less-maintained MDR (Major District Roads) but \"sadly\" with negligible presence of State Transport services on this network. The city falls on midway on the State Highway from [[Ajmer]] to [[Nagaur]] SH-60 and another State Highway Ajmer to Deedwana SH-59.\nRecently a new National Highway Link NH-65A is constructed through this town. It is an alternate route of existing NH-65 [Pali to Ambala]. The new Link NH-65A will divert from Main NH-65 at Nimbi Jodha near Ladnun and run through Banthari, Khatu, Sanju, Langod, Degana, Idwa etc. It will be a much shorter route towards Pali for all traffic from Haryana. \n\nPrivate Buses runs from Degana to Ajmer, Nagaur, Deedwana, Merta, Makrana, Parbatsar and Jodhpur but with very unpleasant service and an oligopolistic system of bus operators running on approx hourly basis connecting most of the villages of this Sub-division.\n\n==Politics and governance==\nNagaur district has the oldest history of Panchyati Raj institutions in independent India as they were inaugurated by the then Prime Minister Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru on 2 October 1959. And Degana being the first among few Panchayats which had elections. Degana was then part of a very large but single Gram Panchayat of 19 villages. \n\nJajunda had a long political and social influence ever since until his demise on 29 August 2007. During last 12 years Kana Ram Jajunda did lot of organizing work to spread the message and vision of his political ideology since he joined Bharatiya Janata Party in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, BJP recorded its first victory on Nagaur MP seat and then grew from strength to strength.\n\nThe Degana Assembly Constituency is representsted in Rajasthan Vidhan Sabha by Ajay Singh Kilak of [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] who defeated [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]] 4 times MLA and stalwart of [[Indian National Congress]] by a narrow margin of 1174 votes in 2008 Assembly elections and again went on to defeat Richhpal Singh Mirdha this time decisively by a margin of 14482 votes in the 2013 General Elections. Ajay Singh Kilak secured more than 53% votes in these elections. [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]] had won four times from Degana constituency (1990\u20132008).\n\nDegana assembly constituency now forms part of newly created Parliamentary Constituency [[Rajsamand]] represented by [[Hari Om Singh Rathore]] of [[Bhartiya Janta Party]] since last General Elections to the Lok Sabha in 2014.\n\nlist of representatives of degana.\n* Candidate\t  Party\t    Year\n* GAURI PUNIA INC\t (1957)\n* GAURI PUNIA\t  RRP\t (1962)\n* GAURI PUNIA INC\t (1967)\n* RAM RAGHUNATH\t  INC\t (1972)\n* RAM RAGHUNATH\t  INC\t (1977)\n* RAM RAGHUNATH\t  INC(U  (1980)\n* KALYAN SINGH\t  JP\t  (1985)\n* [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]]  Janta Dal (1990)\n* [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]]   INC\t(1993)\n* [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]]   Independent (1998)\n* [[Richhpal Singh Mirdha]]   INC\t(2003)\n* [[Ajay Singh Kilak]]   BJP     (2008)\n* [[Ajay Singh Kilak]]    BJP     (2013)\n* [[Vijay pal mirdha]]   INC     (2018)\nThe city has sub-division headquarters with SDM, tehsil headquarters with 237+ revenue villages and judicial headquarters with ADJ court.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of villages in Degana Tehsil]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Nagaur district}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Nagaur district]]\n[[Category:Villages in Nagaur district]]\n", "name_user": "Vikram.soni.89", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEducation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degana"}
