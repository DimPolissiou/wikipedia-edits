It was released on June 2, [[1992 in music|1992]]. Tom Morgan of Australian band [[Smudge (band)|Smudge]] helped author the album, [[The Robbs|The Robb Brothers]] produced.  At the time of principal recording, the band consisted of [[Evan Dando]] (lead vocals, guitar), [[Juliana Hatfield]] (bass, backing vocals) and David Ryan (drums).  While not originally on the album, the band's cover of \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\" was added to the album in later pressings after it became a major worldwide radio hit, and featured a later lineup of the band, with [[Nic Dalton]] on bass.  \n\n== History ==\nThe title track was inspired partially by band leader [[Evan Dando]] seeing the line, \"It's a shame about Ray\" in a Sydney newspaper article about something that happened to a child named Ray. \"It's a Shame about Ray\" was a big international hit for the band, as well as a #5 hit on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart in America.

The Weekly Bangla Patrika, Friday 24 March 2006</ref>\n\n== Involvement in Language Movement ==\nKashem was associated with the literary and cultural activities of [[Bangladesh]] for five decades. He contributed in the movement for recognition of Bengali as one of the state languages of Pakistan soon after the independence of Pakistan in 1947. On 1 September 1947 he founded the Pakistan [[Tamaddun Majlish]] as a non-political cultural organisation to mobilise students, intellectuals and the people in general for the Bengali language. On 15 September 1947 he published a booklet entitled, ''[[Pakistaner Rashtra Bhasha: Bangla Na Urdu?]]'' (Pakistan's state language: Bengali or [[Urdu language|Urdu]]?) demanding introduction of Bengali as one of the state language of whole Pakistan.<ref>Mukul, M.R. Aktar, Vhasa Andoloner jinni suchona kore chilan. Daily Bangla, 10 March 1993</ref> This booklet also strongly advocated for Bengali as the medium of education, court language and for its use in the offices in [[East Pakistan]]. Also his untiring efforts let to the formation of the first [[Rashtrabhasa Sangram Parishad]] (State Language Committee of Action) on 1 October 1947 with [[Nurul Huq Bhuiyan]] as the convener and he himself as the treasurer. On 6 December 1947, a meeting was held under the president-ship of Kashem in Dhaka University campus which protested the resolution of the education week held in Karachi suggesting Urdu as the state language and the lingua franca of Pakistan. A protest procession was brought out from the meeting, which met [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], the provincial Chief Minister, and other ministers. Khawaja Nazimuddin gave a written assurance to the Action Committee that he would do the needful to introduce Bengali as one of the state language of Pakistan. Kashem actively participated in organising a countrywide strike on 11 March 1948, to press for the language demand. As the outcome of the strike, on the eve of the impending visit of [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] (the founder of Pakistan) to [[Dhaka]], the then Provincial Government had no other alternative but to sign an agreement with the action committee on 15 March 1948 for introducing Bengali as one of the state language of [[Pakistan]].<ref name=\"Ahmad 1991\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nKashem began his career as a lecturer in the Physics department at [[Dhaka University]] in 1946.

He was the forerunner in introducing textbooks in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] for higher education and contributed much in initiating the Bengali version of the question papers for higher education.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nKashem received a number of national and social awards, including ''[[Independence Day Award]]'' in 1993, ''[[Ekushey Padak]]'' in 1987, ''[[Bangla Academy Literary Award]]'' (for his book Biggan Somaj O Dhormo) in 1982, ''Islamic foundation Award'' in 1988, ''Pakistan Writers guild award'' in 1964 etc. He was accorded a national reception in Dhaka in 1989 which was attended by eminent scholars and litterateurs of Bangladesh and India.

On 6 December 1947, a meeting was held under the president-ship of Kashem in Dhaka University campus which protested the resolution of the education week held in Karachi suggesting Urdu as the state language and the lingua franca of Pakistan. A protest procession was brought out from the meeting, which met [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], the provincial Chief Minister, and other ministers. Khawaja Nazimuddin gave a written assurance to the Action Committee that he would do the needful to introduce Bengali as one of the state language of Pakistan. Kashem actively participated in organising a countrywide strike on 11 March 1948, to press for the language demand. As the outcome of the strike, on the eve of the impending visit of [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] (the founder of Pakistan) to [[Dhaka]], the then Provincial Government had no other alternative but to sign an agreement with the action committee on 15 March 1948 for introducing Bengali as one of the state language of [[Pakistan]].<ref name=\"Ahmad 1991\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nKashem began his career as a lecturer in the Physics department at [[Dhaka University]] in 1946.

With a work force of nearly 1,500, Federal manufactures [[shotshell]], [[centerfire]], and [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] [[ammunition]] and components.\n\n== History ==\nOn April 27, 1922, [[Charles L.

In 1941, Federal won an $87-million contract from the U.S. government (approx. $1.3 billion in 2010) to build and operate the $30-million [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant|Twin City Ordnance Plant]].<ref name=\"guns\" /> Federal ranked 59th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619</ref>\n\nIn 1977, William B. Horn introduced Federal's Premium line of centerfire rifle and shotshell ammunition. The Premium line did not just load Federal's own bullets. Federal also loaded its Premium line with highly regarded projectiles from other manufacturers such as Nosler Partition and Sierra boat-tail. Federal insisted on extremely tight tolerances. As a result, the factory-made Premium line achieved accuracy, performance, and quality, usually associated with hand-loaded ammunition. As of March 2019, Federal still used projectiles from numerous manufacturers.<ref name=\"PremLoad\">{{cite news |last1=Writer |first1=Staff |title=Federal Premium Ammunition Bringing Back Popular Barnes, Nosler and Berger Loads |url=https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2019/03/staff-writer/federal-premium-ammunition-bringing-back-popular-barnes-nosler-and-berger-loads/ |accessdate=15 March 2019 |publisher=The Truth About Guns |date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFederal also owned Hoffman Engineering, a company that made electronic enclosures. In 1985, a group of private investors, including [[Kelso & Company]], [[BancBoston]] Capital, and members of company management purchased Federal. Federal and Hoffman engineering were united under the name Federal-Hoffman and taken private during the sale. In 1988, [[Pentair Inc.|Pentair]], a diversified manufacturer based in Minnesota, agreed to acquire FC Holdings Inc., the holding company for Federal-Hoffman, for $175 million in cash and the assumption of debt.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2012-02-24 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/15/business/company-news-sale-to-pentair.html?scp=9&sq=federal%20cartridge%20company&st=cse |title=Sale to Pentair |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 15, 1988}}</ref> Federal-Hoffman has since split, and Federal is currently owned by [[Vista Outdoor]].

It has a nickel-plated casing and special primer that improve its reliability in semi-automatic handguns. It weighs 99 grains and has a deep, tapered hollow-point to provide consistent expansion. This ammunition does not meet the FBI Ammunition Testing Protocol. With a 3.75-inch test barrel, HST 380 Auto Micro ammunition achieves a muzzle velocity of 1,030 feet per second, a velocity of 990 feet per second at 25 yards, and a velocity of 950 feet per second at 50 yards.

Hydra-Shok is designed to provide more reliable expansion and deeper penetration than other hollow-point projectiles used at that time. Federal Premium claims that the scored jacket and center post design provide a \"programmed\" expansion. There has been much debate regarding the bullets unreliable expansion when fired through clothing or media other than ballistic gelatin. In [[ballistic gelatin]], the bullet typically displays very rapid expansion resulting in a larger but more shallow wound channel than would be typical from most other bullet configurations in the same caliber and of similar weight.<ref name=\"FP\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/02/shootingthebull410/350657/ |title=9mm Ammo Quest: Federal Premium Hydra Shok |date=23 February 2015 |website=The Truth About Guns |publisher=Robert Farago |access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Vital-Shok===\nFederal Premium announced a [[.30-30 Winchester]] version of its Vital-Shok Trophy Copper ammunition for medium-sized game in August 2015. These bullets are tipped with polymer inserts to affect rapid expansion and retain 99 percent of their mass after expanding. The one percent loss of mass is due mostly to shedding the polymer tip.

The \"Syntech\" trademark derives from the Total Polymer Jacket (TPJ), a synthetic low-friction polymer jacketing that replaces the traditional bare lead or copper jacketing.  With no metal-on-metal contact with the bore and rifling, the polymer-jacketed bullets theoretically will impose much less wear on the rifling and generate less heat, which helps to extend barrel life as well as eliminate lead and copper fouling in the bore.  Cartridges using Syntech bullets also use special primers and clean-burning propellants to further minimize carbon fouling.<ref name=\"Syntech\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=New For 2016: American Eagle\u2019s Polymer-Encapsulated Syntech Ammo |url=http://www.tactical-life.com/gear/2016-american-eagle-syntech-ammo/ |newspaper=Tactical Life (Harris Publications) |location=New York, New York |date=5 January 2016 |access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Digest\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=American Eagle Syntech TSJ: What Is Synthetic-Tip Ammo? |url=http://www.gundigest.com/gun-accessory-reviews-articles/new-gun-product-releases/american-eagle-syntech-tsj-synthetic-tip-ammo |newspaper=Gun Digest |location=United States |date=15 January 2015 |access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nSyntech was designed for indoor range shooters.

Until shortly after the election of 2016, 1,400 worked for Federal Premium in Anoka. After the election, there was a huge drop in sales of ammunition, causing a mass layoff and buyouts of employees totaling around 300. Raw materials are brought to the factory by rail. Production runs 24-hours per day, seven days per week. Some of the machinery in use at Anoka dates back to the 1940s. Federal has also modernized much of its production process with help from [[Lewiston, Idaho]] based CCI, another Vista Outdoor subsidiary.

It is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Vista Outdoor]] and is located in [[Anoka, Minnesota|Anoka]], [[Minnesota]].  With a work force of nearly 1,500, Federal manufactures [[shotshell]], [[centerfire]], and [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] [[ammunition]] and components.\n\n== History ==\nOn April 27, 1922, [[Charles L. Horn]] took control of a small plant in [[Anoka, Minnesota]] and refounded Federal Cartridge Corporation.<ref name=\"guns\">{{cite web |accessdate=2012-02-24 |url=http://www.twincities.com/sports/ci_20974357/nine-decades-ammo |title=Federal Cartridge Company: Federal Premium Ammunition's 90th year of booming business | date=June  2012 |publisher=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press|Pioneer Press]]}}</ref>\n\nHorn launched a distribution plan to merchandise Federal products in grocery stores, barbers shops, and gas stations. In 1941, Federal won an $87-million contract from the U.S. government (approx. $1.3 billion in 2010) to build and operate the $30-million [[Twin Cities Army Ammunition Plant|Twin City Ordnance Plant]] (TCOP).<ref name=\"guns\" /> Federal ranked 59th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]] ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619</ref>\n\nIn 1977, [[William B. Horn]] introduced Federal's Premium line of centerfire rifle and shotshell ammunition. The Premium line did not just load Federal's own bullets. Federal also loaded its Premium line with highly regarded projectiles from other manufacturers such as Nosler Partition and Sierra boat-tail. Federal insisted on extremely tight tolerances. As a result, the factory-made Premium line achieved accuracy, performance, and quality, usually associated with hand-loaded ammunition. As of March 2019, Federal still used projectiles from numerous manufacturers.<ref name=\"PremLoad\">{{cite news |last1=Writer |first1=Staff |title=Federal Premium Ammunition Bringing Back Popular Barnes, Nosler and Berger Loads |url=https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2019/03/staff-writer/federal-premium-ammunition-bringing-back-popular-barnes-nosler-and-berger-loads/ |accessdate=15 March 2019 |publisher=The Truth About Guns |date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFederal also owned Hoffman Engineering, a company that made electronic enclosures. In 1985, a group of private investors, including [[Kelso & Company]], [[BancBoston]] Capital, and members of company management purchased Federal. Federal and Hoffman engineering were united under the name Federal-Hoffman and taken private during the sale. In 1988, [[Pentair Inc.|Pentair]], a diversified manufacturer based in Minnesota, agreed to acquire FC Holdings Inc., the holding company for Federal-Hoffman, for $175 million in cash and the assumption of debt.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2012-02-24 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/15/business/company-news-sale-to-pentair.html?scp=9&sq=federal%20cartridge%20company&st=cse |title=Sale to Pentair |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 15, 1988}}</ref> Federal-Hoffman has since split, and Federal is currently owned by [[Vista Outdoor]].

Hydra-Shok is designed to provide more reliable expansion and deeper penetration than other hollow-point projectiles used at that time. Federal Premium claims that the scored jacket and center post design provide a \"programmed\" expansion. There has been much debate regarding the bullets unreliable expansion when fired through clothing or media other than ballistic gelatin. In [[ballistic gelatin]], the bullet typically displays very rapid expansion resulting in a larger but more shallow wound channel than would be typical from most other bullet configurations in the same caliber and of similar weight.<ref name=\"FP\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/02/shootingthebull410/350657/ |title=9mm Ammo Quest: Federal Premium Hydra Shok |date=23 February 2015 |website=The Truth About Guns |publisher=Robert Farago |access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Vital-Shok===\nFederal Premium announced a [[.30-30 Winchester]] version of its Vital-Shok Trophy Copper ammunition for medium-sized game in August 2015.

The \"Syntech\" trademark derives from the Total Polymer Jacket (TPJ), a synthetic low-friction polymer jacketing that replaces the traditional bare lead or copper jacketing.  With no metal-on-metal contact with the bore and rifling, the polymer-jacketed bullets theoretically will impose much less wear on the rifling and generate less heat, which helps to extend barrel life as well as eliminate lead and copper fouling in the bore.  Cartridges using Syntech bullets also use special primers and clean-burning propellants to further minimize carbon fouling.<ref name=\"Syntech\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=New For 2016: American Eagle\u2019s Polymer-Encapsulated Syntech Ammo |url=http://www.tactical-life.com/gear/2016-american-eagle-syntech-ammo/ |newspaper=Tactical Life (Harris Publications) |location=New York, New York |date=5 January 2016 |access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Digest\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=American Eagle Syntech TSJ: What Is Synthetic-Tip Ammo? |url=http://www.gundigest.com/gun-accessory-reviews-articles/new-gun-product-releases/american-eagle-syntech-tsj-synthetic-tip-ammo |newspaper=Gun Digest |location=United States |date=15 January 2015 |access-date=9 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nSyntech was designed for indoor range shooters.

After the election, there was a huge drop in sales of ammunition, causing a mass layoff and buyouts of employees totaling around 300. Raw materials are brought to the factory by rail. Production runs 24-hours per day, seven days per week. Some of the machinery in use at Anoka dates back to the 1940s.

The town is divided by the county line between Beaufort and Hampton counties, which follows the roadbed of the [[CSX Transportation|CSX railroad]].  Most of the town's population presently lies within Hampton County (as of 2019).  As defined by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the Beaufort County portion of Yemassee is included within the [[Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area]].  Yemassee hosts one of the few commercial breeding facilities of non-[[human]] [[primates]] in the entire United States (Alpha Genesis, Inc.).  Also, the [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-designed [[Auldbrass Plantation]] house and outbuildings lie just outside the town limits of Yemassee.\n\n==History==\nThe town takes its name from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe of the same name, the [[Yamasee]], which was the most important Indian ally of South Carolina until the [[Yamasee War]] of 1715. The first attack that began the Yamasee War occurred in the Yamasee town of Pocotaligo, today part of the town of Yemassee.\n\nThe site of the present town is surrounded by both [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary]] and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] sites.

The town is divided by the county line between Beaufort and Hampton counties, which follows the roadbed of the [[CSX Transportation|CSX railroad]].  Most of the town's population presently lies within Hampton County (as of 2019).  As defined by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the Beaufort County portion of Yemassee is included within the [[Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area]].  Yemassee hosts one of the few commercial breeding facilities of non-[[human]] [[primates]] in the entire United States (Alpha Genesis, Inc.).  Also, the [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]-designed [[Auldbrass Plantation]] house and outbuildings lie just outside the town limits of Yemassee.\n\n==History==\nThe town takes its name from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe of the same name, the [[Yamasee]], which was the most important Indian ally of South Carolina until the [[Yamasee War]] of 1715. The first attack that began the Yamasee War occurred in the Yamasee town of Pocotaligo, today part of the town of Yemassee.\n\nThe site of the present town is surrounded by both [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary]] and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] sites.  The remains of Civil War field fortifications can be observed along [[U.S. Route 21|U.S. 21]] and [[U.S. Route 17 Alternate (South Carolina)|17A]] between Yemassee and Pocotaligo (that section of highway is now a part of Yemassee, as the town has now greatly expanded into Beaufort County [as of 2006]).
