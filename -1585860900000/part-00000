Critics have praised the series for its narrative, characters, strong voice acting, large audience appeal as well as the cross conflicts shown among the main characters and the moral questions presented.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Code Geass characters}}\n\n===Setting===\n<!-- Please do not add 55 years differences - official date is 2017 a.t.b. as Revolution Year 228. Revolution Year is started on Storming of the Bastille, 2017-228=1789. -->\nIn an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative timeline]], the world is divided into three [[superpower]]s: the Holy Britannian Empire (the Americas; also called Britannia), the Chinese Federation (Asia), and the [[United States of Europe|European Union]] (Europe and Africa; previously known as the Euro-Universe, also known as Europa United in ''Akito the Exiled''). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the \"Autonomous Armored Knight\", or \"Knightmare Frame\". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.\n\n===Plot===\n[[Lelouch vi Britannia]] is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor [[Charles zi Britannia]] and his royal consort [[Marianne vi Britannia]]. Lelouch has a sister, [[Nunnally vi Britannia]]. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind eye to their mother's death and failing to pursue their mother's killer.\n\nLelouch and Nunnally are sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend [[Suzaku Kururugi]] that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.\n\nSeven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called [[C.C. (Code Geass)|C.C.]] (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as {{nihongo|Geass|\u30ae\u30a2\u30b9|Giasu}}. This power, also known as the {{nihongo|\"Power of Kings\"|\u738b\u306e\u529b|\u014c no Chikara}}, allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf.  This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. However, this does not come without a cost. Caught up in a conflict where he does not know the full extent of his powers, Lelouch will have to battle Suzaku, a resistance member named [[Kallen Stadtfeld]], the strongest army in the world, his own half-siblings, and many others in a battle that will forever change the world.\n\n==Production==\n''Code Geass'' began as a concept developed at Sunrise by [[Ichir\u014d \u014ckouchi]] and [[Gor\u014d Taniguchi]], who proposed it to producer Yoshitaka Kawaguchi. Kawaguchi had previously approached Okouchi and Taniguchi during the production of ''[[Planetes]]''.<ref name=\"\u014dkouchi-interview\">{{cite news|title=Interview with Ichir\u014d \u014ckouchi|work=Code Geass DVD Volume 1|publisher=[[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]}}</ref> The basic idea for the plot consisted of a \"hero\" who led a secret organization, which was later developed into a conflict between two characters with different values and who belonged to the same military unit, who eventually became [[Lelouch Lamperouge]] and [[Suzaku Kururugi]].<ref name=\"\u014dkouchi-interview\" />\n\nDuring these initial planning stages, Kawaguchi also contacted the noted [[Mangaka|manga artist]] group [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]].<ref name=\"\u014dkouchi-interview\"/> This was the first time Clamp had ever been requested to design the characters of an anime series.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\">{{cite news|title=Interview with Gor\u014d Taniguchi and [[Nanase Ohkawa|Ageha \u014ckawa]], head writer of [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]|work=[[Newtype]], May 2007 issue}}</ref> Clamp signed onto the project early during these development stages and provided numerous ideas, which helped develop the series' setting and characters.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/>\n\nWhile developing the character designs for Lelouch, the protagonist of the series, Clamp had originally conceived of his hair color as being white.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> [[Nanase Ohkawa|Ageha Ohkawa]], head writer at Clamp, said she had visualized him as being a character to which \"everyone\" could relate to as being \"cool\", literally, a \"beauty\".<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> During these planning stages, Clamp and the Sunrise staff had discussed a number of possible inspirations for the characters, including [[KinKi Kids]] and [[Tackey & Tsubasa]].<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> They had wanted to create a \"hit show,\" a series which would appeal to \"everyone.\"<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> Lelouch's alter ego, Zero, was one of the earliest developed characters, with \u014ckouchi having wanted a mask to be included as a part of the series, feeling it was necessary for it to be a Sunrise show, and Clamp wanting a unique design never prior seen in any Sunrise series (said mask was nicknamed \"[[tulip]]\" for its distinctive design).<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/>\n\nThe concept for the Geass may have been inspired by the Irish and Welsh legends of \"[[Geas]]\" or \"Geis\". A geas is a compulsion laid on someone to do or not do something. While the geas itself does not lie on any spectrum, the benefits or actions of it may be decidedly benevolent or malevolent. The concept fits in into the wider fictional world and its lore of British inspirations.\n\nClamp's finalized original character design art, illustrated by its lead artist [[Mokona]], was subsequently converted into animation character designs for the series by Sunrise's character designer [[Takahiro Kimura]], who had previously spent \"every day\" analyzing Clamp's art and style from their artbooks and manga series.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> In working on the animation character designs, he focused on designing them so as to enable the series' other animators to apply them without deviating from Clamp's original art style.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/>\n\nThe music for the series was composed by [[K\u014dtar\u014d Nakagawa]] and Hitomi Kuroishi, who had earlier worked with the series' core staff in ''Planetes'' and Taniguchi's earlier work ''[[Gun X Sword]]''. In addition to the [[incidental music]] featured in each episode, Kuroishi also composed numerous insert songs for the series, including \"Stories\", \"Masquerade\", \"Alone\", and \"Innocent Days\", which were each performed by Kuroishi herself, while \"Picaresque\" and \"Callin'\" were performed by the singer-songwriter [[Mikio Sakai]], who had also earlier worked with Nakagawa and Kuroishi in ''Planetes''. The bands [[Flow (Japanese band)|FLOW]], [[Ali Project]], [[Jinn (band)|Jinn]], [[SunSet Swish]], [[Access (group)|Access]], and [[Orange Range]] have provided songs for the opening and ending themes.<ref name=\"offsite-cd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geass.jp/cd.html|script-title=ja:\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ae\u30a2\u30b9 \u53cd\u9006\u306e\u30eb\u30eb\u30fc\u30b7\u30e5 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306031842/http://www.geass.jp/cd.html|archive-date=2007-03-06|url-status=dead}}<!--https://web.archive.org/20090618055424/http://www.geass.jp/cd.html--></ref><ref name=\"flowwe-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flow.mu/07/news/detail.php|title=8/13 New Single\uff62World End\uff63\u767a\u58f2\u6c7a\u5b9a!!|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323145627/http://www.flow.mu/07/news/detail.php|archive-date=2008-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhen the series was being developed for broadcast on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], it had been given the network's Saturday evening prime time slot, which was later changed to a Thursday [[late night anime|late night time]] slot.

Despite the wide variety of mecha designed and prominently featuring in the show, fans of ''Code Geass'' are of a wide variety and not always attracted purely to the Knightmare combat scenes. [[Anime News Network]]'s columnist Todd Ciolek attributes the soaring popularity of ''Code Geass'' to \"the series hitting every important fan sector\", with the audience appeal points ranging from a \"complex cast of characters and a fast-paced story, told with Goro Taniguchi's capable direction\" for \"general-interest fans\" to \"pretty and just-a-little-broken heroes\" for \"[[yaoi]]-buying female fans\".<ref name=\"ANN_TC_XB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2008-08-13|title=The X Button: Revolutionary Jargon|author=Ciolek, Todd|website=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2008-08-13|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> Carl Kimlinger also finds that the series \"has the skill and energy to carry viewers over the top with it, where they can spend a pleasurable few hours reveling in its melodramatic charms.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion/dvd-1 |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD 1-2 \u2013 Review |website=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref> He also adds that Taniguchi \"executes the excesses of his series with care, skillfully intercutting events as Lelouch's plans come together (or fall apart) and using kinetic mecha combat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass/lelouch-of-the-rebellion/dvd-part-3 |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD Part 3 \u2013 Review |website=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref>\n\nT.H.E.M.

Critics have praised the series for its narrative, characters, strong voice acting, large audience appeal as well as the cross conflicts shown among the main characters and the moral questions presented.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{See also|List of Code Geass characters}}\n\n===Setting===\n<!-- Please do not add 55 years differences - official date is 2017 a.t.b. as Revolution Year 228. Revolution Year is started on Storming of the Bastille, 2017-228=1789. -->\nIn an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative timeline]], the world is divided into three [[superpower]]s: the Holy Britannian Empire (the Americas; also called Britannia), the Chinese Federation (Asia), and the [[United States of Europe|European Union]] (Europe and Africa; previously known as the Euro-Universe, also known as Europa United in ''Akito the Exiled''). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the \"Autonomous Armored Knight\", or \"Knightmare Frame\". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.\n\n===Plot===\n[[Lelouch vi Britannia]] is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor [[Charles zi Britannia]] and his royal consort [[Marianne vi Britannia]]. Lelouch has a sister, [[Nunnally vi Britannia]]. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind eye to their mother's death and failing to pursue their mother's killer.\n\nLelouch and Nunnally are sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend [[Suzaku Kururugi]] that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.\n\nSeven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called [[C.C. (Code Geass)|C.C.]] (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as {{nihongo|Geass|\u30ae\u30a2\u30b9|Giasu}}. This power, also known as the {{nihongo|\"Power of Kings\"|\u738b\u306e\u529b|\u014c no Chikara}}, allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf.  This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. However, this does not come without a cost. Caught up in a conflict where he does not know the full extent of his powers, Lelouch will have to battle Suzaku, a resistance member named [[Kallen Stadtfeld]], the strongest army in the world, his own half-siblings, and many others in a battle that will forever change the world.\n\n==Production==\n''Code Geass'' began as a concept developed at Sunrise by [[Ichir\u014d \u014ckouchi]] and [[Gor\u014d Taniguchi]], who proposed it to producer Yoshitaka Kawaguchi. Kawaguchi had previously approached Okouchi and Taniguchi during the production of ''[[Planetes]]''.<ref name=\"\u014dkouchi-interview\">{{cite news|title=Interview with Ichir\u014d \u014ckouchi|work=Code Geass DVD Volume 1|publisher=[[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]}}</ref> The basic idea for the plot consisted of a \"hero\" who led a secret organization, which was later developed into a conflict between two characters with different values and who belonged to the same military unit, who eventually became [[Lelouch Lamperouge]] and [[Suzaku Kururugi]].<ref name=\"\u014dkouchi-interview\" />\n\nDuring these initial planning stages, Kawaguchi also contacted the noted [[Mangaka|manga artist]] group [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]].<ref name=\"\u014dkouchi-interview\"/> This was the first time Clamp had ever been requested to design the characters of an anime series.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\">{{cite news|title=Interview with Gor\u014d Taniguchi and [[Nanase Ohkawa|Ageha \u014ckawa]], head writer of [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]]|work=[[Newtype]], May 2007 issue}}</ref> Clamp signed onto the project early during these development stages and provided numerous ideas, which helped develop the series' setting and characters.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/>\n\nWhile developing the character designs for Lelouch, the protagonist of the series, Clamp had originally conceived of his hair color as being white.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> [[Nanase Ohkawa|Ageha Ohkawa]], head writer at Clamp, said she had visualized him as being a character to which \"everyone\" could relate to as being \"cool\", literally, a \"beauty\".<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> During these planning stages, Clamp and the Sunrise staff had discussed a number of possible inspirations for the characters, including [[KinKi Kids]] and [[Tackey & Tsubasa]].<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> They had wanted to create a \"hit show,\" a series which would appeal to \"everyone.\"<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> Lelouch's alter ego, Zero, was one of the earliest developed characters, with \u014ckouchi having wanted a mask to be included as a part of the series, feeling it was necessary for it to be a Sunrise show, and Clamp wanting a unique design never prior seen in any Sunrise series (said mask was nicknamed \"[[tulip]]\" for its distinctive design).<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/>\n\nThe concept for the Geass may have been inspired by the Irish and Welsh legends of \"[[Geas]]\" or \"Geis\". A geas is a compulsion laid on someone to do or not do something. While the geas itself does not lie on any spectrum, the benefits or actions of it may be decidedly benevolent or malevolent. The concept fits in into the wider fictional world and its lore of British inspirations.\n\nClamp's finalized original character design art, illustrated by its lead artist [[Mokona]], was subsequently converted into animation character designs for the series by Sunrise's character designer [[Takahiro Kimura]], who had previously spent \"every day\" analyzing Clamp's art and style from their artbooks and manga series.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/> In working on the animation character designs, he focused on designing them so as to enable the series' other animators to apply them without deviating from Clamp's original art style.<ref name=\"taniguchi-\u014dkawa-interview\"/>\n\nThe music for the series was composed by [[K\u014dtar\u014d Nakagawa]] and Hitomi Kuroishi, who had earlier worked with the series' core staff in ''Planetes'' and Taniguchi's earlier work ''[[Gun X Sword]]''. In addition to the [[incidental music]] featured in each episode, Kuroishi also composed numerous insert songs for the series, including \"Stories\", \"Masquerade\", \"Alone\", and \"Innocent Days\", which were each performed by Kuroishi herself, while \"Picaresque\" and \"Callin'\" were performed by the singer-songwriter [[Mikio Sakai]], who had also earlier worked with Nakagawa and Kuroishi in ''Planetes''. The bands [[Flow (Japanese band)|FLOW]], [[Ali Project]], [[Jinn (band)|Jinn]], [[SunSet Swish]], [[Access (group)|Access]], and [[Orange Range]] have provided songs for the opening and ending themes.<ref name=\"offsite-cd\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geass.jp/cd.html|script-title=ja:\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9\u30ae\u30a2\u30b9 \u53cd\u9006\u306e\u30eb\u30eb\u30fc\u30b7\u30e5 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8|language=Japanese|accessdate=2007-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306031842/http://www.geass.jp/cd.html|archive-date=2007-03-06|url-status=dead}}<!--https://web.archive.org/20090618055424/http://www.geass.jp/cd.html--></ref><ref name=\"flowwe-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flow.mu/07/news/detail.php|title=8/13 New Single\uff62World End\uff63\u767a\u58f2\u6c7a\u5b9a!!|language=Japanese|accessdate=2008-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323145627/http://www.flow.mu/07/news/detail.php|archive-date=2008-03-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhen the series was being developed for broadcast on [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], it had been given the network's Saturday evening prime time slot, which was later changed to a Thursday [[late night anime|late night time]] slot.

Despite the wide variety of mecha designed and prominently featuring in the show, fans of ''Code Geass'' are of a wide variety and not always attracted purely to the Knightmare combat scenes. [[Anime News Network]]'s columnist Todd Ciolek attributes the soaring popularity of ''Code Geass'' to \"the series hitting every important fan sector\", with the audience appeal points ranging from a \"complex cast of characters and a fast-paced story, told with Goro Taniguchi's capable direction\" for \"general-interest fans\" to \"pretty and just-a-little-broken heroes\" for \"[[yaoi]]-buying female fans\".<ref name=\"ANN_TC_XB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2008-08-13|title=The X Button: Revolutionary Jargon|author=Ciolek, Todd|website=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2008-08-13|accessdate=2008-08-13}}</ref> Carl Kimlinger also finds that the series \"has the skill and energy to carry viewers over the top with it, where they can spend a pleasurable few hours reveling in its melodramatic charms.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass-lelouch-of-the-rebellion/dvd-1 |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD 1-2 \u2013 Review |website=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref> He also adds that Taniguchi \"executes the excesses of his series with care, skillfully intercutting events as Lelouch's plans come together (or fall apart) and using kinetic mecha combat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/code-geass/lelouch-of-the-rebellion/dvd-part-3 |title=Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion DVD Part 3 \u2013 Review |website=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref>\n\nT.H.E.M.

It supported her successful fourth studio [[album]] ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'' (1989), and the [[soundtrack album]] to the 1990 film ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[I'm Breathless]]'' (1990). Originally planned to be called \"Like a Prayer World Tour\", it was supposed to be sponsored by [[soft drink]] manufacturer [[Pepsi]], whom Madonna signed a deal with. After the release of the accompanying [[music video]] for the [[Single (music)|single]] \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\", which featured Catholic symbols such as stigmata, [[Cross burning|burning crosses]] and a dream about making love to a saint, [[Holy See|the Vatican]] condemned it. Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and called for a boycott of Pepsi products and subsidiaries, leading the company to revoke the commercial and cancel Madonna's sponsorship contract. The Blond Ambition World Tour was officially announced by [[Sire Records]] on November 1989. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine included the tour on the list of the best tours of the past 50 years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weingarten |first1=Christopher R. |title=The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-50-greatest-concerts-of-the-last-50-years-127062/madonna-blond-ambition-tour-194233/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |date=June 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe concert was divided into five segments: ''Metropolis'', inspired by the 1927 [[German expressionism|German expressionist]] film of the [[Metropolis (1927 film)|same name]] and the \"[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]\" music video; ''Religious'', by [[Religion|religious themes]]; ''Dick Tracy'', by the film of the same name and [[cabaret]]; ''[[Art Deco]]'' was inspired by early [[Hollywood]] films using the works of Polish artist [[Tamara de Lempicka]], and the fifth was an encore. The art direction was developed by Madonna's brother [[Christopher Ciccone]], while the costumes were created by French fashion designer [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]]. The tour garnered positive appreciation from contemporary critics and commercial success. It received the \"Most Creative Stage Production\" at the [[Pollstar|Pollstar Concert Industry Awards]] and grossed over US$62.7&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|62.7|r=2|1990}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from 57 concerts. Additionally, Madonna was named the second most successful solo touring act at the time, only behind American singer [[Michael Jackson]].\n\nDue to its sexual and Catholic imagery, the tour generated controversy; in Italy, several Religious organizations protested and condemned it as well as Madonna, with [[Pope John Paul II]] urging the general public and the Christian community not to attend the tour, calling it \"one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity\". The protests were successful and one of three planned Italian dates was cancelled. In Toronto, the police was alerted about \"lewd\" and \"indecent\" content, particularly the performance of \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\", which featured Madonna laying on a red velvet bed, flanked by two male dancers, simulating [[masturbation]]. Madonna and her team were threatened with charges unless that specific part was changed; the show went on unaltered.\n\nA number of concerts were recorded and broadcast. The last concert from the tour in [[Nice, France]], was recorded and broadcast as a special on [[HBO]]; afterwards it was released on [[Laserdisc]], under the title ''[[Blond Ambition World Tour Live]]''. Additionally, one of the concerts in [[Japan]] was recorded and released on [[VHS]] and Laserdisc exclusively in that country. In 1991, a documentary film, ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare]]'' (''In Bed with Madonna''), was released chronicling the tour. The Blond Ambition World Tour has been noted by critics and authors for its theatricality and fashion, which have left its mark on the work of subsequent pop acts.\n\n==Background==\nIn January 1989, [[PepsiCo|Pepsi-Cola]] announced that they had signed a [[United States dollar|US$]]5&nbsp;million deal with Madonna to feature her and her then upcoming single \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\" on a [[Television advertisement|television commercial]] for the company.<ref name=\"tarap\">{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=172}}</ref> The deal also included Pepsi sponsoring Madonna's next [[concert tour|world tour]], announced then as the \"Like a Prayer World Tour\".<ref>{{harvnb|Bignell|2007|p=123}}</ref><ref name=\"People25\">{{cite web |last1=Mackie |first1=Drew |title=25 Reasons Madonna's Blond Ambition Tour Still Rules, 25 Years Later |url=https://people.com/celebrity/madonnas-blond-ambition-tour-25-years-later/ |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=September 14, 2019 |date=April 3, 2015}}</ref> Madonna wanted to use the commercial to launch the song globally before its actual release \u2014the first time something like this was being done in the music industry.

It supported her successful fourth studio [[album]] ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'' (1989), and the [[soundtrack album]] to the 1990 film ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[I'm Breathless]]'' (1990). Originally planned to be called \"Like a Prayer World Tour\", it was supposed to be sponsored by [[soft drink]] manufacturer [[Pepsi]], whom Madonna signed a deal with. After the release of the accompanying [[music video]] for the [[Single (music)|single]] \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\", which featured Catholic symbols such as stigmata, [[Cross burning|burning crosses]] and a dream about making love to a saint, [[Holy See|the Vatican]] condemned it. Religious groups sought to ban the commercial and called for a boycott of Pepsi products and subsidiaries, leading the company to revoke the commercial and cancel Madonna's sponsorship contract. The Blond Ambition World Tour was officially announced by [[Sire Records]] on November 1989. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine included the tour on the list of the best tours of the past 50 years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Weingarten |first1=Christopher R. |title=The 50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-50-greatest-concerts-of-the-last-50-years-127062/madonna-blond-ambition-tour-194233/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |date=June 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe concert was divided into five segments: ''Metropolis'', inspired by the 1927 [[German expressionism|German expressionist]] film of the [[Metropolis (1927 film)|same name]] and the \"[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]\" music video; ''Religious'', by [[Religion|religious themes]]; ''Dick Tracy'', by the film of the same name and [[cabaret]]; ''[[Art Deco]]'' was inspired by early [[Hollywood]] films using the works of Polish artist [[Tamara de Lempicka]], and the fifth was an encore. The art direction was developed by Madonna's brother [[Christopher Ciccone]], while the costumes were created by French fashion designer [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]]. The tour garnered positive appreciation from contemporary critics and commercial success. It received the \"Most Creative Stage Production\" at the [[Pollstar|Pollstar Concert Industry Awards]] and grossed over US$62.7&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|62.7|r=2|1990}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from 57 concerts. Additionally, Madonna was named the second most successful solo touring act at the time, only behind American singer [[Michael Jackson]].\n\nDue to its sexual and Catholic imagery, the tour generated controversy; in Italy, several Religious organizations protested and condemned it as well as Madonna, with [[Pope John Paul II]] urging the general public and the Christian community not to attend the tour, calling it \"one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity\". The protests were successful and one of three planned Italian dates was cancelled. In Toronto, the police was alerted about \"lewd\" and \"indecent\" content, particularly the performance of \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\", which featured Madonna laying on a red velvet bed, flanked by two male dancers, simulating [[masturbation]]. Madonna and her team were threatened with charges unless that specific part was changed; the show went on unaltered.\n\nA number of concerts were recorded and broadcast. The last concert from the tour in [[Nice, France]], was recorded and broadcast as a special on [[HBO]]; afterwards it was released on [[Laserdisc]], under the title ''[[Blond Ambition World Tour Live]]''. Additionally, one of the concerts in [[Japan]] was recorded and released on [[VHS]] and Laserdisc exclusively in that country.

The series is characterized by dynamic and exciting football moves, often stylish and implausible. The plot focuses on Tsubasa's relationship with his friends, rivalry with his opponents, training, competition and the action and outcome of each football match. Across the multiple ''Captain Tsubasa'' mangas, the plot shows Tsubasa's and his friends' growth as they face new rivals. Takahashi decided to create ''Captain Tsubasa'' inspired by [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Argentina]].\n\nThe ''Captain Tsubasa'' manga series was originally serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' comic book magazine between 1981 and 1988, spanning a total of 37 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. This was followed by numerous sequels.

The original ''Captain Tsubasa'' manga series was adapted into a TV [[anime|animation]] series, produced by [[Tsuchida Production]], whose first season premiered in Japan on the [[TV Tokyo]] network between October 10, 1983 and March 27, 1986. Numerous movies and television series have followed with the latest one airing between April 2, 2018 and April 1, 2019.\n\n''Captain Tsubasa'' became into one of the most memorable manga and anime worldwide, most notably in Japan due to how it popularized association football. Multiple real life players have been inspired to become professionals after seeing the series. In a poll conducted by TV Asahi in 2005, the ''Captain Tsubasa'' anime series ranked 41 in a list of top 100 anime series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-09-23/tv-asahi-top-100-anime|title=TV Asahi Top 100 Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n{{see also|List of Captain Tsubasa characters}}\n\n=== ''Captain Tsubasa'' ===\nTsubasa Oozora is an 11-year-old elementary school student who is deeply in love with football and dreams of one day winning the [[FIFA World Cup]] for [[Japan national football team|Japan]]. He lives together with his mother in Japan, while his father is a seafaring captain who travels around the world. Tsubasa is known as the ''Soccer no Moshigo'' which translates as \"heaven-sent child of football\". When he was only barely a year old, he was almost run over by a rushing bus while playing with a ball. However, Tsubasa held the ball in front of him which served as a cushion for most of the impact. The force of the bump blew him away, but he was able to right himself with the ball. Hence, Tsubasa's motto of \"The ball is my friend\". Ever since he was little, he always went out with a ball. His mother concludes that he was indeed born to only play football. At a very young age, Tsubasa already had amazing speed, stamina, dribbling skills and shotpower \u2013 he astounded anyone who saw him play.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, Tsubasa and his mom both move to the city of Nankatsu, a [[fictional town]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] well known for their talented elementary school football teams and where Tsubasa meets Ryo Ishizaki, a football-loving young student who often sneaks out from his mother's public bath houses and chores to play football. He meets Sanae Nakazawa (also known as Anego) an enthusiastic girl who also loves football and helps cheer the Nankatsu high school team on and Genzo Wakabayashi, a highly talented young [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] whom he soon challenges to a game in Nankatsu's annual sports festival. He also meets Roberto Hongo, one of the best [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian]] footballers in the world who is a friend of Tsubasa's father and who starts living with Tsubasa and his mother in order to train Tsubasa. Roberto becomes a mentor to Tsubasa and helps him to harness his football skills, convincing him to join Nankatsu Elementary School and its fledgling elementary school football team, which Roberto later coaches as he passes his techniques onto Tsubasa.\n\nTsubasa meets Taro Misaki, who has travelled around Japan due to his father's job and soon joins Nankatsu. The two become the best of friends on the pitch and real life, forming a partnership soon to be renowned as the \"Golden Duo\" or \"dynamic duo\" of Nankatsu. Soon Tsubasa and his Nankatsu team start taking on the best of elementary school football, meeting such talented players as Kojiro Hyuga, Ken Wakashimazu, Jun Misugi, Hikaru Matsuyama and many others. Tsubasa's Nankatsu squad wins numerous youth national championships and he wins the [[FIFA U-17 World Cup|U-17 World Championships]] for [[Japan national under-17 football team|Japan]], before leaving the country to play in Brazil.\n\n=== ''World Youth'' ===\nTsubasa leaves Japan for Brazil and starts playing, with his mentor Roberto as the manager, for [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starcomics.com/manga_popup.php?id=2614 |title=Captain Tsubasa ~ World youth volume 2 |publisher=[[Star Comics (Italy)|Star Comics]] |language=it |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007043815/http://www.starcomics.com/manga_popup.php?id=2614 |archivedate=October 7, 2007 }}</ref> (F.C.

While in Brazil, Tsubasa gets to meet several talented Brazilian players, such as his teammate and roommate Pepe, who comes from a humble background, as well Flamengo star striker Carlos Santana, a prodigious yet emotionless talent.\n\nEnthusiastic football-loving youngster Shingo Aoi, whom Tsubasa once played against while in the high school national championships, leaves Japan to play football in Italy, where he hopes to play for a major Italian professional team. After arriving in Italy, however, Shingo gets tricked by a man who gives him fraudulent promises of getting him selected for an Italian team. After Shingo is taken to a badly furnished field, the man runs away, stealing all his money. Shingo realizes that he is swindled and tries hard to get his money back, doing such jobs as shoe-shining, until his enthusiastic attitude catches the eye of one of the coaches of [[Inter Milan Youth Sector|Inter Milan]] (Intina in the anime), who sign him to play for their squad as an attacking midfielder.\n\nThe [[Japan national under-20 football team|Japan's youth side]] plays the first phase of [[AFC U-19 Championship|AFC Youth Championship]] without Taro Misaki, Makoto Soda, Hiroshi Jito, Shun Nitta, the Tachibana brothers Masao and Kazuo and Kojiro Hyuga.

In the quarterfinals, they beat [[Sweden national under-20 football team|Sweden]] 1\u20130 and [[Netherlands national under-20 football team|Netherlands]] 1\u20130 in the semifinal. The Japanese win in the \"Great Final\" the World Youth Championship, defeating [[Brazil national under-20 football team|Brazil]] 3\u20132 after extra time with Tsubasa scoring a [[hat-trick]] and the [[golden goal]] despite the fact that Brazil used a new player at the extra time called Natureza, who became the third person to score a [[goal]] on Wakabayashi from outside the goal area \u2013 the first being Karl Heinz Schneider of Germany and second being Sho Shunko of China.\n\nTsubasa moves from S\u00e3o Paulo to [[FC Barcelona]]<ref name=\"barcelona\"/> (FC Catalunya in the anime), in the Spanish [[La Liga|Liga]], after the end of the FIFA World Youth Championship final, taking his childhood friend and now wife, Sanae.

Juventus coach Carlo Monetti replaces him with [[David Trezeguet]] (David Tresaga in the anime), who scores the winning goal as Juventus beat Parma 1\u20130.\n\nIn Germany, Genzo Wakabayashi<ref name=\"AnimaxIndia\"/> and his [[Bundesliga]] team, [[Hamburger SV]] (Grunwald in the anime version), play against [[FC Bayern Munich]] (Routburg in the anime version), led by Karl Heinz Schneider. Wakabayashi makes many great saves, impressing players and coaches from both teams, but in an attempt to win at the final moment despite the coach's decision to aim for a draw, Wakabayashi left the goal area to take a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] shot that was stopped at the last second, which gave Bayern a chance to counterattack on an undefended goal, allowing them to win 2\u20131.\n\nIn Spain, the Liga begins and the match between Barcelona (led by Rivaul) and [[Valencia CF]] (San Jose in the anime) (who have just bought Tsubasa's old rival Carlos Santana) ends 2\u20132.

Meanwhile, Tsubasa's wife Sanae informs him that she is pregnant. In Japan, the match with Denmark ends 4\u20132 with the following scorers: Misaki (J), Haas (D), Nitta (J), Nitta (J), Matsuyama (J) and Haas (D). In Germany, Hamburger SV plays a Bundesliga match and Genzo Wakabayashi is not in the line up because of the bad relationship with the coach Zeeman, starting rumors that Wakabayashi would leave Hamburger. A lot of teams were interested in signing Wakabayashi such us [[ACF Fiorentina]], [[A.S. Roma]], Bayern Munich and [[SV Werder Bremen]].\n\nMeanwhile, Minato Gamo wants to convince Igawa, a player who can play in all the roles ([[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], [[defender (association football)|defender]], [[midfielder]] and [[forward (association football)|forward]]), to join the national team. Also in Spain, Barcelona plays a league match against [[Real Betis]] and Tsubasa scores two goals and makes an assist for Rikaar. In Japan, Wakabayashi joins the national team.\n\nThe match between Japan and Nigeria begins and Nigeria plays very well, as it has two champions Ochado (who plays in [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris SG]], based on [[Jay-Jay Okocha]]) and Bobang (who plays with Shingo Aoi in Albese). After some minutes from the beginning of the match, Nigeria has the first great opportunity to score the first goal in the match with a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]], but the Japanese goalkeeper Genzo Wakabayashi saves in [[corner kick]]. Wakabayashi saves another shot and makes an assist for Ken Wakashimazu, who scores a goal with an [[Bicycle kick|overhead kick]]. However, Nigeria scores two goals with Bobang and Ochado. At the end of the first half, Nigeria is winning 2\u20131. Meanwhile, Minato Gamo convinces Gakuto Igawa to join the national team. The second half begins, the Japan attacks during the injury time Misaki scores the equalizing goal. The match ends 2\u20132.\n\nIn Spain, Barcelona wins 3\u20132 the match against Valencia led by Carlos Santana. In Japan, the match between Japan and [[Paraguay national under-23 football team|Paraguay]] ends 3\u20130 with the following scorers: Gakuto, Wakashimazu and Nitta. In Spain, Barcelona plays against [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] and Fersio Torres (inspired by [[Fernando Torres]]) quickly scores a goal. However, Barcelona replies quickly and Tsubasa scores two goals.\n\nThe Asia qualifications begins and Japan beats [[Malaysia national under-23 football team|Malaysia]] (6-0 for the first match and 5\u20130 for the return match), [[Thailand national under-23 football team|Thailand]] (2\u20130 for the first match, 3\u20130 for the return match) and [[Bahrain national under-23 football team|Bahrain]] (3\u20130 for the first match and 5-0 for the return match) and qualifies to the third round. In the third round, Japan beats [[Vietnam national under-23 football team|Vietnam]] 5\u20130, draws against [[Saudi Arabia national under-23 football team|Saudi Arabia]] 1-1 and loses against [[Australia national under-23 soccer team|Australia]] 3\u20131. Standings after day 3 (of 6): Australia 9, Japan and Saudi Arabia 4 and Vietnam 0. Only the first classified is admitted to [[Olympic Games]].

Standings after day 5 (of 6): Australia 13, Japan 10, Saudi Arabia 5 and Vietnam 0. In the last day, Japan plays against Australia (had Japan defeated Australia 3\u20130, 4\u20131, 5\u20132 and 6\u20133 or more, it would have qualified to Olympic Games, while had Japan won 3\u20131, 4\u20132, 5\u20133 or such, it would have played a playoff against Australia. Japan scores the first goal of the match against Australia, thanks to Tachibana brothers. However, the Tachibana brothers get injured and are substituted by Wakashimazu and Nitta, who scores another goal. Japan tries to score the third goal, but all their shots hit the bar or are saved by the goalkeeper. In the second half, Australia scores the goal of 2\u20131, but Japan reacts and scores two goals (scorers: Igawa and Misaki). Japan ultimately wins 4\u20131 and qualifies to Olympic Games.\n\n=== ''Kaigai Gekito Hen'' ===\n==== Italy ====\n[[One-shot (comics)|One-shot]] released in Japan in 2009, which comprises 24 chapters. This one-shot tells the [[Lega Pro|Serie C1]] final season match between Reggiana and Albese, with both teams directly vying for promotion. This match is the challenge between Kojiro Hyuga (Reggiana) and Shingo Aoi (Albese). Hyuga scores two goals in the first half, showing to be strongly improved in physical game. However, in the second half, Albese reacts and scores two goals. Hyuga eventually scores the victory goal in the last minute, allowing his team to be promoted into Serie B. Albese is disappointed for its defeat because they wrongly think that [[U.C. AlbinoLeffe]] won against [[Ravenna F.C.|Ravenna F.C]] and overtook them in standings. However, Albinoleffe lost 2\u20131 to Ravenna, tying both teams in third place, and this means that both Reggiana (1st) and Albese (2nd) are promoted. Both teams celebrate their promotion.\n\n==== Spain ====\nThis one-shot started in February 2010, in order to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary. It tells the return match between Barcelona and Real Madrid.

Tsubasa scores the draw goal with a flying drive shot in the added time and the match ends 2\u20132.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Y\u014dichi Takahashi - Lucca Comics & Games 2011.jpg|thumb|Author Y\u014dichi Takahashi was inspired to write ''Captain Tsubasa'' after watching the 1978 FIFA World Cup.<ref name=as>{{cite web|url=https://en.as.com/en/2016/12/17/football/1481991686_215388.html|title=Cristiano and Messi are more fantastical than Ozora Tsubasa|publisher=AS|accessdate=December 30, 2018}}</ref>]]\nYoichi Takahashi was delighted by association football after seeing the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. The matches, players and fans' love towards the sport inspired him to write a manga about football.<ref name=\"interview\"/> Another relevant aspect on this decision was the fact that Takahashi liked football more than baseball because he considered the players to have more freedom during matches.<ref name=as/> Despite football not being popular in Japan, Takahashi aimed to depict it through his manga and to reach the general public.<ref name=\"interview\"/> Because of the non-popularity of the subject, getting the approval to write the manga by its publisher, [[Shueisha]], took between 2 and 3 years, which was also difficult since it was his first manga.<ref name=\"as\"/> Rather than using professional players, the manga author instead used children as protagonists, hoping readers would identify themselves with the cast. Nevertheless, Takahashi already had in mind that through the series the main characters would grow up and become professionals.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=https://elcomercio.pe/mundo/actualidad/supercampeones-yoichi-takahashi-oliver-hospital-leyenda-real-noticia-460340|title=Eso de Oliver en un hospital es una leyenda, no es real|publisher=El Comercio|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the making of the cast, Takahashi designed multiple characters with different traits in order to deliver multiple traits that would serve as obstacles for Tsubasa to surpass. The large number of characters made Takahashi careful with their designs and he wanted to give each of them recognizable features. One of Tsubasa's early rivals, Jun Misugi, was given skills that surpassed the protagonist's. As a result, he gave Misugi a heart condition that would balance the match between their teams. When asked why Tsubasa's teams always win, Takahashi stated it was because he aims the manga to be long and thus a defeat would reduce its length.<ref name=\"interview\"/> While the series was initially aimed at children, Takahashi was surprised at how, across the years, it has also attracted adults, as well as at the impact it had on Japan's football. When talking about its themes, Takahashi stated the main one is honor, which is meant to be superior than money, something which people value more.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nAs Takahashi liked European football due to its competitive level, he decided to make Tsubasa leave S\u00e3o Paulo and join Spain's [[F.C. Barcelona]] at the age of 21. In 1998, Takahashi traveled to Barcelona and enjoyed the [[Camp Nou]] stadium so much that he was inspired by it to make the Barcelona team Tsubasa's future team. Nevertheless, Takahashi asserted it was a decision taken at random and joked that Tsubasa would have joined the Real Madrid if he had visited [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2009/08/04/370078/el-creador-de-oliver-y-benji-apoya-a-los-jjoo-tokio-2016.html|title=El creador de Oliver y Benji apoya a los JJ.OO.

The series is characterized by dynamic and exciting football moves, often stylish and implausible. The plot focuses on Tsubasa's relationship with his friends, rivalry with his opponents, training, competition and the action and outcome of each football match. Across the multiple ''Captain Tsubasa'' mangas, the plot shows Tsubasa's and his friends' growth as they face new rivals. Takahashi decided to create ''Captain Tsubasa'' inspired by [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Argentina]].\n\nThe ''Captain Tsubasa'' manga series was originally serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' comic book magazine between 1981 and 1988, spanning a total of 37 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes. This was followed by numerous sequels. ''Captain Tsubasa'' and its sequels have sold over 80 million copies worldwide,<ref>[https://entertainmentstation.jp/77804] entertainment station (2017.05.08)</ref> making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]]. The original ''Captain Tsubasa'' manga series was adapted into a TV [[anime|animation]] series, produced by [[Tsuchida Production]], whose first season premiered in Japan on the [[TV Tokyo]] network between October 10, 1983 and March 27, 1986. Numerous movies and television series have followed with the latest one airing between April 2, 2018 and April 1, 2019.\n\n''Captain Tsubasa'' became into one of the most memorable manga and anime worldwide, most notably in Japan due to how it popularized association football. Multiple real life players have been inspired to become professionals after seeing the series. In a poll conducted by TV Asahi in 2005, the ''Captain Tsubasa'' anime series ranked 41 in a list of top 100 anime series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-09-23/tv-asahi-top-100-anime|title=TV Asahi Top 100 Anime|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=April 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n{{see also|List of Captain Tsubasa characters}}\n\n=== ''Captain Tsubasa'' ===\nTsubasa Oozora is an 11-year-old elementary school student who is deeply in love with football and dreams of one day winning the [[FIFA World Cup]] for [[Japan national football team|Japan]]. He lives together with his mother in Japan, while his father is a seafaring captain who travels around the world. Tsubasa is known as the ''Soccer no Moshigo'' which translates as \"heaven-sent child of football\". When he was only barely a year old, he was almost run over by a rushing bus while playing with a ball. However, Tsubasa held the ball in front of him which served as a cushion for most of the impact. The force of the bump blew him away, but he was able to right himself with the ball. Hence, Tsubasa's motto of \"The ball is my friend\". Ever since he was little, he always went out with a ball. His mother concludes that he was indeed born to only play football. At a very young age, Tsubasa already had amazing speed, stamina, dribbling skills and shotpower \u2013 he astounded anyone who saw him play.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, Tsubasa and his mom both move to the city of Nankatsu, a [[fictional town]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] well known for their talented elementary school football teams and where Tsubasa meets Ryo Ishizaki, a football-loving young student who often sneaks out from his mother's public bath houses and chores to play football. He meets Sanae Nakazawa (also known as Anego) an enthusiastic girl who also loves football and helps cheer the Nankatsu high school team on and Genzo Wakabayashi, a highly talented young [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] whom he soon challenges to a game in Nankatsu's annual sports festival. He also meets Roberto Hongo, one of the best [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian]] footballers in the world who is a friend of Tsubasa's father and who starts living with Tsubasa and his mother in order to train Tsubasa.

The matches, players and fans' love towards the sport inspired him to write a manga about football.<ref name=\"interview\"/> Another relevant aspect on this decision was the fact that Takahashi liked football more than baseball because he considered the players to have more freedom during matches.<ref name=as/> Despite football not being popular in Japan, Takahashi aimed to depict it through his manga and to reach the general public.<ref name=\"interview\"/> Because of the non-popularity of the subject, getting the approval to write the manga by its publisher, [[Shueisha]], took between 2 and 3 years, which was also difficult since it was his first manga.<ref name=\"as\"/> Rather than using professional players, the manga author instead used children as protagonists, hoping readers would identify themselves with the cast. Nevertheless, Takahashi already had in mind that through the series the main characters would grow up and become professionals.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=https://elcomercio.pe/mundo/actualidad/supercampeones-yoichi-takahashi-oliver-hospital-leyenda-real-noticia-460340|title=Eso de Oliver en un hospital es una leyenda, no es real|publisher=El Comercio|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the making of the cast, Takahashi designed multiple characters with different traits in order to deliver multiple traits that would serve as obstacles for Tsubasa to surpass. The large number of characters made Takahashi careful with their designs and he wanted to give each of them recognizable features. One of Tsubasa's early rivals, Jun Misugi, was given skills that surpassed the protagonist's. As a result, he gave Misugi a heart condition that would balance the match between their teams. When asked why Tsubasa's teams always win, Takahashi stated it was because he aims the manga to be long and thus a defeat would reduce its length.<ref name=\"interview\"/> While the series was initially aimed at children, Takahashi was surprised at how, across the years, it has also attracted adults, as well as at the impact it had on Japan's football. When talking about its themes, Takahashi stated the main one is honor, which is meant to be superior than money, something which people value more.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nAs Takahashi liked European football due to its competitive level, he decided to make Tsubasa leave S\u00e3o Paulo and join Spain's [[F.C. Barcelona]] at the age of 21. In 1998, Takahashi traveled to Barcelona and enjoyed the [[Camp Nou]] stadium so much that he was inspired by it to make the Barcelona team Tsubasa's future team. Nevertheless, Takahashi asserted it was a decision taken at random and joked that Tsubasa would have joined the Real Madrid if he had visited [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2009/08/04/370078/el-creador-de-oliver-y-benji-apoya-a-los-jjoo-tokio-2016.html|title=El creador de Oliver y Benji apoya a los JJ.OO.

It was released as the second [[Single (music)|single]] from ''Like a Prayer'' on May 9, 1989, by [[Sire Records]]. \"Express Yourself\" was the first song that Madonna and producer [[Stephen Bray]] collaborated on for ''Like a Prayer''. Written and produced by them, the song was a tribute to American [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. The main inspiration behind the song is female empowerment, urging women never to go for second-best and to always express their inner feelings.\n\n\"Express Yourself\" is an upbeat [[dance-pop]] song that features instrumentation from [[brass]], handclaps and [[Drum machine|drum beats]], while the chorus is backed by the sound of [[saxophone]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomas Erlewine |first1=Stephen |title=Like a Prayer - Madonna |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/like-a-prayer-mw0000198738 |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=6 February 2020}}</ref> The lyrics talk about rejecting material pleasures and only accepting the best for oneself; [[subtext]]s are employed throughout the song. \"Express Yourself\" received positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critic]]s, who applauded the gender equality message of the song and complimented the song for being a hymn to freedom and encouragement to women and all oppressed minorities. Commercially, the single peaked at number two on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became Madonna's sixth number-one hit on the [[European Hot 100 Singles]] chart. It also reached the top of the singles charts in Canada and Switzerland, and the top-five elsewhere.\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]] for \"Express Yourself\", directed by [[David Fincher]], was inspired by the 1927 [[Fritz Lang]] classic film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''. It had a total budget of $5&nbsp;million&nbsp;(${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1989|r=2}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), which made it the most expensive music video made up to then, and currently [[List of most expensive music videos|the third most expensive of all time]]. The video portrayed a city full of tall skyscrapers and railway lines. Madonna played the part of a glamorous lady and chained masochist, with muscular men acting as her workers. In the end, she picks one of them\u2014played by model [[Cameron Alborzian]]\u2014as her date. Critics noted the video's depiction of female sexuality and that Madonna's masculine image in the video was gender-bending.\n\n\"Express Yourself\" has been performed on four of Madonna's [[concert tour]]s and has been covered by the female leads of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', who performed the song in the episode titled \"[[The Power of Madonna]]\". The song and the video are noted for their freedom expression and feminist aspects, and its postmodern nature entranced academics, by resisting definition. It has also left its mark on the work of subsequent pop acts, including the [[Spice Girls]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Lady Gaga]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|quote=\"The message of the song is that people should always say what it is they want. The reason relationships don't work is because they are afraid. That's been my problem in all my relationships. I'm sure people see me as an outspoken person, and for the most part, if I want something I ask for it. But sometimes you feel that if you ask for too much or ask for the wrong thing from someone you care about that that person won't like you. And so you censor yourself. I've been guilty of that in every meaningful relationship I've ever had.

And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think you are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too.\"<ref name=\"mick59\">{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=59}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen\n | filename     = ExpressYourselfSample.ogg\n | title        = 'Express Yourself'\n | description  = A 28 second sample of the song, where Madonna sings the first verse, accompanied by a male voice repeating the last line.

'Cause I got something to say about it, And it goes something like this.\"<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the [[refrain|chorus]] of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first [[verse (popular music)|verse]] of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], \"Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down\", a male voice repeating the last line.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words \"Express yourself\" with background vocals singing \"Hey, hey, hey, hey\" alongside her.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/>\n\nAfter a small saxophone [[break (music)|interlude]], a break-down comes with Madonna singing in a fuller voice, as horns and percussion beats continue. Madonna changes the lyrics at the end to \"express himself\", and after another repetition of the bridge and the intermediate verse, the chorus comes where she changes the lyrics back to the original title. The song ends with the words \"respect yourself\" fading out.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> Set within a simple song structure, \"Express Yourself\" plays with ambiguity through a subtle control of [[harmony]] and the avoidance of diatonic closure. The song appears to be in the key of [[G major]] but its actual composition seems to be written in the key of [[C major]]. But the first note of the melody, \"don't\" in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]], implies the G Dorian mode.<ref name=\"white\">{{harvnb|Whiteley|2000|p=138}}</ref> This is also evident in Madonna's vocal nuance on the words \"express yourself\", which initially centers on G, before moving down a semitone to [[E minor]], the raised 6th in G Dorian.<ref name=\"white\"/> Per the sheet music published by [[Alfred Publishing|Alfred Publishing Co.

Here Madonna is the anti-materialism girl, exhorting her female audiences to respect themselves. That means having a man who loves your head and your heart. If he doesn't treat you right (and here's the revolutionary rhetoric) you're better off on your own.

Behind her, smoke is seen billowing.]]\nThe video opens with the view of a city populated with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears on the back of a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: \"Come on girls, do you believe in love?\" This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pours incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.\n\nWith the beginning of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it from the other side of the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to expose her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.\n\nAs the final verse of the song begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a stalking cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it over her shoulder and it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was and looks up at both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, \"Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind\".\n\n===Reception and analysis===\n[[File:Michael Jackson (20589951783) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=In the center for the photo, a light skinned male with black hair wearing a gold shirt and black pants, has his right hand to his crotch and his left hand held up high.|Madonna's crotch-grabbing in the music video was compared to that of [[Michael Jackson]].]]\nAuthors Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens commented that \"the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending approach associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism.\" They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, leading them to say that \"the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism.\"<ref name=\"fouz26\">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=26}}</ref> However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained to her bed do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes the fact that women can be in control because of their sexual prowess.<ref name=\"fouz26\"/> Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike ''Metropolis'', where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female.<ref name=\"fouz26\"/> Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, ''I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity'', and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk came to the conclusion that \"Express Yourself\" was a smart move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position.<ref>{{harvnb|Gracyk|2001|p=187}}</ref> Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book ''Political Theory for Mortals'', that \"Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Seery|1996|p=38}}</ref> Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of \"[[Michael Jackson]]'s androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity.\" He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=282}}</ref>\n\nMichelle Gibson and Deborah Townsend Meem, authors of ''Femme/Butch'', commended the video for showing a shift in power between the sexes, declaring that \"Madonna assertively claimed all possible gender space like [[Marlene Dietrich]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|Meem|2002|p=155}}</ref> Professor Carol Vernallis noted in her book, ''Experiencing Music Video'' that the diffused light around Madonna in the video was adopted to mimic the diffusion of sound and make the borders around Madonna appear soft, and her body spread outwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Vernallis|2004|p=178}}</ref> In the book ''The 1980s'', authors Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart called \"Express Yourself\" as one of Madonna's most challenging videos. They noted the video for its \"exploitation\" of the male body and sexualizing them as an object of desire. The authors also added that the video \"was a colorful homage to the term [[gaze]], but Madonna is the bearer of it\u2014not men.\" Batchelor explained that the scenes of Madonna performing alone in her room and atop the stairs suggested that she was the object of the gaze, however it seemed to them that she was mocking the movement of the men below. \"She controls the mind of the men below, with a form of siren's song of female empowerment, signalling that the men do move in unison to her song\", Stoddart concluded.<ref>{{harvnb|Batchelor|Stoddart|2007|p=120}}</ref> Elizabeth Edwards, one of the authors of ''Visual Sense: A Cultural Reader'', explained that the shot of Madonna crawling on the floor, while another image of hers watches from a nearby sofa, illustrated the mutation that Madonna's image was undergoing. According to her, Madonna was acting out self-consciousness by \"watching herself\". She concluded by saying, \"'Express Yourself' gives its viewers a whole new series of image references to traditional American gendered and sexual icons\u2014male and female\u2014and a whole new level of irony.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Edwards|Bhaumik|2009|p=266}}</ref> Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss, authors of ''On Fashion'', deconstructed the video for its display of the artificiality of images of gender.<ref>{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|2004|p=176}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani from [[Slant Magazine]] reviewed the video in 2003, and commented that the video \"is the embodiment of 'queer chic', a bombastic masterpiece that heralds Madonna's uncanny ability to use her consumer-driven image to code her feminist politics.\"<ref name=\"100g\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/100-greatest-music-videos/205/page_10|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Ed|date=June 30, 2003|accessdate=July 16, 2011|work=[[Slant Magazine]]}}</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Culture and Power'', Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Coperi\u00e1s Aguilar pointed out the video for its ''chaotic'' texture through the rapid editing of the multiple shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an \"apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation\", she added.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Since [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] has traditionally been associated with the female [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] principle as opposed to male principle of [[cosmos|order]], the video in turn came to be associated with [[dualistic cosmology|duality]] between order/chaos, male/female, good/evil, light/dark etc.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Aguilar also drew parallel between ''Metropolis'' and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work.<ref name=\"aui\"/> However, unlike ''Metropolis'' which portrayed repression of a rebellious [[proletariat]], the chaotic nature of \"Express Yourself\" video showed freedom instead.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Caryn James from ''The New York Times'' added that \"asked about the video, [Madonna] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.'

It was released as the second single from the album on May 9, 1989 by [[Sire Records]]. The song was included on the greatest hits compilation albums ''[[The Immaculate Collection]]'' (1990), and ''[[Celebration (Madonna album)|Celebration]]'' (2009). \"Express Yourself\" was the first song that Madonna and producer [[Stephen Bray]] collaborated on for ''Like a Prayer''. Written and produced by them, the song was a tribute to American [[funk]] and [[soul music|soul]] band [[Sly and the Family Stone]]. The main inspiration behind the song is female empowerment, urging women never to go for second-best and to always express their inner feelings.\n\n\"Express Yourself\" is an upbeat [[dance-pop]] and [[deep funk]] song that features instrumentation from [[brass]], handclaps and [[drum machine|drum beats]], while the chorus is backed by the sound of saxophone and percussion.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomas Erlewine |first1=Stephen |title=Like a Prayer - Madonna |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/like-a-prayer-mw0000198738 |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=6 February 2020}}</ref> The lyrics talk about rejecting material pleasures and only accepting the best for oneself; [[subtext]]s are employed throughout the song. \"Express Yourself\" received positive reviews from critics, who applauded the gender equality message of the song and complimented the song for being a hymn to freedom and encouragement to women and all oppressed minorities. Commercially, the song peaked at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became Madonna's sixth number-one hit on the [[European Hot 100 Singles]] chart. It also reached the top of the singles charts in Canada and Switzerland, and the top five elsewhere.\n\nThe accompanying music video, directed by [[David Fincher]], was inspired by the [[Fritz Lang]] classic film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). It had a total budget of $5&nbsp;million&nbsp;(${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1989|r=2}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), which made it the most expensive music video made up to then, and currently [[List of most expensive music videos|the third most expensive of all time]]. The video portrayed a city full of tall skyscrapers and railway lines. Madonna played the part of a glamorous lady and chained masochist, with muscular men acting as her workers. In the end, she picks one of them\u2014played by model [[Cameron Alborzian]]\u2014as her date. Critics noted the video's depiction of female sexuality and that Madonna's masculine image in the video was gender-bending.\n\n\"Express Yourself\" has been performed on four of Madonna's world tours, and has been covered by the female leads of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', who performed the song in the episode titled \"[[The Power of Madonna]]\". The song and the video are noted for their freedom expression and feminist aspects, and its postmodern nature entranced academics, by resisting definition. It has also left its mark on the work of subsequent pop acts, including the [[Spice Girls]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and [[Lady Gaga]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Quote box|width=30%|quote=\"The message of the song is that people should always say what it is they want. The reason relationships don't work is because they are afraid. That's been my problem in all my relationships. I'm sure people see me as an outspoken person, and for the most part, if I want something I ask for it. But sometimes you feel that if you ask for too much or ask for the wrong thing from someone you care about that that person won't like you. And so you censor yourself. I've been guilty of that in every meaningful relationship I've ever had. The time I learn how not to edit myself will be the time I consider myself a complete adult.\"|source=\u2014Madonna talking to [[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n}}\n\"Express Yourself\" was released as the second single from her fourth studio album, ''[[Like a Prayer (album)|Like a Prayer]]'', on May 9, 1989, with \"[[The Look of Love (Madonna song)|The Look of Love]]\", from the 1987 film soundtrack ''[[Who's That Girl (soundtrack)|Who's That Girl]]'', on its [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> When Madonna started work on ''Like a Prayer'', she considered many options, and thought about the musical direction for it.

And in effect you are chained down by your inability to say what you feel or go after what you want. No matter how in control you think you are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because you choose to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too.\"<ref name=\"mick59\">{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=59}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Composition==\n{{listen\n | filename     = ExpressYourselfSample.ogg\n | title        = 'Express Yourself'\n | description  = A 28 second sample of the song, where Madonna sings the first verse, accompanied by a male voice repeating the last line.

'Cause I got something to say about it, And it goes something like this.\"<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the [[refrain|chorus]] of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first [[verse (popular music)|verse]] of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the [[bridge (music)|bridge]], \"Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down\", a male voice repeating the last line.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words \"Express yourself\" with background vocals singing \"Hey, hey, hey, hey\" alongside her.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/>\n\nAfter a small saxophone [[break (music)|interlude]], a break-down comes with Madonna singing in a fuller voice, as horns and percussion beats continue. Madonna changes the lyrics at the end to \"express himself\", and after another repetition of the bridge and the intermediate verse, the chorus comes where she changes the lyrics back to the original title. The song ends with the words \"respect yourself\" fading out.<ref name=\"rikky1\"/> Set within a simple song structure, \"Express Yourself\" plays with ambiguity through a subtle control of [[harmony]] and the avoidance of diatonic closure. The song appears to be in the key of [[G major]] but its actual composition seems to be written in the key of [[C major]]. But the first note of the melody, \"don't\" in [[B-flat major|B{{music|flat}} major]], implies the G Dorian mode.<ref name=\"white\">{{harvnb|Whiteley|2000|p=138}}</ref> This is also evident in Madonna's vocal nuance on the words \"express yourself\", which initially centers on G, before moving down a semitone to [[E minor]], the raised 6th in G Dorian.<ref name=\"white\"/> Per the sheet music published by [[Alfred Publishing|Alfred Publishing Co. Inc.]], \"Express Yourself\" is set in [[time signature]] of common time, with a [[tempo]] of 120 beats per minute.

They added that the opening line \"Don't go for second best, baby\" transformed the song into a postmodernist anthem.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=223}}</ref> Scholar Sheila Whiteley noted in her book ''Women and Popular Music: Sexuality, Identity, and Subjectivity'', that Madonna's acknowledgement of the pastiche and of being capable of imitating musical style was interesting to her, but given Madonna's ability to manipulate image, the musical exuberance of \"Express Yourself\" did not appear surprising.<ref name=\"white\"/> [[Mark Bego]], author of ''Madonna: Blond Ambition'' declared that \"the song that most reflected the Madonna everyone had come to know and be shocked by was 'Express Yourself'.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bego|2000|p=194}}</ref> O'Brien was impressed with the song, and gave a detailed review:\n<blockquote>\n\"Express Yourself\" is a feminist call-to-arms, complete with muscular brass playing and soulful voice. Here Madonna is the anti-materialism girl, exhorting her female audiences to respect themselves. That means having a man who loves your head and your heart. If he doesn't treat you right (and here's the revolutionary rhetoric) you're better off on your own. Like a female preacher, Madonna emphasizes each word of the chorus, invoking God and the power of orgasm. In parts Cosmo-woman, girl-talk, and swinging dance track, it presages the deliciously declarative stance of \"[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]\" and shows Madonna moving from introspective to survivalist mode.<ref name=\"lucy\"/>\n</blockquote>\nProfessor [[Maury Dean]] wrote in his book ''Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush: A Singles Un-Cyclopedia'', that the main appeal of \"Express Yourself\" lay in its teen appeal, although he understood that at its core, it was addressing a very important issue of female liberation.<ref>{{harvnb|Dean|2003|p=525}}</ref> Kevin Phinney from ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]'' commented that with \"Express Yourself\", Madonna struck out her \"Material Girl\" persona, there by demonstrating once more that no image of hers is concrete.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|last=Whiney|first=Kevin|date=March 22, 1989|accessdate=July 7, 2011|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAD895970EA30B8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title='Like A Prayer' gives Madonna a vehicle for confession}}</ref> Based on the lyrics of the song, Ken Blakely of ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' declared the song as a rare example of good taste and good advice from ''Like a Prayer''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1989-05-18/entertainment/26110319_1_underwear-music-video-madonna|work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|title=Madonna Writhes Again Rock's Siren Flounces Her New Lingerie In 'Express Yourself' Video For Mtv|date=May 18, 1989|accessdate=July 7, 2011|last=Takey|first=Jonathan}}</ref> Andy Goldberg from ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' was impressed with Madonna's vocals on the song, complimenting the soul inlfluences.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/99163067.html?dids=99163067:99163067&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+07%2C+1989&author=Andy+Goldberg&pub=Jerusalem+Post&desc=MADONNA+SAYS+IT+ALL&pqatl=google|title=Madonna Says It All|date=April 7, 1989|accessdate=July 7, 2011|last=Goldberg|first=Andy|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[J.

Fincher liked the concept and it became the main backdrop for the video. In ''Madonna 'Talking': Madonna in Her Own Words'', she commented about the development of the video.\n<blockquote>\nThis one I had the most amount of input. I oversaw everything\u2014the building of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody.

We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of and of all the things we wanted.

I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men\u2014the workers, diligently, methodically working away.<ref name=\"mick\"/>\n</blockquote>\nMadonna mentioned jokingly in a 1990 [[BBC Television]] interview on the program ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'', that the main theme of the video and the cat metaphor represented that \"Pussy rules the world\".<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|BBC Omnibus: Madonna \u2013 Behind the American Dream]]|airdate=August 10, 1990|credits=Presenter:|time=19:29|network=[[BBC Television]]|location=London|transcript=broadcast|season=24|seriesno=|quote=The video means, 'Pussy rules the world!|series=Omnibus|serieslink=Omnibus (UK TV series)}}</ref> She added that the idea of the cat licking the milk and then pour it over, was the director's. \"It's great but believe me I fought him on that.

I'm glad that I gave in to him.\"<ref name=\"mick\">{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=89}}</ref>\n\n===Synopsis===\n[[File:Expressyourselfmusicvideo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Madonna portraying a masculine persona in the music video for \"Express Yourself\".|alt=A blond woman in black coat and pants, holding a monocle to her left eye. Behind her, smoke is seen billowing.]]\nThe video opens with the view of a city populated with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears on the back of a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: \"Come on girls, do you believe in love?\" This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pours incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa and the cat escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers. He becomes nervous hearing her voice and looks down to find one of the workers staring up and looking for the source of the voice.\n\nWith the beginning of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it from the other side of the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to expose her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the worker is shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.\n\nAs the final verse of the song begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a stalking cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it over her shoulder and it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was and looks up at both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, \"Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind\".\n\n===Reception and analysis===\n[[File:Michael Jackson (20589951783) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=In the center for the photo, a light skinned male with black hair wearing a gold shirt and black pants, has his right hand to his crotch and his left hand held up high.|Madonna's crotch-grabbing in the music video was compared to that of [[Michael Jackson]].]]\nAuthors Santiago Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez and Freya Jarman-Ivens commented that \"the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending approach associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism.\" They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, leading them to say that \"the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism.\"<ref name=\"fouz26\">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=26}}</ref> However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained to her bed do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes the fact that women can be in control because of their sexual prowess.<ref name=\"fouz26\"/> Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike ''Metropolis'', where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance in everybody, male or female.<ref name=\"fouz26\"/> Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, ''I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity'', and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk came to the conclusion that \"Express Yourself\" was a smart move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position.<ref>{{harvnb|Gracyk|2001|p=187}}</ref> Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book ''Political Theory for Mortals'', that \"Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Seery|1996|p=38}}</ref> Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of \"[[Michael Jackson]]'s androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity.\" He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.<ref>{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=282}}</ref>\n\nMichelle Gibson and Deborah Townsend Meem, authors of ''Femme/Butch'', commended the video for showing a shift in power between the sexes, declaring that \"Madonna assertively claimed all possible gender space like [[Marlene Dietrich]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Gibson|Meem|2002|p=155}}</ref> Professor Carol Vernallis noted in her book, ''Experiencing Music Video'' that the diffused light around Madonna in the video was adopted to mimic the diffusion of sound and make the borders around Madonna appear soft, and her body spread outwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Vernallis|2004|p=178}}</ref> In the book ''The 1980s'', authors Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart called \"Express Yourself\" as one of Madonna's most challenging videos. They noted the video for its \"exploitation\" of the male body and sexualizing them as an object of desire. The authors also added that the video \"was a colorful homage to the term [[gaze]], but Madonna is the bearer of it\u2014not men.\" Batchelor explained that the scenes of Madonna performing alone in her room and atop the stairs suggested that she was the object of the gaze, however it seemed to them that she was mocking the movement of the men below. \"She controls the mind of the men below, with a form of siren's song of female empowerment, signalling that the men do move in unison to her song\", Stoddart concluded.<ref>{{harvnb|Batchelor|Stoddart|2007|p=120}}</ref> Elizabeth Edwards, one of the authors of ''Visual Sense: A Cultural Reader'', explained that the shot of Madonna crawling on the floor, while another image of hers watches from a nearby sofa, illustrated the mutation that Madonna's image was undergoing. According to her, Madonna was acting out self-consciousness by \"watching herself\". She concluded by saying, \"'Express Yourself' gives its viewers a whole new series of image references to traditional American gendered and sexual icons\u2014male and female\u2014and a whole new level of irony.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Edwards|Bhaumik|2009|p=266}}</ref> Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss, authors of ''On Fashion'', deconstructed the video for its display of the artificiality of images of gender.<ref>{{harvnb|Benstock|Ferriss|2004|p=176}}</ref> Sal Cinquemani from [[Slant Magazine]] reviewed the video in 2003, and commented that the video \"is the embodiment of 'queer chic', a bombastic masterpiece that heralds Madonna's uncanny ability to use her consumer-driven image to code her feminist politics.\"<ref name=\"100g\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/feature/100-greatest-music-videos/205/page_10|title=100 Greatest Music Videos|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|last2=Gonzalez|first2=Ed|date=June 30, 2003|accessdate=July 16, 2011|work=[[Slant Magazine]]}}</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Culture and Power'', Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Coperi\u00e1s Aguilar pointed out the video for its ''chaotic'' texture through the rapid editing of the multiple shots that constituted it. The sudden and continuous changes of camera angles, scenes and the distance and mood seemed to produce an \"apparently incoherent combination of images that offered no stable anchor to provide the whole with a definitive interpretation\", she added.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Since [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] has traditionally been associated with the female [[ontogenesis|ontogenetic]] principle as opposed to male principle of [[cosmos|order]], the video in turn came to be associated with [[dualistic cosmology|duality]] between order/chaos, male/female, good/evil, light/dark etc.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Aguilar also drew parallel between ''Metropolis'' and the music video. Madonna borrowed different phallic symbolism from the film, including the smoke-billowing chimneys, the tall skyscrapers and the oppressive environment of industrial work.<ref name=\"aui\"/> However, unlike ''Metropolis'' which portrayed repression of a rebellious [[proletariat]], the chaotic nature of \"Express Yourself\" video showed freedom instead.<ref name=\"aui\"/> Caryn James from ''The New York Times'' added that \"asked about the video, [Madonna] made a distinction that any honest feminist would respect, however politically incorrect it may seem. 'I have chained myself', she said. 'There wasn't a man that put that chain on me.' You don't have to buy Madonna's next loopy bit of symbolism\u2014'I was chained to my desires'\u2014to believe the feminist subtext she finds in the video. 'I do everything by my own volition. I'm in charge, O.K.' Madonna in chains, though, is far removed from those unfortunate women who don't know that they have options.\"<ref name=\"nyt2\"/> Madonna also complained about the feminist criticisms of her \"crotch-grabbing\", saying that \"if male singers like [[Michael Jackson]] can get away with it, why can't women?\"<ref>{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=50}}</ref>\n\nTheorist [[Douglas Kellner]] further asserted that the video was a feminist critique of male fighting and brutality, with images of the male workers engaged in a boxing match at the end.<ref name=\"kell\"/> According to him, Madonna deliberately appropriated traditional feminine images in the beginning of the video, but contrasted them with her \"crotch-hugging\" male poses near the end, and discordant images of women assuming the male position.<ref name=\"kell\"/> As feminist author [[Susan Bordo]] pointed out, \"it is the postmodern nature of the video that has most entranced academic critics, and its various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bordo|Heywood|2004|p=272}}</ref> At the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]], \"Express Yourself\" was nominated in the categories of [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Editing|Best Editing]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction|Best Direction]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction|Best Art Direction]], winning the last three categories.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_kUaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6888,1746370|title=Paula Abdul Tops Music Video Awards|last=Antczak|first=John|date=September 8, 1989|accessdate=July 16, 2011|work=[[The Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|page=7}}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' also honored the video as the Best Music Video of the year, at their Music Video Awards for 1989.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Peniston Leads Nominees For Billboard Music Video Awards|date=October 17, 1992|journal=Billboard|issn=0006-2510|volume=104|issue=42|pages=79}}</ref> The music video of \"Express Yourself\" is ranked at number one on [[Slant Magazine]]'s \"100 Greatest Music Videos\".<ref name=\"100g\"/> It is also placed at number ten on both ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s \"The 100 Top Music Videos\" and MTV's \"100 Greatest Videos Ever Made\", as well as number three on [[MuchMusic]]'s list of \"Top 100 Videos of The Century\".<ref>{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=90}}</ref> David Dale from ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' listed it as one of the Most Influential Videos of All Time, at number 18.<ref name=\"smh2\"/> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine listed it at number eight on their countdown of The 30-All Time Best Music Videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2085389_2085392_2085369,00.html|title=The 30 All-Time Best Music Videos|last=Levy|first=Glen|date=July 28, 2011|accessdate=August 2, 2011|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:ExpressYourselfUnderGround cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=The image of a young blond woman.

This reaction was channeled mainly by the media's strong attacks against feminism, generally describing activists as \"tortured people with hairy legs\", \"radical, bitter, man-hating, separatist and lesbian\", accompanied by messages advocating a feminization of women that turned them into beautiful ornamental objects, and tended to increase the cultural differences between the sexes.<ref name=\"aui\"/> \"Express Yourself\" appeared as a refutation of some of these reactionary premises. The title, Aguilar noted, seemed to raise the question of the urgency of a feminine voice to develop and emerge\u2014a concern that recalled the tradition of French feminists like [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous]] and [[Luce Irigaray]].<ref name=\"aui\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = MelanieChisholm.jpg\n| width1 = 117\n| alt1 = A brunette woman singing, wearing a sleeveless jacket\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Christina Aguilera Sanremo.jpg\n| width2 = 117\n| alt2 = A blond woman singing, wearing a black gown\n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Lady Gaga EuroPride 2011.jpg\n| width3 = 150\n| alt3 = A woman wearing a blue bob wig, stands talking behind a podium.
