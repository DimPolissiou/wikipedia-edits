He has also done work related to American comics, such as ''[[Iron Man]]'' and ''[[Hellboy]]'' (one of his illustrations was used for an official statuette of Hellboy). He also made additional contributions to early issues of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', including a special edition Strategy Guide for ''[[Dragon Warrior]]'' and artwork for ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''.  In Japan, he was responsible for the original character designs for the ''[[Tantei Jing\u016bji Sabur\u014d]]'' mystery adventure video game series, and has worked prolifically on the series, most consistently as the cover illustration artist. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Original, Badass Zelda Art By Katsuya Terada|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2012/04/original-badass-zelda-art-by-katsuya-terada/|last=Plunkett|first=Luke|date=April 5, 2012|work=[[Kotaku]]}}</ref>\n\nHe was in charge of the book cover and illustrations for the ''Kimaira'' series written by [[Baku Yumemakura]], and was in charge of cover design and illustrations for ''[[Gar\u014dden]]'', ''Shin Majugari'', and ''Yamigarishi'' as well.\n\nTerada has defined himself as a \"rakugaki\" artist, more of a philosophy than a style of drawing, in which one draws a little everywhere, all the time, without thinking too much, on notebooks etc. He is a very prolific artist; one of his collections of sketches numbers more than 1000 pages, appropriately called ''RakugaKing''. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Rakugaking|last=Terada |first=Katsuya |year=2002|isbn=978-4757208858}}</ref>\n\nHe has done very little group-drawn work (an exception being the comic [[The Monkey King (manga)|''The Monkey King'']]), his principal activities being illustration and character design.\n\nHis use of CG tools is integrated very well in his illustrations, giving his work a vivid and rich appearance. He has admitted various influences on his work, particularly European ones, like [[Jean Giraud]] (aka Moebius) and the magazine ''[[M\u00e9tal hurlant]]'' which he has said gave him a taste for strong women who are slightly stripped. <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ex.org/articles/2001/2001.09.08-exclusive-terada.html |title=First Blood: An Interview with Terada Katsuya |access-date=July 25, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608082842/http://www.ex.org/articles/2001/2001.09.08-exclusive-terada.html |archive-date=June 8, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTerada has done illustrations for a book by film historians Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski that is included in a Godzilla [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion]] box set along with other illustrators such as [[Takashi Okazaki]]. <ref>{{Cite news|title=Massive GODZILLA Criterion Box Set Gets a Trailer|url=https://filmpulse.net/massive-godzilla-criterion-box-set-gets-a-trailer/|last=Patterson|first=Adam|date=September 23, 2019|work=Filmpulse}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Illustration collections===\n<!--\nWIKI TABLES HELP: http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Table\nnote: where I have set cell width, I set it only in the first row of a table \n-->\n{|\n!align=left|Romaji Title\n!align=left|Japanese Title  \n!align=left|Release Date\n!align=left|ISBN\n|- bgcolor=#ffffff\n|width=\"380\"|\n|width=\"380\"|'' \u6226\u56fd\u81ea\u885b\u968a1549 ''\n|width=\"120\"| 05-20-05\n| {{ISBN|4-04-873614-0}}\n|- bgcolor=#ffffff\n|'' Work Jam Licensed Detective Sabur\u014d Jing\u016bji - Artbook: Detective File ''\n|'' \u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b8\u30e3\u30e0\u516c\u8a8d\u63a2\u5075\u795e\u5bae\u5bfa\u4e09\u90ceDETECTIVE FILE ''\n| 02-05\n| {{ISBN|4-7572-1136-8}}\n|- bgcolor=#ffffff\n|'' Katsuya Terada & Stapa & Gabin - Photobook: John Symmetry ''\n|'' \u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u30fb\u30b7\u30f3\u30e1\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc ''\n| 06-04\n| {{ISBN|4-947752-63-7}}\n|- bgcolor=#ffffff\n|'' Busin 0 \u2013 Character & World Guide for the game [[Busin 0]]  ''\n|'' \u5bfa\u7530\u514b\u4e5f\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u30b9 ''\n| 03-31-04\n| {{ISBN|4-7577-1852-7}}\n|- bgcolor=#ffffff\n|'' Paint Visual Works Poster Book ''\n|'' \u5f69\u4eac\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u30ef\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30dd\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30d6\u30c3\u30af ''\n| 05-03\n| {{ISBN|4-89829-882-6}}\n|- bgcolor=#ffffff\n|'' Shashou ''\n|'' \u8eca\u638c ''\n| 04-03\n| {{ISBN|4-434-03067-1}}\n|- bgcolor=#ffffff\n|'' Lemni3003 Imada Minu Megamitachi E''\n|'' Lemni3003 \u672a\u3060\u898b\u306c\u5973\u795e\u305f\u3061\u3078 ''\n| 12-19-02\n| {{ISBN|4-334-90106-9}}\n|- bgcolor=#ffffff\n|'' Terada Katsuya Presents - Rakuda Ga Warau''\n|'' \u30e9\u30af\u30c0\u304c\u7b11\u3046  ''\n| 11-02\n| {{ISBN|4-89829-866-4}}\n|- bgcolor=#ffffff\n|'' Painter bon!

They are also known as the '''Wamba-Wamba'''.{{sfn|Tindale|1974}}\n\n==Language==\n[[Wemba Wemba language|Wemba-Wemba]] bears strong similarities to [[Woiwurrung language|Woiwurrung]].{{sfn|McBryde|1986|p=83}} When Moravian missionaries came and started to learn a language in Wembawemba territory, at Archibald Macarthur Camppbell's ''Gannawarra'' station, they quickly noted that the natives, perceiving they were understood, slipped into using another language, not willing to allow this \"cultural conquest\" to enable the whitemen to learn of matters they wished to keep secret from outsiders.{{sfn|Jensz|2010|pp=80\u201381}}{{efn|Jensz notes the paradox that, conversely, at the [[Ebenezer Mission]], pastors resorted to German to stop their converts, fluent in English, from understanding them when they were discussing certain issues. {{harv|Jensz|2010|p=82}}}}\n\n==Country==\nBefore European settlement in the nineteenth century, the Wemba-Wemba occupied the area around the [[Loddon River]], reaching northwards from [[Kerang, Victoria]] to [[Swan Hill]], and including the area of the [[Avoca River]], southwards towards [[Quambatook, Victoria|Quambatook]]. In a northeasterly direction, their territory ran up, over the New South Wales-Victorian border to [[Booroorban, New South Wales|Booroorban]] and [[Moulamein, New South Wales|Moulamein]], and extended to the vicinity of [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]]. [[Lake Boga, Victoria|Lake Boga]] and [[Boort, Victoria|Boora]] in Victoria also fell within their domain.{{sfn|Tindale|1974}} The overall extension of their territory has been calculated by Norman Tindale to be roughly {{convert|3,200|mi2|km2}}.{{sfn|Tindale|1974}}\n\n==Social structure==\nThe Wembawemba were registered as consisting of five [[Band society|hordes]]. Stone lists these hordes, residing around [[Towaninny, Victoria|Towaninny]], Meelool Station (with a name indicating they were thought to be quarrelsome), Lake Boga, Gonn on the Murray River (called the ''Dietjenbaluk'' (\"always on the move\"), and [[Bael Bael, Victoria|Bael Bael]].{{sfn|Tindale|1974}}\n\n==Contact history==\nThe explorer [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] was the first white man to cross Wembawemba territory, in 1836.{{sfn|Jensz|2010|pp=73\u201374}}\n\n===Attempt to evangelize the Wembawemba===\nThe Wembas-Wemba's religio-cultural worldview was centered on a [[Dreamtime|dreaming]], which they called ''yemurraki''.{{sfn|Clarke|2003|p=382}}\n\nTwo German [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries, Reverend A.F.C. T\u00e4ger and Reverend F.W.

The [[Mahim railway station]] is in the Mahim area, on the [[Mumbai suburban railway]] on the [[Western Railway (India)|Western Railway]] line. Mahim is often considered as the heart of Mumbai. Mahim upholds the values of secularism and diversity. In fact one finds a temple, church, mosque and firetemple existing within a few meters of each other\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Seven Islands of Bombay en.svg|thumb|left|160px|Former [[seven islands of Bombay]]]]\nThe name Mahim is derived from the ancient ''Mahikavati'' meaning \"miraculous\" in Sanskrit. Other historical names for the area include ''Mahimawati,'' ''Maijim'', and ''Mejambu''.<ref name=\"origins\">{{cite book |last=D'Cunha |first=Jose Gerson|title=The Origins of Bombay|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=Bombay|year=1900|edition=3|pages=265|chapter=IV The Portuguese Period|isbn=81-206-0815-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miD5YO05jpUC&dq=the+origins+of+bombay|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>\n\nMahim was one of the seven islands that originally made up Mumbai. Mahim, or Mahikawati as it was known, was the capital of [[Bhima of Mahikavati|Raja Bhimdev]], who reigned over the region in the 13th century. He built a palace and a court of justice in [[Prabhadevi]], as well as the first [[Babulnath]] temple.\n\n[[File:Mahim Dargah 4.jpg|thumb|[[Dargah]] of Mahimi in Mahim]]\nIn 1343, this island was possessed by the [[Sultanate of Gujarat]]. It was in their reign that the old Mahim mosque was built. A dargah of Makhtum Fakir Ali Paru was built here in 1431.\n\nIn 1543, the Portuguese captured the islands of Mumbai. In 1662, these islands were given to the English King, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], as a part of the wedding dowry for the Portuguese princess, [[Catherine of Braganza]]. After British acquired Mumbai, they built the [[Mahim Fort]] here to protect themselves from the Marathas. The fort today stands in ruins.\n\nThe causeway connecting Mahim and Bandra (corrupted from \"Bunder\" meaning port in Persian) was completed in 1845 at a cost of Rs. 1,57,000 donated entirely by Lady [[Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]], wife of the first [[baronet]] Sir [[Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]] with a stipulation that no toll would be charged to citizens for its use by the government.\n\nIn 1847, a small group of Scottish missionaries decided to start a new school, now one of the most high-profile schools in Mumbai \u2014 the [[Bombay Scottish School]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Bwsl night222.jpg|thumb|[[Bandra Worli Sea Link]] across Mahim Bay]]\nMahim is surrounded by [[Dharavi]], [[Dadar]] and [[Bandra]] on the north and the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west.\n\n===Schools and educational institutions===\n\nMahim has a number of schools and educational institutions. Some of the well-known schools are [[Bombay Scottish School, Mahim]], [[Canossa Convent High School]], k.J khilnani High School, [[Victoria High School, Mahim|Victoria High School]], [[Saraswati Mandir High School]], [[Lokmanya Vidyamandir]], [[Billa Bong school]] and St Michael High School). Reputed colleges and professional educational institutes such as [[D. G. Ruparel College of Arts, Science and Commerce]] and [[St. Xavier's Technical Institute]] are also in Mahim.\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\n* Shitladevi Temple\n* [[D.

The southern end is [[Worli]], the northern end is [[Bandra]] Reclamation and Mahim is in the centre. The bay was named after the islands of Mahim and [[Salsette]] were merged in the early 19th century. The [[Mithi River]] drains into [[Mahim Creek]].\n\nDuring the colonial era, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] built a watchtower called [[Castella de Aguada]] on the northern side. Later, the [[British Empire|British]] built the [[Worli Fort]] to the south and [[Mahim Fort]] near the creek to defend the [[seven islands of Bombay]] against attacks by the Portuguese and the [[Marathas]]. The [[Bandra-Worli Sealink]] crosses Mahim Bay.\n\n=== Mahimchi Khadi (Mahim Creek) ===\n[[File:Mahim creek.jpg|thumb|right|Mahim Creek]]\nMahim Creek is a {{Convert|15|ft|m}} deep [[creek (tidal)|creek]]. The [[Mithi River]] drains into the creek which drains into the Mahim Bay. It forms the boundary between the [[Mumbai City|city]] and [[Mumbai Suburban District|suburbs]]. The creek is swamped by [[mangrove]]s and has a mini-ecosystem.\n\nIt now has the [[Bandra-Kurla complex]] with corporate offices on both its sides.\n\nThe waters of the creek are foul smelling due to the dumping of untreated industrial effluents upstream. In recent years, the mushrooming of slums around the waters has caused concern for the mangrove ecosystem, vital to the ecosystem of Mumbai.\n\nIn 2006, it was the site of [[2006 Mumbai \"Sweet\" Seawater Incident|mass hysteria]] as thousands claimed its waters had turned \"sweet.\"\n\n== Mahim Causeway ==\n[[File:Mahim Causeway 2.jpg|thumb|The Mahim Causeway, Koliwada Creek Bridge]]\nThe [[Mahim Causeway]] is a vital link road connecting the neighborhoods of Mahim in [[South Mumbai]] to [[Bandra]] in West Mumbai.\n\nThe Mahim Causeway was built between 1841 and 1846 to connect the island of Salsette with Mahim. The swampy area between the two islands made travel dangerous and thus a need for a causeway arose. The [[British East India Company]], which governed Bombay at that time, refused to fund the project. This led [[Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy|Lady Jeejeebhoy]], wife of the first baronet Sir [[Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]], to donate the entire amount of {{INR}}157,000/- <!-- NUMBERING SYSTEM IS CORRECT! See [[Indian numbering system]]. --> on the condition that the government would not charge a toll for its use or disturb the [[Koli people|Koli]] community who lived around the area.<ref>{{cite news|title=A bridge with a difference|url=http://week.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMonline.dll/portal/ep/theWeekContent.do?BV_ID=@@@&contentType=EDITORIAL&sectionName=TheWeek Last Word&programId=1073754894&contentId=5758088|last=Mahesh Dattani}}</ref>\n\nThe Mahim Causeway forms the link between [[Swami Vivekanand Road (Mumbai)|Swami Vivekanand Road]] and [[Lady Jamshetjee Road, Mumbai|L.J. Road]], being the stretch between Bandra masjid and [[St. Michael's Church (Mumbai)|Mahim church]] (St. Michael's). It is not to be confused with the [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]], a major infrastructural project opened on 30 June 2009 which is designed to ease traffic across the causeway by building another bridge across the Mahim Bay.\n\n== Mahim Fort ==\n[[File:Mahim Fort 13.jpg|thumb|Mahim Fort]]\n[[Mahim Fort]], which was once visible from the Mahim Causeway and Bandra Reclamation, is barely visible now. The Mahim Fort along with Fort St George in South Mumbai was an important base during the time of the British Empire. Other forts in Mumbai and [[Salsette Island]] include [[Sion, India|Sion]], [[Worli]], [[Sewri]] and [[Mazgaon]]. Fort St George was built in 1669, by the former Governor of Bombay, Gerald Aungier.\n\nThomas Grantham then strengthened the fort's ramparts in 1684. In 1772, 111 years after Bombay was taken from them, the Portuguese attempted to attack this fort. The British replied fiercely with cannonballs. The Bandra church also bore the brunt of their fire. There were about 100 soldiers and 30 cannons in the Mahim Fort at that time.\n\nToday the fort is almost ruined and encroachers and hutments occupy it.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Mahim}}\n* [[Makhdoom Ali Mahimi]]\n* [[St. Michael's Church (Mumbai)]]\n* [[Mithi River]]\n* [[Back Bay (Mumbai)|Back Bay]]\n* [[Mahim Causeway]]\n* [[Mahim halwa]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mumbai metropolitan area}}\n\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods in Mumbai]]\n[[Category:Mumbai City district]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Mahim\n| native_name             =\n| native_name_lang        = \n| other_name              = \n| settlement_type         = Neighbourhood\n| image_skyline           = Mahim bay skyline.jpg\n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = Mahim Bay\n| nickname                = \n| map_alt                 = \n| map_caption             = \n| pushpin_map             = Mumbai#Maharashtra#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = \n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = \n| coordinates             = {{coord|19.035|N|72.84|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = [[India]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Maharashtra]]\n| subdivision_type2       = Metro\n| subdivision_name2       = Mumbai\n| established_title       = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| government_type         = \n| governing_body          = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| area_footnotes          = \n| area_rank               = \n| area_total_km2          = \n| elevation_footnotes     = \n| elevation_m             = \n| population_total        = \n| population_as_of        = \n| population_rank         = \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_demonym      = Mahimkar\n| population_footnotes    = \n| demographics_type1      = Languages\n| demographics1_title1    = Official\n| demographics1_info1     = [[Marathi language|Marathi]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = <!-- [[Postal Index Number|PIN]] -->\n| postal_code             = \n| registration_plate      = \n| website                 = \n| footnotes               = \n}}\n'''Mahim''' is a neighbourhood in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. The [[Mahim railway station]] is in the Mahim area, on the [[Mumbai suburban railway]] on the [[Western Railway (India)|Western Railway]] line. Mahim is often considered as the heart of Mumbai. Mahim upholds the values of secularism and diversity. In fact one finds a temple, church, mosque and firetemple existing within a few meters of each other\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Seven Islands of Bombay en.svg|thumb|left|160px|Former [[seven islands of Bombay]]]]\nThe name Mahim is derived from the ancient ''Mahikavati'' meaning \"miraculous\" in Sanskrit. Other historical names for the area include ''Mahimawati,'' ''Maijim'', and ''Mejambu''.<ref name=\"origins\">{{cite book |last=D'Cunha |first=Jose Gerson|title=The Origins of Bombay|publisher=Asian Educational Services|location=Bombay|year=1900|edition=3|pages=265|chapter=IV The Portuguese Period|isbn=81-206-0815-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=miD5YO05jpUC&dq=the+origins+of+bombay|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>\n\nMahim was one of the seven islands that originally made up Mumbai. Mahim, or Mahikawati as it was known, was the capital of [[Bhima of Mahikavati|Raja Bhimdev]], who reigned over the region in the 13th century. He built a palace and a court of justice in [[Prabhadevi]], as well as the first [[Babulnath]] temple.\n\n[[File:Mahim Dargah 4.jpg|thumb|[[Dargah]] of Mahimi in Mahim]]\nIn 1343, this island was possessed by the [[Sultanate of Gujarat]]. It was in their reign that the old Mahim mosque was built. A dargah of Makhtum Fakir Ali Paru was built here in 1431.\n\nIn 1543, the Portuguese captured the islands of Mumbai. In 1662, these islands were given to the English King, [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], as a part of the wedding dowry for the Portuguese princess, [[Catherine of Braganza]]. After British acquired Mumbai, they built the [[Mahim Fort]] here to protect themselves from the Portuguese. The fort today stands in ruins.\n\nThe causeway connecting Mahim and Bandra (corrupted from \"Bunder\" meaning port in Persian) was completed in 1845 at a cost of Rs. 1,57,000 donated entirely by Lady [[Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]], wife of the first [[baronet]] Sir [[Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]] with a stipulation that no toll would be charged to citizens for its use by the government.\n\nIn 1847, a small group of Scottish missionaries decided to start a new school, now one of the most high-profile schools in Mumbai \u2014 the [[Bombay Scottish School]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Bwsl night222.jpg|thumb|[[Bandra Worli Sea Link]] across Mahim Bay]]\nMahim is surrounded by [[Dharavi]], [[Dadar]] and [[Bandra]] on the north and the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west.\n\n===Schools and educational institutions===\n\nMahim has a number of schools and educational institutions. Some of the well-known schools are [[Bombay Scottish School, Mahim]], [[Canossa Convent High School]], k.J khilnani High School, [[Victoria High School, Mahim|Victoria High School]], [[Saraswati Mandir High School]], [[Lokmanya Vidyamandir]], [[Billa Bong school]] and St Michael High School). Reputed colleges and professional educational institutes such as [[D. G. Ruparel College of Arts, Science and Commerce]] and [[St. Xavier's Technical Institute]] are also in Mahim.\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\n* Shitladevi Temple\n* [[D.

The southern end is [[Worli]], the northern end is [[Bandra]] Reclamation and Mahim is in the centre. The bay was named after the islands of Mahim and [[Salsette]] were merged in the early 19th century. The [[Mithi River]] drains into [[Mahim Creek]].\n\nDuring the colonial era, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] built a watchtower called [[Castella de Aguada]] on the northern side. Later, the [[British Empire|British]] built the [[Worli Fort]] to the south and [[Mahim Fort]] near the creek to defend the [[seven islands of Bombay]] against attacks by the Portuguese and the [[Marathas]]. The [[Bandra-Worli Sealink]] crosses Mahim Bay.\n\n=== Mahimchi Khadi (Mahim Creek) ===\n[[File:Mahim creek.jpg|thumb|right|Mahim Creek]]\nMahim Creek is a {{Convert|15|ft|m}} deep [[creek (tidal)|creek]]. The [[Mithi River]] drains into the creek which drains into the Mahim Bay. It forms the boundary between the [[Mumbai City|city]] and [[Mumbai Suburban District|suburbs]]. The creek is swamped by [[mangrove]]s and has a mini-ecosystem.\n\nIt now has the [[Bandra-Kurla complex]] with corporate offices on both its sides.\n\nThe waters of the creek are foul smelling due to the dumping of untreated industrial effluents upstream. In recent years, the mushrooming of slums around the waters has caused concern for the mangrove ecosystem, vital to the ecosystem of Mumbai.\n\nIn 2006, it was the site of [[2006 Mumbai \"Sweet\" Seawater Incident|mass hysteria]] as thousands claimed its waters had turned \"sweet.\"\n\n== Mahim Causeway ==\n[[File:Mahim Causeway 2.jpg|thumb|The Mahim Causeway, Koliwada Creek Bridge]]\nThe [[Mahim Causeway]] is a vital link road connecting the neighborhoods of Mahim in [[South Mumbai]] to [[Bandra]] in West Mumbai.\n\nThe Mahim Causeway was built between 1841 and 1846 to connect the island of Salsette with Mahim. The swampy area between the two islands made travel dangerous and thus a need for a causeway arose. The [[British East India Company]], which governed Bombay at that time, refused to fund the project. This led [[Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy|Lady Jeejeebhoy]], wife of the first baronet Sir [[Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy]], to donate the entire amount of {{INR}}157,000/- <!-- NUMBERING SYSTEM IS CORRECT! See [[Indian numbering system]]. --> on the condition that the government would not charge a toll for its use or disturb the [[Koli people|Koli]] community who lived around the area.<ref>{{cite news|title=A bridge with a difference|url=http://week.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMonline.dll/portal/ep/theWeekContent.do?BV_ID=@@@&contentType=EDITORIAL&sectionName=TheWeek Last Word&programId=1073754894&contentId=5758088|last=Mahesh Dattani}}</ref>\n\nThe Mahim Causeway forms the link between [[Swami Vivekanand Road (Mumbai)|Swami Vivekanand Road]] and [[Lady Jamshetjee Road, Mumbai|L.J. Road]], being the stretch between Bandra masjid and [[St. Michael's Church (Mumbai)|Mahim church]] (St. Michael's). It is not to be confused with the [[Bandra-Worli Sea Link]], a major infrastructural project opened on 30 June 2009 which is designed to ease traffic across the causeway by building another bridge across the Mahim Bay.\n\n== Mahim Fort ==\n[[File:Mahim Fort 13.jpg|thumb|Mahim Fort]]\n[[Mahim Fort]], which was once visible from the Mahim Causeway and Bandra Reclamation, is barely visible now. The Mahim Fort along with Fort St George in South Mumbai was an important base during the time of the British Empire. Other forts in Mumbai and [[Salsette Island]] include [[Sion, India|Sion]], [[Worli]], [[Sewri]] and [[Mazgaon]]. Fort St George was built in 1669, by the former Governor of Bombay, Gerald Aungier.\n\nThomas Grantham then strengthened the fort's ramparts in 1684.

The jaguar's present range extends from [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]] in [[North America]], across much of [[Central America]], and south to [[Paraguay]] and northern [[Argentina]] in [[South America]]. Though there are single cats now living within the Western United States, the species has largely been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from the [[United States]] since the early 20th century. It is listed as [[Near Threatened]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]; and its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation of habitat]].\n\nOverall, the jaguar is the largest native cat species of the New World and the [[List of largest cats|third largest in the world]]. This spotted cat closely resembles the [[leopard]], but is usually larger and sturdier. It ranges across a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] is [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest]], [[swamp]]s and wooded regions. The jaguar enjoys swimming and is largely a [[Solitude|solitary]], opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush [[predator]] at [[apex predator|the top of the food chain]]. As a [[keystone species]] it plays an important role in stabilizing [[ecosystem]]s and regulating prey populations.\n\nWhile international trade in jaguars or their body parts is prohibited, the cat is still frequently killed, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American cultures]], including those of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Aztec]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'jaguar' is thought to derive from the [[Tupian languages|Tupian]] word ''yaguara'', meaning \"beast of prey\".<ref name=etymology>{{cite web |author=Harper, D. |year=2001\u20132017 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=jaguar |title=Jaguar | work = [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|publisher=Douglas Harper}}</ref> The word entered English presumably via the Amazonian [[Pidgin|trade language]] [[Nheengatu language|Tupinamb\u00e1]], via [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''jaguar''.<ref name=r1/><ref name=r2/> The specific word for jaguar is ''yaguaret\u00e9'', with the suffix -''et\u00e9'' meaning \"real\" or \"true\".<ref name=r3/>\n\nThe word 'panther' derives from [[classical Latin]] ''panth\u0113ra'', itself from the [[ancient Greek]] ''p\u00e1nth\u0113r'' (\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1).<ref>{{cite web |author1=Liddell, H.

It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases in the absence of the keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects.<ref name=MONGA/> However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the [[keystone predator]] hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.<ref name=r30/>\n\nThe jaguar also has an effect on other predators. The jaguar and the cougar, which is the next-largest feline of South America, but the biggest in Central or North America,<ref name=foodhabits/> are often [[sympatric]] (related species sharing overlapping territory) and have often been studied in conjunction. The jaguar tends to take larger prey, usually over {{convert|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the cougar smaller, usually between {{convert|2|and|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, reducing the latter's size.<ref name=\"Brakefield\"/><ref name=r31/> This situation may be advantageous to the cougar. Its broader prey niche, including its ability to take smaller prey, may give it an advantage over the jaguar in human-altered landscapes;<ref name=foodhabits/> while both are classified as [[near threatened|near-threatened]] species, the cougar has a significantly larger current distribution.

The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, listening for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an [[apex predator]] in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses as large as a heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/>\n\nOn killing prey, the jaguar will drag the carcass to a thicket or other secluded spot.

This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.<ref name=JSSP/>\n\nThe skins of wild cats and other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the beginning of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the [[Second World War]] and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem. During this period, the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay, and the biggest importers were the US and [[Germany]].<ref name=\"SkinTrade\">{{cite book |last1=Broad |first1=S- |title=The harvest of and trade in Latin American spotted cats (Felidae) and otters (Lutrinae) |date=1987|publisher=IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre|location=Cambridge, UK|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/119261|accessdate=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe jaguar is listed on [[CITES Appendix I]], which means that all international trade in jaguars or their body parts is prohibited.

Specific areas of high importance for jaguar conservation, so-called \"Jaguar Conservation Units\" (JCU) were determined in 2000. These are large areas inhabited by at least 50 jaguars. Each unit was assessed and evaluated on the basis of size, connectivity, habitat quality for both jaguar and prey, and jaguar population status. That way, 51 Jaguar Conservation Units were determined in 36 geographic regions as priority areas for jaguar conservation including:<ref name=Sanderson2002/>\n* the [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre]] of Mexico\n* the Selva Maya tropical forests extending over Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala\n* the [[Choc\u00f3-Dari\u00e9n moist forests]] from Honduras, Panama to Colombia\n* [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]]\n* [[Venezuelan Llanos]]\n* northern [[Cerrado]] and [[Amazon basin]] in Brazil\n* [[Misiones Province]] in Argentina\n\nRecent studies underlined that to maintain the robust exchange across the jaguar gene pool necessary for maintaining the species, it is important that jaguar habitats are interconnected. To facilitate this, a new project, the [[Paseo del Jaguar]], has been established to connect several jaguar hotspots.<ref name=r35/>\n\nIn 1986, the [[Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]] was established in Belize as the world's first protected area for jaguar conservation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weckel, M., Giuliano, W. and Silver, S. |year=2006 |title=Cockscomb revisited: jaguar diet in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize |journal=Biotropica |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=687\u2013690 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0de6ca561c58392453101b32240599f5e343b810|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00190.x }}</ref>\n\nGiven the inaccessibility of much of the species' range, particularly the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular [[bioregion]]s, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600\u20131,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125\u2013180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km<sup>2</sup> (2400-mi<sup>2</sup>) [[Calakmul Biosphere Reserve]], with another 350 in the state of [[Chiapas]]. The adjoining [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (9,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>), may have 465\u2013550 animals.<ref name=GUIDELINESPOPULATION/> Work employing [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[telemetry]] in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.<ref name=r34/>\n\n===Approaches===\nIn setting up protected reserves, efforts generally also have to be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.<ref name=gutierrez/>\n\nTo estimate population sizes within specific areas and to keep track of individual jaguars, [[camera trap]]ping and [[Telemetry#Fishery and wildlife research and management|wildlife tracking telemetry]] are widely used, and feces may be sought out with the help of detector dogs to study jaguar health and diet.<ref name=soisalo/><ref name=furtado/>\nCurrent conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting [[ecotourism]].<ref name=WWF/> The jaguar is generally defined as an [[umbrella species]] \u2013 its home range and habitat requirements are sufficiently broad that, if protected, numerous other species of smaller range will also be protected.<ref name=r33/> Umbrella species serve as \"mobile links\" at the landscape scale, in the jaguar's case through predation. Conservation organizations may thus focus on providing viable, connected habitat for the jaguar, with the knowledge other species will also benefit.<ref name=WWF/>\n\n[[Ecotourism]] setups are being used to generate public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, while at the same time generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.<ref name=mossaz/>\n\n===The United States===\n{{Main|North American jaguar}}\nThe only extant cat native to North America that roars,<ref name=TwoSightings/> the jaguar was recorded as an animal of the Americas by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/writingsthomasj10statgoog/writingsthomasj10statgoog_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"The writings of Thomas Jefferson\"}}</ref> Jaguars are still occasionally sighted in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], such as El Jefe,<ref>{{cite web |title=Student project results in new jaguar sighting |author=Jessica Lamberton-Moreno |date=8 September 2015 |publisher=Sky Island Alliance |url=http://www.skyislandalliance.org/2015/09/new-jaguar-sighting/ |accessdate=4 January 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Only Known Jaguar in U.S. Filmed in Rare Video |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160203-jaguars-nation-animals-science-rare/ |website=National Geographic News |access-date=4 February 2016 |first=Brian |last=Handwerk |date=3 February 2016}}</ref> prompting actions for its conservation by authorities.<ref name=TwoSightings/> For example, on 20 August 2012, the USFWS proposed setting aside 838,232 acres in Arizona and New Mexico \u2013 an area larger than Rhode Island \u2013 as critical jaguar habitat.<ref name=\"SA2012\">{{cite journal |title=Kitty Corner: Jaguars Win Critical Habitat in U.S. |first=Susan H. |last=Greenberg |journal=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kitty-corner-jaguars-win-critical-habitat-in-us |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007130344/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kitty-corner-jaguars-win-critical-habitat-in-us/ |url-status=live |date=21 August 2012 |archivedate=7 October 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==In mythology and culture==\n===Pre-Columbian Americas===\n{{multiple image\n |align=right\n |direction=vertical\n |image1=Jaguar warrior.jpg\n |caption1=Jaguar warrior in the Aztec culture\n |width1=220\n |image2=Chilam Balam Ixil.jpg\n |caption2=Copy of the Book of Chilam Balam of Ixil in the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)]]\n |width2=220\n}}\n{{multiple image\n |align=left\n |direction=vertical\n |image1=Statuette Karaj\u00e0 MHNT.ETH.2010.24.88.jpg\n |caption1=Statuette of Karaj\u00e0 in the [[Museum of Toulouse]]\n |width1=220\n |image2=MocheJaguarLarcoMuseum.jpg\n |caption2=Moche jaguar figurine dating to 300&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]], at the [[Larco Museum]] in [[Lima]], Peru\n |width2=220\n}}\n{{See also|Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures}}\nIn [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Central and South America, the jaguar was a symbol of power and strength.

In the later [[Maya civilization]], the jaguar was believed to facilitate communication between the living and the dead and to protect the royal household. The Maya saw these powerful felines as their companions in the spiritual world, and a number of Maya rulers bore names that incorporated the Mayan word for jaguar (''b'alam'' in many of the [[Mayan languages]]). ''Balam'' (''Jaguar'') remains a common Maya surname, and it is also the name of [[Chilam Balam]], a legendary author to whom are attributed 17th and 18th-centuries Maya [[miscellanies]] preserving much important knowledge. The [[Aztec]] civilization shared this image of the jaguar as the representative of the ruler and as a warrior. The Aztecs formed an elite warrior class known as the [[Jaguar warrior|Jaguar Knights]].

The jaguar's present range extends from [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]] in [[North America]], across much of [[Central America]], and south to [[Paraguay]] and northern [[Argentina]] in [[South America]]. Though there are single cats now living within the Western United States, the species has largely been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from the [[United States]] since the early 20th century. It is listed as [[Near Threatened]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]; and its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation of habitat]].\n\nOverall, the jaguar is the largest native cat species of the New World and the [[List of largest cats|third largest in the world]]. This spotted cat closely resembles the [[leopard]], but is usually larger and sturdier. It ranges across a variety of forested and open terrains, but its preferred [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] is [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest]], [[swamp]]s and wooded regions. The jaguar enjoys swimming and is largely a [[Solitude|solitary]], opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush [[predator]] at [[apex predator|the top of the food chain]].

The jaguar has also been termed a [[keystone species]], as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[Seed predation|granivorous]] mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems.<ref name=foodhabits/><ref name=PHOENIX/> However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases in the absence of the keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects.<ref name=MONGA/> However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the [[keystone predator]] hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.<ref name=r30/>\n\nThe jaguar also has an effect on other predators. The jaguar and the cougar, which is the next-largest feline of South America, but the biggest in Central or North America,<ref name=foodhabits/> are often [[sympatric]] (related species sharing overlapping territory) and have often been studied in conjunction. The jaguar tends to take larger prey, usually over {{convert|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the cougar smaller, usually between {{convert|2|and|22|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, reducing the latter's size.<ref name=\"Brakefield\"/><ref name=r31/> This situation may be advantageous to the cougar. Its broader prey niche, including its ability to take smaller prey, may give it an advantage over the jaguar in human-altered landscapes;<ref name=foodhabits/> while both are classified as [[near threatened|near-threatened]] species, the cougar has a significantly larger current distribution.

The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, listening for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an [[apex predator]] in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses as large as a heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/>\n\nOn killing prey, the jaguar will drag the carcass to a thicket or other secluded spot.

When adapted to the prey, the jaguar has been shown to take cattle as a large portion of its diet; while land clearance for grazing is a problem for the species, the jaguar population may have increased when cattle were first introduced to South America, as the animals took advantage of the new prey base. This willingness to take livestock has induced ranch owners to hire full-time jaguar hunters.<ref name=JSSP/>\n\nThe skins of wild cats and other mammals have been highly valued by the fur trade for many decades. From the beginning of the 20th-century Jaguars were hunted in large numbers, but over-harvest and habitat destruction reduced the availability and induced hunters and traders to gradually shift to smaller species by the 1960s. The international trade of jaguar skins had its largest boom between the end of the [[Second World War]] and the early 1970, due to the growing economy and lack of regulations. From 1967 onwards, the regulations introduced by national laws and international agreements diminished the reported international trade from as high as 13000 skins in 1967, through 7000 skins in 1969, until it became negligible after 1976, although illegal trade and smuggling continue to be a problem. During this period, the biggest exporters were Brazil and Paraguay, and the biggest importers were the US and [[Germany]].<ref name=\"SkinTrade\">{{cite book |last1=Broad |first1=S- |title=The harvest of and trade in Latin American spotted cats (Felidae) and otters (Lutrinae) |date=1987|publisher=IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre|location=Cambridge, UK|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/119261|accessdate=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe jaguar is listed on [[CITES Appendix I]], which means that all international trade in jaguars or their body parts is prohibited.

Specific areas of high importance for jaguar conservation, so-called \"Jaguar Conservation Units\" (JCU) were determined in 2000. These are large areas inhabited by at least 50 jaguars. Each unit was assessed and evaluated on the basis of size, connectivity, habitat quality for both jaguar and prey, and jaguar population status. That way, 51 Jaguar Conservation Units were determined in 36 geographic regions as priority areas for jaguar conservation including:<ref name=Sanderson2002/>\n* the [[Sierra Madre Occidental|Sierra Madre]] of Mexico\n* the Selva Maya tropical forests extending over Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala\n* the [[Choc\u00f3-Dari\u00e9n moist forests]] from Honduras, Panama to Colombia\n* [[Sierra de Tamaulipas]]\n* [[Venezuelan Llanos]]\n* northern [[Cerrado]] and [[Amazon basin]] in Brazil\n* [[Misiones Province]] in Argentina\n\nRecent studies underlined that to maintain the robust exchange across the jaguar gene pool necessary for maintaining the species, it is important that jaguar habitats are interconnected. To facilitate this, a new project, the [[Paseo del Jaguar]], has been established to connect several jaguar hotspots.<ref name=r35/>\n\nIn 1986, the [[Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary]] was established in Belize as the world's first protected area for jaguar conservation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weckel, M., Giuliano, W. and Silver, S. |year=2006 |title=Cockscomb revisited: jaguar diet in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, Belize |journal=Biotropica |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=687\u2013690 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0de6ca561c58392453101b32240599f5e343b810|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2006.00190.x }}</ref>\n\nGiven the inaccessibility of much of the species' range, particularly the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular [[bioregion]]s, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600\u20131,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125\u2013180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km<sup>2</sup> (2400-mi<sup>2</sup>) [[Calakmul Biosphere Reserve]], with another 350 in the state of [[Chiapas]]. The adjoining [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]] in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (9,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>), may have 465\u2013550 animals.<ref name=GUIDELINESPOPULATION/> Work employing [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] [[telemetry]] in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers of cats.<ref name=r34/>\n\n===Approaches===\nIn setting up protected reserves, efforts generally also have to be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, especially if the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.<ref name=gutierrez/>\n\nTo estimate population sizes within specific areas and to keep track of individual jaguars, [[camera trap]]ping and [[Telemetry#Fishery and wildlife research and management|wildlife tracking telemetry]] are widely used, and feces may be sought out with the help of detector dogs to study jaguar health and diet.<ref name=soisalo/><ref name=furtado/>\nCurrent conservation efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting [[ecotourism]].<ref name=WWF/> The jaguar is generally defined as an [[umbrella species]] \u2013 its home range and habitat requirements are sufficiently broad that, if protected, numerous other species of smaller range will also be protected.<ref name=r33/> Umbrella species serve as \"mobile links\" at the landscape scale, in the jaguar's case through predation. Conservation organizations may thus focus on providing viable, connected habitat for the jaguar, with the knowledge other species will also benefit.<ref name=WWF/>\n\n[[Ecotourism]] setups are being used to generate public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, while at the same time generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.<ref name=mossaz/>\n\n===The United States===\n{{Main|North American jaguar}}\nThe only extant cat native to North America that roars,<ref name=TwoSightings/> the jaguar was recorded as an animal of the Americas by [[Thomas Jefferson]] in 1799.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/writingsthomasj10statgoog/writingsthomasj10statgoog_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"The writings of Thomas Jefferson\"}}</ref> Jaguars are still occasionally sighted in [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], such as El Jefe,<ref>{{cite web |title=Student project results in new jaguar sighting |author=Jessica Lamberton-Moreno |date=8 September 2015 |publisher=Sky Island Alliance |url=http://www.skyislandalliance.org/2015/09/new-jaguar-sighting/ |accessdate=4 January 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Only Known Jaguar in U.S. Filmed in Rare Video |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/02/160203-jaguars-nation-animals-science-rare/ |website=National Geographic News |access-date=4 February 2016 |first=Brian |last=Handwerk |date=3 February 2016}}</ref> prompting actions for its conservation by authorities.<ref name=TwoSightings/> For example, on 20 August 2012, the USFWS proposed setting aside 838,232 acres in Arizona and New Mexico \u2013 an area larger than Rhode Island \u2013 as critical jaguar habitat.<ref name=\"SA2012\">{{cite journal |title=Kitty Corner: Jaguars Win Critical Habitat in U.S. |first=Susan H. |last=Greenberg |journal=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=kitty-corner-jaguars-win-critical-habitat-in-us |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007130344/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kitty-corner-jaguars-win-critical-habitat-in-us/ |url-status=live |date=21 August 2012 |archivedate=7 October 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==In mythology and culture==\n===Pre-Columbian Americas===\n{{multiple image\n |align=right\n |direction=vertical\n |image1=Jaguar warrior.jpg\n |caption1=Jaguar warrior in the Aztec culture\n |width1=220\n |image2=Chilam Balam Ixil.jpg\n |caption2=Copy of the Book of Chilam Balam of Ixil in the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)]]\n |width2=220\n}}\n{{multiple image\n |align=left\n |direction=vertical\n |image1=Statuette Karaj\u00e0 MHNT.ETH.2010.24.88.jpg\n |caption1=Statuette of Karaj\u00e0 in the [[Museum of Toulouse]]\n |width1=220\n |image2=MocheJaguarLarcoMuseum.jpg\n |caption2=Moche jaguar figurine dating to 300&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]], at the [[Larco Museum]] in [[Lima]], Peru\n |width2=220\n}}\n{{See also|Jaguars in Mesoamerican cultures}}\nIn [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Central and South America, the jaguar was a symbol of power and strength.

In the later [[Maya civilization]], the jaguar was believed to facilitate communication between the living and the dead and to protect the royal household. The Maya saw these powerful felines as their companions in the spiritual world, and a number of Maya rulers bore names that incorporated the Mayan word for jaguar (''b'alam'' in many of the [[Mayan languages]]). ''Balam'' (''Jaguar'') remains a common Maya surname, and it is also the name of [[Chilam Balam]], a legendary author to whom are attributed 17th and 18th-centuries Maya [[miscellanies]] preserving much important knowledge. The [[Aztec]] civilization shared this image of the jaguar as the representative of the ruler and as a warrior. The Aztecs formed an elite warrior class known as the [[Jaguar warrior|Jaguar Knights]]. In [[Aztec mythology]], the jaguar was considered to be the [[totem]] animal of the powerful deity [[Tezcatlipoca]].<ref name=MANUALHIST&BEHAV/><ref name=b3/> Remains of jaguar bones were discovered in a burial site in [[Guatemala]] which indicates that [[Mayans]] kept jaguars as [[pets]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/ancient-mayans-probably-kept-jaguars-as-pets-and-raised-dogs-for-food/|date=March 20, 2018|title=Ancient Mayans Probably Kept Jaguars As Pets And Raised Dogs For Food|publisher=[[IFLScience]]|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporary culture===\nThe jaguar and its name are widely used as a symbol in contemporary culture.
