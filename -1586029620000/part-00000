Alexis, a member of the central Rose family, is introduced as the spoiled socialite daughter of [[Johnny Rose|Johnny]] and [[Moira Rose]], and the younger sister of [[David Rose (Schitt's Creek)|David Rose]]. Her early stories revolve around her efforts to adjust to life in Schitt's Creek after her family loses their fortune, as well as her romantic entanglements with locals Mutt Schitt and Ted Mullins.

She secured the role after Alexis's initial portrayer, [[Abby Elliott]], was unable to continue in the role when ''Schitt's Creek'' was picked up to series by the CBC. Murphy's performance has been largely praised by fans and critics, with some critics calling her the show's \"breakout star\".

Alexis, a member of the central Rose family, is introduced as the spoiled socialite daughter of [[Johnny Rose|Johnny]] and [[Moira Rose]], and the younger sister of [[David Rose (Schitt's Creek)|David Rose]]. Her early stories revolve around her efforts to adjust to life in Schitt's Creek after her family loses their fortune, as well as her romantic entanglements with locals Mutt Schitt and Ted Mullins. In later seasons, Alexis's story focuses on her educational pursuits and the establishment of her public relations business, Alexis Rose Communications.\n\nAlexis Rose is portrayed by actress [[Annie Murphy]]. She secured the role after Alexis's initial portrayer, [[Abby Elliott]], was unable to continue in the role when ''Schitt's Creek'' was picked up to series by the CBC. Murphy's performance has been largely praised by fans and critics, with some critics calling her the show's \"breakout star\". For her work as Alexis, Murphy has been nominated for three [[Canadian Screen Awards]] and one [[Gracie Awards|Gracie Award]], an award she won in 2019.\n\n== Role in ''Schitt's Creek'' ==\n''Schitt's Creek'' follows the trials and tribulations of the once wealthy Rose family, who are banished to the titular town after losing their fortune to an embezzling business manager.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://r-login.wordpress.com/remote-login.php?action=auth&host=torontosun.com&id=126506751&back=https%3A%2F%2Ftorontosun.com%2F2015%2F01%2F11%2Fschitts-creek-eugene-levy-catherine-ohara-and-dan-levy-talk-new-cbc-comedy%2Fwcm%2Ffaaa1b0f-c618-47fc-b8da-39d86b04c531&h=|title='Schitt's Creek': Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara and Dan Levy talk new CBC comedy|last=Harris|first=Bill|date=2015-01-11|website=Toronto Sun|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-14}}</ref> A globetrotting socialite, Alexis is introduced as the self-absorbed adult daughter of Johnny ([[Eugene Levy]]) and Moira Rose ([[Catherine O'Hara]]) who has little time for Schitt's Creek or her family.<ref name=\":3\">\"Our Cup Runneth Over\".

It is part of the [[Education in Marshall, Texas|Marshall Independent School District]] which serves students in central [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]].  In 2014, the school was rated \"[[Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system|Academically Acceptable]]\" by the [[Texas Education Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2011/index.html |title=2011 Accountability Rating System |publisher=Texas Education Agency |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134123/http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2011/index.html |archivedate=2012-06-28 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nOn September 12, 1898, Marshall High School began operation in a building leased from College of Marshall.\n\nThe first Marshall High School had only two teachers, who instructed 30 students in five subjects: Latin, English, history, math, and science. Only grades 8\u201310 were taught when the school opened, but by 1902 had expanded through the 12th grade. The first graduate of MHS was Miss Verbena Barnes. In 1900 there were three graduates.\n\nOn September 25, 1905, the newly constructed East Side Building was opened for grades 1-12.  However, due to the rapid growth of both the elementary classes as well as the high school, overcrowding became an issue almost immediately. MHS was relocated in 1907 to the old Masonic Female Institute campus to alleviate the crowded facility, but also to provide much needed science lab space for the students.\n\nOn March 29, 1910, the College of Marshall transferred a large building and parcel of property to the Marshall School Board. The property was located at 600 West Houston street, just blocks from the heart of downtown Marshal. This facility would be used until a new permanent high school could be completed.  In September 1911, 200 high school students enrolled at MHS.\n\nIn 1923 the old College of Marshall building was demolished and a new building was opened for grades 9\u201312. MHS (the sports teams then known as the Mustangs) remained in that building until 1939. In 1940 Marshall opened a massive three story brick and sandstone building that would become the home of \"The Mavericks\" for the next 41 years.\n\nIn 1954 a new wing was added to the west side of facility that would become home to administrative offices, fine arts classrooms and the Industrial Arts Department. A new 1,300 seat gym was opened in 1965.\n\nThe 1970s brought about more change as the Marshall Independent School District (MISD)saw the integration of Marshall High school with the segregated Pemberton High School.  The increase in enrollment for the combined schools led to the passage of a bond issue in 1976 for the construction of a new facility. The new building became home to grades 10\u201312, while MHS 9th graders attended the Pemberton site.\n\nIn September 1980, students stepped into a comprehensive 212,000-square-foot facility on Maverick Drive. The school had an initial capacity of 1,600 students. Its features included a 2,000-seat gym with three courts, 600-seat auditorium, and a multi-tiered dining area.  A separation of academic areas from industrial, co-op, and Fine Arts added to the layout. The new complex also included a new 7,000-seat stadium with all-weather track, a 12,000 square-foot field house, six tennis courts and a baseball field.\n\nA facilities study, followed by a bond issue in 1986, led to the closing of the Pemberton High site, and the opening of a ninth-grade wing at Marshall High School.  The addition reunited grades 9\u201312 and expanded the capacity of MHS to 2.000. The 44,420-square-foot addition opened to students on September 1, 1988.\n\nA supplemental field house for baseball, cross-country, soccer, and tennis opened at the north end of Maverick Drive in December, 1988.\n\nIn 1993 came a 2,000-seat addition to Maverick Stadium, expanded the capacity to 9,000. A major expansion for the MHS band program came in the mid 1990s with a 2nd rehearsal hall, more practice space, a loading dock, and expanded storage. In the late 1990s MISD constructed what is widely considered one of the finest softball facilities in the state for the Lady Mavs.\n\nAll-weather turf was installed in Maverick Stadium in the summer of 2003 along with a new sound system and a digital scoreboard.

It is part of the [[Education in Marshall, Texas|Marshall Independent School District]] which serves students in central [[Harrison County, Texas|Harrison County]].  In 2014, the school was rated \"[[Texas Education Agency accountability ratings system|Academically Acceptable]]\" by the [[Texas Education Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2011/index.html |title=2011 Accountability Rating System |publisher=Texas Education Agency |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628134123/http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/perfreport/account/2011/index.html |archivedate=2012-06-28 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nOn September 12, 1898, Marshall High School began operation in a building leased from College of Marshall.\n\nThe first Marshall High School had only two teachers, who instructed 30 students in five subjects: Latin, English, history, math, and science. Only grades 8\u201310 were taught when the school opened, but by 1902 had expanded through the 12th grade. The first graduate of MHS was Miss Verbena Barnes. In 1900 there were three graduates.\n\nOn September 25, 1905, the newly constructed East Side Building was opened for grades 1-12.  However, due to the rapid growth of both the elementary classes as well as the high school, overcrowding became an issue almost immediately. MHS was relocated in 1907 to the old Masonic Female Institute campus to alleviate the crowded facility, but also to provide much needed science lab space for the students.\n\nOn March 29, 1910, the College of Marshall transferred a large building and parcel of property to the Marshall School Board. The property was located at 600 West Houston street, just blocks from the heart of downtown Marshal. This facility would be used until a new permanent high school could be completed.  In September 1911, 200 high school students enrolled at MHS.\n\nIn 1923 the old College of Marshall building was demolished and a new building was opened for grades 9\u201312. MHS (the sports teams then known as the Mustangs) remained in that building until 1939. In 1940 Marshall opened a massive three story brick and sandstone building that would become the home of \"The Mavericks\" for the next 41 years.\n\nIn 1954 a new wing was added to the west side of facility that would become home to administrative offices, fine arts classrooms and the Industrial Arts Department. A new 1,300 seat gym was opened in 1965.\n\nThe 1970s brought about more change as the Marshall Independent School District (MISD)saw the integration of Marshall High school with the segregated Pemberton High School.  The increase in enrollment for the combined schools led to the passage of a bond issue in 1976 for the construction of a new facility. The new building became home to grades 10\u201312, while MHS 9th graders attended the Pemberton site.\n\nIn September 1980, students stepped into a comprehensive 212,000-square-foot facility on Maverick Drive. The school had an initial capacity of 1,600 students. Its features included a 2,000-seat gym with three courts, 600-seat auditorium, and a multi-tiered dining area.  A separation of academic areas from industrial, co-op, and Fine Arts added to the layout. The new complex also included a new 7,000-seat stadium with all-weather track, a 12,000 square-foot field house, six tennis courts and a baseball field.\n\nA facilities study, followed by a bond issue in 1986, led to the closing of the Pemberton High site, and the opening of a ninth-grade wing at Marshall High School.  The addition reunited grades 9\u201312 and expanded the capacity of MHS to 2.000. The 44,420-square-foot addition opened to students on September 1, 1988.\n\nA supplemental field house for baseball, cross-country, soccer, and tennis opened at the north end of Maverick Drive in December, 1988.\n\nIn 1993 came a 2,000-seat addition to Maverick Stadium, expanded the capacity to 9,000. A major expansion for the MHS band program came in the mid 90's with a 2nd rehearsal hall, more practice space, a loading dock, and expanded storage. In the late 90's MISD constructed what is widely considered one of the finest softball facilities in the state for the Lady Mavs.\n\nAll-weather turf was installed in Maverick Stadium in the summer of 2003 along with a new sound system and a digital scoreboard. In the spring of 2005 a state of the art weight and training center known as the Maverick Athletic Complex was opened for all MHS athletes thanks to the help of community donations and support from donors.\n\n==Student demographics==\nAs of the 2012-13 school year, Marshall High had a total of 1,534 students (46.6% White, 39.7% African American, 12.9% Hispanic, 0.7% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 0.1% Native American). 44.4% of the students are considered economically disadvantaged.\n\n==Athletics==\nStudent athletes are known as Mavericks and Lady Mavs.  MHS competes the following sports: cross country, volleyball, football, basketball, powerlifting, swimming, soccer, golf, tennis, track, baseball, and softball.
