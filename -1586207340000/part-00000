{"title_page": "History of the Kuomintang", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=September 2016}}\n{{main|Kuomintang}}\n{{History of China}}\n{{History of the Republic of China}}\nThe '''History of the Kuomintang''' is an article on the inception of the '''Kuomintang''' ('''KMT''' or '''CNP''';), a [[Politics of the Republic of China|Chinese political party]] that ruled [[China proper|China]] 1927\u201348 and then moved to [[Taiwan]].  The name translates as \"China's National People's Party\" and was historically referred to as the Chinese Nationalists. The Party was initially founded on 23 August 1912, by [[Sun Yat-sen]] but dissolved in November 1913. It reformed on October 10th 1919, again led by Sun Yat-sen, and became the ruling party in China. After Sun's death, the party was dominated from 1927 to 1975 by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Though the KMT lost the civil war with the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1949, the party took control of Taiwan and remains a major political party of the [[Republic of China]] based in Taiwan.\n\nFounded in 1912 by [[Sun Yat-sen]], the KMT helped topple the Qing Emperor and promoted modernization along Western lines. The party played a significant part in the first Chinese first National Assembly where it was the majority party. However the KMT failed to achieve complete control. The post of president was given to [[Yuan Shikai]] (1859\u20131916) as reward for his part in the revolution. Yuan Shikai abused his powers, overriding the constitution and creating strong tensions between himself and the other parties. In July 1913, the KMT staged a 'Second Revolution' to depose Yuan. This failed and the following crack down by Yuan led to the dissolution of the KMT and the exile of its leadership, mostly to Japan. Subsequently, Yuan Shikai had himself made Emperor of China.\n\nIn exile, Sun Yat-sen and other former KMT members founded several revolutionary parties under various names but with little success. These parties were united by Sun in 1919 under the title \"The Kuomintang of China\". The new party returned to Guangzhou in China in 1920 where it set up a government but failed to achieve control of all of China. After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, China fractured into many regions controlled by warlords. To strengthen the party's position, it accepted aid and support from the Soviet Union and its Comintern. The fledgling Communist Party of China was encouraged to join the KMT and thus formed the First United Front. The KMT gradually increased its sphere of influence from its Guangzhou base. Sun Yat-sen died in 1925 and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (1887\u20131975) became the KMT strong man. In 1926 Chiang led a military operation known as the [[Northern Expedition]] against the warlords that controlled much of the country. In 1927, Chiang instigated the [[April 12 Incident]] in Shanghai in which the Communist Party of China and Communist elements of the KMT were purged.<ref>The event is also known as the Shanghai Massacre of 1927. See Tien-wei Wu,  \"A Review of the Wuhan Debacle: the Kuomintang-Communist Split of 1927.\" '' Journal of Asian Studies'' 1969 29(1): 125\u2013143</ref> The Northern Expedition proved successful and the KMT party came to power throughout China (except Manchuria) in 1927 under the leadership of Chiang. The capital of China was moved to [[Nanjing]] in order to be closer to the party's strong base in southern China.\n\nThe party was always concerned with strengthening Chinese identity at the same time it was discarding old traditions in the name of modernity. In 1929, the KMT government suppressed the textbook ''Modern Chinese History,'' widely used in secondary education. The Nationalists were concerned that, by not admitting the existence of the earliest emperors in ancient Chinese history, the book would weaken the foundation of the state. The case of the ''Modern Chinese History'' textbook reflects the symptoms of the period: banning the textbook strengthened the Nationalists' ideological control but also revealed their fear of the New Culture Movement and its more liberal ideological implications.  The KMT tried to destroy the Communist party of [[Mao Zedong]], but was unable to stop the invasion by Japan, which controlled most of the coastline and major cities, 1937\u20131945. Chiang Kai-shek secured massive military and economic aid from the United States, and in 1945 became one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, with a veto. The KMT governed most of China until it was defeated in the civil war by the Communists in 1949.\n\nThe leadership, the remaining army, and hundreds of thousands of businessmen and other supporters, two million in all, fled to Taiwan. They continued to operate there as the \"[[Republic of China]]\" and dreamed of invading and reconquering what they called \"Mainland China\". The United States, however, set up a naval cordon after 1950 that has since prevented an invasion in either direction.  The KMT regime kept the island under martial law for 38 years, killing up to 30,000 opponents during its dictatorial rule by Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo (1910\u20131988).  As the original leadership died off, it had to hold elections, allowed democracy, with full election of parliament in the early 1990s and first direct presidential election in 1996.  After a defeat by the Democratic Progressive Party in 2000, the KMT returned to power in the elections of 2008 and 2012.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who assumed the leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT) after the death of [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925]]\nThe Kuomintang traces its roots to the [[Revive China Society]], which was founded in 1895 and merged with several other anti-monarchist societies as the [[Revolutionary Alliance]] in 1905.  After the overthrow of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] and the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], the Kuomintang was formally established on 25 August 1912 at the [[Huguang Guild Hall]] in [[Beijing]] where the Revolutionary Alliance and several smaller revolutionary groups joined together to contest the first [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] elections.<ref>[[#Strand|Strand 2002]] 59\u201360</ref>\n[[File:Whampoa3.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Sun Yat-sen]] [middle] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] [on stage in uniform] at the founding of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] in 1924.]]\n[[File:Nationalist government Standing Committee 1925.jpg|250px|thumb|Some members of [[Nationalist government]] Standing Committee in 1925.]]\n[[Sun Yat-sen]], who had just stepped down as provisional [[president of the Republic of China]], was chosen as its overall leader under the title of [[premier]] ({{zh|t=\u7e3d\u7406 |p=z\u01d2ngl\u01d0}}), and [[Huang Xing]] was chosen as Sun's deputy. However, the most influential member of the party was the third ranking [[Song Jiaoren]], who mobilized mass support from gentry and merchants for the KMT on a platform of promoting constitutional parliamentary democracy. Though the party had an overwhelming majority in the first National Assembly, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Yuan Shikai]] started ignoring the parliamentary body in making presidential decisions, counter to the Constitution, and assassinated its parliamentary leader Song Jiaoren in [[Shanghai]] in 1913. Members of the KMT led by Sun Yat-sen staged the [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in July 1913, a poorly planned and ill-supported armed rising to overthrow Yuan, and failed. Yuan dissolved the KMT in November (whose members had largely fled into exile in Japan) and dismissed the parliament early in 1914. [[Yuan Shikai]] proclaimed himself emperor in December 1915.\nWhile exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]], but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including [[Huang Xing]], [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Hu Hanmin]] and [[Chen Jiongming]], refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against [[Yuan Shikai]]. In order to join the Chinese Revolutionary Party, members must take an oath of personal loyalty to Sun, which many old revolutionaries regarded as undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the revolution. Thus, many old revolutionaries did not join Sun's new organization, and he was largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period. Sun returned to China in 1917 to establish a rival government in [[Guangzhou]], but was soon forced out of office and exiled to Shanghai. There, with renewed support, he resurrected the KMT on 10 October 1919, but under the name of the ''Chinese'' Kuomintang, as the old party had simply been called the Kuomintang. In 1920, Sun and the KMT were restored in Guangdong. In 1923, the KMT and its government accepted aid from the [[Soviet Union]] after being denied recognition by the western powers. Soviet advisers \u2013 the most prominent of whom was [[Mikhail Borodin]], an agent of the [[Comintern]] \u2013 began to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], establishing a [[Leninism|Leninist]] party structure that lasted into the 1990s. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the KMT, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their separate party identities, forming the First United Front between the two parties.\n\nSoviet advisers also helped the Nationalists set up a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 [[Chiang Kai-shek]], one of Sun's lieutenants from the [[Tongmenghui]] days, was sent to Moscow for several months' military and political study. At the first party congress in 1924, which included non-KMT delegates such as members of the CCP, they adopted Sun's political theory, which included the [[Three Principles of the People]] \u2013 nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood.\n\n==War with Communists==\n[[File:kmtarmy.JPG|200px|thumb|[[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist soldiers]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].]]\n\nFollowing the death of [[Sun Yat-sen]], General [[Chiang Kai-shek]] emerged as the KMT leader and launched the [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] in 1926  to defeat the [[Warlord era (China)|northern warlords]] and unite China under the party. He halted briefly in [[Shanghai]] in 1927  to [[April 12 Incident|purge the Communists]] who had been allied with the KMT, which sparked the [[Chinese Civil War]]. When Kuomintang forces took Beijing, as the city was the ''[[de jure]]'' internationally recognized capital, though previously controlled by the feuding warlords, this event allowed the Kuomintang to receive widespread diplomatic recognition in the same year. The capital was moved from Beijing to Nanjing, the original capital of the [[Ming Dynasty]], and thus a symbolic purge of the final Qing elements. This period of KMT rule in China between 1927 and 1937 became known as the [[Nanjing decade]].\n\nIn sum, the KMT began as a heterogeneous group advocating American-inspired federalism and provincial independence. However, after its reorganization along Soviet lines, the party aimed to establish a centralized [[one-party state]] with one ideology \u2013 [[Three Principles of the People]]. This was even more evident following Sun's elevation into a cult figure after his death. The control by one single party began the period of \"political tutelage,\" whereby the party was to control the government while instructing the people on how to participate in a democratic system. After several military campaigns and with the help of German military advisors (German planned fifth \"extermination campaign\"), the Communists were forced to withdraw from their bases in southern and central China into the mountains in a massive military retreat known famously as the [[Long March]], an undertaking which would eventually increase their reputation among the peasants. Out of the 86,000 Communist soldiers that broke out of the pocket, only 20,000 would make the 10,000&nbsp;km march to Shaanxi province.  The Kuomintang continued to attack the Communists. This was in line with Chiang's policy of solving internal conflicts (warlords and communists) before fighting external invasions (Japan). However, [[Zhang Xueliang]], who believed that the Japanese invasion constituted the greater prevailing threat, took Chiang hostage during the [[Xi'an Incident]] in 1937 and forced Chiang to agree to an alliance with the Communists in the total war against the Japanese.  The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had officially started, and would last until the Japanese surrender in 1945. However, in many situations the alliance was in name only; after a brief period of cooperation, the armies began to fight the Japanese separately, rather than as coordinated allies. Conflicts between KMT and communists were still common during the war, and documented claims of Communist attacks upon the KMT forces, and vice versa, abound.\n\nIn these incidents, the KMT armies typically utilized more traditional tactics while the Communists chose guerilla tactics, leading to KMT claims that the Communists often refused to support the KMT troops, choosing to withdraw and let the KMT troops take the brunt of Japanese attacks.  These same guerilla tactics, honed against the Japanese forces, were used to great success later during open civil war, as well as the Allied forces in the Korean War and the U.S. forces in the Vietnam War.\n\n===1945\u201349===\nFull-scale civil war between the Communists and KMT resumed after the defeat of Japan. The Communist armies, previously a minor faction, grew rapidly in influence and power due to several errors on the KMT's part:  first, the KMT reduced troop levels precipitously after the Japanese surrender, leaving large numbers of able-bodied, trained fighting men who became unemployed and disgruntled with the KMT as prime recruits for the Communists.\n\nSecond, the collapse of the KMT regime can in part be attributed to the government's economic policies, which triggered capital flight among the businessmen who had been the KMT's strongest supporters.  The cotton textile industry was the leading sector of Chinese industry, but in 1948, shortages of raw cotton plunged the industry into dire straits. The KMT government responded with an aggressive control policy that directly procured cotton from producers to ensure a sufficient supply and established a price freeze on cotton thread and textiles. This policy failed because of resistance from cotton textile industrialists, who relocated textile facilities and capital to Hong Kong or Taiwan around the end of 1948 and early 1949 when prices soared and inflation spiraled out of control. Their withdrawal of support was a shattering blow to the morale of the KMT.\n\nAmong the most despised and ineffective efforts it undertook to contain inflation was the conversion to the gold standard for the national treasury and the [[Gold Standard Script]] ({{zh|t=\u91d1\u5713\u5238 |p=j\u012bn yu\u00e1n qu\u00e0n}}) in August 1948, outlawing private ownership of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, collecting all such precious metals and foreign exchange from the people and issuing the Gold Standard Script in exchange.  The new script became worthless in only ten months and greatly reinforced the nationwide perception of KMT as a corrupt or at best inept entity. Third, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his forces to defend the urbanized cities. This decision gave the Communists a chance to move freely through the countryside. At first, the KMT had the edge with the aid of weapons and ammunition from the United States. However, with [[hyperinflation]] and other economic ills, widespread corruption, the KMT continued to lose popular support.  At the same time, the suspension of American aid and tens of thousands of deserted or decommissioned soldiers being recruited to the Communist cause tipped the balance of power quickly to the Communist side, and the overwhelming popular support for the Communists in most of the country made it all but impossible for the KMT forces to carry out successful assaults against the Communists. By the end of 1949, the Communists controlled almost all of [[mainland China]], as the KMT retreated to [[Taiwan]] with a significant amount of China's national treasures and 2 million people, including military forces and refugees. Some party members stayed in the mainland and broke away from the main KMT to found the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang]], which still currently exists as one of the [[list of political parties in the People's Republic of China|eight minor registered parties]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\n==Ideology in Mainland China (1920s\u20131950s)==\n\n===Chinese nationalism===\nThe Kuomintang was a nationalist revolutionary party, which had been supported by the [[Soviet Union]].

He defined this principle of saying in his last days \"it's socialism and it's communism.\". The concept may be understood as [[social welfare]] as well. Sun understood it as an industrial economy and equality of land holdings for the Chinese peasant farmers. Here he was influenced by the American thinker [[Henry George]] (see [[Georgism]]) and German thinker [[Karl Marx]]; the [[land value tax]] in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. He divided livelihood into four areas: food, clothing, housing, and transportation; and planned out how an ideal (Chinese) government can take care of these for its people.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe Kuomintang was referred to having a socialist ideology. \"Equalization of land rights\" was a clause included by Dr. Sun in the original Tongmenhui.

However, as Bodenhorn (2002) shows, scholars are coming to an appreciation of its efforts to build a vibrant and dynamic state, before it lost on the battlefield to the Communists, but then had a second chance on Taiwan where they did succeed.<ref>\nTerry Bodenhorn, ed. ''Defining Modernity: Guomindang Rhetorics of a New China, 1920\u20131970'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe KMT promoted science and industry, and tried to eradicate such traditional practices as footbinding, and extravagant marriage and funerary customs.  The KMT had a complicated relationship to Christian missionary activity.  Many high officials (including Chiang) were Christians and American public opinion that favored China was based on the missionaries. At the same time in the villages the KMT  criticized missionary activity as an egregious example of imperialism. No significant action against the churches was taken but criticizing them was a much safer way to spread the anti-imperialist message of the KMT than taking on foreign firms or the U.S. The anti-Christian movements were important tactically for gaining the support of students and others in society who were angry at the influence of outsiders in China.\n\nThe Kuomintang purged China's education system of western ideas, introducing [[Confucianism]] into the curriculum. Education came under the total control of state, which meant, in effect, the Kuomintang party, via the Ministry of Education. Military and political classes on the Kuomintang's Three principles of the people were added. Textbooks, exams, degrees and educational instructors were all controlled by the state, as were all universities.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Caknr1VAqMC&dq=ma+bufang+communist+saw&q=riding+it+of+western+texts+and+models#v=onepage&q=it%20of%20western%20texts%20and%20models%20confucian&f=false|title=China's communist revolutions: fifty years of the People's Republic of China|author1=Werner Draguhn |author2=David S.

After Japan's defeat at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, [[General Order No. 1]] instructed Japan, who surrendered to the US, to surrender its troops in Taiwan to the forces of the Republic of China Kuomintang.\n\nTaiwan was placed under the administrative control of the Republic of China by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA), and the ROC put Taiwan under military occupation.  Tensions between the local Taiwanese and [[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]]s from [[mainland China]] increased in the intervening years culminating in a flashpoint on 27 February 1947 in [[Taipei]] when a dispute between a female cigarette vendor and an anti-smuggling officer triggered civil disorder and protests that would last for days.  The uprising turned bloody and was shortly put down by the [[Military of the Republic of China|ROC Army]] in the [[February 28 Incident]].\n\nFollowing the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[People's Republic of China|PRC]]) on 1 October 1949, the commanders of the PRC People's Liberation Army believed that [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] had to be taken before a final assault on Taiwan. KMT fought the [[Battle of Kuningtou]] and stopped the invasion. In 1950  Chiang took office in [[Taipei]] under the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]. The provision declared [[martial law in Taiwan]] and halted some democratic processes, including presidential and parliamentary elections, until the mainland could be recovered from the Communists. KMT estimated it would take 3 years to defeat the Communists.  The slogan was \"prepare in the first year, start fighting in the second, and conquer in the third year.\" However, various factors, including international pressure, are believed to have prevented the KMT from militarily engaging the Communists full-scale. A cold war with a couple of minor military conflicts was resulted in the early years. The various government bodies previously in [[Nanjing]] were re-established in Taipei as the KMT-controlled government actively claimed sovereignty over all China. The [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971 .\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chiang Ching-kuo.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Chiang Ching-kuo]], was the son of Chiang Kai-shek and Leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) between 1975 \u2013 1988.]] -->\nUntil the 1970s, KMT successfully pushed ahead with land reforms, developed the economy, implemented a democratic system in a lower level of the government, improved cross-Taiwan Strait relations, and created the [[Taiwan economic miracle]]. However KMT controlled the government under a one-party authoritarian state until reforms in the late 1970s through the 1990s. As a result of the [[February 28 Incident]] in 1947, Taiwanese people had to endure what is called the \"[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]\", a KMT-led political repression. The ROC in Taiwan was once referred to synonymously with the KMT and known simply as \"Nationalist China\" after its ruling party. In the 1970s, the KMT began to allow for \"supplemental elections\" in Taiwan to fill the seats of the aging representatives in parliament. Although opposition parties were not permitted, [[Tangwai]] (or, \"outside the party\") representatives were tolerated. In the 1980s, the KMT focused on transforming the government from a one-party system to a [[multi-party]] democracy one and embracing \"[[Taiwanese localization movement|Taiwanizing]]\". With the founding of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) in 1986, the KMT started competing against the DPP in Parliamentary elections. In 1991, [[martial law]] ceased when President [[Lee Teng-Hui]] terminated the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]. All parties started to be allowed to compete at all levels of elections, including the presidential election. [[Lee Teng-hui]], the ROC's first democratically elected President and the leader of the KMT during the 1990s, announced his advocacy of \"special state-to-state relations\" with the PRC. The PRC associated it with [[Taiwan independence]].\n\nThe KMT faced a split in 1994  that led to the formation of the [[New Party (Republic of China)|Chinese New Party]], alleged to be a result of Lee's \"corruptive ruling style\". The New Party has, since the purging of Lee, largely reintegrated into KMT. A much more serious split in the party occurred as a result of the [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 Presidential election]]. Upset at the choice of [[Lien Chan]] as the party's presidential nominee, former party Secretary-General [[James Soong]] launched an independent bid, which resulted in the expulsion of Soong and his supporters and the formation of the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People's First Party]] (PFP). The KMT candidate placed third behind Soong in the elections. After the election, Lee's strong relationship with the opponent became apparent. In order to prevent defections to the PFP, Lien moved the party away from Lee's pro-independence policies and became more favorable toward [[Chinese reunification]]. This shift led to Lee's expulsion from the party and the formation of the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]].\n\n==Current issues and challenges==\n{{Update|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Kuomintang nanjing.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Lien Chan]] [middle] and [[Wu Po-hsiung]] [second left] and the Kuomintang touring the [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in [[Nanjing]], the [[People's Republic of China]]. The [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|Pan-Blue coalition visited the mainland]] in 2005.]]\nAs the ruling party on Taiwan, the KMT amassed a vast business empire of banks, investment companies, petrochemical firms, and television and radio stations, thought to have made it the world's richest political party, with assets once estimated to be around US$2\u201310 billion.<ref name=\"KMT_asset\">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=898158|publisher=Economist|title= Taiwan's Kuomintang On the brink|date=6 Dec 2001}}</ref> Although this war chest appeared to help the KMT until the mid-1990s, it later led to accusations of corruption (see [[Black gold (politics)]]). After 2000, the KMT's financial holdings appeared to be more of a liability than a benefit, and the KMT started to divest its assets. However, the transactions were not disclosed and the whereabouts of the money earned from selling assets (if it has gone anywhere) is unknown. There were accusations in the [[2004 ROC presidential election|2004 presidential election]] that the KMT retained assets that were illegally acquired. Currently, there is a law proposed by the DPP in the [[Legislative Yuan]] to recover illegally acquired party assets and return them to the government; however, since the pan-Blue alliance, the KMT and its smaller partner PFP, control the legislature, it is very unlikely to be passed. The KMT also acknowledged that part of its assets were acquired through extra-legal means and thus promised to \"retro-endow\" them to the government. However, the quantity of the assets which should be classified as illegal are still under heated debate; [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]], in its capacity as ruling party from 2000\u20132008, claimed that there is much more that the KMT has yet to acknowledge. Also, the KMT actively sold assets under its title in order to quench its recent financial difficulties, which the DPP argues is illegal. Former KMT Chairman [[Ma Ying-Jeou]]'s position is that the KMT will sell some of its properties at below market rates rather than return them to the government and that the details of these transactions will not be publicly disclosed.\n\nIn December 2003, then-KMT chairman (present chairman emeritus) and presidential candidate [[Lien Chan]] initiated what appeared to some to be a major shift in the party's position on the linked questions of Chinese reunification and Taiwan independence. Speaking to foreign journalists, Lien said that while the KMT was opposed to \"immediate independence,\" it did not wish to be classed as \"pro-reunificationist\" either.\n\nAt the same time, [[Wang Jin-pyng]], speaker of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and the Pan-Blue Coalition's campaign manager in the [[2004 ROC presidential election|2004 presidential election]], said that the party no longer opposed Taiwan's \"eventual independence.\" This statement was later clarified as meaning that the KMT opposes any immediate decision on unification and independence and would like to have this issue resolved by future generations. The KMT's position on the cross-strait relationship was redefined as hoping to remain in the current neither-independent-nor-united situation.\n[[File:Ma Ying-jeou Berkeley 2006 (cropped).jpg|210px|left|thumb|[[Ma Ying-jeou]], the former ROC President and was the former chairman of the Kuomintang from 2005 to 2007.]]\nIn 2005, then-party chairman [[Lien Chan]] announced that he was to leave his office. The two leading contenders for the position include [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and [[Wang Jin-pyng]]. On 5 April 2005, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said he wished to lead the opposition Kuomintang with Wang Jin-pyng. On 16 July 2005, Ma was elected as KMT chairman in the [[2005 KMT chairmanship election|first contested leadership in Kuomintang's 93-year history]]. Some 54 percent of the party's 1.04 million members cast their ballots. [[Ma Ying-jeou]] garnered 72.4 percent of vote share, or 375,056 votes, against [[Wang Jin-pyng]]'s 27.6 percent, or 143,268 votes. After failing to convince Wang to stay on as a vice chairman, Ma named holdovers [[Wu Po-hsiung]] (\u5433\u4f2f\u96c4), [[Chiang Pin-kung]] (\u6c5f\u4e19\u5764), and [[Lin Cheng-chi]] (\u6797\u6f84\u679d), as well as long-time party administrator and strategist [[John Kuan]] (\u95dc\u4e2d), as vice-chairmen; all appointments were approved by a hand count of party delegates.\n\nThere has been a recent warming of relations between the [[pan-blue coalition]] and the PRC, with prominent members of both the KMT and PFP in active discussions with officials on the Mainland. In February 2004, it appeared that KMT had opened a campaign office for the Lien-Soong ticket in [[Shanghai]] targeting Taiwanese businessmen. However, after an adverse reaction in Taiwan, the KMT quickly declared that the office was opened without official knowledge or authorization. In addition, the PRC issued a statement forbidding open campaigning in the Mainland and formally stated that it had no preference as to which candidate won and cared only about the positions of the winning candidate.\n\nOn 28 March 2005, thirty members of the Kuomintang (KMT), led by KMT vice chairman [[Chiang Pin-kung]], [[2005 Kuomintang visits to Mainland|arrived in mainland China]].  This marked the first official visit by the KMT to the mainland since it was defeated by communist forces in 1949 (although KMT members including Chiang had made individual visits in the past). The delegates began their itinerary by paying homage to the revolutionary martyrs of the Tenth Uprising at [[Huanghuagang]]. They subsequently flew to the former ROC capital of [[Nanjing]] to commemorate Sun Yat-sen. <!-- The ''[[China Times]]'', a Taiwan-based newspaper, said the group was to meet Thursday with [[Jia Qinglin]], nominally fourth-ranking CPC politician and a deputy head of the cabinet-level [[Taiwan Affairs Office]]. A top agenda item for Chiang was the anti-secession law, passed by China's parliament earlier in the month that authorized the use of \"non-peaceful means\" against Taiwan if it were to move towards formal independence.--> During the trip KMT signed a 10-points agreement with the CPC. The opponents regarded this visit as the prelude of the third KMT-CPC cooperation. Weeks afterwards, in May, Chairman [[Lien Chan]] visited the mainland and met with [[Hu Jintao]]. No agreements were signed because [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s government threatened to prosecute the KMT delegation for treason and violation of R.O.C. laws prohibiting citizens from collaborating with Communists.\n\nOn 13 February 2007, Ma was indicted by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office on charges of allegedly embezzling approximately NT$11 million (US$339,000), regarding the issue of \"special expenses\" while he was mayor of Taipei. Shortly after the indictment, he submitted his resignation as chairman of the Kuomintang at the same press conference at which he formally announced his candidacy for President.  Ma argued that it was customary for officials to use the special expense fund for personal expenses undertaken in the course of their official duties.  In December 2007, Ma was acquitted of all charges and immediately filed suit against the prosecutors who are also appealing the acquittal.\n\n==Leaders==\n[[File:Kuomintang Central Committee 20050405.jpg|250px|thumb|The Kuomintang headquarters in [[Taipei City]].

The name translates as \"China's National People's Party\" and was historically referred to as the Chinese Nationalists. The Party was initially founded on 23 August 1912, by [[Sun Yat-sen]] but dissolved in November 1913. It reformed on October 10th 1919, again led by Sun Yat-sen, and became the ruling party in China. After Sun's death, the party was dominated from 1927 to 1975 by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Though the KMT lost the civil war with the [[Communist Party of China]] in 1949, the party took control of Taiwan and remains a major political party of the [[Republic of China]] based in Taiwan.\n\nFounded in 1912 by [[Sun Yat-sen]], the KMT helped topple the Qing Emperor and promoted modernization along Western lines. The party played a significant part in the first Chinese first National Assembly where it was the majority party. However the KMT failed to achieve complete control. The post of president was given to [[Yuan Shikai]] (1859\u20131916) as reward for his part in the revolution. Yuan Shikai abused his powers, overriding the constitution and creating strong tensions between himself and the other parties. In July 1913, the KMT staged a 'Second Revolution' to depose Yuan. This failed and the following crack down by Yuan led to the dissolution of the KMT and the exile of its leadership, mostly to Japan. Subsequently, Yuan Shikai had himself made Emperor of China.\n\nIn exile, Sun Yat-sen and other former KMT members founded several revolutionary parties under various names but with little success. These parties were united by Sun in 1919 under the title \"The Kuomintang of China\". The new party returned to Guangzhou in China in 1920 where it set up a government but failed to achieve control of all of China. After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, China fractured into many regions controlled by warlords. To strengthen the party's position, it accepted aid and support from the Soviet Union and its Comintern. The fledgling Communist Party of China was encouraged to join the KMT and thus formed the First United Front. The KMT gradually increased its sphere of influence from its Guangzhou base. Sun Yat-sen died in 1925 and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (1887\u20131975) became the KMT strong man. In 1926 Chiang led a military operation known as the [[Northern Expedition]] against the warlords that controlled much of the country. In 1927, Chiang instigated the [[April 12 Incident]] in Shanghai in which the Communist Party of China and Communist elements of the KMT were purged.<ref>The event is also known as the Shanghai Massacre of 1927. See Tien-wei Wu,  \"A Review of the Wuhan Debacle: the Kuomintang-Communist Split of 1927.\" '' Journal of Asian Studies'' 1969 29(1): 125\u2013143</ref> The Northern Expedition proved successful and the KMT party came to power throughout China (except Manchuria) in 1927 under the leadership of Chiang. The capital of China was moved to [[Nanjing]] in order to be closer to the party's strong base in southern China.\n\nThe party was always concerned with strengthening Chinese identity at the same time it was discarding old traditions in the name of modernity. In 1929, the KMT government suppressed the textbook ''Modern Chinese History,'' widely used in secondary education. The Nationalists were concerned that, by not admitting the existence of the earliest emperors in ancient Chinese history, the book would weaken the foundation of the state. The case of the ''Modern Chinese History'' textbook reflects the symptoms of the period: banning the textbook strengthened the Nationalists' ideological control but also revealed their fear of the New Culture Movement and its more liberal ideological implications.  The KMT tried to destroy the Communist party of [[Mao Zedong]], but was unable to stop the invasion by Japan, which controlled most of the coastline and major cities, 1937\u20131945. Chiang Kai-shek secured massive military and economic aid from the United States, and in 1945 became one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, with a veto. The KMT governed most of China until it was defeated in the civil war by the Communists in 1949.\n\nThe leadership, the remaining army, and hundreds of thousands of businessmen and other supporters, two million in all, fled to Taiwan. They continued to operate there as the \"[[Republic of China]]\" and dreamed of invading and reconquering what they called \"Mainland China\". The United States, however, set up a naval cordon after 1950 that has since prevented an invasion in either direction.  The KMT regime kept the island under martial law for 38 years, killing up to 30,000 opponents during its dictatorial rule by Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo (1910\u20131988).  As the original leadership died off, it had to hold elections, allowed democracy, with full election of parliament in the early 1990s and first direct presidential election in 1996.  After a defeat by the Democratic Progressive Party in 2000, the KMT returned to power in the elections of 2008 and 2012.\n\n==Early years==\n[[File:Chiang Kai-shek.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], who assumed the leadership of the Kuomintang (KMT) after the death of [[Sun Yat-sen]] in 1925]]\nThe Kuomintang traces its roots to the [[Revive China Society]], which was founded in 1895 and merged with several other anti-monarchist societies as the [[Revolutionary Alliance]] in 1905.  After the overthrow of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in the 1911 [[Xinhai Revolution]] and the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], the Kuomintang was formally established on 25 August 1912 at the [[Huguang Guild Hall]] in [[Beijing]] where the Revolutionary Alliance and several smaller revolutionary groups joined together to contest the first [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] elections.<ref>[[#Strand|Strand 2002]] 59\u201360</ref>\n[[File:Whampoa3.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Sun Yat-sen]] [middle] and [[Chiang Kai-shek]] [on stage in uniform] at the founding of the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] in 1924.]]\n[[File:Nationalist government Standing Committee 1925.jpg|250px|thumb|Some members of [[Nationalist government]] Standing Committee in 1925.]]\n[[Sun Yat-sen]], who had just stepped down as provisional [[president of the Republic of China]], was chosen as its overall leader under the title of [[premier]] ({{zh|t=\u7e3d\u7406 |p=z\u01d2ngl\u01d0}}), and [[Huang Xing]] was chosen as Sun's deputy. However, the most influential member of the party was the third ranking [[Song Jiaoren]], who mobilized mass support from gentry and merchants for the KMT on a platform of promoting constitutional parliamentary democracy. Though the party had an overwhelming majority in the first National Assembly, [[President of the Republic of China|President]] [[Yuan Shikai]] started ignoring the parliamentary body in making presidential decisions, counter to the Constitution, and assassinated its parliamentary leader Song Jiaoren in [[Shanghai]] in 1913. Members of the KMT led by Sun Yat-sen staged the [[Second Revolution (China)|Second Revolution]] in July 1913, a poorly planned and ill-supported armed rising to overthrow Yuan, and failed. Yuan dissolved the KMT in November (whose members had largely fled into exile in Japan) and dismissed the parliament early in 1914. [[Yuan Shikai]] proclaimed himself emperor in December 1915.\nWhile exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the [[Chinese Revolutionary Party]], but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including [[Huang Xing]], [[Wang Jingwei]], [[Hu Hanmin]] and [[Chen Jiongming]], refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against [[Yuan Shikai]]. In order to join the Chinese Revolutionary Party, members must take an oath of personal loyalty to Sun, which many old revolutionaries regarded as undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of the revolution. Thus, many old revolutionaries did not join Sun's new organization, and he was largely sidelined within the Republican movement during this period. Sun returned to China in 1917 to establish a rival government in [[Guangzhou]], but was soon forced out of office and exiled to Shanghai. There, with renewed support, he resurrected the KMT on 10 October 1919, but under the name of the ''Chinese'' Kuomintang, as the old party had simply been called the Kuomintang. In 1920, Sun and the KMT were restored in Guangdong. In 1923, the KMT and its government accepted aid from the [[Soviet Union]] after being denied recognition by the western powers. Soviet advisers \u2013 the most prominent of whom was [[Mikhail Borodin]], an agent of the [[Comintern]] \u2013 began to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the KMT along the lines of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], establishing a [[Leninism|Leninist]] party structure that lasted into the 1990s. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the KMT, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their separate party identities, forming the First United Front between the two parties.\n\nSoviet advisers also helped the Nationalists set up a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 [[Chiang Kai-shek]], one of Sun's lieutenants from the [[Tongmenghui]] days, was sent to Moscow for several months' military and political study. At the first party congress in 1924, which included non-KMT delegates such as members of the CCP, they adopted Sun's political theory, which included the [[Three Principles of the People]] \u2013 nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood.\n\n==War with Communists==\n[[File:kmtarmy.JPG|200px|thumb|[[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist soldiers]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].]]\n\nFollowing the death of [[Sun Yat-sen]], General [[Chiang Kai-shek]] emerged as the KMT leader and launched the [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] in 1926  to defeat the [[Warlord era (China)|northern warlords]] and unite China under the party. He halted briefly in [[Shanghai]] in 1927  to [[April 12 Incident|purge the Communists]] who had been allied with the KMT, which sparked the [[Chinese Civil War]]. When Kuomintang forces took Beijing, as the city was the ''[[de jure]]'' internationally recognized capital, though previously controlled by the feuding warlords, this event allowed the Kuomintang to receive widespread diplomatic recognition in the same year. The capital was moved from Beijing to Nanjing, the original capital of the [[Ming Dynasty]], and thus a symbolic purge of the final Qing elements. This period of KMT rule in China between 1927 and 1937 became known as the [[Nanjing decade]].\n\nIn sum, the KMT began as a heterogeneous group advocating American-inspired federalism and provincial independence. However, after its reorganization along Soviet lines, the party aimed to establish a centralized [[one-party state]] with one ideology \u2013 [[Three Principles of the People]]. This was even more evident following Sun's elevation into a cult figure after his death. The control by one single party began the period of \"political tutelage,\" whereby the party was to control the government while instructing the people on how to participate in a democratic system. After several military campaigns and with the help of German military advisors (German planned fifth \"extermination campaign\"), the Communists were forced to withdraw from their bases in southern and central China into the mountains in a massive military retreat known famously as the [[Long March]], an undertaking which would eventually increase their reputation among the peasants. Out of the 86,000 Communist soldiers that broke out of the pocket, only 20,000 would make the 10,000&nbsp;km march to Shaanxi province.  The Kuomintang continued to attack the Communists. This was in line with Chiang's policy of solving internal conflicts (warlords and communists) before fighting external invasions (Japan). However, [[Zhang Xueliang]], who believed that the Japanese invasion constituted the greater prevailing threat, took Chiang hostage during the [[Xi'an Incident]] in 1937 and forced Chiang to agree to an alliance with the Communists in the total war against the Japanese.  The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had officially started, and would last until the Japanese surrender in 1945. However, in many situations the alliance was in name only; after a brief period of cooperation, the armies began to fight the Japanese separately, rather than as coordinated allies. Conflicts between KMT and communists were still common during the war, and documented claims of Communist attacks upon the KMT forces, and vice versa, abound.\n\nIn these incidents, the KMT armies typically utilized more traditional tactics while the Communists chose guerilla tactics, leading to KMT claims that the Communists often refused to support the KMT troops, choosing to withdraw and let the KMT troops take the brunt of Japanese attacks.  These same guerilla tactics, honed against the Japanese forces, were used to great success later during open civil war, as well as the Allied forces in the Korean War and the U.S. forces in the Vietnam War.\n\n===1945\u201349===\nFull-scale civil war between the Communists and KMT resumed after the defeat of Japan. The Communist armies, previously a minor faction, grew rapidly in influence and power due to several errors on the KMT's part:  first, the KMT reduced troop levels precipitously after the Japanese surrender, leaving large numbers of able-bodied, trained fighting men who became unemployed and disgruntled with the KMT as prime recruits for the Communists.\n\nSecond, the collapse of the KMT regime can in part be attributed to the government's economic policies, which triggered capital flight among the businessmen who had been the KMT's strongest supporters.  The cotton textile industry was the leading sector of Chinese industry, but in 1948, shortages of raw cotton plunged the industry into dire straits. The KMT government responded with an aggressive control policy that directly procured cotton from producers to ensure a sufficient supply and established a price freeze on cotton thread and textiles. This policy failed because of resistance from cotton textile industrialists, who relocated textile facilities and capital to Hong Kong or Taiwan around the end of 1948 and early 1949 when prices soared and inflation spiraled out of control. Their withdrawal of support was a shattering blow to the morale of the KMT.\n\nAmong the most despised and ineffective efforts it undertook to contain inflation was the conversion to the gold standard for the national treasury and the [[Gold Standard Script]] ({{zh|t=\u91d1\u5713\u5238 |p=j\u012bn yu\u00e1n qu\u00e0n}}) in August 1948, outlawing private ownership of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, collecting all such precious metals and foreign exchange from the people and issuing the Gold Standard Script in exchange.  The new script became worthless in only ten months and greatly reinforced the nationwide perception of KMT as a corrupt or at best inept entity. Third, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his forces to defend the urbanized cities. This decision gave the Communists a chance to move freely through the countryside. At first, the KMT had the edge with the aid of weapons and ammunition from the United States. However, with [[hyperinflation]] and other economic ills, widespread corruption, the KMT continued to lose popular support.  At the same time, the suspension of American aid and tens of thousands of deserted or decommissioned soldiers being recruited to the Communist cause tipped the balance of power quickly to the Communist side, and the overwhelming popular support for the Communists in most of the country made it all but impossible for the KMT forces to carry out successful assaults against the Communists. By the end of 1949, the Communists controlled almost all of [[mainland China]], as the KMT retreated to [[Taiwan]] with a significant amount of China's national treasures and 2 million people, including military forces and refugees. Some party members stayed in the mainland and broke away from the main KMT to found the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang]], which still currently exists as one of the [[list of political parties in the People's Republic of China|eight minor registered parties]] in the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\n==Ideology in Mainland China (1920s\u20131950s)==\n\n===Chinese nationalism===\nThe Kuomintang was a nationalist revolutionary party, which had been supported by the [[Soviet Union]].

However, as Bodenhorn (2002) shows, scholars are coming to an appreciation of its efforts to build a vibrant and dynamic state, before it lost on the battlefield to the Communists, but then had a second chance on Taiwan where they did succeed.<ref>\nTerry Bodenhorn, ed. ''Defining Modernity: Guomindang Rhetorics of a New China, 1920\u20131970'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe KMT promoted science and industry, and tried to eradicate such traditional practices as footbinding, and extravagant marriage and funerary customs.  The KMT had a complicated relationship to Christian missionary activity.  Many high officials (including Chiang) were Christians and American public opinion that favored China was based on the missionaries. At the same time in the villages the KMT  criticized missionary activity as an egregious example of imperialism. No significant action against the churches was taken but criticizing them was a much safer way to spread the anti-imperialist message of the KMT than taking on foreign firms or the U.S. The anti-Christian movements were important tactically for gaining the support of students and others in society who were angry at the influence of outsiders in China.\n\nThe Kuomintang purged China's education system of western ideas, introducing [[Confucianism]] into the curriculum. Education came under the total control of state, which meant, in effect, the Kuomintang party, via the Ministry of Education. Military and political classes on the Kuomintang's Three principles of the people were added. Textbooks, exams, degrees and educational instructors were all controlled by the state, as were all universities.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Caknr1VAqMC&dq=ma+bufang+communist+saw&q=riding+it+of+western+texts+and+models#v=onepage&q=it%20of%20western%20texts%20and%20models%20confucian&f=false|title=China's communist revolutions: fifty years of the People's Republic of China|author1=Werner Draguhn |author2=David S.

After Japan's defeat at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, [[General Order No. 1]] instructed Japan, who surrendered to the US, to surrender its troops in Taiwan to the forces of the Republic of China Kuomintang.\n\nTaiwan was placed under the administrative control of the Republic of China by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA), and the ROC put Taiwan under military occupation.  Tensions between the local Taiwanese and [[Mainland Chinese|mainlander]]s from [[mainland China]] increased in the intervening years culminating in a flashpoint on 27 February 1947 in [[Taipei]] when a dispute between a female cigarette vendor and an anti-smuggling officer triggered civil disorder and protests that would last for days.  The uprising turned bloody and was shortly put down by the [[Military of the Republic of China|ROC Army]] in the [[February 28 Incident]].\n\nFollowing the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] ([[People's Republic of China|PRC]]) on 1 October 1949, the commanders of the PRC People's Liberation Army believed that [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] had to be taken before a final assault on Taiwan. KMT fought the [[Battle of Kuningtou]] and stopped the invasion. In 1950  Chiang took office in [[Taipei]] under the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]. The provision declared [[martial law in Taiwan]] and halted some democratic processes, including presidential and parliamentary elections, until the mainland could be recovered from the Communists. KMT estimated it would take 3 years to defeat the Communists.  The slogan was \"prepare in the first year, start fighting in the second, and conquer in the third year.\" However, various factors, including international pressure, are believed to have prevented the KMT from militarily engaging the Communists full-scale. A cold war with a couple of minor military conflicts was resulted in the early years. The various government bodies previously in [[Nanjing]] were re-established in Taipei as the KMT-controlled government actively claimed sovereignty over all China. The [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan retained [[China and the United Nations|China's seat in the United Nations]] until 1971 .\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chiang Ching-kuo.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Chiang Ching-kuo]], was the son of Chiang Kai-shek and Leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) between 1975 \u2013 1988.]] -->\nUntil the 1970s, KMT successfully pushed ahead with land reforms, developed the economy, implemented a democratic system in a lower level of the government, improved cross-Taiwan Strait relations, and created the [[Taiwan economic miracle]]. However KMT controlled the government under a one-party authoritarian state until reforms in the late 1970s through the 1990s. As a result of the [[February 28 Incident]] in 1947, Taiwanese people had to endure what is called the \"[[White Terror (Taiwan)|White Terror]]\", a KMT-led political repression. The ROC in Taiwan was once referred to synonymously with the KMT and known simply as \"Nationalist China\" after its ruling party. In the 1970s, the KMT began to allow for \"supplemental elections\" in Taiwan to fill the seats of the aging representatives in parliament. Although opposition parties were not permitted, [[Tangwai]] (or, \"outside the party\") representatives were tolerated. In the 1980s, the KMT focused on transforming the government from a one-party system to a [[multi-party]] democracy one and embracing \"[[Taiwanese localization movement|Taiwanizing]]\". With the founding of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) in 1986, the KMT started competing against the DPP in Parliamentary elections. In 1991, [[martial law]] ceased when President [[Lee Teng-Hui]] terminated the [[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]. All parties started to be allowed to compete at all levels of elections, including the presidential election. [[Lee Teng-hui]], the ROC's first democratically elected President and the leader of the KMT during the 1990s, announced his advocacy of \"special state-to-state relations\" with the PRC. The PRC associated it with [[Taiwan independence]].\n\nThe KMT faced a split in 1994  that led to the formation of the [[New Party (Republic of China)|Chinese New Party]], alleged to be a result of Lee's \"corruptive ruling style\". The New Party has, since the purging of Lee, largely reintegrated into KMT. A much more serious split in the party occurred as a result of the [[2000 ROC presidential election|2000 Presidential election]]. Upset at the choice of [[Lien Chan]] as the party's presidential nominee, former party Secretary-General [[James Soong]] launched an independent bid, which resulted in the expulsion of Soong and his supporters and the formation of the [[People First Party (Republic of China)|People's First Party]] (PFP). The KMT candidate placed third behind Soong in the elections. After the election, Lee's strong relationship with the opponent became apparent. In order to prevent defections to the PFP, Lien moved the party away from Lee's pro-independence policies and became more favorable toward [[Chinese reunification]]. This shift led to Lee's expulsion from the party and the formation of the [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]].\n\n==Current issues and challenges==\n{{Update|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Kuomintang nanjing.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Lien Chan]] [middle] and [[Wu Po-hsiung]] [second left] and the Kuomintang touring the [[Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum]] in [[Nanjing]], the [[People's Republic of China]]. The [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China|Pan-Blue coalition visited the mainland]] in 2005.]]\nAs the ruling party on Taiwan, the KMT amassed a vast business empire of banks, investment companies, petrochemical firms, and television and radio stations, thought to have made it the world's richest political party, with assets once estimated to be around US$2\u201310 billion.<ref name=\"KMT_asset\">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=898158|publisher=Economist|title= Taiwan's Kuomintang On the brink|date=6 Dec 2001}}</ref> Although this war chest appeared to help the KMT until the mid-1990s, it later led to accusations of corruption (see [[Black gold (politics)]]). After 2000, the KMT's financial holdings appeared to be more of a liability than a benefit, and the KMT started to divest its assets. However, the transactions were not disclosed and the whereabouts of the money earned from selling assets (if it has gone anywhere) is unknown. There were accusations in the [[2004 ROC presidential election|2004 presidential election]] that the KMT retained assets that were illegally acquired. Currently, there is a law proposed by the DPP in the [[Legislative Yuan]] to recover illegally acquired party assets and return them to the government; however, since the pan-Blue alliance, the KMT and its smaller partner PFP, control the legislature, it is very unlikely to be passed. The KMT also acknowledged that part of its assets were acquired through extra-legal means and thus promised to \"retro-endow\" them to the government. However, the quantity of the assets which should be classified as illegal are still under heated debate; [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]], in its capacity as ruling party from 2000\u20132008, claimed that there is much more that the KMT has yet to acknowledge. Also, the KMT actively sold assets under its title in order to quench its recent financial difficulties, which the DPP argues is illegal. Former KMT Chairman [[Ma Ying-Jeou]]'s position is that the KMT will sell some of its properties at below market rates rather than return them to the government and that the details of these transactions will not be publicly disclosed.\n\nIn December 2003, then-KMT chairman (present chairman emeritus) and presidential candidate [[Lien Chan]] initiated what appeared to some to be a major shift in the party's position on the linked questions of Chinese reunification and Taiwan independence. Speaking to foreign journalists, Lien said that while the KMT was opposed to \"immediate independence,\" it did not wish to be classed as \"pro-reunificationist\" either.\n\nAt the same time, [[Wang Jin-pyng]], speaker of the [[Legislative Yuan]] and the Pan-Blue Coalition's campaign manager in the [[2004 ROC presidential election|2004 presidential election]], said that the party no longer opposed Taiwan's \"eventual independence.\" This statement was later clarified as meaning that the KMT opposes any immediate decision on unification and independence and would like to have this issue resolved by future generations. The KMT's position on the cross-strait relationship was redefined as hoping to remain in the current neither-independent-nor-united situation.\n[[File:Ma Ying-jeou Berkeley 2006 (cropped).jpg|210px|left|thumb|[[Ma Ying-jeou]], the former ROC President and was the former chairman of the Kuomintang from 2005 to 2007.]]\nIn 2005, then-party chairman [[Lien Chan]] announced that he was to leave his office. The two leading contenders for the position include [[Ma Ying-jeou]] and [[Wang Jin-pyng]]. On 5 April 2005, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said he wished to lead the opposition Kuomintang with Wang Jin-pyng. On 16 July 2005, Ma was elected as KMT chairman in the [[2005 KMT chairmanship election|first contested leadership in Kuomintang's 93-year history]]. Some 54 percent of the party's 1.04 million members cast their ballots. [[Ma Ying-jeou]] garnered 72.4 percent of vote share, or 375,056 votes, against [[Wang Jin-pyng]]'s 27.6 percent, or 143,268 votes. After failing to convince Wang to stay on as a vice chairman, Ma named holdovers [[Wu Po-hsiung]] (\u5433\u4f2f\u96c4), [[Chiang Pin-kung]] (\u6c5f\u4e19\u5764), and [[Lin Cheng-chi]] (\u6797\u6f84\u679d), as well as long-time party administrator and strategist [[John Kuan]] (\u95dc\u4e2d), as vice-chairmen; all appointments were approved by a hand count of party delegates.\n\nThere has been a recent warming of relations between the [[pan-blue coalition]] and the PRC, with prominent members of both the KMT and PFP in active discussions with officials on the Mainland. In February 2004, it appeared that KMT had opened a campaign office for the Lien-Soong ticket in [[Shanghai]] targeting Taiwanese businessmen. However, after an adverse reaction in Taiwan, the KMT quickly declared that the office was opened without official knowledge or authorization. In addition, the PRC issued a statement forbidding open campaigning in the Mainland and formally stated that it had no preference as to which candidate won and cared only about the positions of the winning candidate.\n\nOn 28 March 2005, thirty members of the Kuomintang (KMT), led by KMT vice chairman [[Chiang Pin-kung]], [[2005 Kuomintang visits to Mainland|arrived in mainland China]].  This marked the first official visit by the KMT to the mainland since it was defeated by communist forces in 1949 (although KMT members including Chiang had made individual visits in the past). The delegates began their itinerary by paying homage to the revolutionary martyrs of the Tenth Uprising at [[Huanghuagang]]. They subsequently flew to the former ROC capital of [[Nanjing]] to commemorate Sun Yat-sen. <!-- The ''[[China Times]]'', a Taiwan-based newspaper, said the group was to meet Thursday with [[Jia Qinglin]], nominally fourth-ranking CPC politician and a deputy head of the cabinet-level [[Taiwan Affairs Office]]. A top agenda item for Chiang was the anti-secession law, passed by China's parliament earlier in the month that authorized the use of \"non-peaceful means\" against Taiwan if it were to move towards formal independence.--> During the trip KMT signed a 10-points agreement with the CPC. The opponents regarded this visit as the prelude of the third KMT-CPC cooperation. Weeks afterwards, in May, Chairman [[Lien Chan]] visited the mainland and met with [[Hu Jintao]]. No agreements were signed because [[Chen Shui-bian]]'s government threatened to prosecute the KMT delegation for treason and violation of R.O.C. laws prohibiting citizens from collaborating with Communists.\n\nOn 13 February 2007, Ma was indicted by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office on charges of allegedly embezzling approximately NT$11 million (US$339,000), regarding the issue of \"special expenses\" while he was mayor of Taipei. Shortly after the indictment, he submitted his resignation as chairman of the Kuomintang at the same press conference at which he formally announced his candidacy for President.  Ma argued that it was customary for officials to use the special expense fund for personal expenses undertaken in the course of their official duties.  In December 2007, Ma was acquitted of all charges and immediately filed suit against the prosecutors who are also appealing the acquittal.\n\n==Leaders==\n[[File:Kuomintang Central Committee 20050405.jpg|250px|thumb|The Kuomintang headquarters in [[Taipei City]].

These immigrants landed in Hawaii to work on plantations. After being dissatisfied with the work, Koreans began to spread to California, New York, and Chicago.<ref name=\"Korean Americans\"/>\nThe [[1910 U.S. Census]] did not record any Koreans as living in the State of Illinois.<ref name=KimYJThesisp132>Kim, Youn-Jin, \"From Immigrants to Ethnics: The Life-Worlds of Korean Immigrants in Chicago,\" p. 132.</ref> In 1920, there were about 27 Koreans in Chicago, and that this figure increased to 64 in 1930.<ref name=KimKiljoongp157>Kim, Kiljoong, p.

In the 1930s Korean students discussed the independence movement during gatherings at the [[International House of Chicago|International House]]<ref name=KimKiljoongp158>Kim, Kiljoong, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NtKHGOCFB10C&pg=PA158 158].</ref> of the University of Chicago.\n\nThe Korean population's size remained constant during [[World War II]].<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/> Due to a labor shortage, Koreans during World War II accumulated some capital.<ref name=KimYJThesisp132/> They used the capital to start small businesses.<ref name=KimYJThesisp132133>Kim, Youn-Jin, \"From Immigrants to Ethnics: The Life-Worlds of Korean Immigrants in Chicago,\" p. 132-133.</ref> New economic opportunities that occurred during the war allowed some to open grocery stores and restaurants,<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/> which were the common forms of Korean small business.<ref name=KimYJThesisp132133/> After the colonization of Korea ended in 1945, several Koreans in Chicago, including the bulk of the students, left. The bulk of the non-students stayed in Chicago. There were almost no Koreans who arrived in Chicago from 1945 to 1950.<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/>\n\nIn the late 1950s there were several dozen South Korean families in Chicago.<ref name=Cutlerp193/> In 1960 Chicago had 500 Koreans.<ref name=KimYJThesisp133>Kim, Youn-Jin, \"From Immigrants to Ethnics: The Life-Worlds of Korean Immigrants in Chicago,\" p. 133.</ref> The number of Koreans in Chicago increased after 1960,<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/> and between 1962 and 1972 the Korean population increased by twenty-fold due to revisions in immigration policies.<ref name=KimYJThesisp133/> The numbers of Koreans increased after the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] passed.<ref name=Cutlerp193/> In 1968 there were 2,000 Koreans. In 1970 there were 4,000 Koreans. In 1972 there were 10,000 Koreans.<ref name=KimYJThesisp133/> Students were a large group within the new Korean population, and many of them went on to become white collar professionals.<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/> Other significant groups included agricultural workers, coal miners, doctors, martial arts instructors, and nurses. The agricultural workers had previously migrated to South Africa before coming to Chicago, and the coal miners had previously migrated to West Germany. Koreans who had lived in other countries previously more easily adjusted to American life, and that there was competition among the former students and the Koreans who had lived in Germany.<ref name=KimKiljoongp159>Kim, Kiljoong, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NtKHGOCFB10C&pg=PA159 159].</ref> Those who had lived in West Germany mainly entered small business while the former students became professionals and \"somewhat assimilated\" by moving to the suburbs.<ref name=KimKiljoongp159/>\n\nThe [[U.S. Census Bureau]] estimated that 7,313 Koreans lived in the Chicago area in 1970. Of them, 60% were female. The [[War Brides Act]] caused a disproportionate number of Korean women to come to America.<ref name=KimKiljoongp159/> By the 1970s Korean settlements appeared in the area around Clark Street in the [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]] and [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] areas: the Koreans found it easier to settle there since several Japanese had already settled in that area.<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/> During the 1970s many Koreans began moving further north to [[Edgewater, Chicago|Edgewater]], [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]], and [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]]. Koreans working in healthcare fields stayed in Lakeview and Lincoln Park since those communities were in proximity to both the Korean businesses on Clark Street and the hospitals. Korean residential settlement was \"more scattered\" compared to earlier ethnic European residential settlement.<ref name=KimKiljoongp159/>\n\nThe 1980 estimates from the Census Bureau 21,484 Koreans in Chicago . At this time, 53% were female. In the period the Korean businesses migrated to [[Lawrence Avenue, Chicago|Lawrence Avenue]]. Korean residents originally referred to it as a \"Second Clark Street\". Several Korean residents moved to the Lawrence Avenue area and surrounding neighborhoods because the rental rates in Lawrence Avenue were relatively affordable. By the 1980s it became the primary Korean commercial area. The settlement of Koreans was \"a scattering around the north side of the city, rather than a large pocket.\"<ref name=KimKiljoongp159/> Neighborhoods around Lawrence Avenue which had Korean settlement included Albany Park, Edgewater, Irving Park, Lincoln Square, Rogers Park, Uptown, West Ridge.<ref name=KimKiljoongp159/> In the 1980s, 80% of Chicago's Koreans resided in Albany Park, Edgewater, Irving Park, Lake View, Lincoln Park, North Park, Rogers Park, and West View.<ref name=KimYounJinEncyclopedia>Kim, Youn-Jin. \"[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/694.html Koreans].\" [[Encyclopedia of Chicago]].

Because suburbanization was beginning, some Korean Americans believe the area received its name too late. In several years leading to 2003, the number of Koreans arriving in Illinois had declined. In the period 1972\u20132000, 47,200 Koreans arrived in Illinois. Over 80% of them had arrived prior to 1990.<ref name=KimKiljoongp160>Kim, Kiljoong, p.

The Koreans became the only significant Asian ethnic group in [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]]. By the early 2000s Korean businesses began to leave the Lawrence Avenue area due to the decline of Koreans in the City of Chicago.<ref name=KimKiljoongp160/> As of the [[2000 U.S. Census]], 24,321 Koreans lived in suburbs in the six-county Chicago region, and 10,011 Koreans lived in the City of Chicago.

There are about 2,000 Korean-owned laundry and dry-cleaning stores. About 30% of the area Koreans are entrepreneurs or are self-employed.<ref name=Cutlerp193/>\n\nThe executive director of the Chicago Korean American Chamber of Commerce, Brandon Yu, stated that business owners found it easier to open businesses in the suburbs instead of the City of Chicago. To appeal to non-Koreans who want Korean food, some Korean business owners are opening restaurants in and near the Loop.<ref name=SearchingKT/>\n\nMany Korean stores are located in Korean and African-American neighborhoods. Some blacks believed that the Korean businessowners did not contribute to their communities and did not treat them fairly. There had been measures to improve black-Korean relations.<ref name=Cutlerp193/>\n\nDiversey Cafeteria in [[Lake View, Chicago|Lake View]] was the first Korean business in Chicago.

These immigrants landed in Hawaii to work on plantations.

The bulk of the non-students stayed in Chicago. There were almost no Koreans who arrived in Chicago from 1945 to 1950.<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/>\n\nIn the late 1950s there were several dozen South Korean families in Chicago.<ref name=Cutlerp193/> In 1960 Chicago had 500 Koreans.<ref name=KimYJThesisp133>Kim, Youn-Jin, \"From Immigrants to Ethnics: The Life-Worlds of Korean Immigrants in Chicago,\" p. 133.</ref> The number of Koreans in Chicago increased after 1960,<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/> and between 1962 and 1972 the Korean population increased by twenty-fold due to revisions in immigration policies.<ref name=KimYJThesisp133/> The numbers of Koreans increased after the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] passed.<ref name=Cutlerp193/> In 1968 there were 2,000 Koreans. In 1970 there were 4,000 Koreans. In 1972 there were 10,000 Koreans.<ref name=KimYJThesisp133/> Students were a large group within the new Korean population, and many of them went on to become white collar professionals.<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/> Other significant groups included agricultural workers, coal miners, doctors, martial arts instructors, and nurses. The agricultural workers had previously migrated to South Africa before coming to Chicago, and the coal miners had previously migrated to West Germany. Koreans who had lived in other countries previously more easily adjusted to American life, and that there was competition among the former students and the Koreans who had lived in Germany.<ref name=KimKiljoongp159>Kim, Kiljoong, p.

Of them, 60% were female. The [[War Brides Act]] caused a disproportionate number of Korean women to come to America.<ref name=KimKiljoongp159/> By the 1970s Korean settlements appeared in the area around Clark Street in the [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]] and [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] areas: the Koreans found it easier to settle there since several Japanese had already settled in that area.<ref name=KimKiljoongp158/> During the 1970s many Koreans began moving further north to [[Edgewater, Chicago|Edgewater]], [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]], and [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]]. Koreans working in healthcare fields stayed in Lakeview and Lincoln Park since those communities were in proximity to both the Korean businesses on Clark Street and the hospitals. Korean residential settlement was \"more scattered\" compared to earlier ethnic European residential settlement.<ref name=KimKiljoongp159/>\n\nThe 1980 estimates from the Census Bureau 21,484 Koreans in Chicago . At this time, 53% were female. In the period the Korean businesses migrated to [[Lawrence Avenue, Chicago|Lawrence Avenue]]. Korean residents originally referred to it as a \"Second Clark Street\". Several Korean residents moved to the Lawrence Avenue area and surrounding neighborhoods because the rental rates in Lawrence Avenue were relatively affordable. By the 1980s it became the primary Korean commercial area. The settlement of Koreans was \"a scattering around the north side of the city, rather than a large pocket.\"<ref name=KimKiljoongp159/> Neighborhoods around Lawrence Avenue which had Korean settlement included Albany Park, Edgewater, Irving Park, Lincoln Square, Rogers Park, Uptown, West Ridge.<ref name=KimKiljoongp159/> In the 1980s, 80% of Chicago's Koreans resided in Albany Park, Edgewater, Irving Park, Lake View, Lincoln Park, North Park, Rogers Park, and West View.<ref name=KimYounJinEncyclopedia>Kim, Youn-Jin. \"[http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/694.html Koreans].\" [[Encyclopedia of Chicago]].

Because suburbanization was beginning, some Korean Americans believe the area received its name too late. In several years leading to 2003, the number of Koreans arriving in Illinois had declined. In the period 1972-2000, 47,200 Koreans arrived in Illinois. Over 80% of them had arrived prior to 1990.<ref name=KimKiljoongp160>Kim, Kiljoong, p.

The Koreans became the only significant Asian ethnic group in [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]]. By the early 2000s Korean businesses began to leave the Lawrence Avenue area due to the decline of Koreans in the City of Chicago.<ref name=KimKiljoongp160/> As of the [[2000 U.S. Census]], 24,321 Koreans lived in suburbs in the six-county Chicago region, and 10,011 Koreans lived in the City of Chicago.
