{"title_page": "Who (pronoun)", "text_new": "{{How-to|date=February 2018|reason=Includes usage-related material that is instructional, pedagogical, and/or prescriptive.}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Who'' (pronoun)}}\n{{Wiktionary|who|whom|whose}}\n{{Grammar series}}\nThe [[pronoun]] '''''who''''', in [[English language|English]], is an [[interrogative word|interrogative]] pronoun and a [[relative pronoun]], used chiefly to refer to humans.\n\nIts derived forms include '''''whom''''', an [[objective case|objective]] form whose use is now generally confined to formal English; the [[possessive]] form '''''whose'''''; and the [[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]] form '''''whoever''''' (also ''whosoever'', ''whom(so)ever'', and ''whos(eso)ever''; see also ''[[-ever]]'').\n\n==Etymology why is this so much==\nThe word ''who'' derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''hw\u0101''. The spelling ''who'' does not correspond to the word's pronunciation {{IPA|/hu\u02d0/}}; it is the spelling that represents the expected outcome of ''hw\u0101'', while the pronunciation represents a divergent outcome \u2013 for details see [[Pronunciation of English \u27e8wh\u27e9]]. The word is [[cognate]] with [[Latin]] ''quis'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2''.\n\nThe forms ''whom'' and ''whose'' derive respectively from the Old English [[dative]] and [[genitive]] forms of ''hw\u0101'', namely ''hw\u0101m'' and ''hw\u00e6s''.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===As interrogative pronoun===\n''Who'' and its derived forms can be used as [[interrogative pronoun]]s, to form questions:\n*''Who did that?''\n*''Whom did you meet this morning?'' (informal: ''Who did you meet this morning?'')\n*''To whom did you speak?'' (informal: ''Who did you speak to?'')\n*''Whoever could have done that?'' (emphatic form, expressing disbelief)\n*''Whose bike is that?'' (use of ''whose'' as possessive determiner/adjective; see [[possessive]] and [[English possessive]])\n*''Whose do you like best?'' (use of ''whose'' as possessive pronoun)\n\nThe same forms (though not usually the emphatic ones) are used to make [[indirect question]]s:\n*''We don't know who did that.''\n*''I wonder who(m) she met this morning.''\n\nThe corresponding form when referring to non-humans is ''what'' (which has the emphatic form ''whatever'', and no possessive form). Another similar interrogative is ''which'' \u2013 this can refer to either humans or non-humans, normally implying selection from a particular set, as either interrogative pronoun (''Which do you prefer?'') or interrogative [[determiner]] (adjective) (''Which man should I choose?''). ''What'' can also be used as a determiner (''What book are you reading?''), but ''who'' cannot.\n\n''Which'', ''who'', and ''what'' as interrogatives can be either singular or plural. (Examples: ''Which is the highest hill?'' ''Which are the highest hills?'' ''Who was born in 1920?'' ''Who were king and queen in 1920?''). But ''who'' and ''what'' often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number; the questions ''Who wants some cake?'' and ''What's in the bag?'' do not presuppose anything about number in possible responses: ''I want some cake'', or ''All of us want some''; and ''A rabbit is in the bag'', or ''Five coins and a bus ticket''.<ref>Huddleston and Pullum (2002; pp.&nbsp;505\u2013506) call this default to the singular an \"override\", resembling \"semantically motivated overrides\" with collective nouns: \"The committee have not yet come to a decision\" (their example, p.&nbsp;501).</ref>\n\n===As relative pronoun===\nThe other chief use of ''who'' and its derivatives are in the formation of [[relative clause]]s:\n*''These are the men who work upstairs.''\n*''This is Tom, who(m) I believe you have already met.''\n*''I helped some lads whose car had broken down.''\n\nThe corresponding form for non-humans is ''which'', although ''whose'' can be used as a possessive in relative clauses even when referring to non-humans: ''I will have to fix the car whose engine I ruined.''\n\nIn [[English relative clauses#Restrictive or non-restrictive relative clauses|   restrictive relative clauses]], when not preceded by a preposition, both ''who(m)'' and ''which'' can be replaced by ''that'', or (if not the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the clause) by [[zero (linguistics)|zero]].\nIn relative clauses, ''who'' (like other relative pronouns) takes the [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural) of its antecedent. ''Who'' also takes the [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third) of its antecedent:<ref>Bernstein, ''The Careful Writer'', Atheneum (1986), p.&nbsp;479.</ref>\n* ''I, who '''am''' having a hard time right now, won't be able to help you.''\n* ''I, a tired old man who '''is''' fed up with all your nonsense, refuse to help you.''\n\n''Who'' and ''whom'' can also be used to form [[free relative clause]]s (those with no antecedent). The emphatic forms are often used for this purpose: informal: ''I'll take whoever you choose''; formal: ''I'll take  whomever/whomsoever you choose.''. This corresponds to the use of ''what(ever)'' when referring to non-humans. (For the choice between ''who(ever)'' and ''whom(ever)'' in formal English, see {{slink||Ambiguous cases}} below.)\n\nThe emphatic forms can also be used to make adverbial clauses, as in ''Whoever you choose, I'll be satisfied.'' \n\nFor more details, see [[English relative clauses]].\n\n==Usage of ''whom''==\n{{Redirect|Whom|the radio station on Mount Washington, New Hampshire, with the [[Call_sign|Call sign]] resembling this word|WHOM}}\n===Tendency to replace ''whom'' with ''who''===\nAccording to traditional [[prescriptive grammar]], ''who'' is the [[subjective case|subjective]] (nominative) form only, while ''whom'' is the corresponding [[objective case|objective]] form (just as ''him'' is the objective form corresponding to ''he''). However it has long been common, particularly in informal English, for the uninflected form ''who'' to be used in both cases, thus replacing ''whom'' in the contexts where the latter was traditionally used.\n\nIn 1975, S. Potter noted, in ''Changing English'', that \"nearly half a century ago [[Edward Sapir]] predicted the demise of ''whom'', showing at great length that it was doomed because it was 'psychologically isolated' from the objective pronouns me, us, him, her, them on the one hand, and the invariables which, what, that and where, when, how, why on the other.\"<ref>Potter, 1975, p. 151.</ref> By 1978 the ''who''\u2013''whom'' distinction was identified as having \"slipped so badly that [it is] almost totally uninformative\".<ref>{{cite book |last          = Wanner\n |first         = Eric\n |author2       = Michael Maratsos\n |editor1-last  = Halle\n |editor1-first = M.\n |editor2-last  = Bresnan\n |editor2-first = J.\n |editor3-last  = Miller\n |editor3-first = G.\n |title         = Linguistic theory and psychological reality\n |year          = 1978\n |publisher     = [[MIT Press]]\n |location      = Cambridge, MA\n |isbn          = 978-0-262-58043-4\n |page          = [https://archive.org/details/linguistictheory0000unse_w7c6/page/133 133]\n |chapter       = An ATN approach to Comprehension\n |url           = https://archive.org/details/linguistictheory0000unse_w7c6/page/133\n}}</ref> According to the [[OED]] (2nd edition, 1989), ''whom'' is \"no longer current in natural colloquial speech\". Lasnik and Sobin argue that surviving occurrences of ''whom'' are not part of ordinary English grammar, but the result of extra-grammatical rules for producing \"prestige\" forms.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lasnik\n|first=Howard\n|authorlink=Howard Lasnik\n|author2=Nicholas Sobin\n |year=2000\n|title=The ''who/whom'' puzzle: On the preservation of an archaic feature |journal=Natural Language and Linguistic Theory\n|volume=18 |issue=2\n|pages=343\u2013371\n|doi=10.1023/A:1006322600501}}\n</ref>\n\nAccording to Mair, the decline of ''whom'' has been hastened by the fact that it is one of relatively few [[Synthetic language|synthetic]] ([[inflection|inflected]]) remnants in the principally [[Analytic language|analytical]] grammar of Modern English.<ref>Mair, 2006, p. 141.</ref> It has also been claimed that the decline of ''whom'' is more advanced in the interrogative case than in the relative case, this possibly being related to the degree of complexity of the syntax.<ref>Yoko & Michiko, 2009, p.&nbsp;189.</ref>\n\nHowever, some prescriptivists continue to defend ''whom'' as the only \"correct\" form in functions other than the subject.<ref>Aarts, 2004, p. 71.</ref> Mair notes that: \"''whom'' is moribund as an element of the core grammar of English, but is very much alive as a style marker whose correct use is acquired in the educational system [, where it is taught]. [The use of ''whom''] is highly restricted, but rather than disappear entirely, the form is likely to remain in use for some time to come because of its overt prestige in writing.\"<ref>Mair, 2006, pp.&nbsp;143, 144.</ref>\n\n''Whom'' is also sometimes used by way of [[hypercorrection]], in places where it would not even be considered correct according to traditional rules, as in ''Whom do you think you are?''<ref>Brinten & Arnovick, 2006, p.&nbsp;440.</ref> For more examples see the {{slink||Ambiguous cases}} section below.\n\nRetention of the ''who''\u2013''whom'' distinction often co-occurs with another stylistic marker of formal or \"prestige\" English{{snd}}avoidance of the [[stranded preposition]]. This means that ''whom'' can frequently be found following a [[preposition]], in cases where the usual informal equivalent would use ''who'' and place the preposition later in the sentence. For example:\n* Formal: ''To whom did you give it?''\n* Informal: ''Who did you give it to?''\nIn relative clauses, movement of the preposition further allows ''who'' to be replaced by ''that'' or the empty string:\n* Formal: ''He is someone to whom I owe a great deal.''\n* Informal: ''He is someone who I owe a great deal to'' or<br />''He is someone that I owe a great deal to'' or<br />''He is someone I owe a great deal to...''\n\n===Usage of ''who'' and ''whom''===\nIn the types of English in which ''whom'' is used (which are generally the more formal varieties, as described in the section above), the general grammatical rule is that ''who'' is the [[subjective case|subjective]] (nominative) form, analogous to the [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] ''I'', ''he'', ''she'', ''we'', ''they'', etc., while ''whom'' is the [[objective case|objective]] (oblique) form, analogous to ''me'', ''him'', ''her'', ''us'', ''them'', etc. Thus ''who'' is used as a verb [[subject (grammar)|subject]], while ''whom'' is used as an indirect or direct [[object (grammar)|object]] of a verb or as the object (complement) of a [[preposition]].\n\nExamples:\n*As verb subject: ''Who is waiting over there? Tom is someone who works hard'' (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: '''''He''' works hard.'')\n*As verb object: ''Whom do you support? She is someone whom many people admire.'' (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: ''Many people admire '''her'''.'')\n*As preposition complement: ''On whom do you plan to rely? These are the players of whom I am most proud.'' (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: ''I am most proud of '''them'''.'')\n\nNotice that in a relative clause, the form depends on the role of the pronoun in the relative clause, not that of its antecedent in the main clause. For example, ''I saw the man who ate the pie''{{snd}}not ''whom'', since ''who'' is the subject of ''ate'' (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: '''''He''' ate the pie''); it makes no difference that its antecedent ''(the) man'' is the object of ''saw''.\n\nIn the position of [[predicative expression]], i.e. as the complement of forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'', the form ''who'' is used, and considered correct, rather than ''whom''. (Compare the case of the personal pronouns, where the subjective form is traditionally considered correct, although the objective forms are more commonly used{{snd}}see {{slink|English personal pronouns|Case usage}}.)\n*''Who were those people?''\n*''Who is this?'', or ''Who is it?'' Compare: ''It is I'' (formal, and traditionally correct) to ''it is me'' (informal, but now common usage).\n\nIn the examples that follow, notice how, when the verb is a form of ''be'', the question \"Who is the captain of the team?\" or the noun clause \"who the captain of the team is\" (we know it is a noun clause because it replaces the word \"something\") is the same regardless of whether the original placement of the unknown person was before or after ''be'' (is):\n*She asked something. John is captain of the team. \n:Interrogative: She asked, \"''Who'' is captain of the team?\"\n:Noun clause:  She asked ''who the captain of the team is''.\n*She asked something. The captain of the team is John.\n:Interrogative: She asked, \"''Who'' is captain of the team?\"\n:Noun clause:  She asked ''who the captain of the team is''.\n\n==== Ambiguous cases <span id=\"subject whom\"></span>====\nA problem sometimes arises in constructions like this:\n*''Beethoven, '''who''' you say was a great composer, wrote only one opera.''\nUse of ''who'' here is normal, and to replace it with ''whom'' would be grammatically incorrect, since the pronoun is the subject of ''was'', not the object of ''say''. (One would write ''You say [that] '''he''''' [not '''''him'''''] ''was a great composer''.) Nevertheless ''whom'' is quite commonly encountered, and even defended, in sentences of this type. It may arise from confusion with a form like:\n*''Beethoven, whom you believe'' [or ''whom you believe to be''] ''a great composer, wrote only one opera.''\nIn this case, ''whom'' is used correctly according to the traditional rules, since it is now the object of the verb ''believe''. (One would write ''You believe him'' [not ''he''] ''(to be) a great composer.'')\n\nThe use of ''whom'' in sentences of the first type (''Beethoven, whom you say was a great composer...''){{snd}}referred to as '''subject ''whom'''''{{snd}}can therefore be regarded as a [[hypercorrection]], resulting from awareness of a perceived need to correct ''who'' to ''whom'' in sentences of the second type. Examples of this apparently ungrammatical usage can be found throughout the history of English. The ''[[OED]]'' traces it back to the 15th{{nbsp}}century, while Jespersen cites even earlier examples from [[Chaucer]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Jespersen\n|first=Otto\n|authorlink=Otto Jespersen\n|title=The Philosophy of Grammar\n|year=1965\n|origyear=1924\n|publisher=Norton\n|location=New York City\n|at=appendix\n|isbn=0-226-39881-1}}\n</ref> More examples are given below:\n*''Young Ferdinand, '''whom''' they suppose is drown'd, [...]'' (Shakespeare, ''[[The Tempest]]'', III, 3)\n*''[...] going to seek the grave / Of Arthur, '''whom''' they say is kill'd to-night / On your suggestion.'' (Shakespeare, ''[[King John (Shakespeare)|King John]]'', IV, 2)\n*''[...] the rest of their company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they were come to themselves, all but him '''whom''' they thought had been dead; [...]'' (Defoe, ''[[The Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'', Chapter 6, Part 1. Use of ''whom'' here may be due partly to the proximity of ''him''.)\n*''But if others were involved, it was Harris and Klebold '''whom''' students said seemed the tightest, who stood apart from the rest of their clique.'' (From ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper, [[Melbourne]], Australia, April 1999, in an article [[print syndication|syndicated]] from the ''Washington Post''. The original article had the \"correct\" ''who''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/april99/suspects042299.htm |title=original '&#39;Washington Post'&#39; article |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1999-04-22 |accessdate=2014-08-19}}</ref> Note that the continuation with the parallel construction '''''who''' stood apart'' illustrates how the use of subject ''whom'' can lead to inconsistencies.)\n*''He saith unto them, But '''whom''' say ye that I am?'' ([[King James Bible]], Matthew 16:15. Technically ''whom'' here is not a subject, but the [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] of the copula ''am''; but in this position too it is ''who'' that would be expected according to the traditional grammatical rules as given in the section above, as it would be in ''Who am I?'')\n\nDoubts can also arise in the case of free relative clauses, formed with ''who(m)'', ''who(m)ever'' or ''who(m)soever''. Modern guides to English usage say that the relative pronoun should take the case appropriate to the relative clause, not the function performed by that clause within an external clause.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=Loretta |last2=Gray |title=The Writer's Harbrace Handbook, Brief |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=1-4130-3060-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=65YhK04lMMEC |accessdate=3 November 2010 |page=339}}</ref> For example, it is correct to write ''I'll talk to whoever'' [not ''whomever''] ''will listen'', since ''whoever'' is the subject of ''will listen'' (regardless of the fact that the entire clause ''whoever will listen'' serves as the object of the preposition ''to''). On the other hand, ''Whomever you choose will suit me'' is correct, since ''whomever'' is now the object of ''choose'' (despite the fact that the entire relative clause is the subject of ''will suit'').<ref>The current ''Chicago Manual of Style'':\n:[...]&nbsp;determining the proper case can be confusing when the pronoun serves a function (say, nominative) in a clause that itself serves a different function (say, objective) in the main sentence. It is the pronoun\u2019s function in its clause that determines its case. In the first example below, the entire clause ''whoever will listen'' is the object of the preposition ''to''. But in the clause itself, ''whoever'' serves as the subject, and that function determines its case. Similarly, in the second sentence ''whomever'' is the object of ''choose'' in the clause, so it must be in the objective case even though the clause itself serves as the subject of the sentence.\n::WRONG: I'll talk to whomever will listen.\n::RIGHT: I'll talk to whoever will listen.\n::WRONG: Whoever you choose will suit me.\n::RIGHT: Whomever you choose will suit me.\n:As the second example above shows, a further distraction can arise when the ''who'' clause contains a nested clause, typically of attribution or identification (here, ''you choose''). CMOS16, at 5.63 (\"&nbsp;'Who' versus 'whom'&nbsp;\")</ref>\n\nSimilarly:\n*''Let whoever is without sin cast the first stone.''

The spelling ''who'' does not correspond to the word's pronunciation {{IPA|/hu\u02d0/}}; it is the spelling that represents the expected outcome of ''hw\u0101'', while the pronunciation represents a divergent outcome \u2013 for details see [[Pronunciation of English \u27e8wh\u27e9]]. The word is [[cognate]] with [[Latin]] ''quis'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] ''\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2''.\n\nThe forms ''whom'' and ''whose'' derive respectively from the Old English [[dative]] and [[genitive]] forms of ''hw\u0101'', namely ''hw\u0101m'' and ''hw\u00e6s''.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===As interrogative pronoun===\n''Who'' and its derived forms can be used as [[interrogative pronoun]]s, to form questions:\n*''Who did that?''\n*''Whom did you meet this morning?'' (informal: ''Who did you meet this morning?'')\n*''To whom did you speak?'' (informal: ''Who did you speak to?'')\n*''Whoever could have done that?'' (emphatic form, expressing disbelief)\n*''Whose bike is that?'' (use of ''whose'' as possessive determiner/adjective; see [[possessive]] and [[English possessive]])\n*''Whose do you like best?'' (use of ''whose'' as possessive pronoun)\n\nThe same forms (though not usually the emphatic ones) are used to make [[indirect question]]s:\n*''We don't know who did that.''\n*''I wonder who(m) she met this morning.''\n\nThe corresponding form when referring to non-humans is ''what'' (which has the emphatic form ''whatever'', and no possessive form). Another similar interrogative is ''which'' \u2013 this can refer to either humans or non-humans, normally implying selection from a particular set, as either interrogative pronoun (''Which do you prefer?'') or interrogative [[determiner]] (adjective) (''Which man should I choose?''). ''What'' can also be used as a determiner (''What book are you reading?''), but ''who'' cannot.\n\n''Which'', ''who'', and ''what'' as interrogatives can be either singular or plural. (Examples: ''Which is the highest hill?'' ''Which are the highest hills?'' ''Who was born in 1920?'' ''Who were king and queen in 1920?''). But ''who'' and ''what'' often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number; the questions ''Who wants some cake?'' and ''What's in the bag?'' do not presuppose anything about number in possible responses: ''I want some cake'', or ''All of us want some''; and ''A rabbit is in the bag'', or ''Five coins and a bus ticket''.<ref>Huddleston and Pullum (2002; pp.&nbsp;505\u2013506) call this default to the singular an \"override\", resembling \"semantically motivated overrides\" with collective nouns: \"The committee have not yet come to a decision\" (their example, p.&nbsp;501).</ref>\n\n===As relative pronoun===\nThe other chief use of ''who'' and its derivatives are in the formation of [[relative clause]]s:\n*''These are the men who work upstairs.''\n*''This is Tom, who(m) I believe you have already met.''\n*''I helped some lads whose car had broken down.''\n\nThe corresponding form for non-humans is ''which'', although ''whose'' can be used as a possessive in relative clauses even when referring to non-humans: ''I will have to fix the car whose engine I ruined.''\n\nIn [[English relative clauses#Restrictive or non-restrictive relative clauses|   restrictive relative clauses]], when not preceded by a preposition, both ''who(m)'' and ''which'' can be replaced by ''that'', or (if not the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the clause) by [[zero (linguistics)|zero]].\nIn relative clauses, ''who'' (like other relative pronouns) takes the [[grammatical number|number]] (singular or plural) of its antecedent. ''Who'' also takes the [[grammatical person|person]] (first, second or third) of its antecedent:<ref>Bernstein, ''The Careful Writer'', Atheneum (1986), p.&nbsp;479.</ref>\n* ''I, who '''am''' having a hard time right now, won't be able to help you.''\n* ''I, a tired old man who '''is''' fed up with all your nonsense, refuse to help you.''\n\n''Who'' and ''whom'' can also be used to form [[free relative clause]]s (those with no antecedent). The emphatic forms are often used for this purpose: informal: ''I'll take whoever you choose''; formal: ''I'll take  whomever/whomsoever you choose.''. This corresponds to the use of ''what(ever)'' when referring to non-humans. (For the choice between ''who(ever)'' and ''whom(ever)'' in formal English, see {{slink||Ambiguous cases}} below.)\n\nThe emphatic forms can also be used to make adverbial clauses, as in ''Whoever you choose, I'll be satisfied.'' \n\nFor more details, see [[English relative clauses]].\n\n==Usage of ''whom''==\n{{Redirect|Whom|the radio station on Mount Washington, New Hampshire, with the [[Call_sign|Call sign]] resembling this word|WHOM}}\n===Tendency to replace ''whom'' with ''who''===\nAccording to traditional [[prescriptive grammar]], ''who'' is the [[subjective case|subjective]] (nominative) form only, while ''whom'' is the corresponding [[objective case|objective]] form (just as ''him'' is the objective form corresponding to ''he''). However it has long been common, particularly in informal English, for the uninflected form ''who'' to be used in both cases, thus replacing ''whom'' in the contexts where the latter was traditionally used.\n\nIn 1975, S. Potter noted, in ''Changing English'', that \"nearly half a century ago [[Edward Sapir]] predicted the demise of ''whom'', showing at great length that it was doomed because it was 'psychologically isolated' from the objective pronouns me, us, him, her, them on the one hand, and the invariables which, what, that and where, when, how, why on the other.\"<ref>Potter, 1975, p. 151.</ref> By 1978 the ''who''\u2013''whom'' distinction was identified as having \"slipped so badly that [it is] almost totally uninformative\".<ref>{{cite book |last          = Wanner\n |first         = Eric\n |author2       = Michael Maratsos\n |editor1-last  = Halle\n |editor1-first = M.\n |editor2-last  = Bresnan\n |editor2-first = J.\n |editor3-last  = Miller\n |editor3-first = G.\n |title         = Linguistic theory and psychological reality\n |year          = 1978\n |publisher     = [[MIT Press]]\n |location      = Cambridge, MA\n |isbn          = 978-0-262-58043-4\n |page          = [https://archive.org/details/linguistictheory0000unse_w7c6/page/133 133]\n |chapter       = An ATN approach to Comprehension\n |url           = https://archive.org/details/linguistictheory0000unse_w7c6/page/133\n}}</ref> According to the [[OED]] (2nd edition, 1989), ''whom'' is \"no longer current in natural colloquial speech\". Lasnik and Sobin argue that surviving occurrences of ''whom'' are not part of ordinary English grammar, but the result of extra-grammatical rules for producing \"prestige\" forms.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lasnik\n|first=Howard\n|authorlink=Howard Lasnik\n|author2=Nicholas Sobin\n |year=2000\n|title=The ''who/whom'' puzzle: On the preservation of an archaic feature |journal=Natural Language and Linguistic Theory\n|volume=18 |issue=2\n|pages=343\u2013371\n|doi=10.1023/A:1006322600501}}\n</ref>\n\nAccording to Mair, the decline of ''whom'' has been hastened by the fact that it is one of relatively few [[Synthetic language|synthetic]] ([[inflection|inflected]]) remnants in the principally [[Analytic language|analytical]] grammar of Modern English.<ref>Mair, 2006, p. 141.</ref> It has also been claimed that the decline of ''whom'' is more advanced in the interrogative case than in the relative case, this possibly being related to the degree of complexity of the syntax.<ref>Yoko & Michiko, 2009, p.&nbsp;189.</ref>\n\nHowever, some prescriptivists continue to defend ''whom'' as the only \"correct\" form in functions other than the subject.<ref>Aarts, 2004, p. 71.</ref> Mair notes that: \"''whom'' is moribund as an element of the core grammar of English, but is very much alive as a style marker whose correct use is acquired in the educational system [, where it is taught]. [The use of ''whom''] is highly restricted, but rather than disappear entirely, the form is likely to remain in use for some time to come because of its overt prestige in writing.\"<ref>Mair, 2006, pp.&nbsp;143, 144.</ref>\n\n''Whom'' is also sometimes used by way of [[hypercorrection]], in places where it would not even be considered correct according to traditional rules, as in ''Whom do you think you are?''<ref>Brinten & Arnovick, 2006, p.&nbsp;440.</ref> For more examples see the {{slink||Ambiguous cases}} section below.\n\nRetention of the ''who''\u2013''whom'' distinction often co-occurs with another stylistic marker of formal or \"prestige\" English{{snd}}avoidance of the [[stranded preposition]]. This means that ''whom'' can frequently be found following a [[preposition]], in cases where the usual informal equivalent would use ''who'' and place the preposition later in the sentence. For example:\n* Formal: ''To whom did you give it?''\n* Informal: ''Who did you give it to?''\nIn relative clauses, movement of the preposition further allows ''who'' to be replaced by ''that'' or the empty string:\n* Formal: ''He is someone to whom I owe a great deal.''\n* Informal: ''He is someone who I owe a great deal to'' or<br />''He is someone that I owe a great deal to'' or<br />''He is someone I owe a great deal to...''\n\n===Usage of ''who'' and ''whom''===\nIn the types of English in which ''whom'' is used (which are generally the more formal varieties, as described in the section above), the general grammatical rule is that ''who'' is the [[subjective case|subjective]] (nominative) form, analogous to the [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] ''I'', ''he'', ''she'', ''we'', ''they'', etc., while ''whom'' is the [[objective case|objective]] (oblique) form, analogous to ''me'', ''him'', ''her'', ''us'', ''them'', etc. Thus ''who'' is used as a verb [[subject (grammar)|subject]], while ''whom'' is used as an indirect or direct [[object (grammar)|object]] of a verb or as the object (complement) of a [[preposition]].\n\nExamples:\n*As verb subject: ''Who is waiting over there? Tom is someone who works hard'' (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: '''''He''' works hard.'')\n*As verb object: ''Whom do you support? She is someone whom many people admire.'' (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: ''Many people admire '''her'''.'')\n*As preposition complement: ''On whom do you plan to rely? These are the players of whom I am most proud.'' (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: ''I am most proud of '''them'''.'')\n\nNotice that in a relative clause, the form depends on the role of the pronoun in the relative clause, not that of its antecedent in the main clause. For example, ''I saw the man who ate the pie''{{snd}}not ''whom'', since ''who'' is the subject of ''ate'' (original sentence, before being changed to a clause: '''''He''' ate the pie''); it makes no difference that its antecedent ''(the) man'' is the object of ''saw''.\n\nIn the position of [[predicative expression]], i.e. as the complement of forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'', the form ''who'' is used, and considered correct, rather than ''whom''. (Compare the case of the personal pronouns, where the subjective form is traditionally considered correct, although the objective forms are more commonly used{{snd}}see {{slink|English personal pronouns|Case usage}}.)\n*''Who were those people?''\n*''Who is this?'', or ''Who is it?'' Compare: ''It is I'' (formal, and traditionally correct) to ''it is me'' (informal, but now common usage).\n\nIn the examples that follow, notice how, when the verb is a form of ''be'', the question \"Who is the captain of the team?\" or the noun clause \"who the captain of the team is\" (we know it is a noun clause because it replaces the word \"something\") is the same regardless of whether the original placement of the unknown person was before or after ''be'' (is):\n*She asked something. John is captain of the team. \n:Interrogative: She asked, \"''Who'' is captain of the team?\"\n:Noun clause:  She asked ''who the captain of the team is''.\n*She asked something. The captain of the team is John.\n:Interrogative: She asked, \"''Who'' is captain of the team?\"\n:Noun clause:  She asked ''who the captain of the team is''.\n\n==== Ambiguous cases <span id=\"subject whom\"></span>====\nA problem sometimes arises in constructions like this:\n*''Beethoven, '''who''' you say was a great composer, wrote only one opera.''\nUse of ''who'' here is normal, and to replace it with ''whom'' would be grammatically incorrect, since the pronoun is the subject of ''was'', not the object of ''say''. (One would write ''You say [that] '''he''''' [not '''''him'''''] ''was a great composer''.) Nevertheless ''whom'' is quite commonly encountered, and even defended, in sentences of this type. It may arise from confusion with a form like:\n*''Beethoven, whom you believe'' [or ''whom you believe to be''] ''a great composer, wrote only one opera.''\nIn this case, ''whom'' is used correctly according to the traditional rules, since it is now the object of the verb ''believe''. (One would write ''You believe him'' [not ''he''] ''(to be) a great composer.'')\n\nThe use of ''whom'' in sentences of the first type (''Beethoven, whom you say was a great composer...''){{snd}}referred to as '''subject ''whom'''''{{snd}}can therefore be regarded as a [[hypercorrection]], resulting from awareness of a perceived need to correct ''who'' to ''whom'' in sentences of the second type. Examples of this apparently ungrammatical usage can be found throughout the history of English. The ''[[OED]]'' traces it back to the 15th{{nbsp}}century, while Jespersen cites even earlier examples from [[Chaucer]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Jespersen\n|first=Otto\n|authorlink=Otto Jespersen\n|title=The Philosophy of Grammar\n|year=1965\n|origyear=1924\n|publisher=Norton\n|location=New York City\n|at=appendix\n|isbn=0-226-39881-1}}\n</ref> More examples are given below:\n*''Young Ferdinand, '''whom''' they suppose is drown'd, [...]'' (Shakespeare, ''[[The Tempest]]'', III, 3)\n*''[...] going to seek the grave / Of Arthur, '''whom''' they say is kill'd to-night / On your suggestion.'' (Shakespeare, ''[[King John (Shakespeare)|King John]]'', IV, 2)\n*''[...] the rest of their company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they were come to themselves, all but him '''whom''' they thought had been dead; [...]'' (Defoe, ''[[The Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'', Chapter 6, Part 1. Use of ''whom'' here may be due partly to the proximity of ''him''.)\n*''But if others were involved, it was Harris and Klebold '''whom''' students said seemed the tightest, who stood apart from the rest of their clique.'' (From ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper, [[Melbourne]], Australia, April 1999, in an article [[print syndication|syndicated]] from the ''Washington Post''. The original article had the \"correct\" ''who''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/april99/suspects042299.htm |title=original '&#39;Washington Post'&#39; article |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1999-04-22 |accessdate=2014-08-19}}</ref> Note that the continuation with the parallel construction '''''who''' stood apart'' illustrates how the use of subject ''whom'' can lead to inconsistencies.)\n*''He saith unto them, But '''whom''' say ye that I am?'' ([[King James Bible]], Matthew 16:15. Technically ''whom'' here is not a subject, but the [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]] of the copula ''am''; but in this position too it is ''who'' that would be expected according to the traditional grammatical rules as given in the section above, as it would be in ''Who am I?'')\n\nDoubts can also arise in the case of free relative clauses, formed with ''who(m)'', ''who(m)ever'' or ''who(m)soever''. Modern guides to English usage say that the relative pronoun should take the case appropriate to the relative clause, not the function performed by that clause within an external clause.<ref name=\"handbook\">{{cite book|last=Glenn|first=Loretta |last2=Gray |title=The Writer's Harbrace Handbook, Brief |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=1-4130-3060-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=65YhK04lMMEC |accessdate=3 November 2010 |page=339}}</ref> For example, it is correct to write ''I'll talk to whoever'' [not ''whomever''] ''will listen'', since ''whoever'' is the subject of ''will listen'' (regardless of the fact that the entire clause ''whoever will listen'' serves as the object of the preposition ''to''). On the other hand, ''Whomever you choose will suit me'' is correct, since ''whomever'' is now the object of ''choose'' (despite the fact that the entire relative clause is the subject of ''will suit'').<ref>The current ''Chicago Manual of Style'':\n:[...]&nbsp;determining the proper case can be confusing when the pronoun serves a function (say, nominative) in a clause that itself serves a different function (say, objective) in the main sentence. It is the pronoun\u2019s function in its clause that determines its case. In the first example below, the entire clause ''whoever will listen'' is the object of the preposition ''to''. But in the clause itself, ''whoever'' serves as the subject, and that function determines its case. Similarly, in the second sentence ''whomever'' is the object of ''choose'' in the clause, so it must be in the objective case even though the clause itself serves as the subject of the sentence.\n::WRONG: I'll talk to whomever will listen.\n::RIGHT: I'll talk to whoever will listen.\n::WRONG: Whoever you choose will suit me.\n::RIGHT: Whomever you choose will suit me.\n:As the second example above shows, a further distraction can arise when the ''who'' clause contains a nested clause, typically of attribution or identification (here, ''you choose'').

(In the internal clause, ''whom'' is the object of ''choose''.)\nIn sentences of this type, however, as with the \"subject ''whom''\" examples above, use of ''whom(ever)'' is sometimes found in places where it would not be expected grammatically, due to the relative complexity of the syntax.

In most cases the location of childbirth is planned ahead of time and may be at home, a hospital, a medical facility or a birthing center. In other situations, the birth occurs on the way to these facilities. Oftentimes, no trained medical personnel are present, other times there may be police or other first responders.

One hand is placed on the perineum while the other applies gentle pressure to the baby\u2019s head as it comes out.<ref name=\":6\" />  Soft pressure can be applied to the baby\u2019s chin through the perineum to help expel the head.  Rapid expulsion is still prevented with soft head pressure to reduce vaginal lacerations.<ref name=\":6\" />    \n# Cord check. A check is made to look for the presence of an umbilical cord ([[nuchal cord]]) around the baby\u2019s neck.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> If it is present, an index finger is used to attempt to pull it over the baby\u2019s head.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> If this cannot be done, the cord is clamped/tied in two places.

The placenta usually comes out in 2\u201310 minutes, but it may take up to 60 minutes.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n# Before the placenta is delivered there is a gush of blood as the cord gets longer.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n# The umbilical cord can be held taut, but must not be pulled with much force.<ref name=\":6\" />\n# The placenta is delivered and is be inspected for completeness.

Maternal complications include perineal tearing during delivery, excessive bleeding ([[postpartum hemorrhage]]), retained products of conception in the uterus, hypertension, and seizures.\n\n=== Vaginal bleeding and shock ===\nIn a pregnant woman, 40% of the circulating blood volume is in the uterus. This creates a large bleeding potential and high risk of [[Shock (circulatory)|hemorrhagic shock]] (low blood pressure from loss of circulating blood). For this reason, constant vigilance is important if any of the following occur:\n*Vaginal bleeding early or late in pregnancy\n*Severe abdominal pain\n*Trauma (such as a fall or car accident) while pregnant\n*Uncontrolled vaginal bleeding after the baby is delivered\n*Inability to remove the entire placenta after the baby is delivered\n\n==== First trimester bleeding ====\nCauses of vaginal bleeding early in pregnancy include [[miscarriage]] (inevitable or incomplete abortion), embryo implantation and growth outside the uterus ([[ectopic pregnancy]]), and placenta attachment at the bottom of the uterus over the cervix ([[Placenta praevia|placenta previa]]), all of which can cause significant bleeding.\n\n====Bleeding after the first trimester and during delivery====\n\nPrior to and during delivery, bleeding can also occur from tears in the cervix, vagina, or perineum, sudden placental detachment ([[Placental abruption|abruptio placenta]]) and placental attachment over the cervix ([[placenta previa]]), and [[uterine rupture]].\n\n====Bleeding after delivery (postpartum hemorrhage)====\n\nAfter delivery of the baby, a uterus that is not contracting (atonic uterus), ruptured uterus, remaining parts of placenta or baby or infected remaining parts of placenta or baby can cause severe bleeding. Postpartum bleeding is usually managed preventatively by massaging the lower abdomen ([[fundal massage]]), which increases contraction of the uterus and stops bleeding. Additionally, steady traction is applied to the cord to prevent trauma, cord avulsion (tearing of the umbilical cord), uterine inversion, and retained placental products, all of which can increase blood loss and/or the risk of infection.\n\nPostpartum hemorrhage is defined by loss of more than 500 mL blood within 24 hours after delivery. It is difficult to predict with few known risk factors and occurs in 3% of women, leading to ~150,000 annual deaths worldwide.<ref name=\":7\" /> Once uncontrolled bleeding occurs, management can be manual (fundal massage from the outside, packing the uterus, tamponading bleeding from the inside with balloon or condom catheter), and pharmacological (with [[Oxytocin (medication)|oxytocin]], [[ergotamine]], [[misoprostol]]). Alongside these treatments, shock should be addressed with IV fluids or blood transfusions as discussed below.\n\n====Severe blood loss leading to shock====\n\nIn shock, you may see cold clammy skin, pale skin (especially around eyes, mouth, and hands), sweating, anxiousness, and loss of consciousness. You may note a fast heartbeat (110 beats per minute or more), low blood pressure (90mmHg systolic or less), and decreased urine output.\n\nThe woman should be laid on her left side, with legs and buttocks elevated to encourage blood flow back to the heart with gravity. If available, IV fluids (Ringer\u2019s lactate or normal saline) should be started with monitoring of her heart rate, blood pressure, and appearance. If available, two large bore IV catheters (16-gauge or largest available) should be used to rapidly infuse 1L in 15\u201320 minutes, with a goal of giving 2L in the first hour. If unable to start an IV and the woman is able to drink and is conscious with no recent convulsions, give 300-500 mL of fluid by mouth. If the woman is unable to drink, is unconscious, or has recently had convulsions, fluid can be given rectally with an enema bag or can. Fill the enema with 500mL IV fluid, clamp the end of the tube and insert 10&nbsp;cm (3-4inches) into the rectum. If filling an enema, run water slowly or cramping can occur, pushing the water back out.\n\n=== Convulsions ===\nConvulsions (Seizures) in pregnancy can be caused by pregnancy specific causes of seizures such as [[eclampsia]] and by normal causes of seizures such as [[epilepsy]]. Warning signs that may lead to convulsions include [[Pre-eclampsia|pre-eclamsia]], which is a condition that pregnant women can get after 20 weeks of pregnancy that is characterized by new-onset high blood pressure, headaches, blurry vision, [[Pulmonary edema|trouble breathing from fluid in lungs]], [[Proteinuria|protein in urine from kidney failure]], and elevated liver enzymes from liver dysfunction, and possibly coagulation defects from platelet dysfunction.\n\nIf a pregnant woman begins to have convulsions, additional help and assistance should be sought. One should not restrain the patient, but lie her down on her left side and check the airway (mouth, nose, throat). Turning the patient on her side decreases risk of [[Pulmonary aspiration|breathing in vomit and spit]]. If available, magnesium sulfate is the preferred treatment for seizures in pregnant women, starting with a dose of 4&nbsp;mg IV over 5 minutes.<ref name=\":11\" /> A sensation of warmth during infusion is normal, however, there is also a risk of stopping breathing with magnesium sulfate use, which would indicate the dosage is too high. If this occurs, calcium gluconate can be used to reverse the effects (1g IV over 10 minutes, often in solution).<ref name=\":11\" /> In general, make sure the breathing rate is at least 16 breaths per minute and the knee jerk reflex is still intact before giving more magnesium sulfate. If magnesium sulfate is unavailable, diazepam can be used to treat convulsions in pregnancy. The first dose, the loading dose, should be 10&nbsp;mg of diazepam IV given over 2 minutes.<ref name=QuickRef>{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnacy580.pdf|title=Emergency Obstetric Care: Quick Reference Guide for Frontline Providers|last=United States Agency for International Development|first=Editors: Ann Blouse and Patricia Gomez|date=Sep 2003|website=USAID}}</ref> After this, the loading dose can be repeated. The maintenance dose is 40&nbsp;mg of diazepam in 500mL IV fluids. The amount of diazepam used should never be more than 100&nbsp;mg in 24 hours and it should be dosed in order to keep the woman awake, rousable, and breathing rate above 16 breaths per minute<ref name=QuickRef/>\n\n== Fetal care ==\nAlmost 10% of newborns require some resuscitative care. Common complications of childbirth that relate to the baby include [[Breech birth|breech presentation]], [[shoulder dystocia]], [[Chorioamnionitis|infection]], and umbilical cord wrapped around the baby's neck ([[nuchal cord]]).\n\n===Evaluation===\n\nThe newborn is evaluated at 1 and 5 minutes after birth using the [[Apgar score|Apgar]] score, which assigns points based on appearance (color), pulse, grimace (cry), activity (muscle tone), and respiration (breathing effort), with each component scored from 0 to 2. Scores below 7 generally require further care (see resuscitation below).\n\n===Routine care===\n\nAfter initial evaluation, babies with good Apgar scores are dried and rubbed, any obstruction of breathing is cleared, and they are warmed either with skin-to-skin contact with the mother or under a heat source.\n\n== Complications ==\nWith United States home births as an estimate, neonatal complications are common, with cord wrapped around the head 12-37% of the time ([[nuchal cord]]), insufficient oxygenation ([[Perinatal asphyxia|birth asphyxia]]) 9% of the time, pulselessness 6% of the time, and breech presentation 3% of the time<ref>\"Obstetrics/Gynecology.\" ''''Improvised Medicine: Providing Care in Extreme Environments, 2e'''' Ed.

However, other parts such as the buttocks or feet can present first, which is referred to as [[Breech birth|breech presentation]]. Risk for breech presentation may increase with multiple pregnancies (more than one baby), when there is too little or too much fluid in the uterus, or if the uterus is abnormally shaped.<ref name=\":6\" /> Babies in breech presentation can be delivered vaginally depending on the experience of the provider and if the fetus meets specific low risk criteria, however C-section is recommended if available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Mode-of-Term-Singleton-Breech-Delivery|title=Mode of Term Singleton Breech Delivery - ACOG|website=acog.org|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> Ideally, vaginal breech delivery should not be performed without the availability of nearby emergency C-section capabilities and extensive efforts should be made to bring a woman in labor with breech presentation to a hospital. There are many variations of breech presentations and multiple ways the baby can get stuck during delivery. If a breech delivery is occurring, the provider will guide the hips out by giving light, downward traction holding the pelvis until the scapula is present. Then at the level of the armpits, each shoulder is delivered by rotating the baby as required, then subsequently rotating 180 degrees to deliver the other shoulder. The head is delivered with careful attention to the baby's arms. The arms will be delivered downwards through the vulva and may have to be gently held downwards by the provider's fingers.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Pre-term labor===\n\nIncidence of preterm delivery is approximately 12%, and preterm births are a significant contributing cause of unplanned emergency delivery.<ref name=\":0\" /> Pre-term labor is defined as occurring before 37 weeks, and risks for pre-term labor include pregnancy with multiple fetuses, prior history of premature labor, structural abnormalities of the cervix or uterus, urinary tract, vaginal, or sexually transmitted infections, high blood pressure, drug use, diabetes, blood disorders, or pregnancy occurring less than 6 months after a prior pregnancy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The same principles of term emergency delivery apply to emergency delivery for a [[Preterm birth|preterm fetus]], though the baby will be at higher risk of other problems such as [[low birth weight]], trouble breathing, and infections. The newborn will need additional medical care and monitoring after delivery and should be taken to a hospital providing neonatal care, which may include antibiotics and breathing treatments.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/abnormalities-and-complications-of-labor-and-delivery/preterm-labor|title=Preterm Labor - Gynecology and Obstetrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Shoulder dystocia===\n\nIn [[shoulder dystocia]], the shoulder is trapped after the head is delivered, preventing delivery of the rest of the baby. The major risk factor (other than prior history of shoulder dystocia) is the baby being too large ([[Large for gestational age|macrosomia]]), which can result from the mother being obese or gaining too much weight, diabetes, and the pregnancy lasting too long ([[Postterm pregnancy|post-term pregnancy]]).<ref name=\":6\" /> Shoulder dystocia can lead to further fetal complications such as nerve compression and injury at the shoulder ([[Brachial plexus injury|brachial plexus]]), fracture of the collarbone, and low oxygen for the fetus (whether due to compression of the umbilical cord or due to inability of the baby to breathe). Shoulder dystocia is often signaled by retreat of the head between contractions when it has already been delivered (\"turtle sign\"). Treatment includes the [[McRoberts maneuver]], where the mother flexes her thighs up to her stomach with her knees wide apart as pressure is applied on her lower abdomen, and [[Wood's screw maneuver]], where the deliverer inserts a hand into the vagina to rotate the fetus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/abnormalities-and-complications-of-labor-and-delivery/fetal-dystocia|title=Fetal Dystocia - Gynecology and Obstetrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}</ref> If all maneuvers fail, then C-section would be indicated.\n\n===Prolapsed cord===\n[[File:Cord.prolaps.jpg|thumb|Umbilical cord prolapse]]\n\nA prolapsed cord refers to an umbilical cord that is delivered from the uterus while the baby is still in the uterus and is life-threatening to the baby. Cord prolapse creates a risk of decreased blood flow (and oxygen flow) to the baby as delivery will cause cord compression. However, if the cord delivers before the baby, the cord should not be placed back into the uterus through the cervix since this increases risk of infection.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 14871514 | doi=10.1016/S0020-7292(03)00333-3 | volume=84 | issue=2 | title=Umbilical cord prolapse and perinatal outcomes | year=2004 | journal=Int J Gynaecol Obstet | pages=127\u201332  | last1 = Kahana | first1 = B | last2 = Sheiner | first2 = E | last3 = Levy | first3 = A | last4 = Lazer | first4 = S | last5 = Mazor | first5 = M}}</ref> Emergent obstetric care for C-section would be indicated, and in the meantime, one should elevate the foot of the bed if possible to attempt to keep the baby above the level of the cord.<ref name=\":0\" /> If no specialized care is available, one may attempt to reduce pressure of the cord manually and continue delivery, but this is often difficult to do.\n\n===Nuchal cord===\n\nAfter the baby crowns, the umbilical cord may be found to be wrapped around the neck or body of the baby, which is known as nuchal cord. This is common, occurring in up to 37% of term pregnancies, and most do not cause any long-term problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peesay|first=Morarji|date=2012-08-28|title=Cord around the neck syndrome|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|volume=12|issue=Suppl 1|pages=A6|doi=10.1186/1471-2393-12-S1-A6|issn=1471-2393|pmc=3428673}}</ref> This wrapped cord should be slipped over the head so it is not pulled during delivery. If the wrap is not removed, it can choke the baby or can cause the placenta to detach suddenly which can cause severe maternal bleeding and loss of blood and oxygen to the baby. The cord may also be wrapped around a limb in breech presentation, and should similarly be reduced in these cases.\n\n===Resuscitation===\n\nIf the baby is not doing well on its own, further care may be necessary. Resuscitation typically starts with warming, drying, and stimulating the newborn. If breathing difficulty is noted, the airway is opened and cleared with suction and oxygen is monitored; if necessary, one may consider using a positive airway pressure ventilator (which gives oxygen while keeping the airway open) or intubation. If the heart rate is below 60 beats per minute, CPR is started at 3:1 compression to ventilation ratio, with compressions given at the lower breastbone. If this fails to revive the newborn, epinephrine will be given.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nResuscitation is not indicated for newborns below 22 weeks of gestation and weighing below 400 grams. Resuscitation may also be discontinued if the baby's heart does not start after 10\u201315 minutes of full resuscitation (including breathing treatments, medications, and CPR).\n\n==In culture==\nThe reports of emergency childbirth are typically of general interest.

Maternal complications include perineal tearing during delivery, excessive bleeding ([[postpartum hemorrhage]]), retained products of conception in the uterus, hypertension, and seizures.\n\n=== Vaginal bleeding and shock ===\nIn a pregnant woman, 40% of the circulating blood volume is in the uterus. This creates a large bleeding potential and high risk of [[Shock (circulatory)|hemorrhagic shock]] (low blood pressure from loss of circulating blood). For this reason, constant vigilance is important if any of the following occur:\n*Vaginal bleeding early or late in pregnancy\n*Severe abdominal pain\n*Trauma (such as a fall or car accident) while pregnant\n*Uncontrolled vaginal bleeding after the baby is delivered\n*Inability to remove the entire placenta after the baby is delivered\n\n==== First trimester bleeding ====\nCauses of vaginal bleeding early in pregnancy include [[miscarriage]] (inevitable or incomplete abortion), embryo implantation and growth outside the uterus ([[ectopic pregnancy]]), and placenta attachment at the bottom of the uterus over the cervix ([[Placenta praevia|placenta previa]]), all of which can cause significant bleeding.\n\n====Bleeding after the first trimester and during delivery====\n\nPrior to and during delivery, bleeding can also occur from tears in the cervix, vagina, or perineum, sudden placental detachment ([[Placental abruption|abruptio placenta]]) and placental attachment over the cervix ([[placenta previa]]), and [[uterine rupture]].\n\n====Bleeding after delivery (postpartum hemorrhage)====\n\nAfter delivery of the baby, a uterus that is not contracting (atonic uterus), ruptured uterus, remaining parts of placenta or baby or infected remaining parts of placenta or baby can cause severe bleeding. Postpartum bleeding is usually managed preventatively by massaging the lower abdomen ([[fundal massage]]), which increases contraction of the uterus and stops bleeding. Additionally, steady traction is applied to the cord to prevent trauma, cord avulsion (tearing of the umbilical cord), uterine inversion, and retained placental products, all of which can increase blood loss and/or the risk of infection.\n\nPostpartum hemorrhage is defined by loss of more than 500 mL blood within 24 hours after delivery. It is difficult to predict with few known risk factors and occurs in 3% of women, leading to ~150,000 annual deaths worldwide.<ref name=\":7\" /> Once uncontrolled bleeding occurs, management can be manual (fundal massage from the outside, packing the uterus, tamponading bleeding from the inside with balloon or condom catheter), and pharmacological (with [[Oxytocin (medication)|oxytocin]], [[ergotamine]], [[misoprostol]]). Alongside these treatments, shock should be addressed with IV fluids or blood transfusions as discussed below.\n\n====Severe blood loss leading to shock====\n\nIn shock, you may see cold clammy skin, pale skin (especially around eyes, mouth, and hands), sweating, anxiousness, and loss of consciousness. You may note a fast heartbeat (110 beats per minute or more), low blood pressure (90mmHg systolic or less), and decreased urine output.\n\nThe woman should be laid on her left side, with legs and buttocks elevated to encourage blood flow back to the heart with gravity. If available, IV fluids (Ringer\u2019s lactate or normal saline) should be started with monitoring of her heart rate, blood pressure, and appearance. If available, two large bore IV catheters (16-gauge or largest available) should be used to rapidly infuse 1L in 15\u201320 minutes, with a goal of giving 2L in the first hour. If unable to start an IV and the woman is able to drink and is conscious with no recent convulsions, give 300-500 mL of fluid by mouth. If the woman is unable to drink, is unconscious, or has recently had convulsions, fluid can be given rectally with an enema bag or can. Fill the enema with 500mL IV fluid, clamp the end of the tube and insert 10&nbsp;cm (3-4inches) into the rectum. If filling an enema, run water slowly or cramping can occur, pushing the water back out.\n\n=== Convulsions ===\nConvulsions (Seizures) in pregnancy can be caused by pregnancy specific causes of seizures such as [[eclampsia]] and by normal causes of seizures such as [[epilepsy]]. Warning signs that may lead to convulsions include [[Pre-eclampsia|pre-eclamsia]], which is a condition that pregnant women can get after 20 weeks of pregnancy that is characterized by new-onset high blood pressure, headaches, blurry vision, [[Pulmonary edema|trouble breathing from fluid in lungs]], [[Proteinuria|protein in urine from kidney failure]], and elevated liver enzymes from liver dysfunction, and possibly coagulation defects from platelet dysfunction.\n\nIf a pregnant woman begins to have convulsions, additional help and assistance should be sought. One should not restrain the patient, but lie her down on her left side and check the airway (mouth, nose, throat). Turning the patient on her side decreases risk of [[Pulmonary aspiration|breathing in vomit and spit]]. If available, magnesium sulfate is the preferred treatment for seizures in pregnant women, starting with a dose of 4&nbsp;mg IV over 5 minutes.<ref name=\":11\" /> A sensation of warmth during infusion is normal, however, there is also a risk of stopping breathing with magnesium sulfate use, which would indicate the dosage is too high. If this occurs, calcium gluconate can be used to reverse the effects (1g IV over 10 minutes, often in solution).<ref name=\":11\" /> In general, make sure the breathing rate is at least 16 breaths per minute and the knee jerk reflex is still intact before giving more magnesium sulfate. If magnesium sulfate is unavailable, diazepam can be used to treat convulsions in pregnancy. The first dose, the loading dose, should be 10&nbsp;mg of diazepam IV given over 2 minutes.<ref name=QuickRef>{{Cite web|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/pnacy580.pdf|title=Emergency Obstetric Care: Quick Reference Guide for Frontline Providers|last=United States Agency for International Development|first=Editors: Ann Blouse and Patricia Gomez|date=Sep 2003|website=USAID}}</ref> After this, the loading dose can be repeated. The maintenance dose is 40&nbsp;mg of diazepam in 500mL IV fluids. The amount of diazepam used should never be more than 100&nbsp;mg in 24 hours and it should be dosed in order to keep the woman awake, rousable, and breathing rate above 16 breaths per minute<ref name=QuickRef/>\n\n== Fetal care ==\nAlmost 10% of newborns require some resuscitative care. Common complications of childbirth that relate to the baby include [[Breech birth|breech presentation]], [[shoulder dystocia]], [[Chorioamnionitis|infection]], and umbilical cord wrapped around the baby's neck ([[nuchal cord]]).\n\n===Evaluation===\n\nThe newborn is evaluated at 1 and 5 minutes after birth using the [[Apgar score|Apgar]] score, which assigns points based on appearance (color), pulse, grimace (cry), activity (muscle tone), and respiration (breathing effort), with each component scored from 0 to 2. Scores below 7 generally require further care (see resuscitation below).\n\n===Routine care===\n\nAfter initial evaluation, babies with good Apgar scores are dried and rubbed, any obstruction of breathing is cleared, and they are warmed either with skin-to-skin contact with the mother or under a heat source.\n\n== Complications ==\nWith United States home births as an estimate, neonatal complications are common, with cord wrapped around the head 12-37% of the time ([[nuchal cord]]), insufficient oxygenation ([[Perinatal asphyxia|birth asphyxia]]) 9% of the time, pulselessness 6% of the time, and breech presentation 3% of the time<ref>\"Obstetrics/Gynecology.\" ''''Improvised Medicine: Providing Care in Extreme Environments, 2e'''' Ed.

Risk for breech presentation may increase with multiple pregnancies (more than one baby), when there is too little or too much fluid in the uterus, or if the uterus is abnormally shaped.<ref name=\":6\" /> Babies in breech presentation can be delivered vaginally depending on the experience of the provider and if the fetus meets specific low risk criteria, however C-section is recommended if available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Mode-of-Term-Singleton-Breech-Delivery|title=Mode of Term Singleton Breech Delivery - ACOG|website=acog.org|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> Ideally, vaginal breech delivery should not be performed without the availability of nearby emergency C-section capabilities and extensive efforts should be made to bring a woman in labor with breech presentation to a hospital. There are many variations of breech presentations and multiple ways the baby can get stuck during delivery. If a breech delivery is occurring, the provider will guide the hips out by giving light, downward traction holding the pelvis until the scapula is present. Then at the level of the armpits, each shoulder is delivered by rotating the baby as required, then subsequently rotating 180 degrees to deliver the other shoulder. The head is delivered with careful attention to the baby's arms. The arms will be delivered downwards through the vulva and may have to be gently held downwards by the provider's fingers.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Pre-term labor===\n\nIncidence of preterm delivery is approximately 12%, and preterm births are a significant contributing cause of unplanned emergency delivery.<ref name=\":0\" /> Pre-term labor is defined as occurring before 37 weeks, and risks for pre-term labor include pregnancy with multiple fetuses, prior history of premature labor, structural abnormalities of the cervix or uterus, urinary tract, vaginal, or sexually transmitted infections, high blood pressure, drug use, diabetes, blood disorders, or pregnancy occurring less than 6 months after a prior pregnancy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The same principles of term emergency delivery apply to emergency delivery for a [[Preterm birth|preterm fetus]], though the baby will be at higher risk of other problems such as [[low birth weight]], trouble breathing, and infections. The newborn will need additional medical care and monitoring after delivery and should be taken to a hospital providing neonatal care, which may include antibiotics and breathing treatments.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/abnormalities-and-complications-of-labor-and-delivery/preterm-labor|title=Preterm Labor - Gynecology and Obstetrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Shoulder dystocia===\n\nIn [[shoulder dystocia]], the shoulder is trapped after the head is delivered, preventing delivery of the rest of the baby. The major risk factor (other than prior history of shoulder dystocia) is the baby being too large ([[Large for gestational age|macrosomia]]), which can result from the mother being obese or gaining too much weight, diabetes, and the pregnancy lasting too long ([[Postterm pregnancy|post-term pregnancy]]).<ref name=\":6\" /> Shoulder dystocia can lead to further fetal complications such as nerve compression and injury at the shoulder ([[Brachial plexus injury|brachial plexus]]), fracture of the collarbone, and low oxygen for the fetus (whether due to compression of the umbilical cord or due to inability of the baby to breathe). Shoulder dystocia is often signaled by retreat of the head between contractions when it has already been delivered (\"turtle sign\"). Treatment includes the [[McRoberts maneuver]], where the mother flexes her thighs up to her stomach with her knees wide apart as pressure is applied on her lower abdomen, and [[Wood's screw maneuver]], where the deliverer inserts a hand into the vagina to rotate the fetus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/gynecology-and-obstetrics/abnormalities-and-complications-of-labor-and-delivery/fetal-dystocia|title=Fetal Dystocia - Gynecology and Obstetrics - Merck Manuals Professional Edition|work=Merck Manuals Professional Edition|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}</ref> If all maneuvers fail, then C-section would be indicated.\n\n===Prolapsed cord===\n[[File:Cord.prolaps.jpg|thumb|Umbilical cord prolapse]]\n\nA prolapsed cord refers to an umbilical cord that is delivered from the uterus while the baby is still in the uterus and is life-threatening to the baby. Cord prolapse creates a risk of decreased blood flow (and oxygen flow) to the baby as delivery will cause cord compression. However, if the cord delivers before the baby, the cord should not be placed back into the uterus through the cervix since this increases risk of infection.<ref>Kahana  B, Sheiner  E, Levy  A  et al.: Umbilical cord prolapse and perinatal outcomes. ''Int J Gynaecol Obstet'' 84: 127, 2004. [PubMed: 14871514]</ref> Emergent obstetric care for C-section would be indicated, and in the meantime, one should elevate the foot of the bed if possible to attempt to keep the baby above the level of the cord.<ref name=\":0\" /> If no specialized care is available, one may attempt to reduce pressure of the cord manually and continue delivery, but this is often difficult to do.\n\n===Nuchal cord===\n\nAfter the baby crowns, the umbilical cord may be found to be wrapped around the neck or body of the baby, which is known as nuchal cord. This is common, occurring in up to 37% of term pregnancies, and most do not cause any long-term problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peesay|first=Morarji|date=2012-08-28|title=Cord around the neck syndrome|journal=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|volume=12|issue=Suppl 1|pages=A6|doi=10.1186/1471-2393-12-S1-A6|issn=1471-2393|pmc=3428673}}</ref> This wrapped cord should be slipped over the head so it is not pulled during delivery. If the wrap is not removed, it can choke the baby or can cause the placenta to detach suddenly which can cause severe maternal bleeding and loss of blood and oxygen to the baby. The cord may also be wrapped around a limb in breech presentation, and should similarly be reduced in these cases.\n\n===Resuscitation===\n\nIf the baby is not doing well on its own, further care may be necessary. Resuscitation typically starts with warming, drying, and stimulating the newborn. If breathing difficulty is noted, the airway is opened and cleared with suction and oxygen is monitored; if necessary, one may consider using a positive airway pressure ventilator (which gives oxygen while keeping the airway open) or intubation. If the heart rate is below 60 beats per minute, CPR is started at 3:1 compression to ventilation ratio, with compressions given at the lower breastbone. If this fails to revive the newborn, epinephrine will be given.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nResuscitation is not indicated for newborns below 22 weeks of gestation and weighing below 400 grams. Resuscitation may also be discontinued if the baby's heart does not start after 10\u201315 minutes of full resuscitation (including breathing treatments, medications, and CPR).\n\n==In culture==\nThe reports of emergency childbirth are typically of general interest. A mobile app was developed in Ethiopia that guides users through the procedures of assisting with an emergency birth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/548047/a-mobile-app-could-make-childbirth-safer-in-ethiopia-one-of-the-deadliest-countries-to-have-a-baby/|title=A mobile app could make childbirth safer in Ethiopia, one of the deadliest countries to have a baby|first=Lily|last=Kuo|publisher=|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n[[File:Blue_question_mark_icon.svg|12px|]] <small>[[Wikipedia:Research help|Using Wikipedia for Research]]</small>\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Reproductive health}}\n{{Pregnancy}}\n{{Pathology of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium}}\n{{Infants and their care}}\n\n[[Category:Childbirth| ]]\n[[Category:Midwifery]]\n[[Category:Acute pain]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eProlapsed cord:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_childbirth"}

more expensive|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nAs with previous OnePlus phones, the 8 and 8 Pro use an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 and 8 Pro are the first water-resistant OnePlus phones, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. All 8 Pro models have water resistance, although for the 8 it is present only on carrier models. Both will be available in Onyx Black (glossy) and Glacial Green (matte), while the 8 Pro has its own Ultramarine Blue (matte) finish. The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

more expensive|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nAs with previous OnePlus phones, the 8 and 8 Pro use an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 and 8 Pro are the first water-resistant OnePlus phones, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. All 8 Pro models have water resistance, although for the 8 it is present only on carrier models. Both will be available in Onyx Black (glossy) and Glacial Green (matte), while the 8 Pro has its own Ultramarine Blue (matte) finish. The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

He is the band's lead vocalist, [[guitarist]] and chief songwriter. Between 1990 and 2014, Gamma Ray recorded eleven studio albums.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Formation===\nIn 1988, after four years with the German [[power metal]] band [[Helloween]], [[guitarist]] and [[songwriter]] [[Kai Hansen]] decided, for reasons that are still the subject of much debate, to leave the group. Hansen claimed that Helloween had become too big for him to handle, although the group's troubles with financial issues and their record company, [[Noise Records]], most likely played a part as well. He proceeded to do some studio work with German [[power metal]] band [[Blind Guardian]] and in 1989 decided to form his own project with long-time friend [[Ralf Scheepers]], former vocalist of the band Tyran Pace. This two-man project grew into a four-man band with the addition of [[Uwe Wessel]] on bass and Mathias Burchardt on drums. This was the first line-up of Gamma Ray, bearing a sound understandably close to that of Helloween of that period.\n\n===The Scheepers era (1989&ndash;1995)===\nThe original line-up released the album ''[[Heading for Tomorrow]]'' in February 1990 and later that year the ''[[Heaven Can Wait (Gamma Ray EP)|Heaven Can Wait EP]]'', with new guitarist [[Dirk Schl\u00e4chter]] and new drummer [[Uli Kusch]].\n\nIn February 1991, the band began rehearsing for the recording of their second album in a small, remote house in Denmark. With some brand new songs written, Gamma Ray entered the studio under the supervision of producer Tommy Newton and recorded their second album ''[[Sigh No More (Gamma Ray album)|Sigh No More]]'', which was released in September 1991. The style differed vastly from that of ''Heading for Tomorrow'', featuring darker lyrics inspired by the [[Persian Gulf War]] that was raging at the time. A 50-date worldwide tour followed.\n\nAfter the Japanese tour at the beginning of 1991, Gamma Ray underwent another personnel change: the rhythm section (Wessel and Kusch) left due to a personal disagreement and were replaced by Jan Rubach (bass) and Thomas Nack (drums), both from the [[Hamburg]] band Anesthesia. The band also began to build their own studio, so work on their new album didn't start until 1993. The album ''[[Insanity and Genius]]'' was released in June 1993, with a style which was closer to that of ''Heading for Tomorrow'' than ''Sigh No More''. In September 1993 Gamma Ray, along with [[Rage (German band)|Rage]], Helicon and [[Conception (band)|Conception]], embarked on the Melodic Metal Strikes Back tour. The tour contributed to the release of the double CD ''Power of Metal'', and the videos ''Power of Metal'' and ''Lust for Live'', in December.\n\n===''Land of the Free'' to ''Majestic'' (1995&ndash;2006)===\nMore changes in the lineup were to follow for Gamma Ray. Vocalist Ralf Scheepers, who lived far away from the other band members hometown of [[Hamburg]], was attempting to become the new [[Judas Priest]] singer after [[Rob Halford]] left. He felt that his position in the band had been strained due to the distance between him and the other members. Hansen and Scheepers agreed to an amicable departure. After failing to be recruited for Judas Priest, Scheepers started his own band, [[Primal Fear (band)|Primal Fear]]. Hansen then began to search for a new vocalist but, due to demand from friends and fans, took on the guitar-vocal duties himself as he had done for Helloween's [[Helloween (album)|first EP]] and [[Walls of Jericho (album)|album]].\n\nIn a 2008 interview, Hansen spoke about the importance of the Land of the Free album and what it represented: \"We made it exactly at a time point when this kind of metal was proclaimed to be dead as can be. Where it was almost like if a drummer came up with a double bass drum people would say \u2018 ya dooga daga yourself out of here man.\u2019 Everything was ruled by Kurt Cobain and the alternative to the alternative and all that kind of stuff. So at that point we made an album like this and it went down very successful. That was cool, that was something special. I think it was the album that gave Gamma Ray the acceptance as being a band not only a Kai Hansen project.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2008/03/02/gamma-ray-kai-hansen-2/|title=Gamma Ray\u2019s Kai Hansen interviewed by EvilG|last=EvilG|date=2 March 2008|website=[[Metal Rules]]|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 the fourth album, ''[[Land of the Free (Gamma Ray album)|Land of the Free]]'', the first to feature Hansen on vocals, was released. The album was universally praised by critics and fans alike. The tour following the album, ''Men on a Tour'', brought the recording and release of the live album ''[[Alive '95]]'' in 1996.\n\n[[File:Dan Zimmermann 11oct2005.jpg|thumb|Drummer [[Dan Zimmermann]] live in [[Barcelona]] in 2005]]\nSoon after, there was yet another major lineup change. Jan Rubach and Thomas Nack both left in order to return to Anesthesia and in came new [[drummer]] [[Dan Zimmermann]]. Zimmerman is also known for being a founding member of the German power metal band [[Freedom Call]]. Schl\u00e4chter, who was originally a bass player, as can be seen on the 1990 video ''[[Heading for the East]]'', left the second guitar spot and took back his original instrument, being replaced on guitar by [[Henjo Richter]].\n\nWork started on the next full-length album, and 1997 saw the release of ''[[Somewhere Out in Space]]'', which marked the beginning of the band's thematic concentration on space. The album featured the hit \"Valley of the Kings\" and entered in the charts of many European countries. After two years of touring came the album ''[[Power Plant (Gamma Ray album)|Power Plant]]'', which was a continuation of ''Somewhere Out in Space'''s lyrical approach, but a new direction musically. The album was highly acclaimed throughout the world and gained even more chart success than its predecessor.\n\nFor Gamma Ray's next work, Hansen decided to do things differently from the usual compilation of songs. He let the fans decide by voting on their website for their three favorite songs on each album, then the band went back to the studio to re-record the old tracks from the first three albums and made remixed versions for the songs on the later ones. ''[[Blast from the Past (Gamma Ray album)|Blast from the Past]]'' was the name chosen for this double album.\n\nAfter a break of one year, when Hansen concentrated on his side project [[Iron Savior]], the band was ready for the recording and release of the album ''[[No World Order (Gamma Ray album)|No World Order]]'', which was stylistically similar to [[NWOBHM]] bands such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]]. Again, the album was highly praised and the ''No Order World Tour'' saw the band visiting dozens of European countries and Japan. After resting from the tour, the band went on with the ''Skeletons in the Closet'' tour, which saw the band performing songs that they never or rarely played live before. Once again, the setlist was voted by the fans on the band's website. Only a few shows were played on this tour but two of those were recorded for the live album ''[[Skeletons in the Closet (Gamma Ray album)|Skeletons in the Closet]]''.\n\n[[File:Gamma Ray Rockharz 2016 05.jpg|thumb|left|Gamma Ray in concert in 2016 (Rockharz Open Air)]] \n[[Kai Hansen]] and [[Henjo Richter]] also participated in [[Tobias Sammet]]'s project [[Avantasia]], on both [[The Metal Opera]] and [[The Metal Opera Part II]], along with various other musicians including Hansen's former bandmates from [[Helloween]], [[Markus Grosskopf]] and [[Michael Kiske]].\n\nA live DVD, ''[[Hell Yeah! The Awesome Foursome|Hell Yeah - The Awesome Foursome (And The Finnish Keyboarder Who Didn't Want To Wear His Donald Duck Costume) Live in Montreal]]''<!--This is the real title--> was recorded on May 6, 2006 at Le Medley in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. The setlist contained songs drawn from all of their albums up to ''[[Majestic (Gamma Ray album)|Majestic]]'' (excluding ''Insanity and Genius'') and also a cover of the [[Helloween]] hit \"[[I Want Out]]\". The DVD finally saw release on November 4, 2008. It entered the German media control charts at No.&nbsp;9 and the Swedish charts at No.&nbsp;1, according to the band's official website.\n\n===''Land of the Free II'' to ''Empire of the Undead'', and additional vocalist (2007-present)===\nIn recent years, Gamma Ray have made use of touring keyboard players to fully augment their sound in a live environment. [[Axel Mackenrott]] of [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] fulfilled these duties in the past and was followed by Eero Kaukomies, a Finn who also plays in a Gamma Ray [[tribute band]] named Guardians of Mankind.<ref name=\"cover band\">{{cite web | title = Guardians of Mankind Myspace | url = http://www.myspace.com/guardiansofmankind | publisher =[[Myspace]]}}</ref> His bandmate [[Kasperi Heikkinen]] also played on part of the ''Majestic'' tour in 2006 following an injury to [[Henjo Richter]].

To promote the album, Gamma Ray were the \"very special guest\" on [[Helloween]]'s Hellish Rock 2007/2008 World Tour, on some shows along with the band [[Axxis]]. For the final encores of the evening, Hansen and members of Gamma Ray joined Helloween to play a couple of songs from when he was in the latter band. Hansen would also regularly join Helloween co-founder [[Michael Weikath]] at center stage to the delight of fans of both bands.\n\n''[[To the Metal!]]'' was released as the tenth full-length studio album by the band.

Some of their songs, written by Hansen, are often performed by Gamma Ray live, such as \"Ride the Sky,\" \"[[I Want Out]],\" \"Save Us,\" \"Judas,\" \"Victim of Fate\" or \"[[Future World (Helloween song)|Future World]].\"\n* The song \"Heavy Metal Mania\" by the band Holocaust was covered one time in studio and many times live.\n* Gamma Ray have covered [[Judas Priest]]'s \"Victim of Changes\" with Hansen on vocals and \"Exciter\" with Ralf. It has been stated in various interviews, that Judas Priest is one of Kai Hansen's favourite bands. They are also a favourite of Scheepers, as he left Gamma Ray during the tryouts for the new Judas Priest vocalist. He ultimately lost to [[Tim Owens|Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]]. Additionally, Gamma Ray's song \"Wings of Destiny\" (where it is being sung \"..on sad wings of destiny..\") could be linked to Judas Priest's [[Sad Wings of Destiny]], the album from which \"Victim of Changes\" originates. Another one is \"Hellbent for Metal\" with a stilish many similar to Judas.\n* They also covered two [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] songs: \"[[Look at Yourself (song)|Look at Yourself]]\" on the ''[[Heading for Tomorrow]]'' CD with Scheepers on vocals, and \"Return to Fantasy,\" sung by Hansen, featured on the 2003 release of ''[[Somewhere Out in Space]]''.\n* Gamma Ray covered the [[Pet Shop Boys]] song \"[[It's a Sin]]\" on their 1999 album ''[[Power Plant (Gamma Ray album)|Power Plant]]''.\n* [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]]'s [[Long Live Rock 'N' Roll]], recorded by Gamma Ray was featured on the 2003 release of the ''Power Plant'' album.\n* Gamma Ray covered the [[Thin Lizzy]] song \"Angel of Death\" on their 2001 single ''Heaven or Hell'', which was released in Japan only.\n* Gamma Ray have covered \"Gamma ray,\" off the album ''Hoodoo Man'', by [[Birth Control (band)|Birth Control]].\n* Gamma Ray covered \"Death Or Glory\", by Holocaust and \"Lost Angels\", by The Sweet.

He is the band's lead vocalist, [[guitarist]] and chief songwriter. Between 1990 and 2014, Gamma Ray recorded eleven studio albums.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Formation===\nIn 1988, after four years with the German [[power metal]] band [[Helloween]], [[guitarist]] and [[songwriter]] [[Kai Hansen]] decided, for reasons that are still the subject of much debate, to leave the group. Hansen claimed that Helloween had become too big for him to handle, although the group's troubles with financial issues and their record company, [[Noise Records]], most likely played a part as well. He proceeded to do some studio work with German [[power metal]] band [[Blind Guardian]] and in 1989 decided to form his own project with long-time friend [[Ralf Scheepers]], former vocalist of the band Tyran Pace. This two-man project grew into a four-man band with the addition of [[Uwe Wessel]] on bass and Mathias Burchardt on drums. This was the first line-up of Gamma Ray, bearing a sound understandably close to that of Helloween of that period.\n\n===The Scheepers era (1989&ndash;1995)===\nThe original line-up released the album ''[[Heading for Tomorrow]]'' in February 1990 and later that year the ''[[Heaven Can Wait (Gamma Ray EP)|Heaven Can Wait EP]]'', with new guitarist [[Dirk Schl\u00e4chter]] and new drummer [[Uli Kusch]].\n\nIn February 1991, the band began rehearsing for the recording of their second album in a small, remote house in Denmark. With some brand new songs written, Gamma Ray entered the studio under the supervision of producer Tommy Newton and recorded their second album ''[[Sigh No More (Gamma Ray album)|Sigh No More]]'', which was released in September 1991. The style differed vastly from that of ''Heading for Tomorrow'', featuring darker lyrics inspired by the [[Persian Gulf War]] that was raging at the time. A 50-date worldwide tour followed.\n\nAfter the Japanese tour at the beginning of 1991, Gamma Ray underwent another personnel change: the rhythm section (Wessel and Kusch) left due to a personal disagreement and were replaced by Jan Rubach (bass) and Thomas Nack (drums), both from the [[Hamburg]] band Anesthesia. The band also began to build their own studio, so work on their new album didn't start until 1993. The album ''[[Insanity and Genius]]'' was released in June 1993, with a style which was closer to that of ''Heading for Tomorrow'' than ''Sigh No More''. In September 1993 Gamma Ray, along with [[Rage (German band)|Rage]], Helicon and [[Conception (band)|Conception]], embarked on the Melodic Metal Strikes Back tour. The tour contributed to the release of the double CD ''Power of Metal'', and the videos ''Power of Metal'' and ''Lust for Live'', in December.\n\n===''Land of the Free'' to ''Majestic'' (1995&ndash;2006)===\nMore changes in the lineup were to follow for Gamma Ray. Vocalist Ralf Scheepers, who lived far away from the other band members hometown of [[Hamburg]], was attempting to become the new [[Judas Priest]] singer after [[Rob Halford]] left. He felt that his position in the band had been strained due to the distance between him and the other members. Hansen and Scheepers agreed to an amicable departure. After failing to be recruited for Judas Priest, Scheepers started his own band, [[Primal Fear (band)|Primal Fear]]. Hansen then began to search for a new vocalist but, due to demand from friends and fans, took on the guitar-vocal duties himself as he had done for Helloween's [[Helloween (album)|first EP]] and [[Walls of Jericho (album)|album]].\n\nIn a 2008 interview, Hansen spoke about the importance of the Land of the Free album and what it represented: \"We made it exactly at a time point when this kind of metal was proclaimed to be dead as can be. Where it was almost like if a drummer came up with a double bass drum people would say \u2018 ya dooga daga yourself out of here man.\u2019 Everything was ruled by Kurt Cobain and the alternative to the alternative and all that kind of stuff. So at that point we made an album like this and it went down very successful. That was cool, that was something special. I think it was the album that gave Gamma Ray the acceptance as being a band not only a Kai Hansen project.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2008/03/02/gamma-ray-kai-hansen-2/|title=Gamma Ray\u2019s Kai Hansen interviewed by EvilG|last=EvilG|date=2 March 2008|website=[[Metal Rules]]|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 the fourth album, ''[[Land of the Free (Gamma Ray album)|Land of the Free]]'', the first to feature Hansen on vocals, was released. The album was universally praised by critics and fans alike. The tour following the album, ''Men on a Tour'', brought the recording and release of the live album ''[[Alive '95]]'' in 1996.\n\n[[File:Dan Zimmermann 11oct2005.jpg|thumb|Drummer [[Dan Zimmermann]] live in [[Barcelona]] in 2005]]\nSoon after, there was yet another major lineup change. Jan Rubach and Thomas Nack both left in order to return to Anesthesia and in came new [[drummer]] [[Dan Zimmermann]]. Zimmerman is also known for being a founding member of the German power metal band [[Freedom Call]]. Schl\u00e4chter, who was originally a bass player, as can be seen on the 1990 video ''[[Heading for the East]]'', left the second guitar spot and took back his original instrument, being replaced on guitar by [[Henjo Richter]].\n\nWork started on the next full-length album, and 1997 saw the release of ''[[Somewhere Out in Space]]'', which marked the beginning of the band's thematic concentration on space. The album featured the hit \"Valley of the Kings\" and entered in the charts of many European countries. After two years of touring came the album ''[[Power Plant (Gamma Ray album)|Power Plant]]'', which was a continuation of ''Somewhere Out in Space'''s lyrical approach, but a new direction musically. The album was highly acclaimed throughout the world and gained even more chart success than its predecessor.\n\nFor Gamma Ray's next work, Hansen decided to do things differently from the usual compilation of songs. He let the fans decide by voting on their website for their three favorite songs on each album, then the band went back to the studio to re-record the old tracks from the first three albums and made remixed versions for the songs on the later ones. ''[[Blast from the Past (Gamma Ray album)|Blast from the Past]]'' was the name chosen for this double album.\n\nAfter a break of one year, when Hansen concentrated on his side project [[Iron Savior]], the band was ready for the recording and release of the album ''[[No World Order (Gamma Ray album)|No World Order]]'', which was stylistically similar to [[NWOBHM]] bands such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]]. Again, the album was highly praised and the ''No Order World Tour'' saw the band visiting dozens of European countries and Japan. After resting from the tour, the band went on with the ''Skeletons in the Closet'' tour, which saw the band performing songs that they never or rarely played live before. Once again, the setlist was voted by the fans on the band's website. Only a few shows were played on this tour but two of those were recorded for the live album ''[[Skeletons in the Closet (Gamma Ray album)|Skeletons in the Closet]]''.\n\n[[File:Gamma Ray Rockharz 2016 05.jpg|thumb|left|Gamma Ray in concert in 2016 (Rockharz Open Air)]] \n[[Kai Hansen]] and [[Henjo Richter]] also participated in [[Tobias Sammet]]'s project [[Avantasia]], on both [[The Metal Opera]] and [[The Metal Opera Part II]], along with various other musicians including Hansen's former bandmates from [[Helloween]], [[Markus Grosskopf]] and [[Michael Kiske]].\n\nA live DVD, ''[[Hell Yeah! The Awesome Foursome|Hell Yeah - The Awesome Foursome (And The Finnish Keyboarder Who Didn't Want To Wear His Donald Duck Costume) Live in Montreal]]''<!--This is the real title--> was recorded on May 6, 2006 at Le Medley in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. The setlist contained songs drawn from all of their albums up to ''[[Majestic (Gamma Ray album)|Majestic]]'' (excluding ''Insanity and Genius'') and also a cover of the [[Helloween]] hit \"[[I Want Out]]\". The DVD finally saw release on November 4, 2008. It entered the German media control charts at No.&nbsp;9 and the Swedish charts at No.&nbsp;1, according to the band's official website.\n\n===''Land of the Free II'' to ''Empire of the Undead'', and additional vocalist (2007-present)===\nIn recent years, Gamma Ray have made use of touring keyboard players to fully augment their sound in a live environment. [[Axel Mackenrott]] of [[Masterplan (band)|Masterplan]] fulfilled these duties in the past and was followed by Eero Kaukomies, a Finn who also plays in a Gamma Ray [[tribute band]] named Guardians of Mankind.<ref name=\"cover band\">{{cite web | title = Guardians of Mankind Myspace | url = http://www.myspace.com/guardiansofmankind | publisher =[[Myspace]]}}</ref> His bandmate [[Kasperi Heikkinen]] also played on part of the ''Majestic'' tour in 2006 following an injury to [[Henjo Richter]].

To promote the album, Gamma Ray were the \"very special guest\" on [[Helloween]]'s Hellish Rock 2007/2008 World Tour, on some shows along with the band [[Axxis]]. For the final encores of the evening, Hansen and members of Gamma Ray joined Helloween to play a couple of songs from when he was in the latter band. Hansen would also regularly join Helloween co-founder [[Michael Weikath]] at center stage to the delight of fans of both bands.\n\n''[[To the Metal!]]'' was released as the tenth full-length studio album by the band.

career, including, but not limited to:\n\n* [[Helloween]] - the former band of Kai Hansen. Some of their songs, written by Hansen, are often performed by Gamma Ray live, such as \"Ride the Sky,\" \"[[I Want Out]],\" \"Save Us,\" \"Judas,\" \"Victim of Fate\" or \"[[Future World (Helloween song)|Future World]].\"\n* The song \"Heavy Metal Mania\" by the band Holocaust was covered one time in studio and many times live.\n* Gamma Ray have covered [[Judas Priest]]'s \"Victim of Changes\" with Hansen on vocals and \"Exciter\" with Ralf. It has been stated in various interviews, that Judas Priest is one of Kai Hansen's favourite bands. They are also a favourite of Scheepers, as he left Gamma Ray during the tryouts for the new Judas Priest vocalist. He ultimately lost to [[Tim Owens|Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]]. Additionally, Gamma Ray's song \"Wings of Destiny\" (where it is being sung \"..on sad wings of destiny..\") could be linked to Judas Priest's [[Sad Wings of Destiny]], the album from which \"Victim of Changes\" originates. Another one is \"Hellbent for Metal\" with a stilish many similar to Judas.\n* They also covered two [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] songs: \"[[Look at Yourself (song)|Look at Yourself]]\" on the ''[[Heading for Tomorrow]]'' CD with Scheepers on vocals, and \"Return to Fantasy,\" sung by Hansen, featured on the 2003 release of ''[[Somewhere Out in Space]]''.\n* Gamma Ray covered the [[Pet Shop Boys]] song \"[[It's a Sin]]\" on their 1999 album ''[[Power Plant (Gamma Ray album)|Power Plant]]''.\n* [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]]'s [[Long Live Rock 'N' Roll]], recorded by Gamma Ray was featured on the 2003 release of the ''Power Plant'' album.\n* Gamma Ray covered the [[Thin Lizzy]] song \"Angel of Death\" on their 2001 single ''Heaven or Hell'', which was released in Japan only.\n* Gamma Ray have covered \"Gamma ray,\" off the album ''Hoodoo Man'', by [[Birth Control (band)|Birth Control]].\n* Gamma Ray covered \"Death Or Glory\", by Holocaust and \"Lost Angels\", by The Sweet.
