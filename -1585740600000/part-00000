Some of his main literary works include ''The Kingdom of the Divine Lovers, The Twelve Beguines, The Spiritual Espousals, A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness, The Little Book of Enlightenment'', and ''The Sparkling Stone''. Some of his letters also survive, as well as several short sayings (recorded by some of his disciples, such as Jan van Leeuwen). He wrote in the Dutch vernacular, the language of the common people of the Low Countries, rather than in Latin, the language of the Church liturgy and official texts, in order to reach a wider audience.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Until his ordination===\nJohn had a devout mother, who brought him up in the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic faith]]; of his father we know nothing. John's [[surname]], ''Van Ruusbroec'', is not a surname in the modern sense but a [[toponym]] that refers to his native [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]; modern-day [[Ruisbroek, Flemish Brabant|Ruisbroek]] near [[Brussels]] (compare [[John of Salisbury]] or [[Democritus of Abdera]]).\n\nAt the age of eleven he left his mother, departing without leave or warning, to place himself under the guidance and [[Tutor|tuition]] of his uncle, [[Jan Hinckaert]], a [[canon regular]] of [[Gudula|St. Gudule's]], Brussels. Hinckaert was living according to his Apostolic views with a fellow-canon, [[Frank van Coudenberg]].  This uncle provided for Ruysbroeck's education with a view to the [[priesthood]]. In due course, John was presented with a [[prebendary|prebend]] in [[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral|St. Gudule's church]], and ordained in 1318. His mother had followed him to Brussels, entered a [[Beguines|B\u00e9guinage]] there, and died shortly before his [[ordination]].\n\n===Priest in Brussels===\nFrom 1318 until 1343 Ruysbroeck served as a parish priest at St Gudula. He continued to lead, together with his uncle Hinckaert and Van Coudenberg, a life of extreme austerity and retirement. At that time the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] were causing controversy in the Netherlands and one of them, a woman named [[Heilwige Bloemardinne]], was particularly active in Brussels, propagating her beliefs chiefly by means of popular pamphlets. Ruysbroeck responded with pamphlets also written in the native tongue ([[Middle Dutch]]). Nothing of these treatises remains.  The controversy had a permanent effect on Ruysbroeck: his later writings bear constant reference, direct and indirect, to the [[heresy|heretical]] views expressed in these times, and he always wrote in the country's native language, chiefly with a view to counteracting these writings which he viewed as heretical.\n\n===Priest in Groenendaal===\n[[File:Ruysbroeck chapel.JPG|thumb|Small chapel in the forest at Groenendaal near the monastery where Ruysbroeck contemplated]]The desire for a more retired life, and possibly also the persecution which followed Ruysbroeck's attack on Bloemardinne, induced Ruysbroeck, Jan Hinckaert (d. 1350) and Vrank van Coudenberg (d. 1386) to leave Brussels in 1343 for the [[Groenendael Priory|hermitage of Groenendaal]], in the neighbouring [[Sonian Forest]], which was made over to them by [[John III, Duke of Brabant]]. The ruins of the monastery are still present in the forest of Soignes.<ref>Michel Erkins. ''De Priorij van Groenendaal''. Gemeentehuis. Jan van Ruusbroecpark. Hoeilaart. 2007.</ref>\n\nBut here so many disciples joined the little company that it was found expedient to organize into a duly-authorized religious body. The hermitage was erected into a community of canons regular on 13 March 1349, and eventually it became the motherhouse of a congregation, which bore its name of Groenendaal. Francis van Coudenberg was appointed first [[provost (religion)|provost]], and Blessed John Ruysbroeck [[prior]]. Hinckaert refrained from making the canonical profession lest the discipline of the house should suffer from the exemptions required by the infirmities of his old age; he dwelt, therefore, in a cell outside the [[cloister]] and there a few years later died.\n\nThis period, from his religious profession (1349) to his death (1381), was the most active and fruitful of Ruysbroeck's career. During this time, his fame as a man of God, as a sublime contemplative and a skilled director of souls, spread beyond the bounds of [[county of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to [[County of Holland|Holland]], Germany, and France.<ref>A characteristic story was that one day two priests came from Paris to ask his opinion of their spiritual state, to be told: \"You are as holy as you wish to be!\" (Evelyn Underhill introduction to ''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''. Translation by C. A. Wynschenk.  London: J. M. Dent, 1916. p3)</ref> He had relations with the nearby Carthusian house at Herne, and also with several communities of Poor Clare Franciscans. We know that he had connections with the [[Friends of God]] in [[Strasbourg]], and also that in about 1378 he was visited by [[Geert Groote]], the founder of the ''devotio moderna''. It is possible, though disputed, that [[John Tauler]] came to see him.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\nJohn died at Groenendaal, aged 82, on 2 December 1381.\n\n==Works==\nIn total, Ruysbroeck wrote twelve books, seven epistles, two hymns and a prayer. All were written in Middle Dutch.\n\nAround 1340, Ruysbroeck wrote his masterpiece, ''The Spiritual Espousals''. The 36 surviving Dutch manuscripts, as well as translations into Latin and Middle High German, are evidence of the book's popularity. Some of the text was also translated into Middle English (via the Latin translation) as ''The Chastising of God's Children'' (which was later printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rozenski|first1=Steven|title=''The Chastising of God\u2019s Children'' from manuscript to print|journal=\u00c9tudes anglaises|date=2013|volume=66|issue=3|pages=369\u201378|url=http://www.cairn.info/load_pdf.php?ID_ARTICLE=ETAN_663_0369|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> Around the same time, he also wrote a short treatise, ''The Sparkling Stone'',<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref> which was also translated into Middle English.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Arblaster|first1=Rob|last2=Faesen|first2=John|title=A Companion to John of Ruusbroec|date=2014|publisher=Brill|pages=243\u20134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ao6fAwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck's most famous writings were composed during his time in Groenendaal. His longest and most popular work (surviving today in 42 manuscripts), ''The Spiritual Tabernacle'' was begun in Brussels but finished at Groenendaal, presumably early on in his time there. Two brief works, ''The Christian Faith'' (an explanation of the Creed) and a treatise on ''The Four Temptations'', also date from around the time of Ruysbroeck's arrival in Groenendaal.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\nHis later works include four writings to Margareta van Meerbeke, a Franciscan nun of Brussels. These are ''The Seven Enclosures'' (c1346-50), the first of his seven surviving letters, ''The Seven Rungs'' (c1359-60), and ''A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness''.\n\nAround 1363 the Carthusians at Herne dispatched a deputation to Groenendaal presenting Ruysbroeck with questions on his first book, ''The Realm of Lovers''. Ruysbroeck went to Herne to clarify his teaching, and afterwards put this in writing in his work ''The Little Book of Enlightenment''.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n[[File:Ruysbroeck weg.JPG|thumb|Jan Ruysbroeck Weg sign on walls of his old monastery at Groenendaal.]]Of Ruysbroeck's works, the treatise ''The Seven Steps of the Ladder of Spiritual Love'' is the one that is currently most-readily available. Of the various treatises preserved, the best-known and the most characteristic is that entitled ''The Spiritual Espousals''. It is divided into three books, treating respectively of the active, the interior, and the contemplative life.\n\nLiterally, Ruysbroeck wrote as the spirit moved him. He loved to [[wander]] and [[meditation|meditate]] in the solitude of the forest adjoining the cloister; he was accustomed to carry a tablet with him, and on this to jot down his thoughts as he felt inspired so to do. Late in life he was able to declare that he had never committed aught to writing save by the motion of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nIn none of his treatises do we find anything like a complete or detailed account of his system; perhaps, it would be correct to say that he himself was not conscious of elaborating any system. In his dogmatic writings he explains, illustrates, and enforces traditional teachings with remarkable force and lucidity. In his [[ascetism|ascetic]] works, his favourite virtues are [[detachment (philosophy)|detachment]], [[humility]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]; he loves to dwell on such themes as flight from the world, meditation upon the Life, especially the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], abandonment to the Divine Will, and an intense personal love of God.\n\nIn common with most of the German mystics, Ruysbroeck starts from divine matters before describing humanity. His work often then returns to discussing God, showing how the divine and the human are so closely united as to become one. He demonstrates inclinations towards [[Christian universalism]] in writing that \"Man, having proceeded from God is destined to return, and become one with Him again.\" But here he is careful to clarify his position: \"There where I assert that we are one in God, I must be understood in this sense that we are one in love, not in essence and nature.\" Despite this declaration, however, and other similar saving clauses scattered over his pages, some of Ruysbroeck's expressions are certainly rather unusual and startling. The sublimity of his subject-matter was such that it could scarcely be otherwise. His devoted friend, Gerard Groote, a trained theologian, confessed to a feeling of uneasiness over certain of his phrases and passages, and begged him to change or modify them for the sake at least of the weak. Later on, [[Jean Gerson]] and then [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] both professed to find traces of unconscious [[pantheism]] in his works. But as an offset we may mention the enthusiastic commendations of his contemporaries, Groote, [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]], [[John of Schoonhoven]], and in subsequent times of the [[Franciscan]] [[Henry van Herp]], the [[Carthusian]]s [[Denis the Carthusian|Denis]] and [[Laurentius Surius]], the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[Thomas \u00e1 Jesu]], the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Louis de Blois]], and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Leonardus Lessius]]. [[Ernest Hello]] and especially [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] have done much to make his writings known. Ruysbroeck was a powerful influence in developing [[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]]'s conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as expressed in his book of contemplations called ''[[V\u00e4gm\u00e4rken]]'' ('Markings').<ref>\"[t]he counterpoint to this enormously exposed and public life is Eckhart and Jan van Ruysbroek. They really give me balance and-a more necessary sense of humor.\" Henry P van Dusen. ''Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings''. Faber and Faber. London, 1967. pp49-50</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck insisted that the [[soul]] finds God in its own depths, and noted three stages of progress in what he called the spiritual ladder of Christian attainment: (1) the active life, (2) the inward life, (3) the contemplative life. He did not teach the fusion of the self in God, but held that at the summit of the ascent the soul still preserves its identity.<ref>\"Nevertheless neither is this unity one, but each of those established in singular grace and glory hold in themselves unity and their own function in accordance with their own dignity and nobility. But this unity is situated in the mind and in the form of all powers by means of the bond of love.\" Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. p134.</ref> In the ''Kingdom of the Lovers of God'' he explains that those seeking wisdom must \"flow forth on the waters to all the boundaries of the earth, that is, on compassion, pity and mercy shown to the needs of all men\", must \"fly in the air of the Rational faculty\" and \"refer all actions and virtues to the honour of God\"; thence (through grace) they will find an \"immense and boundless clearness\" bestowed upon their mind.<ref>Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul.

Some of his main literary works include ''The Kingdom of the Divine Lovers, The Twelve Beguines, The Spiritual Espousals, A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness, The Little Book of Enlightenment'', and ''The Sparkling Stone''. Some of his letters also survive, as well as several short sayings (recorded by some of his disciples, such as Jan van Leeuwen). He wrote in the Dutch vernacular, the language of the common people of the Low Countries, rather than in Latin, the language of the Church liturgy and official texts, in order to reach a wider audience.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Until his ordination===\nJohn had a devout mother, who brought him up in the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic faith]]; of his father we know nothing. John's [[surname]], ''Van Ruusbroec'', is not a surname in the modern sense but a [[toponym]] that refers to his native [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]; modern-day [[Ruisbroek, Flemish Brabant|Ruisbroek]] near [[Brussels]] (compare [[John of Salisbury]] or [[Democritus of Abdera]]).\n\nAt the age of eleven he left his mother, departing without leave or warning, to place himself under the guidance and [[Tutor|tuition]] of his uncle, [[Jan Hinckaert]], a [[canon regular]] of [[Gudula|St. Gudule's]], Brussels. Hinckaert was living according to his Apostolic views with a fellow-canon, [[Frank van Coudenberg]].  This uncle provided for Ruysbroeck's education with a view to the [[priesthood]]. In due course, John was presented with a [[prebendary|prebend]] in [[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral|St. Gudule's church]], and ordained in 1318. His mother had followed him to Brussels, entered a [[Beguines|B\u00e9guinage]] there, and died shortly before his [[ordination]].\n\n===Priest in Brussels===\nFrom 1318 until 1343 Ruysbroeck served as a parish priest at St Gudula. He continued to lead, together with his uncle Hinckaert and Van Coudenberg, a life of extreme austerity and retirement. At that time the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] were causing controversy in the Netherlands and one of them, a woman named [[Heilwige Bloemardinne]], was particularly active in Brussels, propagating her beliefs chiefly by means of popular pamphlets. Ruysbroeck responded with pamphlets also written in the native tongue ([[Middle Dutch]]). Nothing of these treatises remains.  The controversy had a permanent effect on Ruysbroeck: his later writings bear constant reference, direct and indirect, to the [[heresy|heretical]] views expressed in these times, and he always wrote in the country's native language, chiefly with a view to counteracting these writings which he viewed as heretical.\n\n===Priest in Groenendaal===\n[[File:Ruysbroeck chapel.JPG|thumb|Small chapel in the forest at Groenendaal near the monastery where Ruysbroeck contemplated]]The desire for a more retired life, and possibly also the persecution which followed Ruysbroeck's attack on Bloemardinne, induced Ruysbroeck, Jan Hinckaert (d. 1350) and Vrank van Coudenberg (d. 1386) to leave Brussels in 1343 for the [[Groenendael Priory|hermitage of Groenendaal]], in the neighbouring [[Sonian Forest]], which was made over to them by [[John III, Duke of Brabant]]. The ruins of the monastery are still present in the forest of Soignes.<ref>Michel Erkins. ''De Priorij van Groenendaal''. Gemeentehuis. Jan van Ruusbroecpark. Hoeilaart. 2007.</ref>\n\nBut here so many disciples joined the little company that it was found expedient to organize into a duly-authorized religious body. The hermitage was erected into a community of canons regular on 13 March 1349, and eventually it became the motherhouse of a congregation, which bore its name of Groenendaal. Francis van Coudenberg was appointed first [[provost (religion)|provost]], and Blessed John Ruysbroeck [[prior]]. Hinckaert refrained from making the canonical profession lest the discipline of the house should suffer from the exemptions required by the infirmities of his old age; he dwelt, therefore, in a cell outside the [[cloister]] and there a few years later died.\n\nThis period, from his religious profession (1349) to his death (1381), was the most active and fruitful of Ruysbroeck's career. During this time, his fame as a man of God, as a sublime contemplative and a skilled director of souls, spread beyond the bounds of [[county of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] to [[County of Holland|Holland]], Germany, and France.<ref>A characteristic story was that one day two priests came from Paris to ask his opinion of their spiritual state, to be told: \"You are as holy as you wish to be!\" (Evelyn Underhill introduction to ''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''. Translation by C. A. Wynschenk.  London: J. M. Dent, 1916. p3)</ref> He had relations with the nearby Carthusian house at Herne, and also with several communities of Poor Clare Franciscans. We know that he had connections with the [[Friends of God]] in [[Strasbourg]], and also that in about 1378 he was visited by [[Geert Groote]], the founder of the ''devotio moderna''. It is possible, though disputed, that [[John Tauler]] came to see him.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\nJohn died at Groenendaal, aged 82, on 2 December 1381.\n\n==Works==\nIn total, Ruysbroeck wrote twelve books, seven epistles, two hymns and a prayer. All were written in Middle Dutch.\n\nAround 1340, Ruysbroeck wrote his masterpiece, ''The Spiritual Espousals''. The 36 surviving Dutch manuscripts, as well as translations into Latin and Middle High German, are evidence of the book's popularity. Some of the text was also translated into Middle English (via the Latin translation) as ''The Chastising of God's Children'' (which was later printed by [[Wynkyn de Worde]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rozenski|first1=Steven|title=''The Chastising of God\u2019s Children'' from manuscript to print|journal=\u00c9tudes anglaises|date=2013|volume=66|issue=3|pages=369\u201378|url=http://www.cairn.info/load_pdf.php?ID_ARTICLE=ETAN_663_0369|accessdate=24 July 2015}}</ref> Around the same time, he also wrote a short treatise, ''The Sparkling Stone'',<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref> which was also translated into Middle English.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Arblaster|first1=Rob|last2=Faesen|first2=John|title=A Companion to John of Ruusbroec|date=2014|publisher=Brill|pages=243\u20134|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ao6fAwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck's most famous writings were composed during his time in Groenendaal. His longest and most popular work (surviving today in 42 manuscripts), ''The Spiritual Tabernacle'' was begun in Brussels but finished at Groenendaal, presumably early on in his time there. Two brief works, ''The Christian Faith'' (an explanation of the Creed) and a treatise on ''The Four Temptations'', also date from around the time of Ruysbroeck's arrival in Groenendaal.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\nHis later works include four writings to Margareta van Meerbeke, a Franciscan nun of Brussels. These are ''The Seven Enclosures'' (c1346-50), the first of his seven surviving letters, ''The Seven Rungs'' (c1359-60), and ''A Mirror of Eternal Blessedness''.\n\nAround 1363 the Carthusians at Herne dispatched a deputation to Groenendaal presenting Ruysbroeck with questions on his first book, ''The Realm of Lovers''. Ruysbroeck went to Herne to clarify his teaching, and afterwards put this in writing in his work ''The Little Book of Enlightenment''.<ref>Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (New York: Herder & Herder, 2012), p7.</ref>\n\n==Thought==\n[[File:Ruysbroeck weg.JPG|thumb|Jan Ruysbroeck Weg sign on walls of his old monastery at Groenendaal.]]Of Ruysbroeck's works, the treatise ''The Seven Steps of the Ladder of Spiritual Love'' is the one that is currently most-readily available. Of the various treatises preserved, the best-known and the most characteristic is that entitled ''The Spiritual Espousals''. It is divided into three books, treating respectively of the active, the interior, and the contemplative life.\n\nLiterally, Ruysbroeck wrote as the spirit moved him. He loved to [[wander]] and [[meditation|meditate]] in the solitude of the forest adjoining the cloister; he was accustomed to carry a tablet with him, and on this to jot down his thoughts as he felt inspired so to do. Late in life he was able to declare that he had never committed aught to writing save by the motion of the [[Holy Ghost]].\n\nIn none of his treatises do we find anything like a complete or detailed account of his system; perhaps, it would be correct to say that he himself was not conscious of elaborating any system. In his dogmatic writings he explains, illustrates, and enforces traditional teachings with remarkable force and lucidity. In his [[ascetism|ascetic]] works, his favourite virtues are [[detachment (philosophy)|detachment]], [[humility]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]; he loves to dwell on such themes as flight from the world, meditation upon the Life, especially the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], abandonment to the Divine Will, and an intense personal love of God.\n\nIn common with most of the German mystics, Ruysbroeck starts from divine matters before describing humanity. His work often then returns to discussing God, showing how the divine and the human are so closely united as to become one. He demonstrates inclinations towards [[Christian universalism]] in writing that \"Man, having proceeded from God is destined to return, and become one with Him again.\" But here he is careful to clarify his position: \"There where I assert that we are one in God, I must be understood in this sense that we are one in love, not in essence and nature.\" Despite this declaration, however, and other similar saving clauses scattered over his pages, some of Ruysbroeck's expressions are certainly rather unusual and startling. The sublimity of his subject-matter was such that it could scarcely be otherwise. His devoted friend, Gerard Groote, a trained theologian, confessed to a feeling of uneasiness over certain of his phrases and passages, and begged him to change or modify them for the sake at least of the weak. Later on, [[Jean Gerson]] and then [[Jacques-B\u00e9nigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] both professed to find traces of unconscious [[pantheism]] in his works. But as an offset we may mention the enthusiastic commendations of his contemporaries, Groote, [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]], [[John of Schoonhoven]], and in subsequent times of the [[Franciscan]] [[Henry van Herp]], the [[Carthusian]]s [[Denis the Carthusian|Denis]] and [[Laurentius Surius]], the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] [[Thomas \u00e1 Jesu]], the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[Louis de Blois]], and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Leonardus Lessius]]. [[Ernest Hello]] and especially [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] have done much to make his writings known. Ruysbroeck was a powerful influence in developing [[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]]'s conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as expressed in his book of contemplations called ''[[V\u00e4gm\u00e4rken]]'' ('Markings').<ref>\"[t]he counterpoint to this enormously exposed and public life is Eckhart and Jan van Ruysbroek. They really give me balance and-a more necessary sense of humor.\" Henry P van Dusen. ''Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings''. Faber and Faber. London, 1967. pp49-50</ref>\n\nRuysbroeck insisted that the [[soul]] finds God in its own depths, and noted three stages of progress in what he called the spiritual ladder of Christian attainment: (1) the active life, (2) the inward life, (3) the contemplative life. He did not teach the fusion of the self in God, but held that at the summit of the ascent the soul still preserves its identity.<ref>\"Nevertheless neither is this unity one, but each of those established in singular grace and glory hold in themselves unity and their own function in accordance with their own dignity and nobility. But this unity is situated in the mind and in the form of all powers by means of the bond of love.\" Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. p134.</ref> In the ''Kingdom of the Lovers of God'' he explains that those seeking wisdom must \"flow forth on the waters to all the boundaries of the earth, that is, on compassion, pity and mercy shown to the needs of all men\", must \"fly in the air of the Rational faculty\" and \"refer all actions and virtues to the honour of God\"; thence (through grace) they will find an \"immense and boundless clearness\" bestowed upon their mind.<ref>Jan Ruysbroeck. ''The Kingdom of the Lovers of God''. T. Arnold Hyde (trans) Kegan Paul. London, 1919. pp 82-83 and 163</ref> In relation to the contemplative life, he held that three attributes should be acquired: The first is spiritual freedom from worldly desires (\"as empty of every outward work as if he did not work at all\"), the second is a mind unencumbered with images (\"inward silence\"), and the third is a feeling of inward union with God (\"even as a burning and glowing fire which can never more be quenched\").<ref>''The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage; The Sparkling Stone; The Book of the Supreme Truth''.

John was beatified on 1 December 1908, by [[Pope]] [[Pius X]].\n\nNo authentic [[portrait]] of John is known to exist; but the traditional picture represents him in the canonical habit, seated in the forest with his writing tablet on his knee, as he was in fact found one day by the brethren\u2014rapt in ecstasy and enveloped in flames, which encircle without consuming the tree under which he is resting.\n\nThere is a secondary school called Jan van Ruusbroeckollege in Laeken near the Royal Palace of Belgium.\n\n== Cultural references ==\nThe epigraph of the 1884 novel ''[[\u00c0 rebours]]'' by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] has the following Ruysbroeck quotation: \"I must rejoice beyond the bounds of time...though the world may shudder at my joy, and in its coarseness know not what I mean.\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages#Doctors in theology|List of Latin nicknames of the Middle Ages: Doctors in theology]]\n* [[Evelyn Underhill#Ruysbroeck (1914)|Evelyn Underhill's ''Ruysbroeck'']]\n* [[Hendrik Mande]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Modern editions===\n*''Jan van Ruusbroec: Opera Omnia'', ed.

In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...\n* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...\n* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...\n* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...\n* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...\n* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...\n* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Connection to Kharijites ==\n{{Main|Khawarij}}\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi\u02bfa Muslims.

In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above.

Raghu is seen to be arrogant and negatively shaded since young. He smokes and steals money from his father gamble. Once when Raghu attacks Sujatha's classmate when he helps her, Sujatha breaks all bonds with Raghu. When Raghu's family move to another village, Sujatha and Raghu do not even say goodbye to each other. Meanwhile, Raghu's father gifts Sujatha with silver anklets and requests her to never remove them to which obliges. Several years pass by. Raghu and Sujatha are farly distanced. Sujatha grows up to be a beautiful teenage girl whereas Raghu becomes a rogue and a womanizer. Everytime his mother speaks of Sujatha, he feels disgusted. He goes to the extent of sleeping with his servant.\n\nMeanwhile, Sujatha goes to college where she meets Venkat. Venkat is from an extremely poor family and does small jobs to survive his only mother, and pay money to the money lender. He has a decent group of friends and they are classmates with Sujatha. Venkat has an instant crush for Sujatha, while Sujatha does not reciprocate. Venkat asks Sujatha to come to the temple festival to which she denies. But in the end, Sujatha comes, indicating that she is in love with Venkat. Venkat and Sujatha start dating and communicate with each other on the train by writing to each other on the black board at the side of the train.\n\nOnce, when building up the courage to board the same compartment in the train as Venkat, Sujatha is spotted by the family astrologer. She goes home scared and as she had expected, the astrologer had told Sujatha's father. Her father tells her that she would be married to Raghu just like decided years ago. Sujatha protests but her father stays firms. This results in Sujatha dropped out from college and staying at home. \n\nRaghu comes for the engagement reluctantly (still thinking their childhood encounter), but instantly falls for her the moment he sees her. He warns Sujatha that she would never go away and marry him in the end. They both are engaged. Sujatha has a Younger sister Kalyani who turns out to be the messenger between her and Venkat. She give message to Venkat  to meet Sujatha at temple. The whole family go to the temple after the engagement and there Sujatha sees Venkat waiting for her. She is spotted talking to Venkat by Raghu and his gang and they mercilessly beat him up. Traumatized, Sujatha runs to her father but Raghu indirectly warns her family that things would turn out wrong if Venkat is seen anywhere near Sujatha.\n\nHe then mysteriously comes into Raghu's home and writes that he would be the one marrying Sujatha in the end, in blood, triggering Raghu. Fearing that Venkat would come and take Sujatha away, Raghu sends his men to Venkat's house. They trash the whole house and the things inside, sparing his mother. His mother tells Venkat's friends that he should come back with Sujatha and if he does not, she herself would kill him. Same thing happens in Sujatha's home on their wedding day he writes he will take Sujatha at 7:00 Clock. Raghu in a rush, asks the family to hurry and complete the wedding. Sujatha goes into the room to change but in reality, she is waiting for Venkat, after seeing his message on the wall. Raghu comes and breaks open the door and at the same time, Venkat comes through the roof and rescues Sujatha.\n\nAngered and defeated, Raghu goes after the couple and a chase ensues which results in Venkat getting wounded by Raghu.

The [[Congress of Angostura]] appointed [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] \"Supreme Commander of the Republic of Venezuela\" (Jefe Supremo de la Rep\u00fablica de Venezuela) from 1819 until 1830.\n\nIn 1830, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio P\u00e1ez]] declared Venezuela independent from [[Gran Colombia]] and became president, taking office on January 13, 1830.

From that point on, five constitutions were adopted, all slightly changing the extent of the President's powers and responsibilities.\n\n==Requirements==\nAccording to articles 227 and 229 of the [[Constitution of Venezuela]], adopted in 1999, the following requirements must be met in order to become President of Venezuela:<ref>Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Chapter 11 \u2013 National Executive Power</ref>\n*Being a Venezuelan citizen from birth and possessing no other nationality.\n*Being at least 30 years old at the time of the election.\n*Not being a subject to any conviction by final judgment.\n*Not being a Minister, Governor, Mayor or the Vice President of the Republic from the day the candidacy is announced to the day of the election.\n\n==Term limits==\nThe current presidential term is for six years with the constitutionally guaranteed recourse of holding a popular recall referendum any time within the last three years of a presidential term. A [[2009 Venezuelan constitutional referendum|2009 referendum]] removed the previous restrictions which limited the President to 2 terms.<ref name=termlimits/>\n\nFrom 1958 to 1999, the presidential term was set at five years. A sitting president was not only barred from immediate reelection, but could not run again for 10 years (equivalent to two full terms) after leaving office.\n\n==Recall==\n{{expand section|date=July 2016}}\nThe president may be [[recall election|recalled]] after a specific time in office.\n*[[2004 Venezuelan recall referendum]]\n*[[2016 Venezuelan recall referendum]] (unsuccessful)\n\n==Office-holders==\n{{Main|List of presidents of Venezuela}}\nPresidents of Venezuela who served under the 1864 constitution (starting with [[Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Falc\u00f3n]]) bore the title of \"President of the Union\", instead of the usual \"President of the Republic\" still used today.

A sitting president was not only barred from immediate reelection, but could not run again for 10 years (equivalent to two full terms) after leaving office.\n\n==Recall==\n{{expand section|date=July 2016}}\nThe president may be [[recall election|recalled]] after a specific time in office.\n*[[2004 Venezuelan recall referendum]]\n*[[2016 Venezuelan recall referendum]] (unsucessful)\n\n==Office-holders==\n{{Main|List of presidents of Venezuela}}\nPresidents of Venezuela who served under the 1864 constitution (starting with [[Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Falc\u00f3n]]) bore the title of \"President of the Union\", instead of the usual \"President of the Republic\" still used today.

Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part at Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that matches, both being Shanaya.

It was the major component of the incumbent [[L\u00f6fven I Cabinet|L\u00f6fven Cabinet]], in which it worked with the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]]. Its [[Party leader|leader]] [[Stefan L\u00f6fven]] had been [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] since 3 October 2014, and sought a mandate to continue his L\u00f6fven Cabinet.\n\nThe '''[[Moderate Party]]''' (M; ''Moderaterna'') was the second-largest party in the Riksdag with 84 seats. It was the largest governing party under [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] from 2006 to 2014. The party was involved alongside three other parties in the [[Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance]]; all four sought to return to power together. Reinfeldt resigned as party leader after eight years as Prime Minister, and was succeeded as leader by [[Anna Kinberg Batra]] on 10 January 2015. Kinberg Batra's decision as the ''de facto'' leader to enter the budgetary procedure agreement with the left-of-centre cabinet saw sharp disgruntlement from some party districts. The Alliance had more MPs than the government parties, but still found itself in opposition. Owing to her low [[opinion poll]]ing numbers, Kinberg Batra faced internal pressure from multiple party districts and the [[Moderate Youth League]] to resign. She announced her resignation in a morning press conference on 25 August 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/bp8mv/efter-avgangskraven--akb-haller-presstraff-i-dag|title=Anna Kinberg Batra avg\u00e5r som partiledare f\u00f6r Moderaterna|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref> Former prime minister and Moderate Party leader [[Carl Bildt]] was suggested as a replacement after Kinberg Batra resigned; however, despite some party districts supporting his candidacy, he declined the offer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/ejq1O/carl-bildts-besked-om-partiledarfragan-inte-intresserad|title=Carl Bildts besked om partiledarfr\u00e5gan: Inte intresserad|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref> Ultimately, Ulf Kristersson was elected to succeed Kinberg Batra as party leader, during an extra Moderate [[party conference]] on 1 October 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/ulf-kristersson-vill-gora-upp-med-s-om-invandringen/|title=Ulf Kristersson vill g\u00f6ra upp med S om invandringen&nbsp;\u2014 DN.SE|date=1 October 2017|work=DN.SE|access-date=2 October 2017|language=sv-se}}</ref>\n\nThe '''[[Sweden Democrats]]''' (SD; ''Sverigedemokraterna'') was the third-largest party in the Riksdag with 49 seats. In the [[2014 Swedish general election|2014 general election]] the party increased its number of seats by 29, becoming the third-largest party. Its leader was [[Jimmie \u00c5kesson]], who was the longest-serving party leader. The other Riksdag parties had repeatedly stated that they would not cooperate with the Sweden Democrats in a future government. An extra general election was called after the Sweden Democrats gave its support to the oppositional Alliance budget (see section '2014 budget crisis'). After the proposed extra election was cancelled, the party advertised itself as the 'only opposition party' and in the following months it saw a sharp rise in support (see section 'Opinion polls').\n\nThe '''[[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]]''' (MP; ''Milj\u00f6partiet'') was the fourth-largest party in the Riksdag with 25 seats. The Green Party was the minor component of the L\u00f6fven Cabinet, alongside the Social Democrats. It was the only Swedish party to have two [[spokesperson]]s, [[Gustav Fridolin]] (since 2011), who served as [[Minister for Education (Sweden)|Minister for Education]], and [[Isabella L\u00f6vin]] (since 2016), who served as [[Minister for International Development Cooperation (Sweden)|Minister for International Development Cooperation]]. This was the first time in Swedish history that the Green Party had its governmental record tested at an election.\n\nThe '''[[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]]''' (C; ''Centerpartiet'') was the fifth-largest party in the Riksdag with 22 seats. It was a part of the [[Reinfeldt Cabinet]] from 2006 to 2014, and was involved in the Alliance. The Centre Party had been led by [[Annie L\u00f6\u00f6f]] since 2011. It was subject to public attempts by L\u00f6fven to become a cooperation party, but the party traditionally leans towards the Moderate policy positions and stayed within the Alliance after the 2014 election.\n\nThe '''[[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]]''' (V; ''V\u00e4nsterpartiet'') was the sixth-largest party in the Riksdag with 21 seats. Its leader was [[Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt]]. He had said that the party sought to participate in a future [[Red-Greens (Sweden)|Red-Green coalition government]]. The Left Party did not support the L\u00f6fven Cabinet because it was not asked to participate in that cabinet following the 2014 general election, but supported its budget that was voted down on 3 December 2014. Following the budgetary agreement, the Left Party was what tips the left-of-centre minority into a larger minority than the Alliance.\n\nThe '''[[Liberals (Sweden)|Liberals]]''' (L; ''Liberalerna'') was the seventh-largest party in the Riksdag with 19 seats. It was a part of the Reinfeldt Cabinet from 2006 to 2014, and was involved in the Alliance. The Liberals had been led by [[Jan Bj\u00f6rklund]] since 2007; his leadership was being increasingly criticized within the party. Opinion polls in the year after the 2014 election suggested that the party was falling significantly behind and struggling to recapture its previous level of support. Having been in charge of the school system and integration of migrants, it came under a lot of criticism owing to falling school results and increased segregation in immigrant-dominated suburbs.\n\nThe '''[[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]]''' (KD; ''Kristdemokraterna'') had been led by [[Ebba Busch Thor]] since 2015. It was involved in the Alliance. Despite polling below the 4% electoral threshold for most of the time between the elections, the party saw a boost in support in the time period immediately prior to the election, guaranteeing its presence in the Riksdag (which was seen as essential in order for the Alliance to be able to form a government.). The party held on by a few tens of thousands of votes last time.\n\n=== Minor parties ===\nParties with less than 4% of the vote do not get any seats in the Riksdag.\n\n'''[[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)|Feminist Initiative]]''' (FI; ''Feministiskt Initiativ''), led by former Left Party leader [[Gudrun Schyman]], was the country's ninth-largest party, and was represented in the [[European Parliament]] following [[2014 European Parliament election in Sweden|the 2014 European election]]. The party received 0.4% of the vote in the election, compared to 3% in the previous election 2014.\n\nThe '''[[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]]''' (PP; ''Piratpartiet'') [[2009 European Parliament election in Sweden|won representation in the 2009\u201314 European Parliament]], but its subsequent runs for office had been less successful. It has been mentioned in some polls as the tenth-largest party, but appeared to be far from having a chance to break the threshold at a domestic level.\n\nThe '''[[Alternative for Sweden]]''' (''Alternativ f\u00f6r Sverige)'' was a party with no representation in the Riksdag. It was formed from members expelled from the Sweden Democrats in 2015, and was led by [[Gustav Kasselstrand]]. The party received 0.3% of the vote, and thus failed to enter the [[Riksdag]] in this election.\n\n==Electoral system==\nThe Swedish Riksdag is made up of 349 MPs, and all are elected through [[open list]] [[proportional representation]] on multi-member party lists that are either regional (most major parties) or national (Sweden Democrats). Each of the 29 constituencies has a set number of parliamentarians that is divided through constituency results to ensure regional representation. The other MPs are then elected through a proportional balancing, to ensure that the numbers of elected MPs for the various parties accurately represent the votes of the electorate. The Swedish constitution (''Regeringsformen'') 1 Ch. 4 \u00a7 says that the Riksdag is responsible for taxation and making laws, and 1 Ch. 6 \u00a7 says that the government is held responsible to the Riksdag. This means that Sweden has [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]] in a [[constitutional monarchy]]\u2014ensuring that the government is responsible to the people's representatives. A minimum of 4% of the national vote is required for a party to enter the Riksdag, alternatively 12% or more within a constituency.\n\n=== Vote secrecy and party-specific ballots ===\nElection officials are responsible for party-specific ballot papers being present in the voting places for parties that have obtained more than one percent of the votes in the previous parliamentary election.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.val.se/servicelankar/other-languages/english-engelska/putting-out-ballot-papers.html |title=Putting out ballot papers |date=20 April 2018 |publisher=Valmyndigheten |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> If there is no access to the wanted party-specific ballot paper, a voter may cast a vote by writing in the party name of choice on a blank ballot paper.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.val.se/servicelankar/other-languages/english-engelska/ballot-papers.html |title=Ballot papers |date=17 August 2018 |publisher=Valmyndigheten |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> The voter generally chooses a party-specific ballot in the open and only then marks the ballot they chose in the [[voting booth]].<ref name=\"Bolling0\"/>\n\nThe OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights sent an election expert team of two members to the 2018 general election to examine and assess this system, including in relation to questions of the secrecy of the ballot.

It was the major component of the incumbent [[L\u00f6fven I Cabinet|L\u00f6fven Cabinet]], in which it worked with the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]]. Its [[Party leader|leader]] [[Stefan L\u00f6fven]] had been [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] since 3 October 2014, and sought a mandate to continue his L\u00f6fven Cabinet.\n\nThe '''[[Moderate Party]]''' (M; ''Moderaterna'') was the second-largest party in the Riksdag with 84 seats. It was the largest governing party under [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] from 2006 to 2014. The party was involved alongside three other parties in the [[Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance]]; all four sought to return to power together. Reinfeldt resigned as party leader after eight years as Prime Minister, and was succeeded as leader by [[Anna Kinberg Batra]] on 10 January 2015. Kinberg Batra's decision as the ''de facto'' leader to enter the budgetary procedure agreement with the left-of-centre cabinet saw sharp disgruntlement from some party districts. The Alliance had more MPs than the government parties, but still found itself in opposition. Owing to her low [[opinion poll]]ing numbers, Kinberg Batra faced internal pressure from multiple party districts and the [[Moderate Youth League]] to resign. She announced her resignation in a morning press conference on 25 August 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/bp8mv/efter-avgangskraven--akb-haller-presstraff-i-dag|title=Anna Kinberg Batra avg\u00e5r som partiledare f\u00f6r Moderaterna|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=26 August 2017}}</ref> Former prime minister and Moderate Party leader [[Carl Bildt]] was suggested as a replacement after Kinberg Batra resigned; however, despite some party districts supporting his candidacy, he declined the offer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/ejq1O/carl-bildts-besked-om-partiledarfragan-inte-intresserad|title=Carl Bildts besked om partiledarfr\u00e5gan: Inte intresserad|work=Aftonbladet|access-date=2 October 2017}}</ref> Ultimately, Ulf Kristersson was elected to succeed Kinberg Batra as party leader, during an extra Moderate [[party conference]] on 1 October 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/ulf-kristersson-vill-gora-upp-med-s-om-invandringen/|title=Ulf Kristersson vill g\u00f6ra upp med S om invandringen&nbsp;\u2014 DN.SE|date=1 October 2017|work=DN.SE|access-date=2 October 2017|language=sv-se}}</ref>\n\nThe '''[[Sweden Democrats]]''' (SD; ''Sverigedemokraterna'') was the third-largest party in the Riksdag with 49 seats. In the [[2014 Swedish general election|2014 general election]] the party increased its number of seats by 29, becoming the third-largest party. Its leader was [[Jimmie \u00c5kesson]], who was the longest-serving party leader. The other Riksdag parties had repeatedly stated that they would not cooperate with the Sweden Democrats in a future government. An extra general election was called after the Sweden Democrats gave its support to the oppositional Alliance budget (see section '2014 budget crisis'). After the proposed extra election was cancelled, the party advertised itself as the 'only opposition party' and in the following months it saw a sharp rise in support (see section 'Opinion polls').\n\nThe '''[[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]]''' (MP; ''Milj\u00f6partiet'') was the fourth-largest party in the Riksdag with 25 seats. The Green Party was the minor component of the L\u00f6fven Cabinet, alongside the Social Democrats. It was the only Swedish party to have two [[spokesperson]]s, [[Gustav Fridolin]] (since 2011), who served as [[Minister for Education (Sweden)|Minister for Education]], and [[Isabella L\u00f6vin]] (since 2016), who served as [[Minister for International Development Cooperation (Sweden)|Minister for International Development Cooperation]]. This was the first time in Swedish history that the Green Party had its governmental record tested at an election.\n\nThe '''[[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]]''' (C; ''Centerpartiet'') was the fifth-largest party in the Riksdag with 22 seats. It was a part of the [[Reinfeldt Cabinet]] from 2006 to 2014, and was involved in the Alliance. The Centre Party had been led by [[Annie L\u00f6\u00f6f]] since 2011. It was subject to public attempts by L\u00f6fven to become a cooperation party, but the party traditionally leans towards the Moderate policy positions and stayed within the Alliance after the 2014 election.\n\nThe '''[[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]]''' (V; ''V\u00e4nsterpartiet'') was the sixth-largest party in the Riksdag with 21 seats. Its leader was [[Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt]]. He had said that the party sought to participate in a future [[Red-Greens (Sweden)|Red-Green coalition government]]. The Left Party did not support the L\u00f6fven Cabinet because it was not asked to participate in that cabinet following the 2014 general election, but supported its budget that was voted down on 3 December 2014. Following the budgetary agreement, the Left Party was what tips the left-of-centre minority into a larger minority than the Alliance.\n\nThe '''[[Liberals (Sweden)|Liberals]]''' (L; ''Liberalerna'') was the seventh-largest party in the Riksdag with 19 seats. It was a part of the Reinfeldt Cabinet from 2006 to 2014, and was involved in the Alliance. The Liberals had been led by [[Jan Bj\u00f6rklund]] since 2007; his leadership was being increasingly criticized within the party. Opinion polls in the year after the 2014 election suggested that the party was falling significantly behind and struggling to recapture its previous level of support. Having been in charge of the school system and integration of migrants, it came under a lot of criticism owing to falling school results and increased segregation in immigrant-dominated suburbs.\n\nThe '''[[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]]''' (KD; ''Kristdemokraterna'') had been led by [[Ebba Busch Thor]] since 2015. It was involved in the Alliance. Despite polling below the 4% electoral threshold for most of the time between the elections, the party saw a boost in support in the time period immediately prior to the election, guaranteeing its presence in the Riksdag (which was seen as essential in order for the Alliance to be able to form a government.). The party held on by a few tens of thousands of votes last time.\n\n=== Minor parties ===\nParties with less than 4% of the vote do not get any seats in the Riksdag.\n\n'''[[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)|Feminist Initiative]]''' (FI; ''Feministiskt Initiativ''), led by former Left Party leader [[Gudrun Schyman]], was the country's ninth-largest party, and was represented in the [[European Parliament]] following [[2014 European Parliament election in Sweden|the 2014 European election]]. The party received 0.4% of the vote in the election, compared to 3% in the previous election 2014.\n\nThe '''[[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]]''' (PP; ''Piratpartiet'') [[2009 European Parliament election in Sweden|won representation in the 2009\u201314 European Parliament]], but its subsequent runs for office had been less successful. It has been mentioned in some polls as the tenth-largest party, but appeared to be far from having a chance to break the threshold at a domestic level.\n\nThe '''[[Alternative for Sweden]]''' (''Alternativ f\u00f6r Sverige)'' was a party with no representation in the Riksdag. It was formed from members expelled from the Sweden Democrats in 2015, and was led by [[Gustav Kasselstrand]]. The party received 0.3% of the vote, and thus failed to enter the [[Riksdag]] in this election.\n\n==Electoral system==\nThe Swedish Riksdag is made up of 349 MPs, and all are elected through [[open list]] [[proportional representation]] on multi-member party lists that are either regional (most major parties) or national (Sweden Democrats). Each of the 29 constituencies has a set number of parliamentarians that is divided through constituency results to ensure regional representation. The other MPs are then elected through a proportional balancing, to ensure that the numbers of elected MPs for the various parties accurately represent the votes of the electorate. The Swedish constitution (''Regeringsformen'') 1 Ch. 4 \u00a7 says that the Riksdag is responsible for taxation and making laws, and 1 Ch. 6 \u00a7 says that the government is held responsible to the Riksdag. This means that Sweden has [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarism]] in a [[constitutional monarchy]]\u2014ensuring that the government is responsible to the people's representatives.

Robert C. Allen of [[New York University]] evaluated and substantiated Engels' account in his 2008 paper, \"Explorations in Economic History\", coining the term \"Engels' pause\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the years following Engels' pause and the publication of ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', British wages began to rise with economic output. Between 1840 and 1900, output per worker increased by 90 percent and real wage growth increased by 123&nbsp;percent.<ref name=\":0\" /> This pattern, in which labour productivity and wages increase at about the same rate, developed in Britain around the time that Engels wrote his book.\n\n== Causes ==\n\nSeveral explanations of Engels' pause exist, due to the dynamic nature of the British economy during the Industrial Revolution. During the revolution, classical economists provided theories explaining the wage stagnation. English scholar [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] proposed that technical progress would increase demand for labour, but this would be offset by an increase in population. German economist [[Karl Marx]] believed that technical progress, enhanced by a large amount of labour, would reduce demand for labour and prevent steady wage growth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Lewisgraph.jpg|thumb|alt=Graph measuring wages and labour|Model of wage growth during the period, according to the Lewis economic model]]\nThe first explanation of Engels' pause takes a macroeconomic approach, adopting the development model created by economist [[W. Arthur Lewis]].<ref name=\":6\" /> The model shows a two-phase development process in an economic period, and divides the British economy into two sectors. In the agricultural sector, population exceeded capital output and the marginal product of labour was zero; the distribution of income from output amongst the population sustained livelihoods. Phase one shows the origins of Engels' pause, as surplus labour from the agricultural sector is absorbed into the modern sector to meet rapidly-increasing demand. The initially-more-prosperous segment is the technological sector, which encapsulates mass-manufacturing processes, new technology, and the rapidly-expanding urban population arising from the Industrial Revolution. The savings rate rose, as [[Capitalism|capitalists]] withheld part of their income and circulated the equity as investments to improve processes and develop technology. Capital accumulation ensured that the modern sector was continuously growing, and labour for the increasing capacity was infinitely available from the agricultural sector as the population moved from rural areas to the city (explaining the period's large-scale urbanisation. In this economic theory, the increase in the supply of labour meant a larger population among whom to divide wages. This kept wages stagnant as profits increased, leading to a snowball effect of capital accrual. The trend ends when the expanding sector absorbs the labour surplus; as it continues to grow, wages increase and Engels' pause ends.<ref name=\":6\">Lewis, W. (1954). ''Economic development with unlimited supplies of labour.'' Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies. Retrieved from http://faculty.smu.edu/tosang/pdf/Lewis_1954.pdf</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second approach looks at specific industries, including laws and occurrences in them which would have affected British wage growth. At the beginning of the 19th century, the [[Napoleonic Wars]] raised the prices of wheat and other agricultural products and hampered the growth of real wages. The [[Corn Laws]], a series of tariffs on the import and export of grain which were designed to keep prices high, also ensured that wages remained stagnant. As the American grain invasion occurred in 1870 and the British and North American grain markets were integrated, the previous effects were mitigated and wages began to rise.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2018'').

''The Long American Grain Invasion of Britain: Market Integration and the Wheat Trade Between North America and Britain from the Eighteenth Century''. Univ. of Copenhagen Dept. of Economics Discussion Paper No. 08-20.</ref>\n\nA third explanation, put forward by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]], is that the early inventions of the Industrial Revolution were predominantly labor-replacing:  \"If technology replaces labor in existing tasks, wages and the share of national income accruing to labor may fall. If, in contrast, technological change is augmenting labor, it will make workers more productive in existing tasks or create entirely new labor-intensive activities, thereby increasing the demand for labor. The divergence between output and wages, in other words, is consistent with this being a period where technology was primarily replacing. Artisan workers in the domestic system were replaced by machines, often tended by children\u2014who had very little bargaining power and often worked without wages. The growing capital share of income meant that the gains from technological progress were very unequally distributed: corporate profits were captured by industrialists, who reinvested them in factories and machines.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Technology Trap: Capital, Labor and Power in the Age of Automation|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThis pattern, Frey argues, becomes murkier over the course of the nineteenth century: \"by the 1850s, the participation of children in the workforce had fallen dramatically. Quite possibly, the Factory Acts of the 1830s, which regulated working hours and improved the conditions of children in the factories, increased the cost of child labor and thus spurred the adoption of steam power, though causality might equally have run in the other direction. Regardless, the more widespread adoption of steam power from the 1830s onward, and the subsequent arrival of machines of greater size, meant that more-skilled operatives were required: the complementarity between factory equipment and the human capital necessary to operate it grew stronger as machines became more complex. Contemporaries like Peter Gaskell had already observed this tendency in the 1830s: Gaskell asserted that \u201csince steam-weaving became so general as to supersede the hand-loom, the number of adults engaged in the mills have been progressively advancing; inasmuch that very young children are no longer competent to take charge of a steam-loom.\u201d\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Technology Trap: Capital, Labor and Power in the Age of Automation|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\n\n=== Economic effects ===\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, British industries were generally small-scale. Textile production relied on thousands of individual manufacturers, including spinners, weavers and dyers, who worked in their homes. Changes in steam technology revolutionised transport and manufacturing processes in Britain, allowing large-scale manufacturing and transportation and increasing industrial output. The construction of large factories allowed mass employment in one building, increasing labour efficiency and output.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/georgian-britain/articles/the-industrial-revolution|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=White|first=Matthew|date=2009|website=British Library|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416103651/https://www.bl.uk/georgian-britain/articles/the-industrial-revolution|archive-date=2019-04-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEngels' pause allowed for the accrual of profits from output by capitalists and industrialists; these profits were returned to their industries to continue the expansion and development of new manufacturing processes and technology. Britain's gross domestic product increased steadily, with profits on business capital estimated at 12-16 percent during the 1850s. The share of income allotted to labour dropped from 50 percent in 1801 to 45 percent in 1845, with the rate of return to capital rising over 20 percent from the late 18th to the mid-19th century.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Social effects ===\n[[Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution|Working and living conditions]] during Engels' pause were poor, since the rate of urbanisation exceeded the rate of growth in labour demand. New processes and technologies in agriculture rendered traditional processes obsolete, and a surplus of cheap agricultural labour led to unemployment and increasing poverty in many rural areas (encouraging urbanisation). The increase in capital as a result of the Industrial Revolution led to increased demand for labour as a growing number of people moved to urban centres in search of employment. The large increase in urban population led to high unemployment; over 1.5 million people were unemployed in Great Britain during the early Industrial Revolution. Capitalists and industrialists accumulated and maintained wealth, and the working classes lived in overcrowded environments. The new urban population consisted of displaced agricultural workers, most of whom were unskilled; much of Parliament's attention was directed towards regulating and capitalising on technological developments and capital gain, and harsh treatment, long working hours and low wages were standard. Skilled labourers, such as weavers, found themselves redundant as new machinery usurped their roles. Women spent less time working in the family home, and took jobs in the domestic-service and textile industries. [[Child labour|Children]] worked in factories to meet the demand for labour and contribute to family income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/paper_money/paper_money_of_england__wales/the_industrial_revolution.aspx|title=The Industrial Revolution and the changing face of Britain|last=Manolopoulou|first=Artemis|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106200048/https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/paper_money/paper_money_of_england__wales/the_industrial_revolution.aspx|archive-date=2018-11-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLiving conditions for a large part of the working class were poor due to rapid urbanisation. Overcrowding led to poor sanitation; low wages resulted in poor diets for those who could not afford fresh food, and diseases such as cholera, tuberculosis and typhoid became common.<ref name=\":2\">Walsh, B. (2001.) ''GCSE Modern World History.'' London, United Kingdom: Hodder Education.   </ref>\n\n== Controversy == \nTwentieth- and 21st-century economic historians studying the Industrial Revolution differ about whether wages remained stagnant or grew with gains from capital, questioning the existence of Engels' pause; comprehensive economic data from the period is difficult to find.  According to [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] of the University of California, real wage growth in early-19th-century England was underestimated and GDP growth was overestimated; an inaccurate view of wage growth compared to GDP growth was presented, and wages grew more than per-capita output.<ref>Clark, Gregory. 2007. \"What made Britannia great?

The changes caused by industrialisation required the principles of society to be redesigned. Engels' pause was accompanied by major changes in the social-security and party systems, elementary schools, urban planning, public transport and many other areas of society. It has been argued that a similar transformation is underway in industrialised Western nations, where [[Digitization|digitisation]] and robotisation are transforming society. In the [[Western world]], particularly the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], the 2010s may be seen as the beginning of a similar \"pause\" in which the position of workers and the capacity of current systems to maintain the development of society are (at least temporarily) weakened.<ref name=\"Hautam\u00e4ki 2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://media.sitra.fi/2017/01/08121209/From_pause_to_play_Sitra_Demos.pdf|title=From pause to play.

According to the [[Demos Helsinki]] [[think tank]], society and the economy is changing as it did during the Industrial Revolution. During [[industrialisation]], productivity began to increase as society and business were designed in accordance with the new modes of operation; this eventually led to an unprecedented period of prosperity. Two [[Social class|social classes]] were born: the [[working class]] (whose living conditions were that which a large part of 20th-century politics revolved around improving) and the [[middle class]], whose expansion was an important result of increased in prosperity triggered by industrialisation and political reform. The birth of political parties and urban planning can be dated to the beginning of industrialisation. Digitisation and robotisation may have begun a decades-long period of transformation comparable to the Industrial Revolution during which the basic structures of society and forms of livelihood may change and wealth may be radically redistributed.<ref name=\"Hautam\u00e4ki 2017\"/>\n\n[[Bank of England]] governor Mark Carney spoke at the April 2018 [[Public Policy Forum]] testimonial dinner in Toronto about his concern that rapidly-increasing technology in blue- and white-collar jobs would result in poor wage growth, worker redundancy and excessive capital accrual for owners of the machines.<ref>Carney, M (2018.) \"The future of work\".

Capitalists and financiers of new, large-scale manufacturing businesses accumulated the gains from economic development, using them to expand their industries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBritish academic economists [[Charles Knickerbocker Harley|Charles Harley]] and [[Nicholas Crafts]] analysed the growth rates of industries and economic sectors in Britain during the Industrial Revolution in 1980, estimating per-capita growth at 46 percent between 1780 and 1840.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.2307/2597415 | jstor=2597415| title=Output Growth and the British Industrial Revolution: A Restatement of the Crafts-Harley View| journal=The Economic History Review| volume=45| issue=4| pages=703| year=1992| last1=Crafts| first1=N.

Robert C. Allen of [[New York University]] evaluated and substantiated Engels' account in his 2008 paper, \"Explorations in Economic History\", coining the term \"Engels' pause\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the years following Engels' pause and the publication of ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'', British wages began to rise with economic output. Between 1840 and 1900, output per worker increased by 90 percent and real wage growth increased by 123&nbsp;percent.<ref name=\":0\" /> This pattern, in which labour productivity and wages increase at about the same rate, developed in Britain around the time that Engels wrote his book.\n\n== Causes ==\n\nSeveral explanations of Engels' pause exist, due to the dynamic nature of the British economy during the Industrial Revolution. During the revolution, classical economists provided theories explaining the wage stagnation. English scholar [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] proposed that technical progress would increase demand for labour, but this would be offset by an increase in population. German economist [[Karl Marx]] believed that technical progress, enhanced by a large amount of labour, would reduce demand for labour and prevent steady wage growth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Lewisgraph.jpg|thumb|alt=Graph measuring wages and labour|Model of wage growth during the period, according to the Lewis economic model]]\nThe first explanation of Engels' pause takes a macroeconomic approach, adopting the development model created by economist [[W. Arthur Lewis]].<ref name=\":6\" /> The model shows a two-phase development process in an economic period, and divides the British economy into two sectors. In the agricultural sector, population exceeded capital output and the marginal product of labour was zero; the distribution of income from output amongst the population sustained livelihoods. Phase one shows the origins of Engels' pause, as surplus labour from the agricultural sector is absorbed into the modern sector to meet rapidly-increasing demand. The initially-more-prosperous segment is the technological sector, which encapsulates mass-manufacturing processes, new technology, and the rapidly-expanding urban population arising from the Industrial Revolution. The savings rate rose, as [[Capitalism|capitalists]] withheld part of their income and circulated the equity as investments to improve processes and develop technology. Capital accumulation ensured that the modern sector was continuously growing, and labour for the increasing capacity was infinitely available from the agricultural sector as the population moved from rural areas to the city (explaining the period's large-scale urbanisation. In this economic theory, the increase in the supply of labour meant a larger population among whom to divide wages. This kept wages stagnant as profits increased, leading to a snowball effect of capital accrual. The trend ends when the expanding sector absorbs the labour surplus; as it continues to grow, wages increase and Engels' pause ends.<ref name=\":6\">Lewis, W. (1954). ''Economic development with unlimited supplies of labour.'' Manchester School of Economic and Social Studies. Retrieved from http://faculty.smu.edu/tosang/pdf/Lewis_1954.pdf</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second approach looks at specific industries, including laws and occurrences in them which would have affected British wage growth. At the beginning of the 19th century, the [[Napoleonic Wars]] raised the prices of wheat and other agricultural products and hampered the growth of real wages. The [[Corn Laws]], a series of tariffs on the import and export of grain which were designed to keep prices high, also ensured that wages remained stagnant. As the American grain invasion occurred in 1870 and the British and North American grain markets were integrated, the previous effects were mitigated and wages began to rise.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2018'').

''The Long American Grain Invasion of Britain: Market Integration and the Wheat Trade Between North America and Britain from the Eighteenth Century''. Univ. of Copenhagen Dept. of Economics Discussion Paper No. 08-20.</ref>\n\nA third explanation, put forward by [[Carl Benedikt Frey]], is that the early inventions of the Industrial Revolution were predominantly labor-replacing:  \"If technology replaces labor in existing tasks, wages and the share of national income accruing to labor may fall. If, in contrast, technological change is augmenting labor, it will make workers more productive in existing tasks or create entirely new labor-intensive activities, thereby increasing the demand for labor. The divergence between output and wages, in other words, is consistent with this being a period where technology was primarily replacing. Artisan workers in the domestic system were replaced by machines, often tended by children\u2014who had very little bargaining power and often worked without wages. The growing capital share of income meant that the gains from technological progress were very unequally distributed: corporate profits were captured by industrialists, who reinvested them in factories and machines.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Technology Trap: Capital, Labor and Power in the Age of Automation|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThis pattern, Frey argues, becomes murkier over the course of the nineteenth century: \"by the 1850s, the participation of children in the workforce had fallen dramatically. Quite possibly, the Factory Acts of the 1830s, which regulated working hours and improved the conditions of children in the factories, increased the cost of child labor and thus spurred the adoption of steam power, though causality might equally have run in the other direction. Regardless, the more widespread adoption of steam power from the 1830s onward, and the subsequent arrival of machines of greater size, meant that more-skilled operatives were required: the complementarity between factory equipment and the human capital necessary to operate it grew stronger as machines became more complex. Contemporaries like Peter Gaskell had already observed this tendency in the 1830s: Gaskell asserted that \u201csince steam-weaving became so general as to supersede the hand-loom, the number of adults engaged in the mills have been progressively advancing; inasmuch that very young children are no longer competent to take charge of a steam-loom.\u201d\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Technology Trap: Capital, Labor and Power in the Age of Automation|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2019|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Effects ==\n\n=== Economic effects ===\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, British industries were generally small-scale. Textile production relied on thousands of individual manufacturers, including spinners, weavers and dyers, who worked in their homes. Changes in steam technology revolutionised transport and manufacturing processes in Britain, allowing large-scale manufacturing and transportation and increasing industrial output. The construction of large factories allowed mass employment in one building, increasing labour efficiency and output.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/georgian-britain/articles/the-industrial-revolution|title=The Industrial Revolution|last=White|first=Matthew|date=2009|website=British Library|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416103651/https://www.bl.uk/georgian-britain/articles/the-industrial-revolution|archive-date=2019-04-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEngels' pause allowed for the accrual of profits from output by capitalists and industrialists; these profits were returned to their industries to continue the expansion and development of new manufacturing processes and technology. Britain's gross domestic product increased steadily, with profits on business capital estimated at 12-16 percent during the 1850s. The share of income allotted to labour dropped from 50 percent in 1801 to 45 percent in 1845, with the rate of return to capital rising over 20 percent from the late 18th to the mid-19th century.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Social effects ===\n[[Life in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution|Working and living conditions]] during Engels' pause were poor, since the rate of urbanisation exceeded the rate of growth in labour demand. New processes and technologies in agriculture rendered traditional processes obsolete, and a surplus of cheap agricultural labour led to unemployment and increasing poverty in many rural areas (encouraging urbanisation). The increase in capital as a result of the Industrial Revolution led to increased demand for labour as a growing number of people moved to urban centres in search of employment. The large increase in urban population led to high unemployment; over 1.5 million people were unemployed in Great Britain during the early Industrial Revolution. Capitalists and industrialists accumulated and maintained wealth, and the working classes lived in overcrowded environments. The new urban population consisted of displaced agricultural workers, most of whom were unskilled; much of Parliament's attention was directed towards regulating and capitalising on technological developments and capital gain, and harsh treatment, long working hours and low wages were standard. Skilled labourers, such as weavers, found themselves redundant as new machinery usurped their roles. Women spent less time working in the family home, and took jobs in the domestic-service and textile industries. [[Child labour|Children]] worked in factories to meet the demand for labour and contribute to family income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/paper_money/paper_money_of_england__wales/the_industrial_revolution.aspx|title=The Industrial Revolution and the changing face of Britain|last=Manolopoulou|first=Artemis|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106200048/https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/online_research_catalogues/paper_money/paper_money_of_england__wales/the_industrial_revolution.aspx|archive-date=2018-11-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLiving conditions for a large part of the working class were poor due to rapid urbanisation. Overcrowding led to poor sanitation; low wages resulted in poor diets for those who could not afford fresh food, and diseases such as cholera, tuberculosis and typhoid became common.<ref name=\":2\">Walsh, B. (2001.) ''GCSE Modern World History.'' London, United Kingdom: Hodder Education.   </ref>\n\n== Controversy == \nTwentieth- and 21st-century economic historians studying the Industrial Revolution differ about whether wages remained stagnant or grew with gains from capital, questioning the existence of Engels' pause; comprehensive economic data from the period is difficult to find.  According to [[Gregory Clark (economist)|Gregory Clark]] of the University of California, real wage growth in early-19th-century England was underestimated and GDP growth was overestimated; an inaccurate view of wage growth compared to GDP growth was presented, and wages grew more than per-capita output.<ref>Clark, Gregory. 2007. \"What made Britannia great?

The changes caused by industrialisation required the principles of society to be redesigned. Engels' pause was accompanied by major changes in the social-security and party systems, elementary schools, urban planning, public transport and many other areas of society. It has been argued that a similar transformation is underway in industrialised Western nations, where [[Digitization|digitisation]] and robotisation are transforming society. In the [[Western world]], particularly the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], the 2010s may be seen as the beginning of a similar \"pause\" in which the position of workers and the capacity of current systems to maintain the development of society are (at least temporarily) weakened.<ref name=\"Hautam\u00e4ki 2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://media.sitra.fi/2017/01/08121209/From_pause_to_play_Sitra_Demos.pdf|title=From pause to play.

According to the [[Demos Helsinki]] [[think tank]], society and the economy is changing as it did during the Industrial Revolution. During [[industrialisation]], productivity began to increase as society and business were designed in accordance with the new modes of operation; this eventually led to an unprecedented period of prosperity. Two [[Social class|social classes]] were born: the [[working class]] (whose living conditions were that which a large part of 20th-century politics revolved around improving) and the [[middle class]], whose expansion was an important result of increased in prosperity triggered by industrialisation and political reform. The birth of political parties and urban planning can be dated to the beginning of industrialisation. Digitisation and robotisation may have begun a decades-long period of transformation comparable to the Industrial Revolution during which the basic structures of society and forms of livelihood may change and wealth may be radically redistributed.<ref name=\"Hautam\u00e4ki 2017\"/>\n\n[[Bank of England]] governor Mark Carney spoke at the April 2018 [[Public Policy Forum]] testimonial dinner in Toronto about his concern that rapidly-increasing technology in blue- and white-collar jobs would result in poor wage growth, worker redundancy and excessive capital accrual for owners of the machines.<ref>Carney, M (2018.) \"The future of work\".
