McLouth\n| products      = Low carbon and stainless strip steel\n}}\n'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n===First Continuous Caster===\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n====Pilot Plant====\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n====Casting Plant Description====\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>\n\n== Closing ==\nMcLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.\n\nMcLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. \n\nMcLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. \n\nIn the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Steel companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company\n| name          = McLouth Steel Corporation\n| logo          = [[image:McLouth Steel Logo.svg|200px]]\n| fate          = Bankruptcy\n| successor     = Detroit Steel Company\n| foundation    = 1934\n| defunct       = 1996\n| location      = [[Detroit, MI]] 1934-1981, [[Trenton, MI]] 1982-1996\n| industry      = [[Steel]]\n| key_people    = Donald B.

The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from a Chicago mill (at bargain prices)<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Uwt8DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=mclouth+steel+%22plancor%22&source=bl&ots=8U9XHXXFkK&sig=ACfU3U2jfL9kpBg4AkCkrG028cSsxhl98g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEts-gjOboAhXRHc0KHUN6DKgQ6AEwAXoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=mclouth%20steel%20%22plancor%22&f=false</ref>, the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n===First Continuous Caster===\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n====Pilot Plant====\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n====Casting Plant Description====\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>\n\n== Closing ==\nMcLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.\n\nMcLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. \n\nMcLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. \n\nIn the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Steel companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Ty5150", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLouth_Steel"}

He participated in both [[Chindit]] operations and was instrumental in popularizing the unorthodox ideas of [[Orde Wingate|General Orde Wingate]]. He frequently led attacks from the front, a practice that earned him the nickname amongst the men under his command of \"Mad Mike.\"\n\n==Early life==\nCalvert was born at [[Rohtak]] in [[British India|India]], son of a member of the [[Indian Civil Service]]. He was educated at [[Bradfield College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], from which was commissioned as a [[subaltern]] into the British Army's [[Royal Engineers]] as a professional soldier.<ref>Obituary for Calvert. 'The Independent', 2 December 1998.</ref>\n\n==Military career==\nCalvert was commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1933, and for a time was the Army's [[middleweight]] boxing champion. He spent a year reading for the Mechanical Engineering [[Tripos]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref>Obituary for Calvert, 'The Independent', 2 December 1998. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-brigadier-michael-calvert-1188603.html</ref> In 1934 he returned to active service and was posted to the [[Hong Kong]] Royal Engineers, where he learned to speak [[Cantonese]]. He also witnessed the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese Army's]] attack on [[Shanghai]] and the [[Rape of Nanking]], which made him one of the few officers in the British Army pre-World War 2 who fully appreciated the nature of the threat posed by Japanese imperialism.\n\nWhen the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939 Calvert briefly commanded a detachment of Royal Engineers in the [[Norwegian Campaign]], then trained [[commando]] detachments in [[demolition]] techniques in Hong Kong and Australia. In Australia, along with [[F. Spencer Chapman]], he assisted with training Australian commandos who formed the first [[Australian Army Independent Companies]] at [[Wilsons Promontory]], Victoria in 1941. He was then appointed to command the '''Bush Warfare School''' in [[Burma]], training officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s to lead guerilla bands in China for operations against the Japanese.\n\nThe Japanese invaded Burma in early 1942. Calvert and others from the school raided [[Henzada]] by riverboat after the fall of [[Rangoon]] as a deception operation to convince the Japanese that Australian reinforcements had reached Burma. Calvert then spent a period of time touring Burma with [[Orde Wingate]]. After the Bush Warfare School closed, Calvert was sent with 22 men from the school and a few hundred men separated from their units to guard the Gokteik Viaduct thirty miles east of [[Maymyo]]. (The Allied Commander in Chief, General [[Archibald Wavell]] apparently hoped that Calvert would use his initiative and demolish it, in spite of orders from the civil government to keep it intact. For once, Calvert obeyed orders.)<ref>Allen (1984), p.136</ref>\n\nAfter retreating from the viaduct, Calvert participated in a deception operation involving the loss of a set of false papers to the Japanese. Calvert's unit finally retreated to India at the very rear of the army, often behind the Japanese lines.\n\n===Operation Longcloth===\nIn India, he reunited with the equally unorthodox Wingate, and the two became firm friends. Calvert led one of the company-sized columns in [[Operation Longcloth]], Wingate's first [[Chindit]] operation in 1943. This was a long-range penetration operation behind enemy lines, which put great demands on the endurance of all who took part. Calvert was awarded the DSO for his achievements on the operation. His column achieved the greatest amount of demolition of the Japanese lines of communication, and reached India intact with the fewest casualties of those in the force.<ref>Allen (1984), pp.128-143</ref>\n\n===Operation Thursday===\n====The Fly-In====\nCalvert commanded the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade]] in [[Operation Thursday]], the much larger second Chindit operation. His brigade spearheaded the airborne landings deep in the Japanese rear. The operation was staged from Lalaghat, with D-Day fixed for 5 March. That morning, one of General [[Philip Cochran]]'s [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchells]] flew over and photographed the landing zones. Wingate had ordered that no aircraft should fly over the landing zones, lest the operation be betrayed, but Cochran was not directly under Wingate's command and felt that launching the operation without accurate intelligence was a dangerous gamble.<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 104\u20135</ref> The photographs clearly showed that one of landing sites selected, codenamed Piccadilly, was unusable.\n\n<blockquote>It was at this dramatic moment, with everyone keyed up and ready to go, that the aerial photographs arrived. They showed that primary landing site Broadway was clear, but Piccadilly had been blocked by tree trunks; no gliders would land there that night. The general opinion was that the Japs had realized the possibilities of Piccadilly as a landing area and had deliberately blocked it, though some time later we discovered that the explanation was much simpler: Burmese woodmen had laid out their trees to dry in the clearing.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 140</ref></blockquote>\n\nWingate was enraged by Cochran's actions but admitted that the danger was real. He and Calvert weighed the options. The danger of executing a potentially compromised operation were substantial, but any delay threatened to push back the window of opportunity by at least a month. Of the three planned sites only two were available; Calvert suggested the plan be further altered and the entire brigade flown into Broadway. He said, \"I am prepared to take the whole of my brigade into Broadway and do without [second landing site] Piccadilly.\"<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 106</ref> Calvert later wrote, \"We had taken into account that [third landing site] Chowringhee was to the east of the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] while Broadway was west of the river. I told Wingate, 'I don't want to split my brigade either side of the Irrawaddy. I am prepared to take all the brigade into Broadway alone and take the consequence of a slower build-up.'\"<ref>Calvert, 1964: 141</ref> Lieutenant General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]] \"asked Calvert\u2026and found him strongly against [using] Chowringhee.\"<ref>Slim, 1957: 259</ref> Further discussion with Slim and Wingate clinched the matter: \"it was to be Broadway alone. I was nervous as bales, I imagine we all were, but we all knew we had to go\u2026In any case Broadway was clear and I could really see no reason why we should not go in there just because Piccadilly was blocked.\"<ref>Calvert, 1964: 141</ref>\n\nEach American [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] towed two heavily laden [[Waco CG-4]] gliders. Although a double tow posed no problems for a competent pilot in good weather, many of the pilots were inexperienced and the route across the mountain ranges bordering the [[Chindwin river]] guaranteed a turbulent, unsettled flight. The first gliders were scheduled to arrive at Broadway by 9:30pm, but by 2:00am Wingate and the others waiting at Lalaghat had not yet heard from Calvert. Poor reconnaissance, not enemy resistance, caused the delay, as aerial reconnaissance had failed to show a number of ditches scarring the field at Broadway. Calvert wrote:\n\n<blockquote>All six of the advance party gliders had landed and the plan had been that we would wheel them off to make way for the next batch, which would in turn be wheeled away and so on. But we had reckoned without the ditches. Three of the six gliders were so badly wrecked that the small force at present on the ground could not shift them. We worked at them furiously but suddenly I heard a shout and looked up. In the bright light of the moon I saw to my horror that the first two of the next batch had cast off [their tows] and were winging their silent way down.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 143</ref></blockquote>\n\nCalvert transmitted the prearranged signal \"Soya Link\", the most despised of ration items, to stop all flying, but at 6:30am on 6 March he radioed the code words \"Pork Sausage\" to resume flights into Broadway. A strip for C-47s was in place that evening, and supplies came rushing in. Calvert lost no time in organizing reconnaissance missions and fortifying Broadway. By 13 March the build-up was complete. In seven nights about 9,000 men, 1,350 animals, 250 tons of supplies and weapons had landed behind enemy lines in Burma.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 148</ref>\n\n====Broadway====\nOn 17 March he led a [[bayonet]] charge against Japanese positions shielded by a sunken road and a steep hill crowned with a pagoda. Calvert noticed that friendly forces nearby were drawing heavier fire. In fact, elements of the South Staffordshire Regiment had dug in adjacent to a Japanese unit. Neither force was aware of the other.<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 199</ref> Deciding that something had to be done, he elected to make a frontal assault:\n\n<blockquote>I saw something had to be done pretty quickly, so I shouted to Freddie that we were going to charge. I then told everyone that we were going to charge the Pagoda Hill. There were reinforcements on our left flank who would charge as well. So, standing up, I shouted out 'Charge' in the approved Victorian manner, and ran down the hill\u2026Half of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffords]] joined in. Then looking back I found a lot had not. So I told them to bloody well 'Charge, what the hell do you think you're doing.' So they charged. Machine-gunners, mortar teams, all officers \u2013 everybody who was on that hill<ref>Calvert, 1952:50</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe fighting quickly degenerated into a free-for-all. Calvert characterized the action as an \"extraordinary m\u00eal\u00e9e\u2026everyone shooting, bayoneting, kicking at everyone else, rather like an officers' guest night.\"<ref>Calvert, 1952: 50</ref> [[George Albert Cairns|Lieutenant George Cairns]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for killing several Japanese after one severed his left arm with a sword. A pause in the fighting turned into a stalemate, complete with shouting \u2013 according to Calvert \"[t]he Japs were yelling at us in English, 'You dirty hairy bastards,' etc.; only a final charge made by Calvert and some [[Gurkha]]s dislodged the Japanese. Many of these were shot as they retreated.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 51</ref> Afterward, \"the hill was a horrid sight, littered with Jap dead, and already the ones who had been killed there earlier in the day were black with flies. Stretcher-bearers were removing our wounded and our mercifully very few dead.\"<ref>Norman Durant quoted in Bidwell, 1979: 122</ref>\n\nShortly after this action a lieutenant in the South Staffordshire Regiment, Norman Durant, wrote a compelling description of Calvert in a letter to his parents:\n\n<blockquote>His hair flops over his forehead, and he has a disconcerting habit of staring at you when you speak to him and yet not appearing to hear a word. His lectures were always painfully slow and hesitant and during training he gave the impression of taking a long time to make up his mind; in action things were very different. He knows all the officers in the brigade and many of the senior NCOs, and his manner and attitude are always the same if he is talking to a CO, a subaltern or a private\u2026<ref>Norman Durant quoted in Bidwell, 1979: 118\u201319</ref></blockquote>\n\nCalvert's dedication to the troops under his command was one of his most visible attributes. According to David Rooney he was \"one of the most successful of the Chindit leaders [and] showed his greatness as a commander by reminding his men that, however bad things were for them, things were probably much worse for the enemy.\"<ref>Rooney, 1995: 98</ref>\n\n====White City====\nThe brigade then captured and held a position near Mawlu. Calvert \"saw that Mawlu [the location of the block] was the crucial point for road and rail traffic and determined to build up a defensive box there.\"<ref>Rooney, 1995: 126</ref> Because of the supply drop parachutes adorning the surrounding jungle, it became known as the White City. This fortified position blocked Japanese road and rail communications to their northern front for over two months. A large rectangle, 1,000 by 800 yards, White City was quickly identified by the Japanese as a threat. Probing attacks on 18, 19, and 20 March inflicted a handful of casualties, but were beaten back without significant loss. The Japanese mounted a serious attack on the night of 21 March that resulted in \"[v]ery confused close-quarter fighting\" that lasted all night. Two Japanese light machine guns were established in the block; a dawn attack led by flamethrower-equipped infantry displaced the Japanese, driving them outside the perimeter. Calvert was instrumental in orchestrating the counterattacks and was frequently under fire.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 52\u201357</ref>\n\nAfter repulsing numerous nighttime attacks, Calvert had two relatively quiet weeks to fortify White City. Under his direction a thick hedge of barbed wire was put in place and surrounded with mines and booby traps. Firing positions were dug in and camouflaged; reinforced with logs and earth, these positions were invisible and all-but impenetrable. Calvert also established a defensive fire plan to coordinate machine gun and mortar fire. Some [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|2-pounder anti-tank guns]] arrived on 29 March and were quickly put in place. These were followed by engineers who built a landing strip capable of handling [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] cargo aircraft, which delivered more artillery. White City was eventually defended by four anti-tank guns, six [[Bofors 40 mm]] [[autocannon]]s and four [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounders]].<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 125</ref> Calvert had a not insubstantial arsenal at his disposal.\n\nOn 6 April the White City again came under attack. The Japanese shelled and bombed the block throughout the afternoon. Calvert recalled that the terrain combined with meticulous attention to detail in constructing the positions provided shelter, and that casualties were low.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 109\u201310</ref> The only effective weapon the Japanese possessed was a 6-inch [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], an old coastal defence piece they had laboriously dragged through the jungle to bombard the block. The mortar fired a bomb four and a half feet long that was in flight for more than 30 seconds.<ref>Allen, 1998: 353</ref> Calvert described the mortar as \"the bane of our existence.\"<ref>Calvert, 1952: 109</ref> Calvert spent the attack in a dugout, coordinating his troops' response via telephone. He reported that stiff resistance led by his friend Ian MacPherson prevented the Japanese from breaching the block.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 110\u201311</ref>\n\nFrom 6 April through 11 April, Calvert wrote, \"[t]he sequence of attack was the same practically every night and only varied in intensity.\" Japanese infantry attacked after dark, invariably running into stiff resistance from emplaced machine guns, mines, barbed wire, booby traps, artillery, and sustained rifle fire.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 112</ref> The Japanese brought forward two light tanks; these were quickly destroyed with 2-pounder anti-tank guns. Confident in the block's ability to withstand any attack, Calvert's only concern was his rapidly dwindling supply of ammunition. Machine gun ammunition was being used at a frantic pace. In all, some 700,000 rounds of [[Vickers machine gun]] ammunition were dropped into White City. Calvert requested that supply drops contain less food and more ammunition.<ref>Allen, 1998: 353</ref>\n\nCalvert led several counter-attacks against encircling Japanese forces in person. On 13 April he commanded a much larger attack involving most of the brigade. Despite the intervention of American [[P-51 Mustang]]s, the attack was a failure; Calvert was forced to order a retreat. He learned that Major Ian MacPherson, commander of the headquarters company of the 77th Brigade had been killed, his body left in the Japanese positions. Calvert said he \"could not leave anyone like that without knowing for certain\" before starting back to look for MacPherson.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 133</ref> Only when the brigade major \"heaved out his revolver, stuck it in my stomach and said, 'I'll shoot you if you don't go back. I was with him when he was killed'\" did Calvert resume the retreat.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 134</ref>\n\n====Mogaung====\n{{Further|Battle of Mogaung}}\n[[File:The Chindits MH7287.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert (left) giving orders during the capture of Mogaung in June 1944.]]\nIn May, the Chindit brigades moved north. The [[monsoon]] had broken and floods impeded the Chindits' operations. On 27 May, Major General [[Walter Lentaigne]] (who had taken command of the Chindits after Wingate was killed in an air crash in late March) ordered Calvert's brigade to capture the town of [[Mogaung]].<ref>Allen, p.369</ref> Calvert at first promised to capture Mogaung by 5 June. However, the Japanese reinforced the defenders of the town until it was held by a force of four battalions from the 53rd Division.<ref>Allen (1984), p.371</ref> As Calvert's brigade tried to advance over flooded flat ground, they suffered severely from shortage of rations, exhaustion and disease. Finally, Calvert was reinforced by a Chinese battalion and put in an all-out assault on 24 June which captured almost all of the town.<ref>Allen, p.373-374</ref> The last resistance was cleared by 27 June. Calvert's brigade had suffered 800 battle casualties in the siege, half of its strength. Of the remainder, only 300 men were left fit to fight.\n\nThe American General [[Joseph Stilwell]], who had overall command of the Chindits, announced via the [[BBC]] that the Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung. Calvert signalled to Stilwell's headquarters \"Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.\"<ref>Allen, p.374</ref>\n\nWhen he received orders to move to [[Myitkyina]], where another Japanese garrison was holding out, Calvert closed down his brigade's radio sets and marched to Stilwell's headquarters in [[Kamaing]] instead. A court martial was threatened, but after he and Stilwell finally met in person and Stilwell appreciated for the first time the conditions under which the Chindits had operated, the 77th Brigade was evacuated to India to recover. Calvert was awarded a bar to the DSO for the second Chindit expedition. In the field Calvert was \"clearly the most successful and aggressive Chindit commander,\" and a font of \"positive leadership\" throughout the campaign.<ref>Rooney (1995), p.127</ref>\n\n===SAS Operations===\n[[File:3rd 4th sas tarbes 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert at the ceremony marking the passing of 3 and 4 SAS to France in October 1945.]]\nCalvert was evacuated to Britain on medical grounds (ironically following an accidental injury) in September 1944. In March 1945 he was appointed to command the [[Special Air Service]] Brigade organising [[Operation Amherst]]. He held this appointment until the brigade disbanded in October 1945.\n\nAfter the war, he attended the Army's [[Staff College]]. After passing the course, he was appointed to a staff post as lieutenant colonel in the Allied Military Government in [[Trieste]]. He was then selected in 1950 to command the [[Malayan Scouts]] engaged in operations against Communist insurgents in the [[Malayan Emergency]]. Although he held the local rank of [[brigadier]], he nevertheless led several patrols and operations in person. However, the Malayan Scouts were not subject to proper selection procedures and never lost an early reputation for poor discipline. Calvert's exertions meant that he was invalided home in 1951.\n\n===Dismissal from the Army===\nOn his return to the UK, Calvert reverted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1951 he was assigned to a minor administrative staff post with the [[British Army of the Rhine]]. While there in 1952 he was accused of an act of sexual indecency with German civilian youths, [[court-martial]]led, found guilty and dismissed from the British Army.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-shaming-of-a-hero-1091460.html</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nAfter the military Calvert tried several times tried to build a career as an engineer, including a spell making a new start in Australia, but his life in this period was plagued by [[alcoholism]], and he resorted to hand-to-mouth manual itinerant work, and for a while he was a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] there. He later returned to England.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999</ref>\n\nHe wrote three books about his time in Burma with Wingate and the Chindits: ''Prisoners of Hope'', ''Fighting Mad: One Man's Guerrilla War'', and ''Chindits: Long Range Penetration''. He also contributed to the acclaimed British documentary television series, ''[[The World at War (TV series)|The World at War]].'' He is interviewed in the fourteenth episode, \"It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow \u2013 Burma (1942\u20131944)\". He also appeared on film in the 2001 documentary series ''Gladiators of World War II'' episode 11, entitled \"The Chindits\".  Subsequently, he was appointed research fellow at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in 1971 to write \"The Pattern of Guerrilla Warfare\", which was never finished.\n\nWith little money in his final years, he was compelled to sell his military medals and decorations in 1997.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nCalvert died in his 86th year on 26 November 1998 in [[Richmond-upon-Thames]]. Up until his death he was a supporter of The Chindits Old Comrades Association and other charities for the support of ex-servicemen. His body was cremated at the Chilterns Crematorium in [[Amersham]], in the county of [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref>Entry for Calvert in 'Findagrave'. http://www.findagrave.com/memorial/57324141</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* [[Distinguished Service Order]] 5 August 1943, 18 May 1944\n* [[Silver Star]] (United States) 19 September 1944\n* [[King Haakon VII's Cross of Liberty]] (Norway) 19 March 1948\n* [[Order of Leopold II|Commander of the Order of Leopold II with Palm]] (Belgium)\n* [[War Cross (Belgium)|Croix de Guerre 1940 with Palm]] (Belgium) 14 May 1948\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book |author=Allen, Louis |title=Burma: The Longest War, 1941\u201345 |year=1998 |publisher=Phoenix Giant |location=London |ISBN=0-7538-0221-X}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bidwell, Shelford |title=The Chindit War: Stilwell, Wingate, and the Campaign in Burma: 1944 |url=https://archive.org/details/chinditwarstilwe00bidw |url-access=registration |year=1979 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York}}\n* Calvert, Michael (1974) ''Chindits: Long Range Penetration'' New York: Ballantine Books\n* Calvert, Michael (1973) ''Slim'' New York: Ballantine Books\n* {{cite book |author=Calvert, Michael |title=Fighting Mad: One Man's Guerrilla War |year=1964 |publisher=Jarrolds Publishers |location=London}}\n* {{cite book |author=Calvert, Michael |title=Prisoners of Hope |year=1952 |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London}}\n* {{cite book |author=Latimer, Jon |title=Burma: The Forgotten War |year=2004 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |ISBN=0-7195-6576-6}}\n* {{cite book |author=Rooney, David |title=Burma Victory: Imphal, Kohima and the Chindit issue, March 1944 to May 1945 |year=1995 |publisher=Arms and Armour Press |location=New York}}\n* {{cite book |author=Rooney, David |title=Mad Mike: A Life of Brigadier Michael Calvert |year=1997 |publisher=Pen & Sword |ISBN=0-85052-543-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Slim, William |title=Defeat Into Victory |year=1957 |publisher=The Reprint Society |location=London}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Mike Calvert}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061031202504/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/biography/rem_bio_calvert.htm Royal Engineers Museum] Biography of Mike Calvert\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090612103711/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/malaya/Calvert.htm Biography at smallwars.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051227173725/http://www.chindit.org.uk/12mikesob.htm Times obituary]\n* [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-brigadier-michael-calvert-1188603.html Independent obituary]\n* [http://www.unithistories.com/officers/Army_officers_C01.html#Calvert_JM British Army Officers 1939\u20131945]\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80017491 Imperial War Museum Interview]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Calvert, Michael}}\n[[Category:1913 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Rohtak]]\n[[Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]\n[[Category:Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester]]\n[[Category:Royal Engineers officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:People educated at Bradfield College]]\n[[Category:Special Air Service officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of the Malayan Emergency]]\n[[Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Silver Star]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the King Haakon VII Freedom Cross]]\n[[Category:Commanders of the Order of Leopold II]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Croix de guerre (Belgium)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox military person\n|name         = Mike Calvert\n|nickname     = Mad Mike\n|birth_name   = James Michael Calvert\n|birth_date   = {{dob|df=y|1913|3|6}}\n|birth_place  = [[Rohtak]], India\n|death_date   = {{dda|df=y|1998|11|26|1913|3|6}}\n|death_place  = [[Richmond-upon-Thames]], England\n|image        = Chindit leaders Burma 1944 IWM MH 7873.jpg\n|caption      = Brigadier Calvert, third from left, with [[Orde Wingate]] (centre) and other Chindits at the \"Broadway\" airfield in Burma awaiting a night supply drop, 1944\n|allegiance   = {{flag|United Kingdom}}\n|branch       = {{army|UK}}\n|serviceyears = 1933\u201352\n|rank         = [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant colonel]]\n|commands     = {{ubl|[[77th Indian Infantry Brigade|77th Indian Brigade]]|[[Special Air Service]] Brigade|[[Malayan Scouts]]}}\n|unit         = {{ubl|[[Royal Engineers]]|[[Chindits|Long Range Penetration Groups]]}}\n|battles      = {{ubl|[[Second World War]]}}\n* [[Burma Campaign]]\n* [[North-West Europe]]\n                {{ubl|[[Malayan Emergency]]}}\n|laterwork    = Writer, lecturer\n}}\n'''James Michael Calvert''' (6 March 1913 \u2013 26 November 1998) was a British soldier involved in [[special operations]] in [[Burma]] during the [[Second World War]]. He participated in both [[Chindit]] operations and was instrumental in popularizing the unorthodox ideas of [[Orde Wingate|General Orde Wingate]]. He frequently led attacks from the front, a practice that earned him the nickname amongst the men under his command of \"Mad Mike.\"\n\n==Early life==\nCalvert was born at [[Rohtak]] in [[British India|India]], son of a member of the [[Indian Civil Service]]. He was educated at [[Bradfield College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]], from which was commissioned as a [[subaltern]] into the British Army's [[Royal Engineers]] as a professional soldier.<ref>Obituary for Calvert. 'The Independent', 2 December 1998.</ref>\n\n==Military career==\nCalvert was commissioned into the [[Royal Engineers]] in 1933, and for a time was the Army's [[middleweight]] boxing champion. He spent a year reading for the Mechanical Engineering [[Tripos]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref>Obituary for Calvert, 'The Independent', 2 December 1998. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-brigadier-michael-calvert-1188603.html</ref> In 1934 he returned to active service and was posted to the [[Hong Kong]] Royal Engineers, where he learned to speak [[Cantonese]]. He also witnessed the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese Army's]] attack on [[Shanghai]] and the [[Rape of Nanking]], which made him one of the few officers in the British Army pre-World War 2 who fully appreciated the nature of the threat posed by Japanese imperialism.\n\nWhen the [[Second World War]] broke out in 1939 Calvert briefly commanded a detachment of Royal Engineers in the [[Norwegian Campaign]], then trained [[commando]] detachments in [[demolition]] techniques in Hong Kong and Australia. In Australia, along with [[F. Spencer Chapman]], he assisted with training Australian commandos who formed the first [[Australian Army Independent Companies]] at [[Wilsons Promontory]], Victoria in 1941. He was then appointed to command the '''Bush Warfare School''' in [[Burma]], training officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s to lead guerilla bands in China for operations against the Japanese.\n\nThe Japanese invaded Burma in early 1942. Calvert and others from the school raided [[Henzada]] by riverboat after the fall of [[Rangoon]] as a deception operation to convince the Japanese that Australian reinforcements had reached Burma. Calvert then spent a period of time touring Burma with [[Orde Wingate]]. After the Bush Warfare School closed, Calvert was sent with 22 men from the school and a few hundred men separated from their units to guard the Gokteik Viaduct thirty miles east of [[Maymyo]]. (The Allied Commander in Chief, General [[Archibald Wavell]] apparently hoped that Calvert would use his initiative and demolish it, in spite of orders from the civil government to keep it intact. For once, Calvert obeyed orders.)<ref>Allen (1984), p.136</ref>\n\nAfter retreating from the viaduct, Calvert participated in a deception operation involving the loss of a set of false papers to the Japanese. Calvert's unit finally retreated to India at the very rear of the army, often behind the Japanese lines.\n\n===Operation Longcloth===\nIn India, he reunited with the equally unorthodox Wingate, and the two became firm friends. Calvert led one of the company-sized columns in [[Operation Longcloth]], Wingate's first [[Chindit]] operation in 1943. This was a long-range penetration operation behind enemy lines, which put great demands on the endurance of all who took part. Calvert was awarded the DSO for his achievements on the operation. His column achieved the greatest amount of demolition of the Japanese lines of communication, and reached India intact with the fewest casualties of those in the force.<ref>Allen (1984), pp.128-143</ref>\n\n===Operation Thursday===\n====The Fly-In====\nCalvert commanded the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade]] in [[Operation Thursday]], the much larger second Chindit operation. His brigade spearheaded the airborne landings deep in the Japanese rear. The operation was staged from Lalaghat, with D-Day fixed for 5 March. That morning, one of General [[Philip Cochran]]'s [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Mitchells]] flew over and photographed the landing zones. Wingate had ordered that no aircraft should fly over the landing zones, lest the operation be betrayed, but Cochran was not directly under Wingate's command and felt that launching the operation without accurate intelligence was a dangerous gamble.<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 104\u20135</ref> The photographs clearly showed that one of landing sites selected, codenamed Piccadilly, was unusable.\n\n<blockquote>It was at this dramatic moment, with everyone keyed up and ready to go, that the aerial photographs arrived. They showed that primary landing site Broadway was clear, but Piccadilly had been blocked by tree trunks; no gliders would land there that night. The general opinion was that the Japs had realized the possibilities of Piccadilly as a landing area and had deliberately blocked it, though some time later we discovered that the explanation was much simpler: Burmese woodmen had laid out their trees to dry in the clearing.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 140</ref></blockquote>\n\nWingate was enraged by Cochran's actions but admitted that the danger was real. He and Calvert weighed the options. The danger of executing a potentially compromised operation were substantial, but any delay threatened to push back the window of opportunity by at least a month. Of the three planned sites only two were available; Calvert suggested the plan be further altered and the entire brigade flown into Broadway. He said, \"I am prepared to take the whole of my brigade into Broadway and do without [second landing site] Piccadilly.\"<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 106</ref> Calvert later wrote, \"We had taken into account that [third landing site] Chowringhee was to the east of the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] while Broadway was west of the river. I told Wingate, 'I don't want to split my brigade either side of the Irrawaddy. I am prepared to take all the brigade into Broadway alone and take the consequence of a slower build-up.'\"<ref>Calvert, 1964: 141</ref> Lieutenant General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]] \"asked Calvert\u2026and found him strongly against [using] Chowringhee.\"<ref>Slim, 1957: 259</ref> Further discussion with Slim and Wingate clinched the matter: \"it was to be Broadway alone. I was nervous as bales, I imagine we all were, but we all knew we had to go\u2026In any case Broadway was clear and I could really see no reason why we should not go in there just because Piccadilly was blocked.\"<ref>Calvert, 1964: 141</ref>\n\nEach American [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] towed two heavily laden [[Waco CG-4]] gliders. Although a double tow posed no problems for a competent pilot in good weather, many of the pilots were inexperienced and the route across the mountain ranges bordering the [[Chindwin river]] guaranteed a turbulent, unsettled flight. The first gliders were scheduled to arrive at Broadway by 9:30pm, but by 2:00am Wingate and the others waiting at Lalaghat had not yet heard from Calvert. Poor reconnaissance, not enemy resistance, caused the delay, as aerial reconnaissance had failed to show a number of ditches scarring the field at Broadway. Calvert wrote:\n\n<blockquote>All six of the advance party gliders had landed and the plan had been that we would wheel them off to make way for the next batch, which would in turn be wheeled away and so on. But we had reckoned without the ditches. Three of the six gliders were so badly wrecked that the small force at present on the ground could not shift them. We worked at them furiously but suddenly I heard a shout and looked up. In the bright light of the moon I saw to my horror that the first two of the next batch had cast off [their tows] and were winging their silent way down.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 143</ref></blockquote>\n\nCalvert transmitted the prearranged signal \"Soya Link\", the most despised of ration items, to stop all flying, but at 6:30am on 6 March he radioed the code words \"Pork Sausage\" to resume flights into Broadway. A strip for C-47s was in place that evening, and supplies came rushing in. Calvert lost no time in organizing reconnaissance missions and fortifying Broadway. By 13 March the build-up was complete. In seven nights about 9,000 men, 1,350 animals, 250 tons of supplies and weapons had landed behind enemy lines in Burma.<ref>Calvert, 1964: 148</ref>\n\n====Broadway====\nOn 17 March he led a [[bayonet]] charge against Japanese positions shielded by a sunken road and a steep hill crowned with a pagoda. Calvert noticed that friendly forces nearby were drawing heavier fire. In fact, elements of the South Staffordshire Regiment had dug in adjacent to a Japanese unit. Neither force was aware of the other.<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 199</ref> Deciding that something had to be done, he elected to make a frontal assault:\n\n<blockquote>I saw something had to be done pretty quickly, so I shouted to Freddie that we were going to charge. I then told everyone that we were going to charge the Pagoda Hill. There were reinforcements on our left flank who would charge as well. So, standing up, I shouted out 'Charge' in the approved Victorian manner, and ran down the hill\u2026Half of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffords]] joined in. Then looking back I found a lot had not. So I told them to bloody well 'Charge, what the hell do you think you're doing.' So they charged. Machine-gunners, mortar teams, all officers \u2013 everybody who was on that hill<ref>Calvert, 1952:50</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe fighting quickly degenerated into a free-for-all. Calvert characterized the action as an \"extraordinary m\u00eal\u00e9e\u2026everyone shooting, bayoneting, kicking at everyone else, rather like an officers' guest night.\"<ref>Calvert, 1952: 50</ref> [[George Albert Cairns|Lieutenant George Cairns]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for killing several Japanese after one severed his left arm with a sword. A pause in the fighting turned into a stalemate, complete with shouting \u2013 according to Calvert \"[t]he Japs were yelling at us in English, 'You dirty hairy bastards,' etc.; only a final charge made by Calvert and some [[Gurkha]]s dislodged the Japanese. Many of these were shot as they retreated.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 51</ref> Afterward, \"the hill was a horrid sight, littered with Jap dead, and already the ones who had been killed there earlier in the day were black with flies. Stretcher-bearers were removing our wounded and our mercifully very few dead.\"<ref>Norman Durant quoted in Bidwell, 1979: 122</ref>\n\nShortly after this action a lieutenant in the South Staffordshire Regiment, Norman Durant, wrote a compelling description of Calvert in a letter to his parents:\n\n<blockquote>His hair flops over his forehead, and he has a disconcerting habit of staring at you when you speak to him and yet not appearing to hear a word. His lectures were always painfully slow and hesitant and during training he gave the impression of taking a long time to make up his mind; in action things were very different. He knows all the officers in the brigade and many of the senior NCOs, and his manner and attitude are always the same if he is talking to a CO, a subaltern or a private\u2026<ref>Norman Durant quoted in Bidwell, 1979: 118\u201319</ref></blockquote>\n\nCalvert's dedication to the troops under his command was one of his most visible attributes. According to David Rooney he was \"one of the most successful of the Chindit leaders [and] showed his greatness as a commander by reminding his men that, however bad things were for them, things were probably much worse for the enemy.\"<ref>Rooney, 1995: 98</ref>\n\n====White City====\nThe brigade then captured and held a position near Mawlu. Calvert \"saw that Mawlu [the location of the block] was the crucial point for road and rail traffic and determined to build up a defensive box there.\"<ref>Rooney, 1995: 126</ref> Because of the supply drop parachutes adorning the surrounding jungle, it became known as the White City. This fortified position blocked Japanese road and rail communications to their northern front for over two months. A large rectangle, 1,000 by 800 yards, White City was quickly identified by the Japanese as a threat. Probing attacks on 18, 19, and 20 March inflicted a handful of casualties, but were beaten back without significant loss. The Japanese mounted a serious attack on the night of 21 March that resulted in \"[v]ery confused close-quarter fighting\" that lasted all night. Two Japanese light machine guns were established in the block; a dawn attack led by flamethrower-equipped infantry displaced the Japanese, driving them outside the perimeter. Calvert was instrumental in orchestrating the counterattacks and was frequently under fire.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 52\u201357</ref>\n\nAfter repulsing numerous nighttime attacks, Calvert had two relatively quiet weeks to fortify White City. Under his direction a thick hedge of barbed wire was put in place and surrounded with mines and booby traps. Firing positions were dug in and camouflaged; reinforced with logs and earth, these positions were invisible and all-but impenetrable. Calvert also established a defensive fire plan to coordinate machine gun and mortar fire. Some [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|2-pounder anti-tank guns]] arrived on 29 March and were quickly put in place. These were followed by engineers who built a landing strip capable of handling [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47]] cargo aircraft, which delivered more artillery. White City was eventually defended by four anti-tank guns, six [[Bofors 40 mm]] [[autocannon]]s and four [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounders]].<ref>Bidwell, 1979: 125</ref> Calvert had a not insubstantial arsenal at his disposal.\n\nOn 6 April the White City again came under attack. The Japanese shelled and bombed the block throughout the afternoon. Calvert recalled that the terrain combined with meticulous attention to detail in constructing the positions provided shelter, and that casualties were low.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 109\u201310</ref> The only effective weapon the Japanese possessed was a 6-inch [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], an old coastal defence piece they had laboriously dragged through the jungle to bombard the block. The mortar fired a bomb four and a half feet long that was in flight for more than 30 seconds.<ref>Allen, 1998: 353</ref> Calvert described the mortar as \"the bane of our existence.\"<ref>Calvert, 1952: 109</ref> Calvert spent the attack in a dugout, coordinating his troops' response via telephone. He reported that stiff resistance led by his friend Ian MacPherson prevented the Japanese from breaching the block.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 110\u201311</ref>\n\nFrom 6 April through 11 April, Calvert wrote, \"[t]he sequence of attack was the same practically every night and only varied in intensity.\" Japanese infantry attacked after dark, invariably running into stiff resistance from emplaced machine guns, mines, barbed wire, booby traps, artillery, and sustained rifle fire.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 112</ref> The Japanese brought forward two light tanks; these were quickly destroyed with 2-pounder anti-tank guns. Confident in the block's ability to withstand any attack, Calvert's only concern was his rapidly dwindling supply of ammunition. Machine gun ammunition was being used at a frantic pace. In all, some 700,000 rounds of [[Vickers machine gun]] ammunition were dropped into White City. Calvert requested that supply drops contain less food and more ammunition.<ref>Allen, 1998: 353</ref>\n\nCalvert led several counter-attacks against encircling Japanese forces in person. On 13 April he commanded a much larger attack involving most of the brigade. Despite the intervention of American [[P-51 Mustang]]s, the attack was a failure; Calvert was forced to order a retreat. He learned that Major Ian MacPherson, commander of the headquarters company of the 77th Brigade had been killed, his body left in the Japanese positions. Calvert said he \"could not leave anyone like that without knowing for certain\" before starting back to look for MacPherson.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 133</ref> Only when the brigade major \"heaved out his revolver, stuck it in my stomach and said, 'I'll shoot you if you don't go back. I was with him when he was killed'\" did Calvert resume the retreat.<ref>Calvert, 1952: 134</ref>\n\n====Mogaung====\n[[File:The Chindits MH7287.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert (left) giving orders during the capture of Mogaung in June 1944.]]\nIn May, the Chindit brigades moved north. The [[monsoon]] had broken and floods impeded the Chindits' operations. On 27 May, Major General [[Walter Lentaigne]] (who had taken command of the Chindits after Wingate was killed in an air crash in late March) ordered Calvert's brigade to capture the town of [[Mogaung]].<ref>Allen, p.369</ref> Calvert at first promised to capture Mogaung by 5 June. However, the Japanese reinforced the defenders of the town until it was held by a force of four battalions from the 53rd Division.<ref>Allen (1984), p.371</ref> As Calvert's brigade tried to advance over flooded flat ground, they suffered severely from shortage of rations, exhaustion and disease. Finally, Calvert was reinforced by a Chinese battalion and put in an all-out assault on 24 June which captured almost all of the town.<ref>Allen, p.373-374</ref> The last resistance was cleared by 27 June. Calvert's brigade had suffered 800 battle casualties in the siege, half of its strength. Of the remainder, only 300 men were left fit to fight.\n\nThe American General [[Joseph Stilwell]], who had overall command of the Chindits, announced via the [[BBC]] that the Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung. Calvert signalled to Stilwell's headquarters \"Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.\"<ref>Allen, p.374</ref>\n\nWhen he received orders to move to [[Myitkyina]], where another Japanese garrison was holding out, Calvert closed down his brigade's radio sets and marched to Stilwell's headquarters in [[Kamaing]] instead. A court martial was threatened, but after he and Stilwell finally met in person and Stilwell appreciated for the first time the conditions under which the Chindits had operated, the 77th Brigade was evacuated to India to recover. Calvert was awarded a bar to the DSO for the second Chindit expedition. In the field Calvert was \"clearly the most successful and aggressive Chindit commander,\" and a font of \"positive leadership\" throughout the campaign.<ref>Rooney (1995), p.127</ref>\n\n===SAS Operations===\n[[File:3rd 4th sas tarbes 1945.jpg|thumb|right|Calvert at the ceremony marking the passing of 3 and 4 SAS to France in October 1945.]]\nCalvert was evacuated to Britain on medical grounds (ironically following an accidental injury) in September 1944. In March 1945 he was appointed to command the [[Special Air Service]] Brigade organising [[Operation Amherst]]. He held this appointment until the brigade disbanded in October 1945.\n\nAfter the war, he attended the Army's [[Staff College]]. After passing the course, he was appointed to a staff post as lieutenant colonel in the Allied Military Government in [[Trieste]]. He was then selected in 1950 to command the [[Malayan Scouts]] engaged in operations against Communist insurgents in the [[Malayan Emergency]]. Although he held the local rank of [[brigadier]], he nevertheless led several patrols and operations in person. However, the Malayan Scouts were not subject to proper selection procedures and never lost an early reputation for poor discipline. Calvert's exertions meant that he was invalided home in 1951.\n\n===Dismissal from the Army===\nOn his return to the UK, Calvert reverted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In 1951 he was assigned to a minor administrative staff post with the [[British Army of the Rhine]]. While there in 1952 he was accused of an act of sexual indecency with German civilian youths, [[court-martial]]led, found guilty and dismissed from the British Army.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999. https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-shaming-of-a-hero-1091460.html</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nAfter the military Calvert tried several times tried to build a career as an engineer, including a spell making a new start in Australia, but his life in this period was plagued by [[alcoholism]], and he resorted to hand-to-mouth manual itinerant work, and for a while he was a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] there. He later returned to England.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999</ref>\n\nHe wrote three books about his time in Burma with Wingate and the Chindits: ''Prisoners of Hope'', ''Fighting Mad: One Man's Guerrilla War'', and ''Chindits: Long Range Penetration''. He also contributed to the acclaimed British documentary television series, ''[[The World at War (TV series)|The World at War]].'' He is interviewed in the fourteenth episode, \"It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow \u2013 Burma (1942\u20131944)\". He also appeared on film in the 2001 documentary series ''Gladiators of World War II'' episode 11, entitled \"The Chindits\".  Subsequently, he was appointed research fellow at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in 1971 to write \"The Pattern of Guerrilla Warfare\", which was never finished.\n\nWith little money in his final years, he was compelled to sell his military medals and decorations in 1997.<ref>'The Shaming of a Hero', 'The Independent', 4 May 1999.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nCalvert died in his 86th year on 26 November 1998 in [[Richmond-upon-Thames]]. Up until his death he was a supporter of The Chindits Old Comrades Association and other charities for the support of ex-servicemen. His body was cremated at the Chilterns Crematorium in [[Amersham]], in the county of [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref>Entry for Calvert in 'Findagrave'. http://www.findagrave.com/memorial/57324141</ref>\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* [[Distinguished Service Order]] 5 August 1943, 18 May 1944\n* [[Silver Star]] (United States) 19 September 1944\n* [[King Haakon VII's Cross of Liberty]] (Norway) 19 March 1948\n* [[Order of Leopold II|Commander of the Order of Leopold II with Palm]] (Belgium)\n* [[War Cross (Belgium)|Croix de Guerre 1940 with Palm]] (Belgium) 14 May 1948\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book |author=Allen, Louis |title=Burma: The Longest War, 1941\u201345 |year=1998 |publisher=Phoenix Giant |location=London |ISBN=0-7538-0221-X}}\n* {{cite book |author=Bidwell, Shelford |title=The Chindit War: Stilwell, Wingate, and the Campaign in Burma: 1944 |url=https://archive.org/details/chinditwarstilwe00bidw |url-access=registration |year=1979 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York}}\n* Calvert, Michael (1974) ''Chindits: Long Range Penetration'' New York: Ballantine Books\n* Calvert, Michael (1973) ''Slim'' New York: Ballantine Books\n* {{cite book |author=Calvert, Michael |title=Fighting Mad: One Man's Guerrilla War |year=1964 |publisher=Jarrolds Publishers |location=London}}\n* {{cite book |author=Calvert, Michael |title=Prisoners of Hope |year=1952 |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London}}\n* {{cite book |author=Latimer, Jon |title=Burma: The Forgotten War |year=2004 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |ISBN=0-7195-6576-6}}\n* {{cite book |author=Rooney, David |title=Burma Victory: Imphal, Kohima and the Chindit issue, March 1944 to May 1945 |year=1995 |publisher=Arms and Armour Press |location=New York}}\n* {{cite book |author=Rooney, David |title=Mad Mike: A Life of Brigadier Michael Calvert |year=1997 |publisher=Pen & Sword |ISBN=0-85052-543-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Slim, William |title=Defeat Into Victory |year=1957 |publisher=The Reprint Society |location=London}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Mike Calvert}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061031202504/http://www.remuseum.org.uk/biography/rem_bio_calvert.htm Royal Engineers Museum] Biography of Mike Calvert\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090612103711/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/malaya/Calvert.htm Biography at smallwars.com]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051227173725/http://www.chindit.org.uk/12mikesob.htm Times obituary]\n* [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-brigadier-michael-calvert-1188603.html Independent obituary]\n* [http://www.unithistories.com/officers/Army_officers_C01.html#Calvert_JM British Army Officers 1939\u20131945]\n* [http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/80017491 Imperial War Museum Interview]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Calvert, Michael}}\n[[Category:1913 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Rohtak]]\n[[Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]\n[[Category:Academics of the Victoria University of Manchester]]\n[[Category:Royal Engineers officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:People educated at Bradfield College]]\n[[Category:Special Air Service officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of the Malayan Emergency]]\n[[Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Silver Star]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the King Haakon VII Freedom Cross]]\n[[Category:Commanders of the Order of Leopold II]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Croix de guerre (Belgium)]]\n", "name_user": "Eastfarthingan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMogaung:link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Calvert"}
