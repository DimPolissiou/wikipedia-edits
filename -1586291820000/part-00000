{"title_page": "Anti-austerity movement", "text_new": "{{Short description|Opposition to austerity measures, especially in Europe}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{Anti-austerity movement in the European Union}}\nThe '''anti-austerity movement''' refers to the mobilisation of [[street protest]]s and [[grassroots]] campaigns that has happened across various countries, especially in [[Europe]], since the onset of the worldwide [[Great Recession]].\n\nAnti-austerity actions are varied and ongoing, and can be either sporadic and loosely organised or longer-term and tightly organised. They continue as of the present day. The global [[Occupy movement]] has arguably been the most noticeable physical enactment of anti-austerity and [[Populism|populist]] sentiment.\n\n==Ireland==\nAn example of countries implementing severe austerity measures is [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Ireland witnessed its housing market completely (rather than, as elsewhere, partially) collapse, and the government eventually had to apply for a [[bailout]] from the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), agreeing to an austerity program of economic reform in exchange. The austerity measures and the terms of the IMF bailout became major aspects of the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|Irish financial crisis]], and populist anger over these issues played a major role in the loss of governmental power of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] to opposition parties in the [[2011 Irish general election]]. The loss for Fianna F\u00e1il was so great that many commentators remarked that the results were \"historic\". [[Fine Gael]] and the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] formed a [[coalition government]], and Fine Gael promised to re-negotiate the terms of the IMF bailout end the austerity programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Enda-Kenny-and-Eamon-Gilmore-will-renegotiate-EU-bailout-117573543.html|title=Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore will renegotiate EU bailout|date=8 March 2011|work=IrishCentral.com}}</ref> [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], which for the first time won a notable percentage in the election, called for a nationwide [[referendum]] over whether the bailout agreement should be scrapped altogether.
