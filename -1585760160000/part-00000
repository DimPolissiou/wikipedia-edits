Construction was completed in one phase, and most of the castle is in the same architectural style. [[Archaeology|Archaeologist]] David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly, probably because of the threat from the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=14.}}</ref> Stone castles were usually time-consuming and expensive to build, often costing thousands of pounds.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|1992|pp=41\u201343.}}</ref> Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of [[Brest, France|Brest]] in France from 1386 to 1387, and as a result was probably absent for the first years of the castle's construction.<ref name=\"Thackray 13\"/> It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge's main residence and the administrative centre of the manor.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=17.}}</ref> It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed, but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392; Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle, as he was dead by 1395.<ref name=\"Thackray 13\"/>\n\nDanlyngrigge's estates, including the castle, were inherited by his son, John Dalyngrigge. Like his father, John enjoyed the favour of the king and was described as the \"King's Knight\"; in 1400 he was granted an annual allowance of 100&nbsp;[[Mark (money)|marks]] by the king. He died on 27 September 1408; his [[will (law)|will]] ensured that his property belonged to his widow, Alice. John and Alice had no children, so on her death in 1443 the estates and castle were passed on to Richard Dalyngrigge, John's cousin. Richard died without [[issue (legal)|issue]], so in accordance with John's will the estates passed on to Richard's sister Philippa in 1470. She was married to Sir Thomas Lewknor, from a prominent Sussex family who owned land all over the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=21\u201322.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bodiam Castle through the trees.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of Bodiam Castle across the water, framed by oak leaves.

When Richard of the [[House of York]] ascended to the throne as [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] in 1483, Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] in southeast England. In November 1483, Lewknor's uncle and [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]], the [[Earl of Surrey]], were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle, where Lewknor was based. It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead, and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance. His property was confiscated, and Nicholas Rigby was made [[constable]] of the castle. On [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s accession to the English throne the [[attainder]] was revoked, and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor. However, not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542. Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family. Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries, there is little to indicate how it was used in this period, or if the family spent much time in it.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=21\u201324.}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Sir Roger Lewknor in 1543, his estates were divided among his descendants, and the castle and manor were split.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=22.}}</ref> John Levett of [[Salehurst]] purchased the castle in 1588.<ref>{{harvnb|Curzon|1926|pp=37\u201339.}}</ref> In 1623, most of the estates of Bodiam were bought by Sir [[Nicholas Tufton, 1st Earl of Thanet|Nicholas Tufton]], later [[Earl of Thanet]]. His son, [[John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet]], inherited Nicholas's property on his father's death in 1631; it was John Tufton who reunited possession of castle and manor when he bought Bodiam Castle in 1639. John Tufton was a supporter of the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] cause during the [[English Civil War]], and led an attack on [[Lewes]], and was involved in a Royalist defeat at [[Haywards Heath]]. Parliament confiscated some of his lands in 1643, and more in 1644, as well as fining him \u00a39,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|9000|1644|r=-5}}|0}} today).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref name=\"Thackray 24\">{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=24.}}</ref> To help pay his fine, Tufton sold Bodiam Castle for \u00a36,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|6000|1644|r=-4}}|0}} today){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} in March 1644 to Nathaniel Powell, a [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]].<ref name=\"Thackray 24\"/>\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Picturesque ruins==\n[[File:The North East View of Bodiham Castle in the County of Sussex.jpg|thumb|left|481x481px|Engraving of 1737 by [[Samuel and Nathaniel Buck]], showing Bodiam Castle from the northeast]]\nAfter the Civil War, Powell was made [[Powell Baronets#Powell baronets, of Ewhurst (1661)|a baronet]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. Although it is unrecorded when Bodiam Castle was dismantled ([[slighting|slighted]]), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted to prevent them from being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the [[barbican]], the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=24\u201325.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1722 Sir Thomas Webster bought the castle. For over a century, Bodiam Castle and its associated manor descended through the [[Webster Baronets#Webster baronets, of Copthall, in the County of Essex (1703)|Webster family]]. It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period. The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid-18th century, when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=25.}}</ref> Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the [[Gothic Revival architecture|revival in Gothic architecture]] and the renovation of old structures.<ref name=\"Thackray 26\">{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=26.}}</ref>\n\nThe third Sir Godfrey Webster began looking for buyers for the castle in 1815, and in 1829 he finally managed to sell it and {{convert|24|acre|ha|0}} of the surrounding land to [[John 'Mad Jack' Fuller]] for \u00a33,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3000|1829|r=-4}}|0}} today).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref name=\"Thackray 26\"/> Fuller repaired one of the towers, added new gates to the site, and removed a cottage which had been built within the castle in the 18th century; he is thought to have bought the castle to prevent the Webster family from dismantling it and reusing its materials. [[George Cubitt, 1st Baron Ashcombe|George Cubitt]], later [[Baron Ashcombe]], purchased the castle and its {{convert|24|acre|ha}} from Fuller's grandson in 1849, for over \u00a35,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|5000|1849|r=-4}}|0}} today).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=26\u201327.}}</ref> Cubitt continued the renovations that Fuller started. He commissioned the first detailed survey of Bodiam Castle in 1864, and undertook repairs to the tower at the southwest corner of the site, which had almost entirely collapsed. Because there was then a fashion for ruins covered in ivy, the vegetation was not removed despite its detrimental effect on the masonry, and the trees which had taken root in the courtyard were left.<ref name=\"Thackray 27\">{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=27.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bodiam-Castle.jpg|417x417px|thumb|A [[watercolor painting|watercolour]] from 1906 by Wilfrid Ball showing the overgrown ruins and neglected moat of the castle.

Nearby hedges and fences were removed to provide an unobscured view of the castle. There were excavations in the interior, and a well was discovered in the basement of the southwest tower. Vegetation was cleared, stonework repaired, and the original floor level re-established throughout the castle. A cottage was built to provide a museum to display the finds from the excavations and a home for a caretaker.

A landscape survey by the Royal Commission for Historic Monuments concluded that if this were the case, then Bodiam Castle was unusually sited, as it is far from the medieval coastline.<ref name=\"Liddiard 8-9\"/>\n\n[[File:Bodiam Castle fromthe north.jpg|thumb|left|477x477px|alt=View of the castle in pale winter light framed by bare trees.|Bodiam Castle was described as \"an old soldier's dream house\" in the 1960s, although its defences are now considered more ornamental than practical.<ref>{{harvnb|Liddiard|2005|pp=7, 10.}}</ref>]]\nThe area surrounding Bodiam Castle was landscaped when the castle was built, to increase its aesthetic appeal.<ref name=\"Thackray 55\">{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=55.}}</ref> Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam as one of the best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Creighton|Higham|2003|p=23.}}</ref> The water features were originally extensive, but only the moat survives, along with the earthworks left over from its construction. Roughly rectangular, the moat is supplied by several springs, some of them within it,<ref name=\"Thackray 55\"/> which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s.<ref name=\"Thackray 30\"/> A moat can prevent attackers from gaining access to the base of a castle's walls, but in the case of Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape. The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence. The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect, giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour.<ref>{{harvnb|Liddiard|2005|pp=8\u201310.}}</ref> Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable, and considers it the equal of the 13th-century [[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd|castles of Edward I in Wales]], such as [[Caerphilly Castle]].<ref name=\"Cathcart King 150\">{{harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=150.}}</ref>\n\nThe castle sits roughly in the middle of the moat. The [[postern]] gate at the rear would have been connected to the moat's south bank by a drawbridge and a long timber bridge. The main entrance on the north side of the castle is today connected to the north bank by a wooden bridge, but the original route would have included two bridges: one from the main entrance to an island in the moat, and another connecting the island to the west bank. For the most part the bridge was static, apart from the section closest to the west bank, which would have been a drawbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=33\u201334.}}</ref> The island in the moat is called the Octagon, and excavations on it have uncovered a [[garderobe]] (toilet), suggesting that there may have been a guard on the island, although it is unclear to what extent it was fortified.

This type of castle, with a central courtyard and buildings against the [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle has been described by military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=149.}}</ref> There are circular towers at each of the four corners, with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered [[gatehouse]] in the north face of the castle.

The surviving fabric includes a slot for a [[portcullis]] for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that the second story would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show the ground floor of the barbican still standing and includes detail such as [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] inside the passageway.<ref name=\"Thackray35\"/>\n\n[[File:Bodiam murder holes.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A vaulted stone ceiling.

The Wardeux family was that of Edward Dalyngrigge's wife; the Radyndens were relations of the Dalyngrigges. Above the arms is a helm bearing a unicorn head crest.

The domestic buildings within the castle lined the curtain walls. However, remains are substantial enough to recreate a plan of the castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=39.}}</ref> The structure was divided into separate living areas for the lord and his family, high-status guests, the garrisons, and servants.<ref name=\"Thackray 40\">{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=40.}}</ref> The south range of the castle consisted of the [[great hall]], the kitchens, and associated rooms. The great hall, to the east of the centrally located [[postern]] gate, was {{convert|24|by|40|ft}} and would have been as tall as the curtain wall. To the west of the great hall was the pantry and buttery, linked to the great hall by a [[screens passage]]. The three standing arches gave access to different rooms, the pantry, buttery and the kitchen which was at the far west of the south range. This layout was typical of large medieval houses. The great hall was the social centre of the castle, and where the lord would have entertained guests.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=44\u201345.}}</ref> The buttery and pantry occupied the bottom floor, and above was a room of unknown purpose. The buttery had a cellar and was used to store ale and wine, while the pantry held the supplies for the kitchen. To prevent heat from the cooking fires becoming unbearable, the kitchen was as tall as the curtain walls to provide a large space to absorb the heat. In the southwest tower was a well, from which water would have been drawn for the household.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=48\u201349.}}</ref>\n\nAlong the east wall is a chapel, a hall, and an [[antechamber]]. To accommodate the chapel, the curtain wall near the northeast corner projects {{convert|9|ft}} further into the moat than the rest of the wall along the east side. Immediately south of the chapel was the main accommodation for the lord and his family. The buildings were two storeys high and incorporated a basement. The exact layout of the rooms is unclear.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=42.}}</ref>\n[[File:Bodiam Castle 05.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Ruined buildings inside the castle. There is a doorway leading to a ruined room, the kitchen range. In the background is the southeast tower.|The remains of the south range of the castle|483x483px]]\n\nArranged along the west curtain wall was an extra hall and a kitchen; it is not certain what these were used for, although it is probable that these were intended to provide for the household's retainers. The \"retainers' hall\" had no windows on its west side and would have been relatively dark compared to the great hall. Also, whereas the great hall had a large fireplace, the \"retainers' hall\" had none. The hall was adjacent to the kitchen, to which it was directly connected, with no screens passage in between. Above the \"retainers' hall\", which was confined to the ground floor, was a room with no fireplace and of unclear purpose.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=51\u201352.}}</ref>\n\nEast of the main gatehouse was a two-storey building with a basement. The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation.<ref name=\"Thackray 40\"/> The purpose of the buildings along the west end of the north range is uncertain. The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables. The tower in the northwest corner of the castle had a garderobe and fireplace on each of the three above-ground floors, and there was a basement underneath.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=52\u201354.}}</ref>{{clear left}}\n\n{{wide image|Bodiam interior.jpg|1000px|alt=The courtyard of Bodiam Castle with the ruins of domestic buildings.

It was built in 1385 by Sir [[Edward Dalyngrigge]], a former knight of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], with the permission of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], ostensibly to defend the area against French invasion during the [[Hundred Years' War]]. Of [[quadrangular castle|quadrangular plan]], Bodiam Castle has no [[keep]], having its various chambers built around the outer defensive walls and inner courts. Its corners and entrance are marked by towers, and topped by [[battlement|crenellations]]. Its structure, details and situation in an artificial watery landscape indicate that display was an important aspect of the castle's design as well as defence. It was the home of the [[Edward Dalyngrigge#Genealogy|Dalyngrigge]] family and the centre of the [[manorialism|manor]] of [[Bodiam]].\n\nPossession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of Dalyngrigges, until their line became extinct, when the castle passed by marriage to the Lewknor family. During the [[Wars of the Roses]], Sir Thomas Lewknor supported the [[House of Lancaster]], and when [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] of the [[House of York]] became king in 1483, a force was despatched to [[siege|besiege]] Bodiam Castle. It is unrecorded whether the siege went ahead, but it is thought that Bodiam was surrendered without much resistance. The castle was confiscated, but returned to the Lewknors when [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] of the House of Lancaster became king in 1485. Descendants of the Lewknors owned the castle until at least the 16th century.\n\nBy the start of the [[English Civil War]] in 1641, Bodiam Castle was in the possession of [[John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet|Lord Thanet]]. He supported the [[cavalier|Royalist]] cause, and sold the castle to help pay fines levied against him by Parliament. The castle was subsequently dismantled, and was left as a picturesque ruin until its purchase by [[John 'Mad Jack' Fuller|John Fuller]] in 1829. Under his auspices, the castle was partially restored before being sold to [[George Cubitt, 1st Baron Ashcombe]], and later to [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], both of whom undertook further restoration work. The castle is protected as a Grade I [[listed building]] and [[Scheduled Monument]]. It has been owned by [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]] since 1925, donated by Lord Curzon on his death, and is open to the public.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Death of Wat Tyler Froissart.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Picture from an illuminated manuscript showing a townscape with a group of horsemen, some wielding swords and one man driving a sword through the head of a prostrate man.

[[Archaeology|Archaeologist]] David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly, probably because of the threat from the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=14.}}</ref> Stone castles were usually time-consuming and expensive to build, often costing thousands of pounds.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|1992|pp=41\u201343.}}</ref> Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of [[Brest, France|Brest]] in France from 1386 to 1387, and as a result was probably absent for the first years of the castle's construction.<ref name=\"Thackray 13\"/> It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge's main residence and the administrative centre of the manor.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=17.}}</ref> It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed, but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392; Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle, as he was dead by 1395.<ref name=\"Thackray 13\"/>\n\nDanlyngrigge's estates, including the castle, were inherited by his son, John Dalyngrigge. Like his father, John enjoyed the favour of the king and was described as the \"King's Knight\"; in 1400 he was granted an annual allowance of 100&nbsp;[[Mark (money)|marks]] by the king. He died on 27 September 1408; his [[will (law)|will]] ensured that his property belonged to his widow, Alice. John and Alice had no children, so on her death in 1443 the estates and castle were passed on to Richard Dalyngrigge, John's cousin. Richard died without [[issue (legal)|issue]], so in accordance with John's will the estates passed on to Richard's sister Philippa in 1470. She was married to Sir Thomas Lewknor, from a prominent Sussex family who owned land all over the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=21\u201322.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bodiam Castle through the trees.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photo of Bodiam Castle across the water, framed by oak leaves.

When Richard of the [[House of York]] ascended to the throne as [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] in 1483, Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] in southeast England. In November 1483, Lewknor's uncle and [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard]], the [[Earl of Surrey]], were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle, where Lewknor was based. It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead, and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance. His property was confiscated, and Nicholas Rigby was made [[constable]] of the castle. On [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s accession to the English throne the [[attainder]] was revoked, and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor. However, not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542. Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family. Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries, there is little to indicate how it was used in this period, or if the family spent much time in it.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=21\u201324.}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Sir Roger Lewknor in 1543, his estates were divided among his descendants, and the castle and manor were split.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=22.}}</ref> John Levett of [[Salehurst]] purchased the castle in 1588.<ref>{{harvnb|Curzon|1926|pp=37\u201339.}}</ref> In 1623, most of the estates of Bodiam were bought by Sir [[Nicholas Tufton, 1st Earl of Thanet|Nicholas Tufton]], later [[Earl of Thanet]]. His son, [[John Tufton, 2nd Earl of Thanet]], inherited Nicholas's property on his father's death in 1631; it was John Tufton who reunited possession of castle and manor when he bought Bodiam Castle in 1639. John Tufton was a supporter of the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] cause during the [[English Civil War]], and led an attack on [[Lewes]], and was involved in a Royalist defeat at [[Haywards Heath]].

Although it is unrecorded when Bodiam Castle was dismantled ([[slighting|slighted]]), it was probably after it was bought by Powell. During and after the Civil War, many castles were slighted to prevent them from being reused. Not all were destroyed completely, and in some cases care was taken not to unnecessarily deface the structure. At Bodiam, it was deemed sufficient to dismantle the [[barbican]], the bridges, and the buildings inside the castle. When Nathaniel Powell died in 1674 or 1675, Bodiam Castle was passed on to his son, also called Nathaniel. After the second Nathaniel, the castle came into the possession of Elizabeth Clitherow, his daughter-in-law.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=24\u201325.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1722 Sir Thomas Webster bought the castle. For over a century, Bodiam Castle and its associated manor descended through the [[Webster Baronets#Webster baronets, of Copthall, in the County of Essex (1703)|Webster family]]. It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period. The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid-18th century, when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=25.}}</ref> Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the [[Gothic Revival architecture|revival in Gothic architecture]] and the renovation of old structures.<ref name=\"Thackray 26\">{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=26.}}</ref>\n\nThe third Sir Godfrey Webster began looking for buyers for the castle in 1815, and in 1829 he finally managed to sell it and {{convert|24|acre|ha|0}} of the surrounding land to [[John 'Mad Jack' Fuller]] for \u00a33,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3000|1829|r=-4}}|0}} today).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref name=\"Thackray 26\"/> Fuller repaired one of the towers, added new gates to the site, and removed a cottage which had been built within the castle in the 18th century; he is thought to have bought the castle to prevent the Webster family from dismantling it and reusing its materials. [[George Cubitt, 1st Baron Ashcombe|George Cubitt]], later [[Baron Ashcombe]], purchased the castle and its {{convert|24|acre|ha}} from Fuller's grandson in 1849, for over \u00a35,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|5000|1849|r=-4}}|0}} today).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=26\u201327.}}</ref> Cubitt continued the renovations that Fuller started. He commissioned the first detailed survey of Bodiam Castle in 1864, and undertook repairs to the tower at the southwest corner of the site, which had almost entirely collapsed. Because there was then a fashion for ruins covered in ivy, the vegetation was not removed despite its detrimental effect on the masonry, and the trees which had taken root in the courtyard were left.<ref name=\"Thackray 27\">{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|p=27.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bodiam-Castle.jpg|417x417px|thumb|A [[watercolor painting|watercolour]] from 1906 by Wilfrid Ball showing the overgrown ruins and neglected moat of the castle.

The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence. The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect, giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour.<ref>{{harvnb|Liddiard|2005|pp=8\u201310.}}</ref> Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable, and considers it the equal of the 13th-century [[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd|castles of Edward I in Wales]], such as [[Caerphilly Castle]].<ref name=\"Cathcart King 150\">{{harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=150.}}</ref>\n\nThe castle sits roughly in the middle of the moat. The [[postern]] gate at the rear would have been connected to the moat's south bank by a drawbridge and a long timber bridge. The main entrance on the north side of the castle is today connected to the north bank by a wooden bridge, but the original route would have included two bridges: one from the main entrance to an island in the moat, and another connecting the island to the west bank. For the most part the bridge was static, apart from the section closest to the west bank, which would have been a drawbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=33\u201334.}}</ref> The island in the moat is called the Octagon, and excavations on it have uncovered a [[garderobe]] (toilet), suggesting that there may have been a guard on the island, although it is unclear to what extent it was fortified.

The surviving fabric includes a slot for a [[portcullis]] for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates.

To the west of the great hall was the pantry and buttery, linked to the great hall by a [[screens passage]]. The three standing arches gave access to different rooms, the pantry, buttery and the kitchen which was at the far west of the south range. This layout was typical of large medieval houses. The great hall was the social centre of the castle, and where the lord would have entertained guests.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=44\u201345.}}</ref> The buttery and pantry occupied the bottom floor, and above was a room of unknown purpose. The buttery had a cellar and was used to store ale and wine, while the pantry held the supplies for the kitchen. To prevent heat from the cooking fires becoming unbearable, the kitchen was as tall as the curtain walls to provide a large space to absorb the heat. In the southwest tower was a well, from which water would have been drawn for the household.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=48\u201349.}}</ref>\n\nAlong the east wall is a chapel, a hall, and an [[antechamber]].

Also, whereas the great hall had a large fireplace, the \"retainers' hall\" had none. The hall was adjacent to the kitchen, to which it was directly connected, with no screens passage in between.

The basement was probably used for storage while the above two floors provided accommodation.<ref name=\"Thackray 40\"/> The purpose of the buildings along the west end of the north range is uncertain. The sparse arrangement, with little provision for lighting, has led to suggestions that it was used as stables, however there are no drains which are usually associated with stables.
