{"title_page": "Smoke detector", "text_new": "[[File:Smoke detector.JPG|thumb|Smoke Detector mounted on the ceiling]]\n\nA '''smoke detector''' is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indicator of [[fire]]. Commercial security devices issue a signal to a [[fire alarm control panel]] as part of a [[fire alarm system]], while household smoke detectors, also known as '''smoke alarms''', generally issue a local audible or visual [[alarm]] from the detector itself or several detectors if there are multiple smoke detectors interlinked.\n\nSmoke detectors are housed in plastic  enclosures, smoke detectors are typically shaped like a disk or square about {{convert|150|mm|in|0}} in diameter and {{convert|25|mm|in|0}} thick, but shape and size vary. Smoke can be detected either  optically ([[Photodiode|photoelectric]]) or by physical process ([[ionization]]); detectors may use either, or both, methods. Sensitive alarms can be used to detect, and thus deter, smoking in areas where it is banned. Smoke detectors in large commercial, industrial, and residential buildings are usually powered by a central fire alarm system, which is powered by the building power with a battery backup. Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units, to several interlinked mains-powered units with battery backup; with these interlinked units, if any unit detects smoke, all trigger even if household power has gone out.\n\nThe risk of dying in a home fire is cut by 1/4th in homes with working smoke alarms. The US National Fire Protection Association reports 0.53 deaths per 100 fires in homes with working smoke alarms compared to 1.18 deaths without (2009\u20132013). Some homes do not have any smoke alarms, some alarms do not have working batteries; sometimes the alarm fails to detect the fire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfpa.org/news-and-research/fire-statistics-and-reports/fire-statistics/fire-safety-equipment/smoke-alarms-in-us-home-fires |title=Smoke Alarms in U.S. Home Fires |website=nfpa.org |date=September 2015 |accessdate=2017-07-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729010219/http://www.nfpa.org/news-and-research/fire-statistics-and-reports/fire-statistics/fire-safety-equipment/smoke-alarms-in-us-home-fires |archivedate=2017-07-29 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe first automatic electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by [[Francis Robbins Upton]],<ref>{{Cite patent|country=US|number=436961|inventor=[[Francis Robbins Upton]]}}</ref> an associate of [[Thomas Edison]].<ref name=\"party1\">{{cite news |title= Birthday Party to Edison; Men Associated with Him in the Early 80s Organize the Pioneers |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/02/03/102977088.pdf |quote=Francis R.

Ionization detectors are more sensitive to the flaming stage of fires than optical detectors, while optical detectors are more sensitive to fires in the early smouldering stage.<ref name=\"ionizaton\">Fleming, Jay.

The radioactive source emits [[alpha particle]]s into both chambers, which [[ionizes]] some air [[molecule]]s. There is a [[potential difference]] (voltage) between pairs of [[electrode]]s in the chambers; the [[electrical charge]] on the [[ion]]s allows an [[electric current]] to flow. The currents in both chambers should be the same as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cote|first1=Arthur|last2=Bugbee|first2=Percy|title=Principles of fire protection|year=1988|publisher=National Fire Protection Association|location=Quincy, MA|isbn=0-87765-345-3|page=249|chapter=Ionization smoke detectors}}</ref> The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm if and only if power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The current drawn by an ionization smoke detector is low enough for a small battery used as sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.\n\nIonization smoke detectors are usually cheaper to manufacture than optical detectors.

In spot-type detectors, all of these components are arranged inside a chamber where air, which may contain smoke from a nearby fire, flows. In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums, [[optical beam smoke detector|optical beam]] or projected-beam smoke detectors are used instead of a chamber within the unit: a wall-mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device or reflected to the receiver by a reflector. In some types, particularly optical beam types, the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the photosensor. The received [[Radiative transfer|light intensity will be reduced]] due to [[scattering]] from particulates of smoke, air-borne dust, or other substances; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold, potentially due to smoke.<ref name=\"AirflowPatterns\" /> In other types, typically chamber types, the light is not directed at the sensor, which is not illuminated in the absence of particles. If the air in the chamber contains particles (smoke or dust), the light is [[scattering|scattered]] and some of it reaches the sensor, triggering the alarm.<ref name=\"AirflowPatterns\" />\n\nAccording to the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA), \"photoelectric smoke detection is generally more responsive to fires that begin with a long period of smoldering\". Studies by Texas A&M and the NFPA cited by the City of Palo Alto, California state, \"Photoelectric alarms react slower to rapidly growing fires than ionization alarms, but laboratory and field tests have shown that photoelectric smoke alarms provide adequate warning for all types of fires and have been shown to be far less likely to be deactivated by occupants.\"\n\nAlthough photoelectric alarms are highly effective at detecting smoldering fires and do provide adequate protection from flaming fires, fire safety experts and the National Fire Protection Agency recommend installing what are called combination alarms, which are alarms that either detect both heat and smoke or use both the ionization and photoelectric processes. Some combination alarms may include a carbon monoxide detection capability.\n\nThe type and sensitivity of light source and photoelectric sensor and type of smoke chamber differ between manufacturers.\n\n=== Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide detection ===\n[[Carbon monoxide sensor]]s detect potentially fatal concentrations of [[carbon monoxide]] gas, which may build up due to faulty ventilation where there are combustion appliances such as gas heaters and cookers, although there is no uncontrolled fire outside the appliance.<ref>{{cite web | last = New York City Fire Department | title = Carbon monoxide alarms | url = http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/safety/fire_safety_education/2010_02/08_smoke_and_carbon_monoxide_alarms_english.pdf | accessdate = 2012-05-28 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120131024146/http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/safety/fire_safety_education/2010_02/08_smoke_and_carbon_monoxide_alarms_english.pdf | archivedate = 2012-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nHigh levels of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) may indicate a fire, and can be detected by a [[carbon dioxide sensor]].

All smoke detectors must be hooked directly to the [[electrical wiring]], be interconnected and have a [[battery backup]]. In addition, smoke detectors are required either inside or outside every [[bedroom]], depending on local codes. Smoke detectors on the outside will detect fires more quickly, assuming the fire does not begin in the bedroom, but the sound of the alarm will be reduced and may not wake some people.

Commercial security devices issue a signal to a [[fire alarm control panel]] as part of a [[fire alarm system]], while household smoke detectors, also known as '''smoke alarms''', generally issue a local audible or visual [[alarm]] from the detector itself or several detectors if there are multiple smoke detectors interlinked.\n\nSmoke detectors are housed in plastic  enclosures, smoke detectors are typically shaped like a disk or square about {{convert|150|mm|in|0}} in diameter and {{convert|25|mm|in|0}} thick, but shape and size vary. Smoke can be detected either  optically ([[Photodiode|photoelectric]]) or by physical process ([[ionization]]); detectors may use either, or both, methods. Sensitive alarms can be used to detect, and thus deter, smoking in areas where it is banned. Smoke detectors in large commercial, industrial, and residential buildings are usually powered by a central fire alarm system, which is powered by the building power with a battery backup. Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units, to several interlinked mains-powered units with battery backup; with these interlinked units, if any unit detects smoke, all trigger even if household power has gone out.\n\nThe risk of dying in a home fire is cut by 1/4th in homes with working smoke alarms. The US National Fire Protection Association reports 0.53 deaths per 100 fires in homes with working smoke alarms compared to 1.18 deaths without (2009\u20132013). Some homes do not have any smoke alarms, some alarms do not have working batteries; sometimes the alarm fails to detect the fire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfpa.org/news-and-research/fire-statistics-and-reports/fire-statistics/fire-safety-equipment/smoke-alarms-in-us-home-fires |title=Smoke Alarms in U.S. Home Fires |website=nfpa.org |date=September 2015 |accessdate=2017-07-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729010219/http://www.nfpa.org/news-and-research/fire-statistics-and-reports/fire-statistics/fire-safety-equipment/smoke-alarms-in-us-home-fires |archivedate=2017-07-29 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe first automatic electric fire alarm was patented in 1890 by [[Francis Robbins Upton]],<ref>{{Cite patent|country=US|number=436961|inventor=[[Francis Robbins Upton]]}}</ref> an associate of [[Thomas Edison]].<ref name=\"party1\">{{cite news |title= Birthday Party to Edison; Men Associated with Him in the Early 80s Organize the Pioneers |url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1918/02/03/102977088.pdf |quote=Francis R.

Ionization detectors are more sensitive to the flaming stage of fires than optical detectors, while optical detectors are more sensitive to fires in the early smouldering stage.<ref name=\"ionizaton\">Fleming, Jay.

The radioactive source emits [[alpha particle]]s into both chambers, which [[ionizes]] some air [[molecule]]s. There is a [[potential difference]] (voltage) between pairs of [[electrode]]s in the chambers; the [[electrical charge]] on the [[ion]]s allows an [[electric current]] to flow. The currents in both chambers should be the same as they are equally affected by air pressure, temperature, and the ageing of the source. If any smoke particles enter the open chamber, some of the ions will attach to the particles and not be available to carry the current in that chamber. An electronic circuit detects that a current difference has developed between the open and sealed chambers, and sounds the alarm.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cote|first1=Arthur|last2=Bugbee|first2=Percy|title=Principles of fire protection|year=1988|publisher=National Fire Protection Association|location=Quincy, MA|isbn=0-87765-345-3|page=249|chapter=Ionization smoke detectors}}</ref> The circuitry also monitors the battery used to supply or back up power, and sounds an intermittent warning when it nears exhaustion. A user-operated test button simulates an imbalance between the ionization chambers, and sounds the alarm if and only if power supply, electronics, and alarm device are functional. The current drawn by an ionization smoke detector is low enough for a small battery used as sole or backup power supply to be able to provide power for months or years without the need for external wiring.\n\nIonization smoke detectors are usually cheaper to manufacture than optical detectors.

In spot-type detectors, all of these components are arranged inside a chamber where air, which may contain smoke from a nearby fire, flows. In large open areas such as atria and auditoriums, [[optical beam smoke detector|optical beam]] or projected-beam smoke detectors are used instead of a chamber within the unit: a wall-mounted unit emits a beam of infrared or ultraviolet light which is either received and processed by a separate device or reflected to the receiver by a reflector. In some types, particularly optical beam types, the light emitted by the light source passes through the air being tested and reaches the photosensor. The received [[Radiative transfer|light intensity will be reduced]] due to [[scattering]] from particulates of smoke, air-borne dust, or other substances; the circuitry detects the light intensity and generates the alarm if it is below a specified threshold, potentially due to smoke.<ref name=\"AirflowPatterns\" /> In other types, typically chamber types, the light is not directed at the sensor, which is not illuminated in the absence of particles. If the air in the chamber contains particles (smoke or dust), the light is [[scattering|scattered]] and some of it reaches the sensor, triggering the alarm.<ref name=\"AirflowPatterns\" />\n\nAccording to the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA), \"photoelectric smoke detection is generally more responsive to fires that begin with a long period of smoldering\". Studies by Texas A&M and the NFPA cited by the City of Palo Alto, California state, \"Photoelectric alarms react slower to rapidly growing fires than ionization alarms, but laboratory and field tests have shown that photoelectric smoke alarms provide adequate warning for all types of fires and have been shown to be far less likely to be deactivated by occupants.\"\n\nAlthough photoelectric alarms are highly effective at detecting smoldering fires and do provide adequate protection from flaming fires, fire safety experts and the National Fire Protection Agency recommend installing what are called combination alarms, which are alarms that either detect both heat and smoke or use both the ionization and photoelectric processes. Some combination alarms may include a carbon monoxide detection capability.\n\nThe type and sensitivity of light source and photoelectric sensor and type of smoke chamber differ between manufacturers.\n\n=== Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide detection ===\n[[Carbon monoxide sensor]]s detect potentially fatal concentrations of [[carbon monoxide]] gas, which may build up due to faulty ventilation where there are combustion appliances such as gas heaters and cookers, although there is no uncontrolled fire outside the appliance.<ref>{{cite web | last = New York City Fire Department | title = Carbon monoxide alarms | url = http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/safety/fire_safety_education/2010_02/08_smoke_and_carbon_monoxide_alarms_english.pdf | accessdate = 2012-05-28 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120131024146/http://www.nyc.gov/html/fdny/pdf/safety/fire_safety_education/2010_02/08_smoke_and_carbon_monoxide_alarms_english.pdf | archivedate = 2012-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nHigh levels of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) may indicate a fire, and can be detected by a [[carbon dioxide sensor]]. Such sensors are often used to measure levels of CO<sub>2</sub> which may be undesirable but not indicative of a fire; this type of sensor can also be used to detect and warn of the much higher levels generated by a fire. One manufacturer says that detectors based on CO<sub>2</sub> levels are the fastest fire indicators, and also, unlike ionization and optical detectors, detect fires that do not generate smoke, such as those fuelled by alcohol or gasoline. CO<sub>2</sub> fire detectors are not susceptible to false alarms due to particles, making them particularly suitable for use in dusty and dirty environments.<ref name=\"senseair\">{{cite web|url=http://senseair.senseair.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/carbon_dioxide.pdf|title=Carbon Dioxide - Life and Death|publisher=senseair.se|page=4|accessdate=2018-12-21}}<!--archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522011323/http://senseair.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/carbon_dioxide.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-22}}--></ref>\n\n=== Performance differences ===\nA presentation by Siemens and the Canadian Fire Alarm Association reports the ionization detector as best at detecting incipient-stage fires with invisibly small particles, fast-flaming fires with smaller 0.01-0.4 [[micron]] particles, and dark or black smoke, while more modern photoelectric detectors are best at detecting slow-smouldering fires with larger 0.4\u201310.0 micron particles, and light-coloured white/grey smoke.<ref name=siemens/>\n\nPhotoelectric smoke detectors respond faster to fire in its early, smouldering stage (before it breaks into flame).

Wireless smoke and carbon monoxide detectors linked to alert mechanisms such as vibrating pillow pads for the hearing impaired, strobes, and remote warning handsets are more effective at waking people with serious hearing loss than other alarms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hearinglossweb.com/tech/alrt/smoke/low.htm|title=All about Hearing Loss|website=www.hearinglossweb.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618073004/http://www.hearinglossweb.com/tech/alrt/smoke/low.htm|archivedate=18 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Batteries ===\nBatteries are used either as sole or as backup power for residential smoke detectors. Mains-operated detectors have disposable or rechargeable batteries; others run only on 9-volt disposable batteries. When the battery is exhausted a battery-only smoke detector becomes inactive; most smoke detectors chirp repeatedly if the battery is low. It has been found that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated{{When|date=January 2016}} that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have dead or removed batteries. In response public information campaigns have been created to remind people to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on [[April Fools' Day]] every year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beacham|first=Janine|title=Don't be a fool: change alarm batteries|url=http://www.margaretrivermail.com.au/news/local/news/general/dont-be-a-fool-shange-alarm-batteries/2119255.aspx|publisher=Augusta Margaret River Mail|accessdate=19 April 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403140053/http://www.margaretrivermail.com.au/news/local/news/general/dont-be-a-fool-shange-alarm-batteries/2119255.aspx|archivedate=3 April 2011}}</ref> In regions using [[daylight saving time]], campaigns may suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clocks or on a birthday.\n\nSome mains-powered detectors are fitted with a non-rechargeable [[lithium battery]] for backup with a life of typically ten years, after which it is recommended that the detector be replaced. User-replaceable disposable [[Nine-volt battery#Lithium 9V/PP3|9-volt lithium batteries]], which last at least twice as long as alkaline batteries are available.\n\nThe US [[National Fire Protection Association]] recommends that home-owners replace smoke detector batteries with a new battery at least once per year, when it starts chirping (a signal that the battery is low), or when it fails a test, which the NFPA recommends to be carried out at least once per month by pressing the \"test\" button on the alarm.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=1647&itemID=39905&URL=Research%20&%20Reports/Fact%20sheets/Smoke%20alarms/Smoke%20alarm%20safety%20tips&cookie_test=1\n |title       = SMOKE ALARM SAFETY TIPS\n |publisher   = National Fire Protection Association\n |work        = Safety Information.\n |accessdate  = 2009-05-17\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090821222032/http://www.nfpa.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=1647&itemID=39905&URL=Research%20&%20Reports%2FFact%20sheets%2FSmoke%20alarms%2FSmoke%20alarm%20safety%20tips&cookie_test=1\n |archivedate = 2009-08-21\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Reliability ===\nA 2004 [[NIST]] report concluded that \"Smoke alarms of either the ionization type or the photoelectric type consistently provided time for occupants to escape from most residential fires,\" and, \"Consistent with prior findings, ionization type alarms provided somewhat better response to flaming fires than photoelectric alarms (57 to 62 seconds faster response), and photoelectric alarms provided (often) considerably faster response to smoldering fires than ionization type alarms (47 to 53 minutes faster response).\"<ref name=\"NIST\" />\n\nRegular cleaning can prevent false alarms caused by the build-up of dust and insects, particularly on optical type alarms as they are more susceptible to these factors. A vacuum cleaner can be used to clean domestic smoke detectors to remove detrimental dust.

However, some rules and guidelines for existing homes are relatively consistent throughout the developed world. For example, Canada and Australia require a building to have a working smoke detector on every level. The United States NFPA code cited in the previous paragraph requires smoke detectors on every habitable level and within the vicinity of all bedrooms. Habitable levels include attics that are tall enough to allow access.<ref name=nfpa72/> Many other countries have comparable requirements.\n\nIn new construction, minimum requirements are typically more stringent. All smoke detectors must be hooked directly to the [[electrical wiring]], be interconnected and have a [[battery backup]]. In addition, smoke detectors are required either inside or outside every [[bedroom]], depending on local codes. Smoke detectors on the outside will detect fires more quickly, assuming the fire does not begin in the bedroom, but the sound of the alarm will be reduced and may not wake some people. Some areas also require smoke detectors in [[stairway]]s, main [[hallway]]s and [[garage (house)|garages]].<ref name=\"rcahw\">{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Gregory|date=18 May 2011|title=Residential Construction Academy: House Wiring|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugOkSeJlfisC&dq=placing+smoke+detectors&source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher=Technology & Engineering|isbn=978-1111306212|accessdate=24 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508184806/https://books.google.com/books?id=ugOkSeJlfisC&dq=placing+smoke+detectors&source=gbs_navlinks_s|archivedate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nA dozen or more detectors may be connected via wiring or wirelessly such that if one detects smoke, the alarms will sound on all the detectors in the network, improving the likelihood that occupants will be alerted even if smoke is detected far from their location. Wired interconnection are more practical in new construction than for existing buildings.\n\nIn the UK the installation of smoke alarms in new builds must comply with British Standard BS5839 pt6. BS 5839: Pt.6: 2004 recommends that a new-build property consisting of no more than 3 floors (less than 200 square metres per floor) should be fitted with a Grade D, LD2 system. Building Regulations in England, Wales and Scotland recommend that BS 5839: Pt.6 should be followed, but as a minimum a Grade D, LD3 system should be installed. Building Regulations in Northern Ireland require a Grade D, LD2 system to be installed, with smoke alarms fitted in the escape routes and the main living room and a heat alarm in the kitchen; this standard also requires all detectors to have a mains supply and a battery back up.<ref>{{cite act|title=BS 5839-6:2013 Fire detection and fire alarm systems for buildings - Code of practice for the design, installation, commissioning and maintenance of fire detection and fire alarm systems in domestic premises|number=5839-6|language=en-GB|year=2013|url=http://www.safelincs.co.uk/pages/bs5839-6.html|accessdate=24 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202161054/http://www.safelincs.co.uk/pages/bs5839-6.html|archivedate=2 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Standards ==\n\n=== EN54 European standards ===\nFire detection products have the European Standard ''[[EN 54]] Fire Detection and Fire Alarm Systems'' that is a mandatory standard for every product that is going to be delivered and installed in any country in the European Union (EU).

[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]\u2019s maternal grandfather [[Mizuno Tadamasa]] rebuilt [[Kariya Castle]] in the mid-16th century.  The Mizuno clan shifted allegiances adroitly between the [[Imagawa clan]] to [[Oda Nobunaga]] and to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], who relocated the clan to [[Ise Province]]. However, [[Mizuno Katsunari]], the grandson of Tadamasa was allowed to return to the clan's ancestral territories by Ieyasu after the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] as ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of [[Kariya Domain]], a [[han system|feudal han]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. The domain was reassigned to numerous clans during the [[Edo period]], but was retained by the [[Doi clan]] from 1734 until the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Kariya Town was created within [[Hekikai District, Aichi|Hekikai District]], Aichi Prefecture with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on October 1, 1889. The town prospered as a center for commerce, [[sake]] production, [[sericulture]] and ceramics due to its location on the main railway routes. The [[Yosami Transmitting Station]], located in Kariya, was Japan's tallest structure when completed in 1929. Kariya achieved city status on April 1, 1950. The city expanded by annexation of neighboring Fujimatsu and most of Yosami villages on April 1, 1955. Control of the Yosami Transmitting Station was returned to Japan from the [[United States Navy]] in 1994, and the former facility is now a city park.\n\n==Government==\nKariya has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 28 members. The city contributes two members to the Aichi Prefectural Assembly.  In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aichi District 13 of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Kariya is dominated by companies related to the [[Toyota Group]], including [[Toyota Industries Corporation]], [[Aisin Seiki]] and [[Denso Corporation]]. Toyota Motor Corporation started as a division of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works (now called Toyota Industries Corporation). The Toyoda Automatic Loom Works was highly profitable and board members reinvested much of the profits into the growing automobile manufacturing business.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Aichi University of Education auditorium ac.JPG|thumb|180px|right|[[Aichi University of Education]]]]\n;University and Colleges\n*[[Aichi University of Education]]\n;Schools\n*Kariya has 15 public elementary schools and six public junior high schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Aichi Prefectural Board of Education.

[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]\u2019s maternal grandfather [[Mizuno Tadamasa]] rebuilt [[Kariya Castle]] in the mid-16th century.  The Mizuno clan shifted allegiances adroitly between the [[Imagawa clan]] to [[Oda Nobunaga]] and to [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], who relocated the clan to [[Ise Province]]. However, [[Mizuno Katsunari]], the grandson of Tadamasa was allowed to return to the clan\u2019s ancestral territories by Ieyasu after the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] as ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of [[Kariya Domain]], a [[han system|feudal han]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. The domain was reassigned to numerous clans during the [[Edo period]], but was retained by the [[Doi clan]] from 1734 until the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Kariya Town was created within [[Hekikai District, Aichi|Hekikai District]], Aichi Prefecture with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on October 1, 1889. The town prospered as a center for commerce, [[sake]] production, [[sericulture]] and ceramics due to its location on the main railway routes. The [[Yosami Transmitting Station]], located in Kariya, was Japan's tallest structure when completed in 1929. Kariya achieved city status on April 1, 1950. The city expanded by annexation of neighboring Fujimatsu and most of Yosami villages on April 1, 1955. Control of the Yosami Transmitting Station was returned to Japan from the [[United States Navy]] in 1994, and the former facility is now a city park.\n\n==Government==\nKariya has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 28 members. The city contributes two members to the Aichi Prefectural Assembly.  In terms of national politics, the city is part of Aichi District 13 of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Kariya is dominated by companies related to the [[Toyota Group]], including [[Toyota Industries Corporation]], [[Aisin Seiki]] and [[Denso Corporation]]. Toyota Motor Corporation started as a division of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works (now called Toyota Industries Corporation). The Toyoda Automatic Loom Works was highly profitable and board members reinvested much of the profits into the growing automobile manufacturing business.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Aichi University of Education auditorium ac.JPG|thumb|180px|right|[[Aichi University of Education]]]]\n;University and Colleges\n*[[Aichi University of Education]]\n;Schools\n*Kariya has 15 public elementary schools and six public junior high schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Aichi Prefectural Board of Education.

These basic 46&nbsp;MW units are designed to be scaled up to fit specific power requirements.  In the molten salt configuration, 10 modules may be aggregated to build a 100MW, 50% capacity factor solar power plant.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Plants of various electric output and capacity factor may be assembled through use or varying numbers of molten salt modules.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Sierra SunTower==\n[[File:Sierra SunTower Power Plant.jpg|thumb|300px|The Sierra SunTower power plant in Lancaster, California.]]\n{{main|Sierra SunTower}}\nIn the summer of 2009, eSolar unveiled the 5 MW Sierra SunTower plant, a commercial facility in [[Lancaster, California]] that demonstrated the company's technology.  Sierra SunTower is interconnected to the [[Southern California Edison]] (SCE) grid and, in spring 2010, is was the only commercial CSP tower facility in North America.  As of mid-August, 2018, the two towers that were the center of the facility are no longer standing.  The plant, however, is still present.\n\nSierra SunTower included two eSolar modules. 24,000 heliostats, divided between four sub-fields, tracked the sun and focussed its energy onto two tower-mounted receivers.  The focused heat converted feedwater piped to the receivers into [[superheated steam]] that drove a reconditioned 1947 [[GE]] turbine generator to produce electricity. The steam passed through a steam condenser, reverted to water through cooling, and the process repeated.\n\nDuring the 12 months of construction, [[Sierra SunTower]] created over 300 temporary jobs. In operation, the site employed 21 permanent employees.\n\nSierra Suntower was certified by the [[California Energy Commission]] as a renewable energy facility. Power from the facility is sold under a [[Power Purchase Agreement]] (PPA) with SCE, providing  renewable energy for up to 4,000 homes.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe 5 MW output from [[Sierra SunTower]] reduced {{CO2}} emissions by 7,000 tons per year, an amount equivalent to planting {{convert|5265|acre|km2}} of trees, removing 1,368 automobiles from the road, or saving 650,000 gallons of gasoline.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nHowever, in 2015, the Sierra SunTower was shut down for commercial operation, as it was deemed to be too costly to operate except on the sunniest of days. Thus, it served to show the real-world problems, and unpredictable nature, of concentrated solar power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guntherportfolio.com/2013/04/esolar-sierra-suntower-a-history-of-concentrating-solar-power-underperformance/|title=eSolar Sierra SunTower: a History of Concentrating Solar Power Underperformance \u2013 GUNTHER Portfolio|website=Guntherportfolio.com}}</ref>\n\n==Performance Data from US Treasury Dept.- Performance Report and Certification Form==\n\nThe eSolar Sierra SunTower generated 539 MWh (MegaWatt-hour) of electricity from August 1, 2010, to July 31, 2011.

With the support from the U. S. Department of Energy, the companies try to come up with a design for plants with flexibility of the sizes from 50 to 200 MW by replicating the basic module without a redesign. Each module uses hexagonal heliostat field to reflect sunlight to the salt-in-tube external thermal receiver on top of the tower at the center. With many modules working together, the receivers heat the 285&nbsp;\u00b0C cold salt input and return 565&nbsp;\u00b0C hot salt to centrally located storage. The hot salt will then be used in the generator system to generate electricity.

The company was founded by the [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]-based business incubator [[Idealab]] in 2007 as a developer of CSP plant technology. The company aims to develop a low cost alternative to [[fossil fuel]]s through a combination of small [[heliostat]]s, modular architecture, and a high-precision sun-tracking system. In October 2017, an article in GreenTech Media suggested that eSolar ceased business in late 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/concentrated-solar-contender-esolar-goes-awol | title = Concentrated Solar Power Contender ESolar Goes AWOL | date = 12 October 2017 | accessdate = 13 June 2019 | last = Deign | first = Jason | work = GreenTech Media}}</ref> It was succeeded by [[Heliogen]]\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Heliostat design===\neSolar has designed heliostats that are smaller than the industry norm, allowing for pre-fabrication, mass-manufacturing, and easy installation, thereby reducing production and installation costs.  eSolar announced a new heliostat design, referred to as SCS5, during the 2013 SolarPACES Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada.  SCS5 offers a more simplified design and enhanced reliability to reduce total installed solar collector system cost by more than a third.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnovus.com/solarpaces-2013-esolar-debuts-heliostat-molten-salt-plant-design_N7008.html|title=SolarPACES 2013: eSolar debuts heliostat, molten salt plant design \u2013 Solar Novus Today|website=www.solarnovus.com}}</ref>\n\n===Sun-tracking software===\neSolar has developed a sun-tracking control system that is able to calibrate heliostats and monitor the performance of each heliostat within the field.

In the direct-steam configuration, the concentrated solar energy boils water in the receiver to produce steam. The steam is piped to a [[steam turbine]] generator, which converts the energy to electricity. The steam out of the turbine is condensed and pressurized back into the receiver.

In the molten salt configuration, 10 modules may be aggregated to build a 100MW, 50% capacity factor solar power plant.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  Plants of various electric output and capacity factor may be assembled through use or varying numbers of molten salt modules.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Sierra SunTower==\n[[File:Sierra SunTower Power Plant.jpg|thumb|300px|The Sierra SunTower power plant in Lancaster, California.]]\n{{main|Sierra SunTower}}\nIn the summer of 2009, eSolar unveiled the 5 MW Sierra SunTower plant, a commercial facility in [[Lancaster, California]] that demonstrated the company's technology.  Sierra SunTower is interconnected to the [[Southern California Edison]] (SCE) grid and, in spring 2010, is was the only commercial CSP tower facility in North America.  As of mid-August, 2018, the two towers that were the center of the facility are no longer standing.  The plant, however, is still present.\n\nSierra SunTower included two eSolar modules. 24,000 heliostats, divided between four sub-fields, tracked the sun and focussed its energy onto two tower-mounted receivers.  The focused heat converted feedwater piped to the receivers into [[superheated steam]] that drove a reconditioned 1947 [[GE]] turbine generator to produce electricity. The steam passed through a steam condenser, reverted to water through cooling, and the process repeated.\n\nDuring the 12 months of construction, [[Sierra SunTower]] created over 300 temporary jobs. In operation, the site employed 21 permanent employees.\n\nSierra Suntower was certified by the [[California Energy Commission]] as a renewable energy facility. Power from the facility is sold under a [[Power Purchase Agreement]] (PPA) with SCE, providing  renewable energy for up to 4,000 homes.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe 5 MW output from [[Sierra SunTower]] reduced {{CO2}} emissions by 7,000 tons per year, an amount equivalent to planting {{convert|5265|acre|km2}} of trees, removing 1,368 automobiles from the road, or saving 650,000 gallons of gasoline.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nHowever, in 2015, the Sierra SunTower was shut down for commercial operation, as it was deemed to be too costly to operate except on the sunniest of days. Thus, it served to show the real-world problems, and unpredictable nature, of concentrated solar power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guntherportfolio.com/2013/04/esolar-sierra-suntower-a-history-of-concentrating-solar-power-underperformance/|title=eSolar Sierra SunTower: a History of Concentrating Solar Power Underperformance \u2013 GUNTHER Portfolio|website=Guntherportfolio.com}}</ref>\n\n==Performance Data from US Treasury Dept.- Performance Report and Certification Form==\n\nThe eSolar Sierra SunTower generated 539 MWh (MegaWatt-hour) of electricity from August 1, 2010, to July 31, 2011.

With the support from the U. S. Department of Energy, the companies try to come up with a design for plants with flexibility of the sizes from 50 to 200 MW by replicating the basic module without a redesign. Each module uses hexagonal heliostat field to reflect sunlight to the salt-in-tube external thermal receiver on top of the tower at the center. With many modules working together, the receivers heat the 285&nbsp;\u00b0C cold salt input and return 565&nbsp;\u00b0C hot salt to centrally located storage. The hot salt will then be used in the generator system to generate electricity. The new system incorporates the experience from the Sierra SunTower which uses a Babcock & Wilcox's water-based receiver, and the finding from the [[The Solar Project#Solar Two|Solar Two]] project.<ref>{{cite web|title=eSolar's Modular and Scalable Baseload Molten Salt Plant Design and Feasibility Project|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy13osti/58484.pdf|work=SunShot Concentrating Solar Power Program Review 2013|publisher=SunShot Initiative, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Partnerships==\n\n===NRG===\n[[NRG Energy, Inc.]] partnered with eSolar in February 2009 to develop solar power plants with a total generation capacity of up to 500 MW at sites within California and across the Southwestern United States.

It is part of the ''Chhagaam Gol'' (\"Circle of Six Villages\").\n\n[[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], one of India's greatest leaders in the [[Indian Independence Movement]] grew up in Karamsad. It was also the home of his elder brother [[Vithalbhai Patel]], who was also an important political leader. The Patel brothers lived with their two elder brothers and one younger brother and sister, and parents Jhaverbhai and Ladba Patel in a mud-brick house adjacent to his family's farm holdings. This house is preserved to date as a memorial to Patel.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe date of establishment of Karamsad is not exactly known, but during the era of Kumarpal i.e., in 1155 AD, the village consisted mainly of people from [[Koli language|Koli]] tribes. This community mostly rely on agricultural skills. \n\nIn 1211, Aja Patel, originally from Hilod (a town near Adalaj), came over and settled here. Because of his skills, agricultural production increased and the village prospered.\n\nThe details henceforth from Aja Patel to Kupa Patel are not available, however Kupa Patel was from the twelfth or fourteenth generation of Aja Patel. Kupa Patel was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva. He renovated Lord Shiva's temple, which was in ruins and situated in the western side of the village. That was well built by his son Lakha Patel. He had also helped build a lake in the village.\n\nDevidas, a few generations down had two sons. Jibhai and Bajibhai. His sons asked the Moghul Governor of Ahmedabad Province to let them keep Karamsad for revenue collection. Of them, Majibhai's four sons and their descendants distributed themselves in six different Khadkis (street or lane before a group of two or more houses with a common gate) in Karamsad.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sardar Patel Historical School Design Karamsad.jpg|thumb|400px|right|SARDAR PATEL'S HISTORICAL PRIMARY SCHOOL - KARAMSAD]] -->\n\n[[File:Sardar Patel Memorial Karamsad.JPG|thumb|400px|Sardar Patel Memorial at Karamsad]]\n\nSix different Khadkis were formed in Karamsad after the six descendants of Mahijibhai. \n# Bhayni Khadki (Gokaldas)\n# Bapani Khadki (Govendas)\n# Hathibhaini Khadki (Sunderdas)\n# Motabhaini Khadki (Jivabhai)\n# Jini Khadki (Bhavijibhai)\n# Chhatthi Khadki (Laljibhai)\n\nAnother popular story goes like this - the original owner of the village was a Rajput. Mahijibhai Patel of the Uvarsad village, near Ahmedabad came and settled here. The Rajput community of the village did not like the arrival of Mahijibhai. They killed two of his six sons. Both of his brothers had actually gone to the Petlad court, where a case was filed against the Rajput community by Mahijibhai's sons. On their way back, they were killed by the Rajputs near Sandesar, where afterwards memorial pillars were built in their name. Today there are hardly any Rajputs in Karamsad. After the Patidars occupied most of the land in Karamsad, the Rajputs left and settled in Napa village.\n\nThe original Patidars of Karamsad were physically very strong. They were known for their endurance and their ability to bear torture. One of Mahijibhai's sons suffered from a carbuncle. (A carbuncle is when a particular part of the body becomes gangrenous). During that time, antibiotics were not available, so the only way to treat it was to cauterize that part. The local method at that time was by heating an iron rod and applying it over the affected part instantly. During this, the person would lose all his calm and nerves. At that time, this procedure would involve 3-4 people tightly holding the patient. One of the Rajput in Napa village was known to do this procedure. However that son was brave, so when Mahjibhai's son was taken over there he said, \"Nobody should hold me. I do not need any support. Nothing is going to happen to me.\"\n\nThe Rajput performing this procedure had kept the old rivalry between them in mind. So he overheated the iron rod and put it over the affected part with great vengeance. Mahijibhai's son bore it without uttering a single word. When the Rajput praised him for his enduring power, Mahijibhai's son said, \"Do not praise me. I am nothing in comparison to my other brothers. Their endurance power is a lot greater than mine.\"\n\nAfter this incident, the Rajput community in Napa village came to know about the strength of the Patidar community and they stopped creating trouble in and around Karamsad. When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was staying at Nadiad, which was his maternal native, he had suffered from Bubo (an inflammatory swelling of a lymph gland) of the armpit. He had it cauterized without uttering a single word. After all he was also from Karamsad.\n\nDuring the making of Vallabh Vidyanagar, had the Patidars of Karamsad not donated generously, then Vidyanagar would not have looked like what it looks today.\n\nKaramsad has been quite under the influence of Swaminarayan Sect and Santram Temple for a long time. Both these sects do a lot of activities in Karamsad. Karamsad has always remained way ahead, be it in politics, education, religion, cooperative activities or industries in the Kheda District. The Patidars of Karamsad are well known in the social community of Chha Gam (six villages). The yesterday's generation of Patidars have proved best themselves in different fields in Africa, Fiji, Myanmar (Burma), etc. the first two Patidars to reach East Africa in 1895 AD. were Maganbhai Naranbhai and Ishwarbhai Nathabhai Patel. Today the Patidars of Karamsad are spread out in England, Canada, America and Australia.\n\nSantram Temple in Karamsad is famous for its Convention Hall / Banquet Hall. The temple also provides health services to the people at a very nominal charge. It also runs coaching classes for students. After being coached in these classes many students have been accepted into various engineering and medical colleges. A temple of Goddess Khodiyar \u2013 the presiding deity of Patidars has been recently built. It is also has various facilities and a big banquet hall, which can be used for marriage ceremonies. There are very few Digambar Jain Temples in the whole of Gujarat, but still there is a temple (Derasar) in Karamsad. Moreover, there are a Swaminarayan Temple, Bapeshwar Mahadev, Catholic mission, and a mosque.\n\nKaramsad is situated at 22 North latitude and 72 East longitude. It has a population of 14,000 people and has water works also, but in the past, people used to get water from  Kharo Kuvo, Lakhvo Kuvo, Rabari No Kuvo, Moto Kuvo and other wells.\n\n==Sardar Patel Biography==\n[[File:Sardar patel (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]]]]\nSardar Patel belonged to a [[Gurjar]] family of [[Gujarat]]. '''[[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]]''' was popularly known as '''Iron Man of India'''. His full name was Vallabhbhai Patel. He played a leading role in the Indian freedom struggle and became the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India. He is credited with achieving political integration of India.\n\nPatel was born on 31 October 1875 in Nadiad, a City in Gujarat. His father Jhaverbhai was a farmer and mother Laad Bai was a simple lady. Sardar Vallabhbhai's early education took place in '''Karamsad'''. Then he joined a school in Petlad. After two years he joined a high school in Nadiad. He passed his high school examination in 1896.\n\nVallabhbhai wanted to become a barrister. To realize this ambition he had to go to England. But he did not have the financial means to even join a college in India. In those days a candidate could study in private and sit for an examination in Law. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel borrowed books from a lawyer of his acquaintance and studied at home. Occasionally he attended courts of law and listened attentively to the arguments of lawyer. Vallabhbhai passed the Law examination.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel started his Law practice in Godhra. Soon his practice flourished. He married Jhaberaba. In 1904, he had a baby daughter [[Maniben Patel]], and in 1905 his son Dahyabhai was born. Vallabhbhai sent his elder brother Vitthalbhai, who himself was a lawyer, to England for higher studies in Law. Patel was only thirty-three years old when his wife died. He did not wish to marry again. After his brother's return, Vallabhbhai went to England. He studied with single-minded devotion and stood first in the Barrister-at-Law Examination.\n\nSardar Patel returned to India in 1913 and started his practice in Ahmedabad. Soon he became popular. At the urging of his friends, Patel contested and won elections to become the sanitation commissioner of Ahmedabad in 1917. Sardar Patel was deeply impressed by Gandhiji's success in Champaran Satyagraha. In 1918, there was a drought in the Kheda division of Gujarat. Peasants asked for relief from the high rate of taxes but the British government refused. Gandhiji took up peasants cause but could not devote his full-time in Kheda. He was looking for someone who could lead the struggle in his absence. At this point Sardar Patel volunteered to come forward and lead the struggle. He gave up his lucrative legal practice and entered public life.\n\nVallabhbhai successfully led peasants revolt in Kheda and the revolt ended in 1919 when the British government agreed to suspend collection of revenue and roll back the rates. Kheda Satyagraha turned Vallabhbhai Patel into a national hero. Vallabhbhai supported Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement, and as president of the Gujarat Congress, helped in organizing bonfires of British goods in Ahmedabad. He gave up his English clothes and started wearing Khadi. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Ahmedabad's municipal president in 1922, 1924 and 1927. During his terms, Ahmedabad was extended a major supply of electricity and underwent major education reforms. Drainage and sanitation systems were extended over all the city.\n\nIn 1928, Bardoli Taluka in Gujarat suffered from famine. In this hour of distress the British government raised the revenue taxes by thirty percent. Sardar Patel took up cudgels on behalf of the farmers and appealed to the Governor to reduce the taxes. The Governor refused and the government even announced the date of the collection of the taxes. Sardar Patel organized the farmers and told them not to pay even a single pie of tax. The government tried to repress the revolt but ultimately bowed before Vallabhbhai Patel. It was during the struggle and after the victory in Bardoli that caused intense excitement across India, that Patel was increasingly addressed by his colleagues and followers as Sardar.\n\nSardar Patel was imprisoned during Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930. After the signing of Gandhi-Irwin pact in 1931, Sardar Patel was released and he was elected Congress president for its 1931 session in Karachi. Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London, Gandhiji and Sardar Patel were arrested in January 1932 and imprisoned in the [[Yerwada Central Jail]]. During this term of imprisonment, Sardar Patel and Mahatma Gandhi grew close to one another, and the two developed a close bond of affection, trust, and frankness without reserve. Sardar Patel was finally released in July 1934.\n\nIn August 1942, the Congress launched the Quit India Movement. The government jailed all the important leaders of the Congress, including Vallabhbhai Patel. All the leaders were released after three years. After achieving independence on 15 August 1947, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of independent India and Sardar Patel became the Deputy Prime Minister. He was in charge of Home Affairs, Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of States.\n\nThere were 565 princely states in India at that time. Some of the Maharajas and Nawabs were dreaming of becoming independent rulers once the British quit India. They argued that the government of free India should treat them as equals. Some of them went to the extent of planning to send their representatives to the United Nations Organization.\n\nPatel invoked the patriotism of India's monarchs, asking them to join in the freedom of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people. He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic, especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects. With political foresight, he consolidated the small kingdoms. The entire nation was with him. He tackled the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and the [[Nawab of Junagarh]] who initially did not want to join India.\n\nSardar Patel's efforts brought success, uniting a scattered nation without much bloodshed. He was nicknamed \n''' 'Iron Man' '''\n. Sardar Patel died of cardiac arrest on 15 December 1950. For his services to the nation Sardar Patel was conferred with [[Bharat Ratna]] posthumously in 1991.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vithalbhai Patel]] - elder brother\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sardarpateltrust.org]\n*[http://www.answers.com/topic/sardar-vallabhbhai-patel]\n*[http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/sardar-patel.html]\n'''FACEBOOK''' https://www.facebook.com/svphistoricalschool\n'''Facebook'''https://www.facebook.com/pages/Karamsad-patels-community/136689673073408\n\n==Geography==\nKaramsad is located at {{coord|22.55|N|72.9|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/9/Karamsad.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Karamsad]</ref> It has an average elevation of 35&nbsp;metres (114&nbsp;feet).\n\n'''Karamsad Weather'''.http://weather.weatherbug.com/India/Karamsad-weather.html?zcode=z5602.

Of them, Majibhai's four sons and their descendants distributed themselves in six different Khadkis (street or lane before a group of two or more houses with a common gate) in Karamsad.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sardar Patel Historical School Design Karamsad.jpg|thumb|400px|right|SARDAR PATEL'S HISTORICAL PRIMARY SCHOOL - KARAMSAD]] -->\n\n[[File:Sardar Patel Memorial Karamsad.JPG|thumb|400px|Sardar Patel Memorial at Karamsad]]\n\nSix different Khadkis were formed in Karamsad after the six descendants of Mahijibhai. \n# Bhayni Khadki (Gokaldas)\n# Bapani Khadki (Govendas)\n# Hathibhaini Khadki (Sunderdas)\n# Motabhaini Khadki (Jivabhai)\n# Jini Khadki (Bhavijibhai)\n# Chhatthi Khadki (Laljibhai)\n\nAnother popular story goes like this - the original owner of the village was a Rajput. Mahijibhai Patel of the Uvarsad village, near Ahmedabad came and settled here. The Rajput community of the village did not like the arrival of Mahijibhai. They killed two of his six sons. Both of his brothers had actually gone to the Petlad court, where a case was filed against the Rajput community by Mahijibhai's sons. On their way back, they were killed by the Rajputs near Sandesar, where afterwards memorial pillars were built in their name. Today there are hardly any Rajputs in Karamsad. After the Patidars occupied most of the land in Karamsad, the Rajputs left and settled in Napa village.\n\nThe original Patidars of Karamsad were physically very strong. They were known for their endurance and their ability to bear torture. One of Mahijibhai's sons suffered from a carbuncle. (A carbuncle is when a particular part of the body becomes gangrenous). During that time, antibiotics were not available, so the only way to treat it was to cauterize that part. The local method at that time was by heating an iron rod and applying it over the affected part instantly. During this, the person would lose all his calm and nerves. At that time, this procedure would involve 3-4 people tightly holding the patient. One of the Rajput in Napa village was known to do this procedure. However that son was brave, so when Mahjibhai's son was taken over there he said, \"Nobody should hold me. I do not need any support. Nothing is going to happen to me.\"\n\nThe Rajput performing this procedure had kept the old rivalry between them in mind. So he overheated the iron rod and put it over the affected part with great vengeance. Mahijibhai's son bore it without uttering a single word. When the Rajput praised him for his enduring power, Mahijibhai's son said, \"Do not praise me. I am nothing in comparison to my other brothers. Their endurance power is a lot greater than mine.\"\n\nAfter this incident, the Rajput community in Napa village came to know about the strength of the Patidar community and they stopped creating trouble in and around Karamsad. When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was staying at Nadiad, which was his maternal native, he had suffered from Bubo (an inflammatory swelling of a lymph gland) of the armpit. He had it cauterized without uttering a single word. After all he was also from Karamsad.\n\nDuring the making of Vallabh Vidyanagar, had the Patidars of Karamsad not donated generously, then Vidyanagar would not have looked like what it looks today.\n\nKaramsad has been quite under the influence of Swaminarayan Sect and Santram Temple for a long time. Both these sects do a lot of activities in Karamsad. Karamsad has always remained way ahead, be it in politics, education, religion, cooperative activities or industries in the Kheda District. The Patidars of Karamsad are well known in the social community of Chha Gam (six villages). The yesterday\u2019s generation of Patidars have proved best themselves in different fields in Africa, Fiji, Myanmar (Burma), etc. the first two Patidars to reach East Africa in 1895 AD. were Maganbhai Naranbhai and Ishwarbhai Nathabhai Patel. Today the Patidars of Karamsad are spread out in England, Canada, America and Australia.\n\nSantram Temple in Karamsad is famous for its Convention Hall / Banquet Hall. The temple also provides health services to the people at a very nominal charge. It also runs coaching classes for students. After being coached in these classes many students have been accepted into various engineering and medical colleges. A temple of Goddess Khodiyar \u2013 the presiding deity of Patidars has been recently built. It is also has various facilities and a big banquet hall, which can be used for marriage ceremonies. There are very few Digambar Jain Temples in the whole of Gujarat, but still there is a temple (Derasar) in Karamsad. Moreover there are a Swaminarayan Temple, Bapeshwar Mahadev, Catholic mission, and a mosque.\n\nKaramsad is situated at 22 North latitude and 72 East longitude. It has a population of 14,000 people and has water works also, but in the past, people used to get water from  Kharo Kuvo, Lakhvo Kuvo, Rabari No Kuvo, Moto Kuvo and other wells.\n\n==Sardar Patel Biography==\n[[File:Sardar patel (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]]]]\nSardar Patel belonged to a [[Gurjar]] family of [[Gujarat]]. '''[[Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]]''' was popularly known as '''Iron Man of India'''. His full name was Vallabhbhai Patel. He played a leading role in the Indian freedom struggle and became the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India. He is credited with achieving political integration of India.\n\nPatel was born on 31 October 1875 in Nadiad, a City in Gujarat. His father Jhaverbhai was a farmer and mother Laad Bai was a simple lady. Sardar Vallabhbhai's early education took place in '''Karamsad'''. Then he joined a school in Petlad. After two years he joined a high school in Nadiad. He passed his high school examination in 1896.\n\nVallabhbhai wanted to become a barrister. To realize this ambition he had to go to England. But he did not have the financial means to even join a college in India. In those days a candidate could study in private and sit for an examination in Law. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel borrowed books from a lawyer of his acquaintance and studied at home. Occasionally he attended courts of law and listened attentively to the arguments of lawyer. Vallabhbhai passed the Law examination.\n\nSardar Vallabhbhai Patel started his Law practice in Godhra. Soon his practice flourished. He married Jhaberaba. In 1904, he had a baby daughter [[Maniben Patel]], and in 1905 his son Dahyabhai was born. Vallabhbhai sent his elder brother Vitthalbhai, who himself was a lawyer, to England for higher studies in Law. Patel was only thirty-three years old when his wife died. He did not wish to marry again. After his brother's return, Vallabhbhai went to England. He studied with single-minded devotion and stood first in the Barrister-at-Law Examination.\n\nSardar Patel returned to India in 1913 and started his practice in Ahmedabad. Soon he became popular. At the urging of his friends, Patel contested and won elections to become the sanitation commissioner of Ahmedabad in 1917. Sardar Patel was deeply impressed by Gandhiji's success in Champaran Satyagraha. In 1918, there was a drought in the Kheda division of Gujarat. Peasants asked for relief from the high rate of taxes but the British government refused. Gandhiji took up peasants cause but could not devote his full-time in Kheda. He was looking for someone who could lead the struggle in his absence. At this point Sardar Patel volunteered to come forward and lead the struggle. He gave up his lucrative legal practice and entered public life.\n\nVallabhbhai successfully led peasants revolt in Kheda and the revolt ended in 1919 when the British government agreed to suspend collection of revenue and roll back the rates. Kheda Satyagraha turned Vallabhbhai Patel into a national hero. Vallabhbhai supported Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement, and as president of the Gujarat Congress, helped in organizing bonfires of British goods in Ahmedabad. He gave up his English clothes and started wearing Khadi. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Ahmedabad's municipal president in 1922, 1924 and 1927. During his terms, Ahmedabad was extended a major supply of electricity and underwent major education reforms. Drainage and sanitation systems were extended over all the city.\n\nIn 1928, Bardoli Taluka in Gujarat suffered from famine. In this hour of distress the British government raised the revenue taxes by thirty percent. Sardar Patel took up cudgels on behalf of the farmers and appealed to the Governor to reduce the taxes. The Governor refused and the government even announced the date of the collection of the taxes. Sardar Patel organized the farmers and told them not to pay even a single pie of tax. The government tried to repress the revolt but ultimately bowed before Vallabhbhai Patel. It was during the struggle and after the victory in Bardoli that caused intense excitement across India, that Patel was increasingly addressed by his colleagues and followers as Sardar.\n\nSardar Patel was imprisoned during Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930. After the signing of Gandhi-Irwin pact in 1931, Sardar Patel was released and he was elected Congress president for its 1931 session in Karachi. Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London, Gandhiji and Sardar Patel were arrested in January 1932 and imprisoned in the [[Yerwada Central Jail]]. During this term of imprisonment, Sardar Patel and Mahatma Gandhi grew close to one another, and the two developed a close bond of affection, trust, and frankness without reserve. Sardar Patel was finally released in July 1934.\n\nIn August 1942, the Congress launched the Quit India Movement. The government jailed all the important leaders of the Congress, including Vallabhbhai Patel. All the leaders were released after three years. After achieving independence on 15 August 1947, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of independent India and Sardar Patel became the Deputy Prime Minister. He was in charge of Home Affairs, Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of States.\n\nThere were 565 princely states in India at that time. Some of the Maharajas and Nawabs were dreaming of becoming independent rulers once the British quit India. They argued that the government of free India should treat them as equals. Some of them went to the extent of planning to send their representatives to the United Nations Organization.\n\nPatel invoked the patriotism of India's monarchs, asking them to join in the freedom of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people. He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic, especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects. With political foresight, he consolidated the small kingdoms. The entire nation was with him. He tackled the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] and the [[Nawab of Junagarh]] who initially did not want to join India.\n\nSardar Patel's efforts brought success, uniting a scattered nation without much bloodshed. He was nicknamed \n''' 'Iron Man' '''\n. Sardar Patel died of cardiac arrest on 15 December 1950. For his services to the nation Sardar Patel was conferred with [[Bharat Ratna]] posthumously in 1991.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vithalbhai Patel]] - elder brother\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sardarpateltrust.org]\n*[http://www.answers.com/topic/sardar-vallabhbhai-patel]\n*[http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/sardar-patel.html]\n'''FACEBOOK''' https://www.facebook.com/svphistoricalschool\n'''Facebook'''https://www.facebook.com/pages/Karamsad-patels-community/136689673073408\n\n==Geography==\nKaramsad is located at {{coord|22.55|N|72.9|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/9/Karamsad.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Karamsad]</ref> It has an average elevation of 35&nbsp;metres (114&nbsp;feet).\n\n'''Karamsad Weather'''.http://weather.weatherbug.com/India/Karamsad-weather.html?zcode=z5602.

It is due to the transportation of products between Tehran and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Chemicals, fertilizers and processed agricultural goods are also produced in the city.\n\nKaraj is a major industrial city, with factories producing sugar, textiles, wire, and alcohol. It has become a major area for middle class migrants from Tehran.

It is due to the transportation of products between Tehran and the [[Caspian Sea]]. Chemicals, fertilizers and processed agricultural goods are also produced in the city.\n\nKaraj is a major industrial city, with factories producing sugar, textiles, wire, and alcohol. It has become a major area for middle class migrants from Tehran.

''Zowb e \u0100han'' or ''Zowb \u0100han'', literally \"steel mill\", was a contract between the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] government and a consortium from [[Nazi Germany]].
