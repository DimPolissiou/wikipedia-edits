This was sometime between 1892-93. This first settlement was established by Chief Chiatlo and a group of people by the building of log cabins and bringing dairy cows.

In 1949, the community organized its first community government, forming an Administrative District under the direction of the Government of Canada, run by a trustee board with two elected members, two appointed members, and a chairman.<ref>\"Hay River Still Growing Town\" The News of the North, May 27, 1949</ref>\n\nIn 1959, the [[Northern Transportation Company|Northern Transportation Company Limited]] located their main base in Hay River and over the years developed the facilities.

This was sometime between 1892-93. This first settlement was established by Chief Chiatlo and a group of people by the building of log cabins and bringing dairy cows. This was followed in 1893 by the Anglican Mission, at the request of Chief Chiatlo in 1893 with the Roman Catholic Mission and the Hudson's Bay Company arriving later.<ref name=\"HRH\">[http://www.hayriver.com/main/brief_history.htm Hay River history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513143844/http://www.hayriver.com/main/brief_history.htm |date=13 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA school, health centre and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] followed, and as part of the [[Canol Road]] project the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] built a runway on [[Vale Island]]. In 1948 the [[Government of Canada]] built a gravel road, now the [[Mackenzie Highway]], from [[Grimshaw, Alberta]] to Hay River, making it the first community in the NWT to be linked with southern Canada.<ref name=\"HRH\"/> The settlement's role as terminus of all-season trucking, and the establishment of a commercial fishing industry, started an economic boom. In 1949, the community organized its first community government, forming an Administrative District under the direction of the Government of Canada, run by a trustee board with two elected members, two appointed members, and a chairman.<ref>\"Hay River Still Growing Town\" The News of the North, May 27, 1949</ref>\n\nIn 1959, the [[Northern Transportation Company|Northern Transportation Company Limited]] located their main base in Hay River and over the years developed the facilities.

There is also a Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall along the highway coming into town. On the Katl'odeeche First Nations Reserve there are a small Catholic church, and a larger Pentecostal church. There is also an Anglican church that was destroyed in the 2008 Hay River ice breakup.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. It is named Munlough South to distinguish it from the neighbouring townland of [[Munlough North]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nMunlough South is bounded on the north by [[Munlough North]] townland, on the west by [[Keenagh, Templeport]] townland, on the south by [[Lissanover]] townland and on the east by [[Cavanaquill]] townland. Its chief geographical features are the dried bed of the lake that gives the townland its name, a stream and a dug well. Munlough South is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes.

The said Thomas Groves was the Anglican rector of Templeport parish from 1626 to 1632.\n\nIn the Irish Rebellion of 1641 Martin Kilhare of [[Drumlane]] made a deposition about the rebellion in Munlough as follows- <ref>[http://1641.tcd.ie/deposition.php?depID=833029r023]</ref>\n\n''(239)''\n''Martine Killhare of Drumlane in the Countie of Cauan doe depose that my Brother Godferrye Killhare of '''Munlogh''' within the parish of Templeporte within the Baronie of Tullahae and Countie of Cauan, had in personale estate when this Rebellione first begane-''\n''Cowes ould and younge woorth \u00a364; Horses woorth \u00a320; Corne and haye worth \u00a310; Houshould goods \u00a310; In all \u00a3104.''\n''All these goods ware taken from him forceably aboute the 24th of October 1641 by the hands of Gillernew mc Gawran, and Manus mc Gawran, both of the parish of Templeport and Baronie of Tullaha and Countie of Cauan gent.

The unknown ship reversed course and attempts to contact her failed. ''PGM-18'' monitored a radio message reporting a sighting of a submarine. ''PGM-18'' proceeded to send out a message reporting that the submarine sighting was false and that they had been mistaken for a submarine.<ref name=\"navsource\" /> Due to the low profile of PGM gunboats and PC submarine chasers it was not uncommon for them to be misidentified as a submarine.<ref name=\"navsource\" /> Later, the same ship overtook them and was revealed to be US Army freighter, {{SS|Minot Victory}}.<ref name=\"navsource\" />\n\nOn 6 March 1945, the two gunboats arrived at Eniwetok. While anchored, ''PGM-29'' was accidentally struck by [[Liberty ship]] {{SS|John G. Tod}}. While she underwent repairs, ''PGM-18'' proceeded without her to [[Guam]] and then to [[Ulithi]].<ref name=\"navsource\" />  After a week of shoreleave, she proceeded to Kerama Retto, [[Ryukyu Islands]] with a group of ''YMS-1'' class minesweepers.  Throughout heavy [[kamikaze]] attacks during the Battle of Okinawa, ''PGM-18'' and the minesweepers successfully cleaned up Japanese mines at Kerama Retto and off the west coast of Okinawa.  The minesweepers turned their attention to the waters of [[Nakagusuku Bay]].<ref name=\"navsource\" />\n\n''PGM-18'', while following behind ''YMS-103'' and destroying mines she and other minesweepers cut loose, struck and detonated a mine. Eyewitnesses on nearby ships reported that the explosion was so powerful they could see five feet of sunlight under her [[keel]] before she came back down into the water, rolled over, and then foundered.<ref name=\"navsource\" /> ''YMS-103'', in an attempt to rescue survivors, struck two mines, blowing off her [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and [[Stem (ship)|stem]].<ref name=\"navsource\" />  Despite this, she was able to remain afloat.<ref name=\"ntlworld\">{{citation|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/andrew.etherington/1945/04/07.htm|title=April 7th, 1945|date=|accessdate=2008-12-21}}</ref>  ''PGM-18'' suffered two dead, twelve missing and 14 wounded, and ''YMS-103'' suffered five killed and seven wounded.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fold3.com/image/1/295794569 |title=Loss report of PGM-18 |publisher=www.fold3.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref></ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fold3.com/image/1/295831144 |title=Loss report of YMS-103 |publisher=www.fold3.com |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>  The survivors were picked up by other ships in the area.

main [[game engine]] were noted for their quality. The [[Dolby Surround]]-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim.<ref name = GS_PC /><ref name = PCZ /> British magazine ''[[PC Zone]]'' described it as \"bloody good,\" with \"some modest simulation elements.\" The magazine praised the setting of the game, commenting: \"a refreshing change from the deep space of most futuristic combat sims, and something which definitely has a positive effect on gameplay.\" The review concluded by saying that \"it's as fun as it looks.

It also praised the sound and graphics, though the latter was a source of criticism: \"''Incoming'''s got it all... but it all comes at a high price: getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt.\" Despite calling it \"an outstanding-looking and great playing game,\" IGN only gave the game a \"decent\" review score because of the system problems.<ref name=IGN_PC /> Conversely, [[GameSpot]]'s review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as \"some of the finest... of any action game\". The reviewer, however, described the game design as \"strong yet slightly flawed... [it] definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there,\" complaining that \"what [the developer] have presented gets tiresome quickly.\" The publication summarised the game as \"a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay.\"<ref name=GS_PC />\n\nThe reception, however, was less positive when the game was [[Porting|ported]] to the Dreamcast. A release title for [[Sega]]'s console, ''IGN'' complained that the graphics were not top-of-the-range at the time of its late 1999 release, with the [[draw distance]] being cited as a specific hindrance on gameplay. ''IGN'' also said that, although the game \"is lacking in many areas, there's more than enough here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action.\" Though criticizing the graphics' ability to \"get in the way at times,\" the \"very vague\" mission briefings and the \"odd flying model for the planes,\" the reviewer conceded that \"if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're looking for a good challenge, you'll probably want to look into ''Incoming''.\"<ref name=IGN_DC /> [[GameSpy|PlanetDreamcast]]'s review was harsher, describing the plot as \"the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type,\" the multiplayer [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] mode as \"lame\" and the objectives as \"mundane.\" The reviewer also noted graphical issues, clipping problems and poor controls. Though dismissing the graphics as \"a bit dated,\" the reviewer did acknowledge the \"nifty special effects\" and admitted that \"''Incoming'' may be worth a rental... [it] is only slightly better than mediocre.\"<ref name=GSPY_DC /> In a rare positive review for the Dreamcast version, ''Game Vortex'' described the visuals as \"some of the most breathtaking visuals you'll find in any game.\" Though describing the multiplayer as \"fun\", it considered \"by far, the best [mode to be] Campaign mode.\" The review concluded by describing the game as \"lots of fun and highly recommended.\"<ref name = GV_DC>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamevortex.com/gamevortex/soft_rev.php/1467/incoming-dreamcast.html | title = Incoming (DC) | author = Ashley Perkins | year = 1999 | website = Game Vortex | publisher = PS Illustrated | accessdate = June 7, 2019}}</ref> In Japan, where said console version was released under the name {{nihongo|'''''Incoming: Ginrui Saish\u016b Kessen'''''|\u30a4\u30f3\u30ab\u30df\u30f3\u30b0 \u4eba\u985e\u6700\u7d42\u6c7a\u6226|Inkamingu Ginrui Saish\u016b Kessen|lit. \"Incoming: Humanity's Final Showdown\"}}, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of 27 out of 40.<ref name=\"Fam\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{moby game|id=/incoming-the-final-conflict}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013112612/http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/database/420.shtml ''Incoming''] at [[GameSpy|PlanetDreamcast]]\n\n{{good article}}\n\n[[Category:1998 video games]]\n[[Category:Alien invasions in video games]]\n[[Category:Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Dreamcast games]]\n[[Category:Imagineer games]]\n[[Category:Rage Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox video game\n|title = Incoming\n|image = incoming cover.jpg\n|caption = European Windows cover art\n|developer = [[Rage Software]]\n|publisher = {{vgrelease|EU|Rage Software|NA|[[Xicat Interactive]] (PC)|NA|[[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] (DC)|JP|[[Imagineer (Japanese company)|Imagineer]]}}\n|designer = Scott Johnson<br>Kristian Ramsay-Jones\n|composer = Stephen Lord\n|engine = \n|released ='''Windows'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|March 23, 1998|JP|March 23, 1998|NA|July 9, 1998<ref name = IGN_PC />}}'''Dreamcast'''<br />{{vgrelease|JP|December 17, 1998<ref name = MG_RI />|EU|October 14, 1999<ref name = MG_RI>{{cite web | url = https://www.mobygames.com/game/dreamcast/incoming-the-final-conflict/release-info | title = Incoming: The Final Conflict (1998) Dreamcast Release Dates | website = [[MobyGames]] | publisher = Blue Flame Labs | accessdate = April 16, 2012}}</ref>|NA|November 30, 1999<ref name = MG_RI />}}'''Arcade'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|April 30, 2003}}\n|genre = [[Shooter game|Shooting]], [[flight simulator]]\n|modes = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n|platforms = [[Dreamcast]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Arcade game|Arcade]]\n}}\n\n'''''Incoming''''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Shooter game|shooter]] video game developed by [[Rage Software]] and published by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]].

main [[game engine]] were noted for their quality. The [[Dolby Surround]]-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim.<ref name = GS_PC /><ref name = PCZ /> British magazine ''[[PC Zone]]'' described it as \"bloody good,\" with \"some modest simulation elements.\" The magazine praised the setting of the game, commenting: \"a refreshing change from the deep space of most futuristic combat sims, and something which definitely has a positive effect on gameplay.\" The review concluded by saying that \"it's as fun as it looks. Just for once, all those people who don't read reviews and buy games purely on the strength of pretty pictures on the packaging are gonna find themselves playing a very, very enjoyable game.\"<ref name=PCZ>{{cite magazine | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=3081 | title = PC Review: Incoming | author = Warren Christmas | magazine = [[PC Zone]] | publisher = [[Dennis Publishing]] | accessdate = October 7, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304020937/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=3081 | archivedate = March 4, 2007 | url-status = dead}}</ref> ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' highlighted the game's efficient gameplay mechanics, stating that designers \"managed to produce something more than a lightshow, taking care to fine-tune a design that, if not exactly original, at least does its thing with flair and solid understanding of gameplay.\"<ref name=\"Edge review\"/>\n\n''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the Windows version and stated that \"The amount of varied units and different settings give ''Incoming'' the commendable originality and replay value that make it a title worth checking out.\"<ref name=\"NG\" />\n\nThough considering the game \"pretty darn tough,\" [[IGN]] praised the game's variety and length. It also praised the sound and graphics, though the latter was a source of criticism: \"''Incoming'''s got it all... but it all comes at a high price: getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt.\" Despite calling it \"an outstanding-looking and great playing game,\" IGN only gave the game a \"decent\" review score because of the system problems.<ref name=IGN_PC /> Conversely, [[GameSpot]]'s review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as \"some of the finest... of any action game\". The reviewer, however, described the game design as \"strong yet slightly flawed... [it] definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there,\" complaining that \"what [the developer] have presented gets tiresome quickly.\" The publication summarised the game as \"a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay.\"<ref name=GS_PC />\n\nThe reception, however, was less positive when the game was [[Porting|ported]] to the Dreamcast. A release title for [[Sega]]'s console, ''IGN'' complained that the graphics were not top-of-the-range at the time of its late 1999 release, with the [[draw distance]] being cited as a specific hindrance on gameplay. ''IGN'' also said that, although the game \"is lacking in many areas, there's more than enough here for the hardcore shooting fans out there to have their requisite blast of shooting action.\" Though criticizing the graphics' ability to \"get in the way at times,\" the \"very vague\" mission briefings and the \"odd flying model for the planes,\" the reviewer conceded that \"if you're a hardcore shooting fan, and you're looking for a good challenge, you'll probably want to look into ''Incoming''.\"<ref name=IGN_DC /> [[GameSpy|PlanetDreamcast]]'s review was harsher, describing the plot as \"the same recycled garbage used in tons of other games of this type,\" the multiplayer [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] mode as \"lame\" and the objectives as \"mundane.\" The reviewer also noted graphical issues, clipping problems and poor controls. Though dismissing the graphics as \"a bit dated,\" the reviewer did acknowledge the \"nifty special effects\" and admitted that \"''Incoming'' may be worth a rental... [it] is only slightly better than mediocre.\"<ref name=GSPY_DC /> In a rare positive review for the Dreamcast version, ''Game Vortex'' described the visuals as \"some of the most breathtaking visuals you'll find in any game.\" Though describing the multiplayer as \"fun\", it considered \"by far, the best [mode to be] Campaign mode.\" The review concluded by describing the game as \"lots of fun and highly recommended.\"<ref name = GV_DC>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamevortex.com/gamevortex/soft_rev.php/1467/incoming-dreamcast.html | title = Incoming (DC) | author = Ashley Perkins | year = 1999 | website = Game Vortex | publisher = PS Illustrated | accessdate = June 7, 2019}}</ref> In Japan, where said console version was released under the name {{nihongo|'''''Incoming: Ginrui Saish\u016b Kessen'''''|\u30a4\u30f3\u30ab\u30df\u30f3\u30b0 \u4eba\u985e\u6700\u7d42\u6c7a\u6226|Inkamingu Ginrui Saish\u016b Kessen|lit. \"Incoming: Humanity's Final Showdown\"}}, ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a score of 27 out of 40.<ref name=\"Fam\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{moby game|id=/incoming-the-final-conflict}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013112612/http://www.planetdreamcast.com/games/database/420.shtml ''Incoming''] at [[GameSpy|PlanetDreamcast]]\n\n{{good article}}\n\n[[Category:1998 video games]]\n[[Category:Alien invasions in video games]]\n[[Category:Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Dreamcast games]]\n[[Category:Imagineer games]]\n[[Category:Rage Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n", "name_user": "Mika1h", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incoming_(1998_video_game)"}
