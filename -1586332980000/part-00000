Burke steps out of the car and walks towards a London Underground station. It is at this point where the song begins to play. During the first chorus, Burke makes her way down to the platform.\n\nAt the end of the first chorus, Burke steps onto a train and sits down right at the rear of the carriage. During the second verse, she stands up and calls all the passengers to dance, including a businessman and a professional dancer. She walks through to the very front of the train and it is at the front carriage where Burke and her team start to dance in the carriage. Burke then continues to dance in an empty car park, where she and her team perform a further dance routine. The video finishes with Burke and her dancers posing in the car park.\n\n==Live performances==\nBurke performed an acoustic version of the song on ''[[Loose Women]]'' in 2012, and also performed the

It was released in the United Kingdom on 27 May 2012 as the album's second and final single.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexandra Burke debuts new single 'Let It Go' \u2013 listen  |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a376306/alexandra-burke-debuts-new-single-let-it-go-listen.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> \"Let It Go\" is an uptempo [[1990s in music|90s]] throwback [[Dance music|dance]] song drawing influences from the [[dance-pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] genres.<ref>{{cite web|title=Playlist: 10 tracks you need to hear |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/thesound/a376675/playlist-10-tracks-you-need-to-hear.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n\"Let It Go\" received generally favourable reviews from music critics, who deemed the song the best song on the album, along with its catchy tune and production; however, minority of critics found the song generic. The song was unable to match the success like \"Elephant\", only peaking inside the [[UK Top 40]].\n\n==Background and release==\nIn an interview with Peter Robinson for [[Popjustice]], Burke explained the song's conception and development.<ref name=\"PopjusticeInterview\">{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Peter|url=http://www.popjustice.com/interviewsandfeatures/an-alexandra-burke-interview/|title=Alexandra Burke does not intend to grow any vegetables in the near future: Just one of the many things you will discover in this illuminating interview|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|date=24 May 2012|accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref> Burke revealed that she did not co-write the song, but was involved with the writing camp, a series of sessions where writers and producers met Burke in order to create material for ''[[Heartbreak on Hold]]'', and that \"Let It Go\" was written during the sessions.<ref name=\"PopjusticeInterview\"/> She explained the meaning behind the songs lyrics, saying:\n\n{{quote|For me, it's about letting go of life\u2019s stresses full stop.

Burke steps out of the car and walks towards a London Underground station. It is at this point where the song begins to play. During the first chorus, Burke makes her way down to the platform.\n\nAt the end of the first chorus, Burke steps onto a train and sits down right at the rear of the carriage. During the second verse, she stands up and calls all the passengers to dance, including a businessman and a professional dancer. She walks through to the very front of the train and it is at the front carriage where Burke and her team start to dance in the carriage. Burke then continues to dance in an empty car park, where she and her team perform a further dance routine. The video finishes with Burke and her dancers posing in the car park.\n\n==Live performances==\nBurke performed an acoustic version of the song on ''[[Loose Women]]'' in 2012, and also performed the song on series finale of ''[[The Voice of Ireland (series 1)#Episode 16: Final .2829 April.29|The Voice of Ireland]]'' on 29 April 2012.<ref name=\"TheVoiceIreland\">{{cite

It is located 13 kilometers inland from the Pacific coast and 770 kilometers from the nation's capital, [[Lima]].\n\nFounded by Spanish explorers as \"Santa Mar\u00eda de los Valles de Chiclayo\" in the 16th century, it was declared a city on 15 April 1835 by president [[Felipe Santiago Salaverry]]. He named Chiclayo \"the Heroic City\" to recognize the courage of its citizens in the fight for independence, a title it still holds. Other nicknames for Chiclayo include \"The Capital of Friendship\" and the \"Pearl of the North\".\n\nChiclayo is Peru's [[List of 20 largest cities in Peru|fourth-largest city]], after [[Lima]], [[Arequipa]], and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], with a population of 738,000 as of 2011.<ref name=\"travels\">[http://www.travelsradiate.com/south-america/republic-of-peru/departamento-de-amazonas/provincia-de-bagua/chiclayo/3698350-chiclayo.html \"Local Stats, Info, Weather\"], ''TravelsRadiate'', 3 August 2011, accessed 3 August 2011.</ref> The Lambayeque region is the fourth most populous [[metropolitan areas of Peru|metropolitan area of Peru]], with a population of 972,713 in 2009.<ref>World-Gazetteer.com</ref>\n\nThe city was founded near an important prehistoric archaeological site, the [[Northern Wari ruins]], which constitute the remains of a city from the 7th to 12th century of the [[Wari Empire]].\n\n==Etymology==\nMany different historical accounts tell of the naming of ''Chiclayo''. Some attribute it to an indigenous man known as \"chiclayoc\" or \"chiclayep\" who transported plaster between the ancient cities of [[Za\u00f1a]], [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]] and [[Morrope District|Morrope]].\n\nAnother version claims that around the time that the city was founded, the area was home to a green-colored fruit called ''chiclayep'' or ''chiclayop,'' which in the [[Moche (culture)|Mochican]] language means \"green that hangs\". In some towns in the highlands of [[Cajamarca Region|Cajamarca]], squashes are known as ''chiclayos'', evidence that this fruit is the origin of the city's name.\n\nAnother source indicates that the word is a translation from the extinct [[Moche (culture)|Moche language]] and is derived from the word ''Cheqta'' which means \"half\" and ''yoc'' which means \"property of\".\n\nOthers say the [[Moche (culture)|Mochican]] language had words similar to the name, such as ''Chiclayap'' or ''Chekliayok'', which means \"place where there are green branches\".<ref name=\"Historia de Chiclayo\">{{cite web|title=Historia de Chiclayo|url=http://www.lambayeque.net/chiclayo/historia/|work=Lambayeque.net|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Symbols==\n\n=== Shield ===\n\nThe coat of arms summarizes important features of the province, such as the one dedicated to the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, represented in light blue background, which is a Catholic town, represented on the cross, but, also see other items related to the history, geography and landscape.<ref name=\"blogspot\">{{cite web|url=http://mitierraenlaweb.blogspot.com/2011/04/escudo-de-chiclayo.html |title=Mi tierra en la Web: Escudo de Chiclayo|publisher=mitierraenlaweb.blogspot.com|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Description ====\n\n*'' 'Tumi''' the tumi is a ceremonial knife used by the Lambayeque culture, represents [[Naylamp]].\n*'' 'Sea''' the sea was always very important for its marine resources and legends that are told of it.\n*'' 'Huerequeque''' is the typical bird of the region, is so called because in his song seems to say Huere-que-que-que.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Columbian cultures===\n\n====Mochica culture====\n{{Main|Moche (culture)}}\nThe Moche civilization began between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, occupying a territory that spanned much of what is now the northern coast of Peru, encompassing what is today the coastal area of the departments of Ancash, Lambayeque and La Libertad. This civilization developed a broad knowledge of hydraulic engineering: its people constructed canals to create an irrigation system in order to support agriculture. They produced surpluses, which supported population density and a strong economy for development. The culture was characterized by intensive use of copper in the manufacture of ornamental objects, tools and weapons.<ref name=\"Historia de Chiclayo\"/>\n\nDuring the Moche times, [[Pampa Grande]], near Chiclayo, was a major regional capital.\n\nThe Mochicans produced ceramics with elaborate designs, representing religious themes, humans, animals, and scenes of ceremonies and myths reflecting their perception of the world. They were famous for huaco-portraits, which are preserved in museums around the country, highlighting amazing expressiveness, perfection, and realism. The civilization disappeared as a result of disasters caused by [[El Ni\u00f1o]].<ref name=\"Historia de Chiclayo\"/>\n\n====Sican culture====\n{{Main|Sican culture}}\nThe [[Sican culture]] (or Lambayeque culture) existed between 700 and 1375AD and occupied the territory that is now the [[Lambayeque region|department of Lambayeque]], including present-day Chiclayo.\n\nThis culture formed towards the end of the Moche civilization and assimilated much of the Moche knowledge and cultural traditions. At its peak, (900-1100), it extended over almost the entire Peruvian coast. The Sican excelled in architecture, jewelry and navigation. A thirty-year drought around the year 1020 hastened the fall of this civilization.\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[Image:Parque de las Musas.jpg|thumb|320px|Parade of the Muses|right]]\nIn the early 16th century, Chiclayo was inhabited by two ethnic groups; the Cinto and Collique. The chieftains of these ethnic groups donated part of their land for the construction of a Franciscan convent. This cesion of land was approved by the royal decree of 17 September 1585. Thus, with the advocation of Saint Maria of Chiclayo and under the direction of Father Fray Antonio of the Concepci\u00f3n, a church and a Franciscan covenant were erected at Chiclayo. At the time of construction of these Spanish-built edifices, the city of Chiclayo was founded. Unlike other major Peruvian colonial cities such as [[Lima]], [[Piura]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], or [[Arequipa]], Chiclayo was inhabited by a largely indigenous population rather than Spanish colonizers.\n\n===Republican era===\nDuring the [[Peruvian War of Independence]], Chiclayo supported General [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]'s liberating army with soldiers, weapons, horses, and other resources, under the supervision of the most progressive creole, Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz.\n\nAfter independence, Chiclayo was still a small village. In 1827, Chiclayo was elevated to the level of villa.\n\nOn 15 April 1835, Chiclayo was proclaimed a city by then-president [[Felipe Santiago Salaverry]], who declared it a \"Heroic City\" in recognition of the services its people rendered in the War of Independence. The next day, the [[Chiclayo Province]] was organized, with Chiclayo designated as its capital.\n\n===Modern Chiclayo===\nToday, Chiclayo is an important Peruvian city, the financial and commercial capital of Northern Peru. Its strategic geographic location makes it a rail, communications, and automotive hub. Modern touches include large supermarkets, banking chains, warehouses, hospitals, clinics, and galleries.<ref name=Cabrejos>{{cite news|first=Juan|last=Cabrejos|title=Ra\u00edces mochicas de Chiclayo, perla del norte del Per\u00fa|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2012-04-21-raices-mochicas-de-chiclayo-perla-del-norte-del-peru-noticia_474184.html|newspaper=El Comercio|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nChiclayo is also known as the \"City of Friendship\" and ''Perla del Norte'' (\"Pearl of the North\") of Per\u00fa.<ref name=Cabrejos />\n\n== Municipal administration ==\nIn Chiclayo, the mayor is the head of government.

Since the city of Chiclayo is located in a tropical zone near the Equator, the weather should be hot, humid, and rainy. However, it mostly resembles a [[subtropical]] climate, being comfortable and dry. This is due to the strong winds called \"cyclones\"{{clarify|reason=This sentence needs clarification. Do you mean tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones?|date=April 2016}} that lower temperature to a moderate climate for most of the year except in the summer months where the temperature rises, so summer is often spent in resorts like Puerto Eten and Pimentel. Periodically, every 7 to 15 years, there are hotter temperatures with much higher rainfall and extreme rise of river water.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Chiclayo (1961\u20131990, extremes 1943\u2013present)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 36.2\n|Feb record high C = 38.0\n|Mar record high C = 36.0\n|Apr record high C = 39.2\n|May record high C = 34.9\n|Jun record high C = 34.7\n|Jul record high C = 35.4\n|Aug record high C = 31.4\n|Sep record high C = 30.5\n|Oct record high C = 30.0\n|Nov record high C = 32.2\n|Dec record high C = 34.0\n|year record high C = 39.2\n|Jan high C = 29.1\n|Feb high C = 30.5\n|Mar high C = 30.3\n|Apr high C = 28.8\n|May high C = 26.6\n|Jun high C = 24.9\n|Jul high C = 23.6\n|Aug high C = 23.4\n|Sep high C = 23.6\n|Oct high C = 24.2\n|Nov high C = 25.3\n|Dec high C = 27.1\n|year high C = 26.4\n|Jan mean C = 23.4\n|Feb mean C = 24.3\n|Mar mean C = 24.3\n|Apr mean C = 22.8\n|May mean C = 21.1\n|Jun mean C = 19.9\n|Jul mean C = 18.8\n|Aug mean C = 18.4\n|Sep mean C = 18.3\n|Oct mean C = 18.8\n|Nov mean C = 19.7\n|Dec mean C = 21.8\n|year mean C = 21.0\n|Jan low C = 19.3\n|Feb low C = 20.5\n|Mar low C = 20.5\n|Apr low C = 19.1\n|May low C = 17.8\n|Jun low C = 16.7\n|Jul low C = 15.7\n|Aug low C = 15.3\n|Sep low C = 15.2\n|Oct low C = 15.6\n|Nov low C = 16.3\n|Dec low C = 17.6\n|year low C = 17.5\n|Jan record low C = 15.0\n|Feb record low C = 16.0\n|Mar record low C = 10.5\n|Apr record low C = 12.8\n|May record low C = 11.0\n|Jun record low C = 12.8\n|Jul record low C = 12.0\n|Aug record low C = 11.0\n|Sep record low C = 12.0\n|Oct record low C = 12.0\n|Nov record low C = 10.0\n|Dec record low C = 10.0\n|year record low C = 10.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 5.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 2.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 8.8\n|Apr precipitation mm = 4.0\n|May precipitation mm = 1.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 0.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 0.3\n|Sep precipitation mm = 0.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 0.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 1.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 0.5\n|year precipitation mm = 26.9\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 1.2\n|Feb precipitation days = 1.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 3.6\n|Apr precipitation days = 1.9\n|May precipitation days = 0.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 0.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 0.0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 0.2\n|Oct precipitation days = 0.4\n|Nov precipitation days = 0.3\n|Dec precipitation days = 0.6\n|year precipitation days = 10.6\n|Jan humidity = 73\n|Feb humidity = 72\n|Mar humidity = 74\n|Apr humidity = 75\n|May humidity = 76\n|Jun humidity = 78\n|Jul humidity = 79\n|Aug humidity = 80\n|Sep humidity = 79\n|Oct humidity = 79\n|Nov humidity = 78\n|Dec humidity = 76\n|year humidity = 77\n|source 1 = NOAA,<ref name = NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/PR/84452.TXT\n| title = Chiclayo Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 23 April 2015}}</ref> Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=1878\n| title = Station Capitan Jose \n| publisher = M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat \n| language = French \n| accessdate = 27 June 2017}}</ref>\n|source 2 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (mean temperatures 1961\u20131990, precipitation days 1970\u20131990 and humidity 1954\u20131969)<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_844520_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von  Chiclayo, Prov.

FAP Jos\u00e9 A. Qui\u00f1ones Gonzales International Airport]] (IATA: CIX, ICAO: SPHI) is the main airport serving Chiclayo and the surrounding metropolitan area. It is run by ADP, a private airport operator that operates various airports in northern Peru. The airport hosts domestic airlines, international airlines flights, and fuel supply services. The terminal has a runway of 2520 by 45 meters.\n\nFour airlines serve Chiclayo's international airport; [[LATAM Airlines]] and [[Viva Air Per\u00fa]] offering domestic service to [[Lima, Peru|Lima]]. In July 2016, [[Copa Airlines]] began direct flights between Chiclayo and its hub in [[Tocumen International Airport|Panama]], making it the first ever international flight to arrive to the city. US-based [[Spirit Airlines]] has expressed interest in serving Chiclayo from its hub in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida, United States.\n\n===Land===\nChiclayo, because of its location, serves as a point of interconnection for various cities of the Northeast of the country and has various bus companies which service cities such as Lima, Trujillo, [[Piura]], [[Cajamarca]], [[Chota, Peru|Chota]], [[Cutervo District|Cutervo]], [[Bagua, Peru|Bagua]], [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]], [[Chachapoyas, Peru|Chachapoyas]], and [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]].\n\nTo adequately accommodate the transportation demand, the city is served by two different land terminals, one located towards the southern end of the city and another at the northern end on the [[Panamerican Highway]]. A substantial number of bus companies have their own terminals, many of them located near the downtown of the city and in nearby areas. These interprovincial buses contribute to the congestion experienced in downtown Chiclayo. To try to solve the problem the city government has proposed a plan to build a central station in the city.\n\nRegionally, there are various different public services such as ''combis'', ''cousters'', ''colectivos'', which provide services within the districts and provinces of the department of [[Lambayeque Region|Lambayeque]]. There are also an overwhelming number of private taxis which incessantly honk their horns throughout the downtown area of the city, causing a great deal of unwanted noise pollution.\n\n==Population==\n\n[[Image:PLANO DE LA CIUDAD CHICLAYO Y SU AREA METROPOLITANA.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Chiclayo.]]\n\nAccording to the Census of Population and Housing undertaken in 2007, 574,408 people inhabit the area within Chiclayo's city limits or the six municipalities. The metropolitan area has a population of 930,824; it includes other nearby cities like Monsef\u00fa and Lambayeque in a ten-minute radius by paved highway. Under the thirty-minute range are, in order of hierarchy, Ferre\u00f1afe, Santa Rosa, Eten, Illimo and Tuman. Chiclayo is at the center of the Chancay River delta, in a fertile valley.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:center;line-height:120%\"\n|- bgcolor=silver\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Municipalities of<br />the city\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Area<br />km<sup>2</sup>\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Population<br />(census 2007)\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Households<br />(2007)\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Density<br />(hab/km<sup>2</sup>)\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Elevation<br />[[Metres above sea level|masl]]\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Distance from<br />main square (km)\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Chiclayo District|Chiclayo center]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 50.35\n| align=\"right\" | 260,948*\n| align=\"right\" | 60,325\n| align=\"right\" | 5,182.7\n| align=\"right\" | 27\n| align=\"right\" | 0&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz District|Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 28.22\n| align=\"right\" | 167,717*\n| align=\"right\" | 34,641\n| align=\"right\" | 5,943.2\n| align=\"right\" | 28\n| align=\"right\" | 1.5&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[La Victoria District, Chiclayo|La Victoria]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 29.36\n| align=\"right\" | 77,699*\n| align=\"right\" | 16,447\n| align=\"right\" | 2,646.4\n| align=\"right\" | 23\n| align=\"right\" | 2.4&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Pomalca District|Pomalca]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 80.35\n| align=\"right\" | 23,092*\n| align=\"right\" | 5,802\n| align=\"right\" | 287.39\n| align=\"right\" | 29\n| align=\"right\" | 7&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Reque District|Reque]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 47.03\n| align=\"right\" |12,606*\n| align=\"right\" | 3,664\n| align=\"right\" | 268.04\n| align=\"right\" | 21\n| align=\"right\" | 8&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Pimentel District|Pimentel]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 66.53\n| align=\"right\" | 32,346*\n| align=\"right\" | 9,301\n| align=\"right\" | 486.2\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n| align=\"right\" | 11.9&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''Total'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''301.84&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''574,408*'''\n| align=\"right\" |  '''130,180'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''1,903.02'''\n| align=\"center\" | \u2014\n| align=\"center\" | \u2014\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |<big>*</big><small>Data from the census taken by the [[INEI]]</small><ref>[http://desa.inei.gob.pe/mapas/bid/ INEI Census 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423164200/http://desa.inei.gob.pe/mapas/bid/ |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\n|}\n\nAccording to the planning director of Chiclayo, by 2020 the [[San Jos\u00e9 District, Lambayeque|San Jose]] district belonging to the [[Lambayeque Province]] will be completely integrated with the city of Chiclayo.

It was home to the ancient civilization of the Moche who created some of the most ingenious monuments and works of art known to ancient Peru. In 1987, royal tombs of ancient Moche rulers were excavated. The artifacts found in the tomb were transferred to the Royal Tomb of Sipan Museum in the city of Lambayeque. Also there are the Brunning Museum and the Sic\u00e1n Museum in Ferre\u00f1afe. These museums display the magnificent ancient artwork produced by the ancient Moche. The pyramids of T\u00facume are also in this area. In 2007, more than 306,000 tourists visited the museums of Lambayeque.[10] There are more than 20 adobe pyramids all of which are 40 meters (131 feet) in height and are in an abundance of vegetation and wildlife. Also in the area is the Chaparr\u00ed Ecological Reserve which has abundant biodiversity.\nThe department of Lambayeque boasts some of the best cuisine in Peru. The most popular dish in this area is duck with rice. The city of Chiclayo, the capital of the department, is the second largest in the Peruvian north and has a vibrant nightlife.\n\n* '''Main Park'''.- Located in the heart of Chiclayo, was built in two sections, it has a pool equipped with three water valves which give rise to three jets of water that form the flag of [[Peru]]. Around her are shopping centers, the RENIEC, its beautiful Cathedral, Hotel Royal, the Old Cinema Tropical and Colonial Theatre and republican buildings and many places where any tourist or citizen might enjoy. Its actual design, with little modification, was built in 1969; a bronze plate still in place attributes the design to Architect Carlos Garrido Lecca.\n* '''Cathedral of Chiclayo'''.- Located in the main square of the city is built in neoclassical style and dates from 1869 by design and drawings of [[Gustave Eiffel]]. The cover is two bodies, supported by Doric columns first is in front of three archways. The second presents Corinthian capitals whose intercolumpios appreciate balconies or bay windows. On both sides of the facade stand steeples topped with cupolas. Inside, three bodies, highlights the beautiful sculpture of Christ poor and the home of Antonio. The cathedral building was finished near 1945; however, the bells were mounted in 1961. \n* '''Municipal Palace'''.- It stood on the north side of the main park, located on Calle San Jose 823. Elegant building construction (1919), cost more than 30,000 pounds of gold; finished in 1924. It has Republican style with large windows and wrought iron gates. It was destroyed partially by a fire caused by a deplorable political brawl between the Deputy Mayor Jose Barreto Sanchez and his opponent then reinstated Mayor Arturo Castillo Chirinos, who tried to recover the position relying on a ruling of the Constitutional Court, just two months of completing the period for which he was elected in October 2006. It has been restored and is operated as a museum. The beautiful Consistorial Room is used several times a year at special ceremonies and events.\n* '''La Ver\u00f3nica's Chapel'''.- Situated at calle Torres Paz 294.

His collection is extremely poor and outdated meagerly. It has no services such as a Catalog, Internet and multimedia; also, it lacks professional management and its year budget is under US$18,000. It has no branches (it would take four or five only in the district capital) and should be given priority and a serious investment plan. The collection is under 10,000 mostly old items; it should be of 50.000 to 90.000 titles, organized and constantly renewed.\n*'''Centro C\u00edvico - Civic Center'''.- When the \u00c9ten Railway Station was closed, the land was assignet to the Civic Center. The first building was for the Chiclayo Central Mail (actually SERPOST); next was the Banco de la Naci\u00f3n; then the Biblioteca Municipal JELyL; following the SUNAT; the new Lambayeque Judicial Superior Courts; finally, the Ministerio P\u00fablico (Attorneys) of Lambayeque.

It is located 13 kilometers inland from the Pacific coast and 770 kilometers from the nation's capital, [[Lima]].\n\nFounded by Spanish explorers as \"Santa Mar\u00eda de los Valles de Chiclayo\" in the 16th century, it was declared a city on 15 April 1835 by president [[Felipe Santiago Salaverry]]. He named Chiclayo \"the Heroic City\" to recognize the courage of its citizens in the fight for independence, a title it still holds. Other nicknames for Chiclayo include \"The Capital of Friendship\" and the \"Pearl of the North\".\n\nChiclayo is Peru's [[List of 20 largest cities in Peru|fourth-largest city]], after [[Lima]], [[Arequipa]], and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], with a population of 738,000 as of 2011.<ref name=\"travels\">[http://www.travelsradiate.com/south-america/republic-of-peru/departamento-de-amazonas/provincia-de-bagua/chiclayo/3698350-chiclayo.html \"Local Stats, Info, Weather\"], ''TravelsRadiate'', 3 August 2011, accessed 3 August 2011.</ref> The Lambayeque region is the fourth most populous [[metropolitan areas of Peru|metropolitan area of Peru]], with a population of 972,713 in 2009.<ref>World-Gazetteer.com</ref>\n\nThe city was founded near an important prehistoric archaeological site, the [[Northern Wari ruins]], which constitute the remains of a city from the 7th to 12th century of the [[Wari Empire]].\n\n==Etymology==\nMany different historical accounts tell of the naming of ''Chiclayo''. Some attribute it to an indigenous man known as \"chiclayoc\" or \"chiclayep\" who transported plaster between the ancient cities of [[Za\u00f1a]], [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]] and [[Morrope District|Morrope]].\n\nAnother version claims that around the time that the city was founded, the area was home to a green-colored fruit called ''chiclayep'' or ''chiclayop,'' which in the [[Moche (culture)|Mochican]] language means \"green that hangs\". In some towns in the highlands of [[Cajamarca Region|Cajamarca]], squashes are known as ''chiclayos'', evidence that this fruit is the origin of the city's name.\n\nAnother source indicates that the word is a translation from the extinct [[Moche (culture)|Moche language]] and is derived from the word ''Cheqta'' which means \"half\" and ''yoc'' which means \"property of\".\n\nOthers say the [[Moche (culture)|Mochican]] language had words similar to the name, such as ''Chiclayap'' or ''Chekliayok'', which means \"place where there are green branches\".<ref name=\"Historia de Chiclayo\">{{cite web|title=Historia de Chiclayo|url=http://www.lambayeque.net/chiclayo/historia/|work=Lambayeque.net|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Symbols==\n\n=== Shield ===\n\nThe coat of arms summarizes important features of the province, such as the one dedicated to the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, represented in light blue background, which is a Catholic town, represented on the cross, but, also see other items related to the history, geography and landscape.<ref name=\"blogspot\">{{cite web|url=http://mitierraenlaweb.blogspot.com/2011/04/escudo-de-chiclayo.html |title=Mi tierra en la Web: Escudo de Chiclayo|publisher=mitierraenlaweb.blogspot.com|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Description ====\n\n*'' 'Tumi''' the tumi is a ceremonial knife used by the Lambayeque culture, represents [[Naylamp]].\n*'' 'Sea''' the sea was always very important for its marine resources and legends that are told of it.\n*'' 'Huerequeque''' is the typical bird of the region, is so called because in his song seems to say Huere-que-que-que.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Columbian cultures===\n\n====Mochica culture====\n{{Main|Moche (culture)}}\nThe Moche civilization began between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, occupying a territory that spanned much of what is now the northern coast of Peru, encompassing what is today the coastal area of the departments of Ancash, Lambayeque and La Libertad. This civilization developed a broad knowledge of hydraulic engineering: its people constructed canals to create an irrigation system in order to support agriculture. They produced surpluses, which supported population density and a strong economy for development. The culture was characterized by intensive use of copper in the manufacture of ornamental objects, tools and weapons.<ref name=\"Historia de Chiclayo\"/>\n\nDuring the Moche times, [[Pampa Grande]], near Chiclayo, was a major regional capital.\n\nThe Mochicans produced ceramics with elaborate designs, representing religious themes, humans, animals, and scenes of ceremonies and myths reflecting their perception of the world. They were famous for huaco-portraits, which are preserved in museums around the country, highlighting amazing expressiveness, perfection, and realism. The civilization disappeared as a result of disasters caused by [[El Ni\u00f1o]].<ref name=\"Historia de Chiclayo\"/>\n\n====Sican culture====\n{{Main|Sican culture}}\nThe [[Sican culture]] (or Lambayeque culture) existed between 700 and 1375AD and occupied the territory that is now the [[Lambayeque region|department of Lambayeque]], including present-day Chiclayo.\n\nThis culture formed towards the end of the Moche civilization and assimilated much of the Moche knowledge and cultural traditions. At its peak, (900-1100), it extended over almost the entire Peruvian coast. The Sican excelled in architecture, jewelry and navigation. A thirty-year drought around the year 1020 hastened the fall of this civilization.\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[Image:Parque de las Musas.jpg|thumb|320px|Parade of the Muses|right]]\nIn the early 16th century, Chiclayo was inhabited by two ethnic groups; the Cinto and Collique. The chieftains of these ethnic groups donated part of their land for the construction of a Franciscan convent. This cesion of land was approved by the royal decree of 17 September 1585. Thus, with the advocation of Saint Maria of Chiclayo and under the direction of Father Fray Antonio of the Concepci\u00f3n, a church and a Franciscan covenant were erected at Chiclayo. At the time of construction of these Spanish-built edifices, the city of Chiclayo was founded. Unlike other major Peruvian colonial cities such as [[Lima]], [[Piura]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], or [[Arequipa]], Chiclayo was inhabited by a largely indigenous population rather than Spanish colonizers.\n\n===Republican era===\nDuring the [[Peruvian War of Independence]], Chiclayo supported General [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]'s liberating army with soldiers, weapons, horses, and other resources, under the supervision of the most progressive creole, Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz.\n\nAfter independence, Chiclayo was still a small village. In 1827, Chiclayo was elevated to the level of villa.\n\nOn 15 April 1835, Chiclayo was proclaimed a city by then-president [[Felipe Santiago Salaverry]], who declared it a \"Heroic City\" in recognition of the services its people rendered in the War of Independence. The next day, the [[Chiclayo Province]] was organized, with Chiclayo designated as its capital.\n\n===Modern Chiclayo===\nToday, Chiclayo is an important Peruvian city, the financial and commercial capital of Northern Peru. Its strategic geographic location makes it a rail, communications, and automotive hub. Modern touches include large supermarkets, banking chains, warehouses, hospitals, clinics, and galleries.<ref name=Cabrejos>{{cite news|first=Juan|last=Cabrejos|title=Ra\u00edces mochicas de Chiclayo, perla del norte del Per\u00fa|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2012-04-21-raices-mochicas-de-chiclayo-perla-del-norte-del-peru-noticia_474184.html|newspaper=El Comercio|accessdate=29 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nChiclayo is also known as the \"City of Friendship\" and ''Perla del Norte'' (\"Pearl of the North\") of Per\u00fa.<ref name=Cabrejos />\n\n== Municipal administration ==\nIn Chiclayo, the mayor is the head of government. The mayor is democratically elected for a period of four years. Each district also has a mayor, under the supervision of the mayor of Chiclayo.

Peripheral to the central city are three other districts: [[Pimentel District|Pimentel]], [[Pomalca District|Pomalca]], and [[Reque District|Reque]]. Districts are subdivided into housing developments. The total land mass is 252.39&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nAdding Pimentel, Pomalca, and Reque to the City of Chiclayo was proposed by a 1992 [[urban development]] plan called \"Chiclayo 2020\". The program was superseded in 2016 by the Plan de Acondicionamiento Territorial (PAT) and Plan de Desarrollo Urbano (PDU).<ref>{{cite web | title=Municipalidad Provincial de Chiclayo Planes Urbanos | website=Municipalidad Provincial de Chiclayo | url=https://www.munichiclayo.gob.pe/index.php?tipo=lpubli&menu=82 | language=es | access-date=2019-01-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Metropolitan area ===\n{{main|Chiclayo metropolitan area}}\nChiclayo is part of the metropolitan area of Chiclayo-Lambayeque.

Since the city of Chiclayo is located in a tropical zone near the Equator, the weather should be hot, humid, and rainy. However, it mostly resembles a [[subtropical]] climate, being comfortable and dry. This is due to the strong winds called \"cyclones\"{{clarify|reason=This sentence needs clarification. Do you mean tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones?|date=April 2016}} that lower temperature to a moderate climate for most of the year except in the summer months where the temperature rises, so summer is often spent in resorts like Puerto Eten and Pimentel. Periodically, every 7 to 15 years, there are hotter temperatures with much higher rainfall and extreme rise of river water.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Chiclayo (1961\u20131990, extremes 1943\u2013present)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 36.2\n|Feb record high C = 38.0\n|Mar record high C = 36.0\n|Apr record high C = 39.2\n|May record high C = 34.9\n|Jun record high C = 34.7\n|Jul record high C = 35.4\n|Aug record high C = 31.4\n|Sep record high C = 30.5\n|Oct record high C = 30.0\n|Nov record high C = 32.2\n|Dec record high C = 34.0\n|year record high C = 39.2\n|Jan high C = 29.1\n|Feb high C = 30.5\n|Mar high C = 30.3\n|Apr high C = 28.8\n|May high C = 26.6\n|Jun high C = 24.9\n|Jul high C = 23.6\n|Aug high C = 23.4\n|Sep high C = 23.6\n|Oct high C = 24.2\n|Nov high C = 25.3\n|Dec high C = 27.1\n|year high C = 26.4\n|Jan mean C = 23.4\n|Feb mean C = 24.3\n|Mar mean C = 24.3\n|Apr mean C = 22.8\n|May mean C = 21.1\n|Jun mean C = 19.9\n|Jul mean C = 18.8\n|Aug mean C = 18.4\n|Sep mean C = 18.3\n|Oct mean C = 18.8\n|Nov mean C = 19.7\n|Dec mean C = 21.8\n|year mean C = 21.0\n|Jan low C = 19.3\n|Feb low C = 20.5\n|Mar low C = 20.5\n|Apr low C = 19.1\n|May low C = 17.8\n|Jun low C = 16.7\n|Jul low C = 15.7\n|Aug low C = 15.3\n|Sep low C = 15.2\n|Oct low C = 15.6\n|Nov low C = 16.3\n|Dec low C = 17.6\n|year low C = 17.5\n|Jan record low C = 15.0\n|Feb record low C = 16.0\n|Mar record low C = 10.5\n|Apr record low C = 12.8\n|May record low C = 11.0\n|Jun record low C = 12.8\n|Jul record low C = 12.0\n|Aug record low C = 11.0\n|Sep record low C = 12.0\n|Oct record low C = 12.0\n|Nov record low C = 10.0\n|Dec record low C = 10.0\n|year record low C = 10.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 5.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 2.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 8.8\n|Apr precipitation mm = 4.0\n|May precipitation mm = 1.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 0.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 0.3\n|Sep precipitation mm = 0.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 0.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 1.9\n|Dec precipitation mm = 0.5\n|year precipitation mm = 26.9\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 1.2\n|Feb precipitation days = 1.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 3.6\n|Apr precipitation days = 1.9\n|May precipitation days = 0.7\n|Jun precipitation days = 0.3\n|Jul precipitation days = 0.0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 0.2\n|Oct precipitation days = 0.4\n|Nov precipitation days = 0.3\n|Dec precipitation days = 0.6\n|year precipitation days = 10.6\n|Jan humidity = 73\n|Feb humidity = 72\n|Mar humidity = 74\n|Apr humidity = 75\n|May humidity = 76\n|Jun humidity = 78\n|Jul humidity = 79\n|Aug humidity = 80\n|Sep humidity = 79\n|Oct humidity = 79\n|Nov humidity = 78\n|Dec humidity = 76\n|year humidity = 77\n|source 1 = NOAA,<ref name = NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/PR/84452.TXT\n| title = Chiclayo Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 23 April 2015}}</ref> Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=1878\n| title = Station Capitan Jose \n| publisher = M\u00e9t\u00e9o Climat \n| language = French \n| accessdate = 27 June 2017}}</ref>\n|source 2 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (mean temperatures 1961\u20131990, precipitation days 1970\u20131990 and humidity 1954\u20131969)<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_844520_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von  Chiclayo, Prov.

FAP Jos\u00e9 A. Qui\u00f1ones Gonzales International Airport]] (IATA: CIX, ICAO: SPHI) is the main airport serving Chiclayo and the surrounding metropolitan area. It is run by ADP, a private airport operator that operates various airports in northern Peru. The airport hosts domestic airlines, international airlines flights, and fuel supply services. The terminal has a runway of 2520 by 45 meters.\n\nFour airlines serve Chiclayo's international airport; [[LATAM Airlines]] and [[Viva Air Per\u00fa]] offering domestic service to [[Lima, Peru|Lima]]. In July 2016, [[Copa Airlines]] began direct flights between Chiclayo and its hub in [[Tocumen International Airport|Panama]], making it the first ever international flight to arrive to the city. US-based [[Spirit Airlines]] has expressed interest in serving Chiclayo from its hub in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida, United States.\n\n===Land===\nChiclayo, because of its location, serves as a point of interconnection for various cities of the Northeast of the country and has various bus companies which service cities such as Lima, Trujillo, [[Piura]], [[Cajamarca]], [[Chota, Peru|Chota]], [[Cutervo District|Cutervo]], [[Bagua, Peru|Bagua]], [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n]], [[Chachapoyas, Peru|Chachapoyas]], and [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]].\n\nTo adequately accommodate the transportation demand, the city is served by two different land terminals, one located towards the southern end of the city and another at the northern end on the [[Panamerican Highway]]. A substantial number of bus companies have their own terminals, many of them located near the downtown of the city and in nearby areas. These interprovincial buses contribute to the congestion experienced in downtown Chiclayo. To try to solve the problem the city government has proposed a plan to build a central station in the city.\n\nRegionally, there are various different public services such as ''combis'', ''cousters'', ''colectivos'', which provide services within the districts and provinces of the department of [[Lambayeque Region|Lambayeque]]. There are also an overwhelming number of private taxis which incessantly honk their horns throughout the downtown area of the city, causing a great deal of unwanted noise pollution.\n\n==Population==\n\n[[Image:PLANO DE LA CIUDAD CHICLAYO Y SU AREA METROPOLITANA.jpg|right|thumb|450px|Chiclayo.]]\n\nAccording to the Census of Population and Housing undertaken in 2007, 574,408 people inhabit the area within Chiclayo's city limits or the six municipalities. The metropolitan area has a population of 930,824; it includes other nearby cities like Monsef\u00fa and Lambayeque in a ten-minute radius by paved highway. Under the thirty-minute range are, in order of hierarchy, Ferre\u00f1afe, Santa Rosa, Eten, Illimo and Tuman. Chiclayo is at the center of the Chancay River delta, in a fertile valley.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:100%;border:0px;text-align:center;line-height:120%\"\n|- bgcolor=silver\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Municipalities of<br />the city\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Area<br />km<sup>2</sup>\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Population<br />(census 2007)\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Households<br />(2007)\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Density<br />(hab/km<sup>2</sup>)\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Elevation<br />[[Metres above sea level|masl]]\n! style=\"background: #6688AA; color: white;\" | Distance from<br />main square (km)\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Chiclayo District|Chiclayo center]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 50.35\n| align=\"right\" | 260,948*\n| align=\"right\" | 60,325\n| align=\"right\" | 5,182.7\n| align=\"right\" | 27\n| align=\"right\" | 0&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz District|Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Ortiz]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 28.22\n| align=\"right\" | 167,717*\n| align=\"right\" | 34,641\n| align=\"right\" | 5,943.2\n| align=\"right\" | 28\n| align=\"right\" | 1.5&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[La Victoria District, Chiclayo|La Victoria]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 29.36\n| align=\"right\" | 77,699*\n| align=\"right\" | 16,447\n| align=\"right\" | 2,646.4\n| align=\"right\" | 23\n| align=\"right\" | 2.4&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Pomalca District|Pomalca]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 80.35\n| align=\"right\" | 23,092*\n| align=\"right\" | 5,802\n| align=\"right\" | 287.39\n| align=\"right\" | 29\n| align=\"right\" | 7&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Reque District|Reque]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 47.03\n| align=\"right\" |12,606*\n| align=\"right\" | 3,664\n| align=\"right\" | 268.04\n| align=\"right\" | 21\n| align=\"right\" | 8&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''[[Pimentel District|Pimentel]]'''\n| align=\"right\" | 66.53\n| align=\"right\" | 32,346*\n| align=\"right\" | 9,301\n| align=\"right\" | 486.2\n| align=\"right\" | 4\n| align=\"right\" | 11.9&nbsp;km\n|-\n| style=\"background: #DDDDDD;\" |'''Total'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''301.84&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''574,408*'''\n| align=\"right\" |  '''130,180'''\n| align=\"right\" | '''1,903.02'''\n| align=\"center\" | \u2014\n| align=\"center\" | \u2014\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |<big>*</big><small>Data from the census taken by the [[INEI]]</small><ref>[http://desa.inei.gob.pe/mapas/bid/ INEI Census 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423164200/http://desa.inei.gob.pe/mapas/bid/ |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\n|}\n\nAccording to the planning director of Chiclayo, by 2020 the [[San Jos\u00e9 District, Lambayeque|San Jose]] district belonging to the [[Lambayeque Province]] will be completely integrated with the city of Chiclayo.

It was home to the ancient civilization of the Moche who created some of the most ingenious monuments and works of art known to ancient Peru. In 1987, royal tombs of ancient Moche rulers were excavated. The artifacts found in the tomb were transferred to the Royal Tomb of Sipan Museum in the city of Lambayeque. Also there are the Brunning Museum and the Sic\u00e1n Museum in Ferre\u00f1afe. These museums display the magnificent ancient artwork produced by the ancient Moche. The pyramids of T\u00facume are also in this area. In 2007, more than 306,000 tourists visited the museums of Lambayeque.[10] There are more than 20 adobe pyramids all of which are 40 meters (131 feet) in height and are in an abundance of vegetation and wildlife. Also in the area is the Chaparr\u00ed Ecological Reserve which has abundant biodiversity.\nThe department of Lambayeque boasts some of the best cuisine in Peru. The most popular dish in this area is duck with rice. The city of Chiclayo, the capital of the department, is the second largest in the Peruvian north and has a vibrant nightlife.\n\n* '''Main Park'''.- Located in the heart of Chiclayo, was built in two sections, it has a pool equipped with three water valves which give rise to three jets of water that form the flag of [[Peru]]. Around her are shopping centers, the RENIEC, its beautiful Cathedral, Hotel Royal, the Old Cinema Tropical and Colonial Theatre and republican buildings and many places where any tourist or citizen might enjoy. Its actual design, with little modification, was built in 1969; a bronze plate still in place attributes the design to Architect Carlos Garrido Lecca.\n* '''Cathedral of Chiclayo'''.- Located in the main square of the city is built in neoclassical style and dates from 1869 by design and drawings of [[Gustave Eiffel]]. The cover is two bodies, supported by Doric columns first is in front of three archways. The second presents Corinthian capitals whose intercolumpios appreciate balconies or bay windows. On both sides of the facade stand steeples topped with cupolas. Inside, three bodies, highlights the beautiful sculpture of Christ poor and the home of Antonio. The cathedral building was finished near 1945; however, the bells were mounted in 1961. \n* '''Municipal Palace'''.- It stood on the north side of the main park, located on Calle San Jose 823. Elegant building construction (1919), cost more than 30,000 pounds of gold; finished in 1924. It has Republican style with large windows and wrought iron gates. It was destroyed partially by a fire caused by a deplorable political brawl between the Deputy Mayor Jose Barreto Sanchez and his opponent then reinstated Mayor Arturo Castillo Chirinos, who tried to recover the position relying on a ruling of the Constitutional Court, just two months of completing the period for which he was elected in October 2006. It has been restored and is operated as a museum. The beautiful Consistorial Room is used several times a year at special ceremonies and events.\n* '''La Ver\u00f3nica's Chapel'''.- Situated at calle Torres Paz 294. Built at the end of the nineteenth century. Declared monumento hist\u00f3rico nacional in 1987. The altars are covered with gold plate and silver.\n* '''Basilica San Antonio'''.- It is situated between the street and Avenida Paz Torres Luis Gonzales. San Antonio called the Discalced Fathers Chiclayo, modern and simple architecture (1949). The main hall is quite large, has arches and, altar, stands the crucified articulated in polychrome wood sculpture.\n* '''El\u00edas Aguirre Square'''.- Located between Calle Elias Aguirre and San Jose. This was the first place that could see the travelers when getting off the train at the \u00c9ten railway station. The statue was made by Peruvian sculptor David Lozano, its construction dates from 1924, and was erected in honor of Commander Elias Aguirre, Chiclayo hero in the Battle of Angamos of 1879.\n* '''Biblioteca Municipal Jos\u00e9 Eufemio Lora y Lora'''.- It has one of the largest facilities of its kind in Peru. His collection is extremely poor and outdated meagerly. It has no services such as a Catalog, Internet and multimedia; also, it lacks professional management and its year budget is under US$18,000. It has no branches (it would take four or five only in the district capital) and should be given priority and a serious investment plan. The collection is under 10,000 mostly old items; it should be of 50.000 to 90.000 titles, organized and constantly renewed.\n*'''Centro C\u00edvico - Civic Center'''.- When the \u00c9ten Railway Station was closed, the land was assignet to the Civic Center. The first building was for the Chiclayo Central Mail (actually SERPOST); next was the Banco de la Naci\u00f3n; then the Biblioteca Municipal JELyL; following the SUNAT; the new Lambayeque Judicial Superior Courts; finally, the Ministerio P\u00fablico (Attorneys) of Lambayeque. It is only eight blocks West of the Main Park, near the new location of the operational Provincial Municipality of Chiclayo, now working at the Mutual Chiclayo building.\n*'''Parque Infantil - Children Park'''.- It is the large and one of the oldests parks in the city, in an area of 1.8 H\u00e1, 4.5 acres.\n\n==Twin towns - sister cities==\nChiclayo has these cities as twin towns-sister cities:\n\n*{{flagdeco|PER}} [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]]\n*{{flagdeco|JPN}} [[Sapporo]], [[Japan]]\n*{{flagdeco|PER}} [[Juanjui]], [[Peru]]\n*{{flagdeco|ENG}} [[Ipswich]], [[England]]\n*{{flagdeco|ROK}} [[Seongnam]], [[South Korea]]\n*{{flagdeco|ARG}} [[Banfield]], [[Argentina]]\n*{{flagdeco|ECU}} [[Cuenca]], [[Ecuador]]\n*{{flagdeco|ECU}} [[Loja]], [[Ecuador]]\n*{{flagdeco|ECU}} [[Cuenca]], [[Ecuador]]\n*{{flagdeco|VEN}} [[Bocono]], [[Venezuela]]\n\n==Famous people from Chiclayo==\n[[File:Augusto B Leguia 2.jpg|thumb|Augusto B.
