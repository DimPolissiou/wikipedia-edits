It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]].

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

The series was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the established BBC medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', and premiered on 12 January 1999. It is set in the same hospital as ''Casualty'' in the fictional city of [[Holby]], and featured occasional crossovers of characters and plots with both ''Casualty'' (which featured dedicated episodes broadcast as ''[[Casualty@Holby City]]'') and the show's 2007 [[police procedural]] spin-off ''[[HolbyBlue]]''.\n\nIts first executive producers were Young and [[Johnathan Young]], who were succeeded by [[Kathleen Hutchison]] from 2002 to 2004, [[Richard Stokes (producer)|Richard Stokes]] from 2004 to 2006, McHale from 2006 to 2010, Belinda Campbell from 2010 to 2011, Johnathan Young from 2011 to 2013, Oliver Kent from 2013 to 2017 and Simon Harper from 2017. ''Holby City'' airs once a week, all year round, and each series now contains 52 episodes.\n\nThe  show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional [[Holby City Hospital]]. It began with eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of around fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Ade Edmondson]] and [[John Michie]].\n\nMcHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmizing]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Twenty-one series of ''Holby City'' have aired with a [[Holby City (series 22)|twenty-second]] currently on a transmission break. The show has run for over 1000 hour-long episodes. It is filmed at the [[BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Hertfordshire]], and has featured special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, ''Holby City'' moved to [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasting.\n\n''Holby City'' has attracted comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within the television and entertainment industry including [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television [[licence fee]] on the programme. The series employs a team of researchers to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. ''Holby City'' has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the [[British Medical Association]] denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an [[accident and emergency]] nurse at the 2008 [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.\n\n''Holby City'' [[List of awards and nominations received by Holby City|has been nominated for over 100 television awards]], of which it has won ten: the 2008 [[British Academy Television Award]] for Best Continuing Drama, one BEFFTA Award, two [[Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy|Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards]], two Music Video and Screen Awards, and four [[Screen Nation]] Awards. The show's [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]] averaged 9.27&nbsp;million viewers, but apart from a rise in its [[Holby City (series 5)|fifth series]], ratings declined year-on-year until 2009, with the [[Holby City (series 11)|eleventh series]] averaging 5.44&nbsp;million viewers. The [[Holby City (series 12)|twelfth series]] saw a small rise to 5.62&nbsp;million. Later series have consistently drawn over 4&nbsp;million viewers per week.\n\n==Production==\nThe show began with only eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of fifteen to twenty main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Adrian Edmondson]], [[Alex Walkinshaw]] and [[Jemma Redgrave]].\n\nMcHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the \"showrunner\" of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmising]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Twenty complete series of ''Holby City'' have aired, and an twenty-first began airing in January 2019. The show has run for over 600 hour-long episodes. It is filmed in studios at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, with the 1960s office building Neptune House being used for multiple exteriors and interiors in the series. It has occasionally featured special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, ''Holby City'' moved to [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasting.\n\nIn September 2016, as part of the broadcaster's Compete Or Compare Strategy, the BBC confirmed the show would be one of the first put up for tender.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Austin|first1=Jamie|title=BBC names first shows in new competitive tendering plan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/BBC-first-shows-competitive-tendering|website=[[BBC]]|accessdate=19 October 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027133911/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/BBC-first-shows-competitive-tendering|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In the tender released in October, it was confirmed the contract, open to independent producers and [[BBC Studios]], would be for 3 series of a minimum 50 episodes per series, delivered from December 2017 with no break in transmission and produced from the existing production base at [[BBC Elstree Centre]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Invitation to Tender (ITT) |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/site/bbc-content-invitation-to-tender-holby-city-october-2016.pdf |website=[[BBC]] |accessdate=19 October 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020052444/http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/site/bbc-content-invitation-to-tender-holby-city-october-2016.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2016 |df= }}</ref> BBC Studios was announced as the winning bidder and will continue to produce the show through to 2020.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC - BBC Studios awarded Holby City tender - Commissioning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/news/articles/bbc-studios-awarded-holby-city-tender-march-2017|accessdate=14 December 2017|work=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\n''Holby City'' was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', which is set in the [[emergency department]] of the fictional Holby City Hospital.<ref name=\"digital spy1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holbycity/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html |title='Holby City's exec producer stands down |last=Green |first=Kris |date=14 December 2009 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=12 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5r17Zw9V1?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s19/holby-city/news/a191337/holby-citys-exec-producer-stands-down.html |archivedate=6 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FILM+of+the+season;+BABE,+Christmas+Day,+BBC1+7pm.-a060945126|title=Film of the season;

The series was created by [[Tony McHale]] and [[Mal Young]] as a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from the established BBC medical drama ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', and premiered on 12 January 1999. It is set in the same hospital as ''Casualty'' in the fictional city of [[Holby]], and featured occasional crossovers of characters and plots with both ''Casualty'' (which featured dedicated episodes broadcast as ''[[Casualty@Holby City]]'') and the show's 2007 [[police procedural]] spin-off ''[[HolbyBlue]]''.\n\nIts first executive producers were Young and [[Johnathan Young]], who were succeeded by [[Kathleen Hutchison]] from 2002 to 2004, [[Richard Stokes (producer)|Richard Stokes]] from 2004 to 2006, McHale from 2006 to 2010, Belinda Campbell from 2010 to 2011, Johnathan Young from 2011 to 2013, Oliver Kent from 2013 to 2017 and Simon Harper from 2017. ''Holby City'' airs once a week, all year round, and each series now contains 52 episodes.\n\nThe  show follows the lives of medical and ancillary staff at the fictional [[Holby City Hospital]]. It began with eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of around fifteen main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Ade Edmondson]] and [[John Michie]].\n\nMcHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmizing]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Twenty-two series of ''Holby City'' have aired. The show has run for over a thousand hour-long episodes. It is filmed at the [[BBC Elstree Centre]] in [[Hertfordshire]], and has featured special episodes filmed on location abroad. From October 2010, ''Holby City'' moved to [[High-definition television|high definition]] broadcasting.\n\n''Holby City'' has attracted comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable, and figures within the television and entertainment industry including [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] director Paul Bolt have accused the BBC of squandering the television [[licence fee]] on the programme. The series employs a team of researchers to ensure medical accuracy, and utilises surgeons from different disciplines to check scripts. Cast members are taught to perform basic medical procedures, and given the opportunity to spend time on real hospital wards for research. ''Holby City'' has, however, been criticised for its lack of realism, with the [[British Medical Association]] denouncing its portrayal of organ donation and unrealistic impression of resuscitation, and an [[accident and emergency]] nurse at the 2008 [[Royal College of Nursing]] conference accusing the show of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS and fuelling compensation culture.\n\n''Holby City'' [[List of awards and nominations received by Holby City|has been nominated for over 100 television awards]], of which it has won ten: the 2008 [[British Academy Television Award]] for Best Continuing Drama, one BEFFTA Award, two [[Ethnic Multicultural Media Academy|Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards]], two Music Video and Screen Awards, and four [[Screen Nation]] Awards. The show's [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]] averaged 9.27&nbsp;million viewers, but apart from a rise in its [[Holby City (series 5)|fifth series]], ratings declined year-on-year until 2009, with the [[Holby City (series 11)|eleventh series]] averaging 5.44&nbsp;million viewers. The [[Holby City (series 12)|twelfth series]] saw a small rise to 5.62&nbsp;million. Later series have consistently drawn over 4&nbsp;million viewers per week.\n\nOn 15 April 2020 Holby city had a break from airing at the usual time on BBC ONE because of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/14/holby-city-stopping-back-12555964/|title=Why is Holby City stopping and when is it back?|date=2020-04-14|website=Metro|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe show began with only eleven main characters in its [[Holby City (series 1)|first series]], all of whom have since left the show. New main characters have been both written in and out of the series since, with a core of fifteen to twenty main actors employed on the serial at any given time. In casting the first series, Young sought out actors who were already well known in the television industry, something which has continued throughout the show's history, with cast members including [[Patsy Kensit]], [[Jane Asher]], [[Robert Powell]], [[Adrian Edmondson]], [[Alex Walkinshaw]] and [[Jemma Redgrave]].\n\nMcHale was the show's lead writer for several years, and was the first British writer ever to become the \"showrunner\" of a major prime time drama. Under his tenure as executive producer, attempts were made at modernising the programme and appealing to a younger audience by taking on the [[filmising]] technique and introducing musical montage segments into each episode. Twenty complete series of ''Holby City'' have aired, and an twenty-first began airing in January 2019. The show has run for over 600 hour-long episodes. It is filmed in studios at the BBC Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, with the 1960s office building Neptune House being used for multiple exteriors and interiors in the series. It has occasionally featured special episodes filmed on location abroad.

They are known for their unusual amalgamation of [[metalcore]] and [[pop punk]]. The band currently consists of vocalist [[Jeremy McKinnon]], rhythm guitarist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussionist/drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.\n\nSigning with [[Indianola Records]] for their first album, ''[[And Their Name Was Treason]]'' (2005), Scruggs was replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded ''[[For Those Who Have Heart]]'' (2007) for [[Victory Records]]. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals before recording and releasing ''[[Homesick (A Day to Remember album)|Homesick]]'' (2009). While promoting ''Homesick'' on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, ''[[What Separates Me from You]]'' (2010), the band went on a [[What Separates Me from You Tour|worldwide tour]] to promote it. Since 2011, the band has been involved in a lawsuit with [[Victory Records]] over their recording contract. In October 2013 the band was given the right to self-release new albums until a final verdict is reached. They released their fifth album, ''[[Common Courtesy (album)|Common Courtesy]]'', that month. In 2016, the band released their sixth album, ''[[Bad Vibrations]]''. They're set to release their seventh album ''You're Welcome'' sometime in 2020 and will be their first release under [[Fueled by Ramen]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years and debut album (2003\u20132006)===\n{{Main|Halos for Heros, Dirt for the Dead|And Their Name Was Treason}}\nAfter all playing in different groups in the [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]] music scene, singer [[Jeremy McKinnon]], guitarists Neil Westfall and [[Tom Denney]], bassist Joshua Woodard, and drummer Bobby Scruggs came together in 2003.<ref name=thecrofoot/> Soon after, the band embarked onto playing well over 200 shows in their first year of touring, making a name for themselves in the U.S.<ref name=thecrofoot/>\n\nThe band [[self-released]] an [[Halos for Heros, Dirt for the Dead|independent EP]]<ref name=NWAHM9>Sharpe-Young 2005, p. 9</ref> titled ''[[Halos for Heros, Dirt for the Dead|Halos for Heroes, Dirt for the Dead]]'' in 2004, which was sold at their live shows.<ref name=punktastic>{{cite web|last=Dayes |first=Kandi |url=http://punktastic.com/interviews/a-day-to-remember-2/ |title=A Day To Remember |publisher=Punktastic |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=July 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035116/http://punktastic.com/interviews/a-day-to-remember-2/ |archivedate=October 12, 2013 }}</ref> Their epononymous and second EP, moreso a demo rather, was released in January 2005; this was a precursor to their debut studio album and contained demo versions of six songs.\n\nThey were signed to [[Indianola Records|Indianola]] in February 2005,<ref name=lambgoat>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/4468/Indianola-Records-signs-two-bands |title=Indianola Records signs two bands &#124; News |publisher=Lambgoat |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002010005/http://lambgoat.com/news/4468/Indianola-Records-signs-two-bands |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> for which they released their debut album, ''[[And Their Name Was Treason]]'' (2005) in May that year.

They are known for their unusual amalgamation of [[metalcore]] and [[pop punk]]. The band currently consists of vocalist [[Jeremy McKinnon]], rhythm guitarist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussionist/drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.\n\nSigning with [[Indianola Records]] for their first album, ''[[And Their Name Was Treason]]'' (2005), Scruggs was replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded ''[[For Those Who Have Heart]]'' (2007) for [[Victory Records]]. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals before recording and releasing ''[[Homesick (A Day to Remember album)|Homesick]]'' (2009). While promoting ''Homesick'' on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, ''[[What Separates Me from You]]'' (2010), the band went on a [[What Separates Me from You Tour|worldwide tour]] to promote it. Since 2011, the band has been involved in a lawsuit with [[Victory Records]] over their recording contract. In October 2013 the band was given the right to self-release new albums until a final verdict is reached. They released their fifth album, ''[[Common Courtesy (album)|Common Courtesy]]'', that month. In 2016, the band released their sixth album, ''[[Bad Vibrations]]''. They're set to release their seventh album ''You're Welcome'' sometime in 2020 and will be their first release under [[Fueled by Ramen]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years and debut album (2003\u20132006)===\n{{Main|Halos for Heros, Dirt for the Dead|And Their Name Was Treason}}\nAfter all playing in different groups in the [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]] music scene, singer [[Jeremy McKinnon]], guitarists Neil Westfall and [[Tom Denney]], bassist Joshua Woodard, and drummer Bobby Scruggs came together in 2003.<ref name=thecrofoot/> Soon after, the band embarked onto playing well over 200 shows in their first year of touring, making a name for themselves in the U.S.<ref name=thecrofoot/>\n\nThe band [[self-released]] an [[Halos for Heros, Dirt for the Dead|independent EP]]<ref name=NWAHM9>Sharpe-Young 2005, p. 9</ref> titled ''[[Halos for Heros, Dirt for the Dead|Halos for Heroes, Dirt for the Dead]]'' in 2004, which was sold at their live shows.<ref name=punktastic>{{cite web|last=Dayes |first=Kandi |url=http://punktastic.com/interviews/a-day-to-remember-2/ |title=A Day To Remember |publisher=Punktastic |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=July 15, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035116/http://punktastic.com/interviews/a-day-to-remember-2/ |archivedate=October 12, 2013 }}</ref> Their epononymous and second EP, moreso a demo rather, was released in January 2005; this was a precursor to their debut studio album and contained demo versions of six songs.\n\nThey were signed to [[Indianola Records|Indianola]] in February 2005,<ref name=lambgoat>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/4468/Indianola-Records-signs-two-bands |title=Indianola Records signs two bands &#124; News |publisher=Lambgoat |date=February 9, 2005 |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002010005/http://lambgoat.com/news/4468/Indianola-Records-signs-two-bands |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}</ref> for which they released their debut album, ''[[And Their Name Was Treason]]'' (2005) in May that year.

In order to obtain these signatures, the document was flown to the United Kingdom (for the Queen's [[royal sign-manual]]) and to the Caribbean (for the signature of Favreau, who was on vacation). This transport to different climates, combined with the quality of the materials with which the proclamation was created, and the subsequent storage and repair methods (including the use of [[Scotch Tape]]) contributed to the deterioration of the document: The gouache was flaking off, leaving gaps in the heraldic designs, most conspicuously on the red maple leaf of the flag design in the centre of the sheet, and the adhesive from the tape had left stains. A desire to have the proclamation as part of a display at the [[Canadian Museum of History|Canadian Museum of Civilization]] marking the flag's 25th anniversary led to its restoration in 1989. The proclamation is today stored in a temperature and humidity controlled, plexiglass case, so as to prevent the vellum from changing dimensionally.<ref name=Proc />\n\n==Alternative flags==\nAs a symbol of the nation's membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the Royal Union Flag is an official Canadian flag and is flown on certain occasions.<ref name=\"royal union\">{{cite web| date=January 1, 2003| url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/etiquette/4_e.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=The Royal Union Flag| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=May 20, 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506083650/http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/etiquette/4_e.cfm| archivedate=May 6, 2006}}</ref> Regulations require federal installations to fly the Royal Union Flag beside the national flag when physically possible, using a second flagpole, on the following days: [[Commonwealth Day]] (the second Monday in March), [[Victoria Day]] (the same date as the [[Queen's Official Birthday#Canada|Canadian sovereign's official birthday]]), and the anniversary of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (December 11).

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.
