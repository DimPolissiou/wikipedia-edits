He said \"I paint ideas, not things.\"<ref name=ELS /> Watts became famous in his lifetime for his allegorical works, such as ''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'' and ''Love and Life''. These paintings were intended to form part of an epic symbolic cycle called the \"House of Life\", in which the emotions and aspirations of life would all be represented in a universal symbolic language.\n\n== Life ==\nWatts was born in [[Marylebone]] in central London on the birthday of [[George Frederic Handel]] (after whom he was named), to the second wife of a poor piano-maker. Delicate in health and with his mother dying while he was still young, he was home-schooled by his father in a conservative interpretation of Christianity as well as via the classics such as the ''[[Iliad]].''  The former put him off conventional religion for life, while the latter was a continual influence on his art. He showed artistic promise very early, learning sculpture from the age of 10 with [[William Behnes]], starting to study devotedly the [[Elgin Marbles]] (later writing \"It was from them alone that I learned\") and then enrolling as a student at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] at the age of 18. He first exhibited at the Academy in 1837.<ref name=ELS>[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward.]] (1972) ''Symbolist Art''. London: [[Thames & Hudson]], p. 47. {{ISBN|0-500-20125-0}}</ref> He also began his portraiture career, receiving patronage from his close contemporary [[Alexander Constantine Ionides]], who later came to be a close friend.\n\nHe came to the public eye with a drawing entitled ''Caractacus'', which was entered for a competition to design murals for the new [[Palace of Westminster#Frescoes|Houses of Parliament]] at [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] in 1843. Watts won a first prize in the competition, which was intended to promote narrative paintings on patriotic subjects, appropriate to the nation's legislature. In the end Watts made little contribution to the Westminster decorations, but from it he conceived his vision of a building covered with murals representing the spiritual and social evolution of humanity.<ref>The complex history surrounding the decoration is best summarized by\n[[T. S. R. Boase]], ''The Decorations of the New Palace of Westminster 1841\u20131863'', in: ''Journal of the [[Warburg Institute|Warburg]] and [[Courtauld Institute|Courtauld]] Institutes'' 17:1954, pp. 319\u201358.</ref>\n\nThe prize from the Westminster competition did, however, fund a long visit to Italy from 1843 onwards, where Watts stayed and became friends with the British ambassador [[Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland]] and his wife [[Augusta Fox, Baroness Holland|Augusta]] at their homes in [[Casa Feroni]] and the [[Villa Careggi]]. Also while in Italy Watts began producing landscapes and was inspired by [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel]] and [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]'s [[Scrovegni Chapel]]. In 1847, while still in Italy, Watts entered a new competition for the Houses of Parliament with his image of [[Alfred the Great]], ''Alfred Inciting the Saxons to Prevent the Landing of the Danes by Encountering them at Sea'', on a patriotic subject but using [[Phideas|Phidean]] inspiration. Leaving Florence in April 1847 for what was intended to be a brief return to London, he ended up staying. Back in Britain he was unable to obtain a building in which to carry out his plan of a grand fresco based on his Italian experiences, though he did produce a 45&nbsp;ft by 40&nbsp;ft fresco on the upper part of the east wall of the Great Hall of [[Lincoln's Inn]] entitled ''Justice, A Hemicycle of Lawgivers'' (completed 1859), inspired by [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]''. In consequence most of his major works are conventional oil paintings, some of which were intended as studies for the House of Life.\n\nIn his studio he met [[Henry Thoby Prinsep]] (for 16 years a member of the [[Council of India]]) and his wife Sara (n\u00e9e Pattle). Watts thus joined the [[Prinsep]] circle of [[bohemianism|bohemians]], including Sara's seven sisters (including Virginia, with whom Watts fell in love but who married [[Charles Somers-Cocks, 3rd Earl Somers|Charles, Viscount Eastnor]] in 1850), and [[Julia Margaret Cameron]]. Previously staying at 48 Cambridge Street, and then in Mayfair, in 1850 he helped the Prinseps into a 21-year lease on [[Little Holland House]], and stayed there with them and their [[salon (gathering)|salon]] for the next 21 years. (The building was the dower house on the Hollands' London estate in [[Kensington]], near the house of [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Lord Leighton]].)\n\nOne of only two pupils Watts ever accepted was Henry's son [[Valentine Cameron Prinsep]]; the other was [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]] \u2013 both remained friends, but neither became a major artist.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbTd5_RuzisC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=%22virginia+woolf%22+%22john+prinsep%22&source=web&ots=8MIvC8zgm2&sig=E6CiJ7PMAQLCKzCra2kdZMiMOg0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=5&ct=result|title=Clouds}}</ref> While living as tenant at Little Holland House, Watts's epic paintings were exhibited in [[Whitechapel]] by his friend the social reformer Canon [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel Barnett]], and he finally received a commission for the Houses of Parliament, completing his ''The Triumph of the Red Cross Knight'' (from ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'') in 1852\u201353. He also took a short trip back to Italy in 1853 (including Venice, where Titian became yet more of an inspiration) and with [[Charles Thomas Newton]] to excavate [[Halicarnassus]] in 1856\u201357, via Constantinople and the Greek islands.\n\nIn the 1860s, Watts' work shows the influence of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], often emphasising sensuous pleasure and rich colour. Among these paintings is a portrait of his young wife, the actress [[Ellen Terry]], who was 30 years his junior \u2013 having been introduced by mutual friend [[Tom Taylor]], they married on 20 February 1864, just seven days short of her 17th birthday. When she eloped with another man after less than a year of marriage, Watts was obliged to divorce her. Watts's association with Rossetti and the [[Aesthetic movement]] altered during the 1870s, as his work increasingly combined [[Classicism|Classical]] traditions with a deliberately agitated and troubled surface, to suggest the dynamic energies of life and evolution, as well as the tentative and transitory qualities of life. These works formed part of a revised version of the House of Life, influenced by the ideas of [[Max M\u00fcller]], the founder of [[comparative religion]]. Watts hoped to trace the evolving \"mythologies of the races [of the world]\" in a grand synthesis of spiritual ideas with modern science, especially [[Darwinian]] evolution.\n[[File:Assistants and George Frederic Watts - Hope - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'', painted in 1886 and given to the nation in 1897]]\n\nWith the lease on Little Holland House nearing its end and the building soon to be demolished, in the early 1870s he commissioned a new London home nearby from [[C. R. Cockerell]]: New Little Holland House (backing onto the estate of Lord Leighton), and acquired a house at [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight]] \u2013 his friends Julia Margaret Cameron and [[Lord Tennyson]] already had homes on the island. To maintain his friendship with the Prinsep family as their children began leaving home, he built The Briary for them near Freshwater, and adopted their relative [[Blanche Clogstoun]]. In 1877, his [[decree nisi]] from Ellen Terry finally came through, and the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] was opened by his friend [[Coutts Lindsay]]. This was to prove his ideal venue for the next ten years.\n\nIn 1886, at the age of 69, Watts remarried, to [[Mary Fraser Tytler]], a Scottish designer and potter, then aged 36. In 1891 he bought land near [[Compton, Guildford|Compton]], south of [[Guildford]], in [[Surrey]]. The couple named the house \"Limnerslease\" (combining the words \"limner\" or artist with \"leasen\" or glean) and built the [[Watts Gallery]] nearby, a museum dedicated to his work \u2013 the first (and now the only) purpose-built gallery in Britain devoted to a single artist \u2013 which opened in April 1904, shortly before his death, and received a major expansion between 2006 and 2011.\n\nWatts's wife Mary had designed the nearby earlier [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]], which Watts paid for; he also painted a version of ''[[The All-Pervading]]'' for the [[altar]] only three months before he died.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.compton-surrey.co.uk/#/wattschapel/4518411494|title=Watts Chapel|publisher=compton-surrey.co.uk|accessdate=19 December 2008}}</ref> Both Limnerslease and the chapel are now maintained, and the house owned, by the Watts Gallery. In 2016 Watts' studio in the house re-opened, restored as far as possible using photographs from Watts' lifetime, as part of the Watts Gallery, and the main residential section can be visited on a guided tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wattsgallery.org.uk/en-gb/about-us/artists-village/watts-studios/|title=Watts Studios \u2013 Watts Gallery|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMany of his paintings are owned by [[Tate Britain]] \u2013 he donated 18 of his symbolic paintings to Tate in 1897, and three more in 1900. Some of these have been loaned to the Watts Gallery in recent years, and are on display there.\n\nRefusing the baronetcy twice offered him by [[Queen Victoria]], he was elected as an Academician to the Royal Academy in 1867 and accepted to be one of the original members of the new [[Order of Merit]] (OM) in 1902 \u2013 in his own words, on behalf of all English artists. The order was announced in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}</ref> and he received the insignia from King [[Edward VII]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 8 August 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36842| }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27470|page=5679|date=2 September 1902|}}</ref>\n[[File:Cape Town Rhodes memorial energy statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of ''[[Physical Energy (sculpture)|Physical Energy]]'' at [[Rhodes Memorial]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.]]\nIn his late paintings, Watts' creative aspirations mutate into mystical images such as ''The Sower of the Systems'', in which Watts seems to anticipate [[abstract art]]. This painting depicts God as a barely visible shape in an energised pattern of stars and nebulae. Some of Watts' other late works also seem to anticipate the paintings of [[Picasso's Blue Period]]. He was also admired as a portrait painter. His portraits were of the most important men and women of the day, intended to form a \"House of Fame\". Many of these are now in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]: 17 were donated in 1895, with more than 30 more added subsequently. In his portraits Watts sought to create a tension between disciplined stability and the power of action. He was also notable for emphasising the signs of strain and wear on his sitter's faces.

He began work on the plaster model for ''Physical Energy'' (Watts Gallery) around 1883 and was still working on it at the time of his death in 1904. In that year the first bronze cast of the work became the artist's last submission to the Royal Academy's summer exhibition. It marked a new prominence for the courtyard of Burlington House as a site for dramatic contemporary sculpture, a role continued today by the Annenberg Courtyard. ''Physical Energy'' is an allegory of the human need for new challenges \u2013 of our instinct to always be scanning the horizon, looking towards the future. Watts said it is \"a symbol of that restless physical impulse to seek the still unachieved in the domain of material things\".\n\n''Physical Energy'' was the culmination of Watts's ambition in the field of public sculpture, embodying the artist's belief that access to great art would bring immense benefits to the country at large. Having completed a commission for the [[Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster|Duke of Westminster]] for an equestrian monument to commemorate his ancestor, [[Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester|Hugh Lupus]], in 1883 Watts set to work on a new plaster model of another horse and rider, without specific reference to any individual. Reinvigorating the rhetoric of the equestrian monument for the modern age, Watts conceived ''Physical Energy'' as an allegory of human vitality and humanity's ceaseless struggle for betterment.\n\nThe plaster model of ''Physical Energy'' was part of the artist's bequest to Watts Gallery upon his death in 1904.

It then travelled to Cape Town to form part of a memorial to the founder of Rhodesia (now [[Zimbabwe]]), [[Cecil Rhodes]].  In 1907, a posthumous cast was made and sited in Kensington Gardens, London, fulfilling the artist's intention to gift the work to the British Government, insisting that it should be \"for the nation\" and displayed \"somewhere in London\".

He said \"I paint ideas, not things.\"<ref name=ELS /> Watts became famous in his lifetime for his allegorical works, such as ''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'' and ''Love and Life''. These paintings were intended to form part of an epic symbolic cycle called the \"House of Life\", in which the emotions and aspirations of life would all be represented in a universal symbolic language.\n\n== Life ==\nWatts was born in [[Marylebone]] in central London on the birthday of [[George Frederic Handel]] (after whom he was named), to the second wife of a poor piano-maker. Delicate in health and with his mother dying while he was still young, he was home-schooled by his father in a conservative interpretation of Christianity as well as via the classics such as the ''[[Iliad]].''  The former put him off conventional religion for life, while the latter was a continual influence on his art. He showed artistic promise very early, learning sculpture from the age of 10 with [[William Behnes]], starting to study devotedly the [[Elgin Marbles]] (later writing \"It was from them alone that I learned\") and then enrolling as a student at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] at the age of 18. He first exhibited at the Academy in 1837.<ref name=ELS>[[Edward Lucie-Smith|Lucie-Smith, Edward.]] (1972) ''Symbolist Art''. London: [[Thames & Hudson]], p. 47. {{ISBN|0-500-20125-0}}</ref> He also began his portraiture career, receiving patronage from his close contemporary [[Alexander Constantine Ionides]], who later came to be a close friend.\n\nHe came to the public eye with a drawing entitled ''Caractacus'', which was entered for a competition to design murals for the new [[Palace of Westminster#Frescoes|Houses of Parliament]] at [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] in 1843. Watts won a first prize in the competition, which was intended to promote narrative paintings on patriotic subjects, appropriate to the nation's legislature. In the end Watts made little contribution to the Westminster decorations, but from it he conceived his vision of a building covered with murals representing the spiritual and social evolution of humanity.<ref>The complex history surrounding the decoration is best summarized by\n[[T. S. R. Boase]], ''The Decorations of the New Palace of Westminster 1841\u20131863'', in: ''Journal of the [[Warburg Institute|Warburg]] and [[Courtauld Institute|Courtauld]] Institutes'' 17:1954, pp. 319\u201358.</ref>\n\nThe prize from the Westminster competition did, however, fund a long visit to Italy from 1843 onwards, where Watts stayed and became friends with the British ambassador [[Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland]] and his wife [[Augusta Fox, Baroness Holland|Augusta]] at their homes in [[Casa Feroni]] and the [[Villa Careggi]]. Also while in Italy Watts began producing landscapes and was inspired by [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel]] and [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]'s [[Scrovegni Chapel]]. In 1847, while still in Italy, Watts entered a new competition for the Houses of Parliament with his image of [[Alfred the Great]], ''Alfred Inciting the Saxons to Prevent the Landing of the Danes by Encountering them at Sea'', on a patriotic subject but using [[Phideas|Phidean]] inspiration. Leaving Florence in April 1847 for what was intended to be a brief return to London, he ended up staying. Back in Britain he was unable to obtain a building in which to carry out his plan of a grand fresco based on his Italian experiences, though he did produce a 45&nbsp;ft by 40&nbsp;ft fresco on the upper part of the east wall of the Great Hall of [[Lincoln's Inn]] entitled ''Justice, A Hemicycle of Lawgivers'' (completed 1859), inspired by [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]''. In consequence most of his major works are conventional oil paintings, some of which were intended as studies for the House of Life.\n\nIn his studio he met [[Henry Thoby Prinsep]] (for 16 years a member of the [[Council of India]]) and his wife Sara (n\u00e9e Pattle). Watts thus joined the [[Prinsep]] circle of [[bohemianism|bohemians]], including Sara's seven sisters (including Virginia, with whom Watts fell in love but who married [[Charles Somers-Cocks, 3rd Earl Somers|Charles, Viscount Eastnor]] in 1850), and [[Julia Margaret Cameron]]. Previously staying at 48 Cambridge Street, and then in Mayfair, in 1850 he helped the Prinseps into a 21-year lease on [[Little Holland House]], and stayed there with them and their [[salon (gathering)|salon]] for the next 21 years. (The building was the dower house on the Hollands' London estate in [[Kensington]], near the house of [[Frederic Leighton, 1st Baron Leighton|Lord Leighton]].)\n\nOne of only two pupils Watts ever accepted was Henry's son [[Valentine Cameron Prinsep]]; the other was [[John Roddam Spencer Stanhope]] \u2013 both remained friends, but neither became a major artist.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gbTd5_RuzisC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=%22virginia+woolf%22+%22john+prinsep%22&source=web&ots=8MIvC8zgm2&sig=E6CiJ7PMAQLCKzCra2kdZMiMOg0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=5&ct=result|title=Clouds}}</ref> While living as tenant at Little Holland House, Watts's epic paintings were exhibited in [[Whitechapel]] by his friend the social reformer Canon [[Samuel Barnett (reformer)|Samuel Barnett]], and he finally received a commission for the Houses of Parliament, completing his ''The Triumph of the Red Cross Knight'' (from ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'') in 1852\u201353. He also took a short trip back to Italy in 1853 (including Venice, where Titian became yet more of an inspiration) and with [[Charles Thomas Newton]] to excavate [[Halicarnassus]] in 1856\u201357, via Constantinople and the Greek islands.\n\nIn the 1860s, Watts' work shows the influence of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], often emphasising sensuous pleasure and rich colour. Among these paintings is a portrait of his young wife, the actress [[Ellen Terry]], who was 30 years his junior \u2013 having been introduced by mutual friend [[Tom Taylor]], they married on 20 February 1864, just seven days short of her 17th birthday. When she eloped with another man after less than a year of marriage, Watts was obliged to divorce her. Watts's association with Rossetti and the [[Aesthetic movement]] altered during the 1870s, as his work increasingly combined [[Classicism|Classical]] traditions with a deliberately agitated and troubled surface, to suggest the dynamic energies of life and evolution, as well as the tentative and transitory qualities of life. These works formed part of a revised version of the House of Life, influenced by the ideas of [[Max M\u00fcller]], the founder of [[comparative religion]]. Watts hoped to trace the evolving \"mythologies of the races [of the world]\" in a grand synthesis of spiritual ideas with modern science, especially [[Darwinian]] evolution.\n[[File:Assistants and George Frederic Watts - Hope - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'', painted in 1886 and given to the nation in 1897]]\n\nWith the lease on Little Holland House nearing its end and the building soon to be demolished, in the early 1870s he commissioned a new London home nearby from [[C. R. Cockerell]]: New Little Holland House (backing onto the estate of Lord Leighton), and acquired a house at [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight]] \u2013 his friends Julia Margaret Cameron and [[Lord Tennyson]] already had homes on the island. To maintain his friendship with the Prinsep family as their children began leaving home, he built The Briary for them near Freshwater, and adopted their relative [[Blanche Clogstoun]]. In 1877, his [[decree nisi]] from Ellen Terry finally came through, and the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] was opened by his friend [[Coutts Lindsay]]. This was to prove his ideal venue for the next ten years.\n\nIn 1886, at the age of 69, Watts remarried, to [[Mary Fraser Tytler]], a Scottish designer and potter, then aged 36. In 1891 he bought land near [[Compton, Guildford|Compton]], south of [[Guildford]], in [[Surrey]]. The couple named the house \"Limnerslease\" (combining the words \"limner\" or artist with \"leasen\" or glean) and built the [[Watts Gallery]] nearby, a museum dedicated to his work \u2013 the first (and now the only) purpose-built gallery in Britain devoted to a single artist \u2013 which opened in April 1904, shortly before his death, and received a major expansion between 2006 and 2011.\n\nWatts's wife Mary had designed the nearby earlier [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]], which Watts paid for; he also painted a version of ''[[The All-Pervading]]'' for the [[altar]] only three months before he died.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.compton-surrey.co.uk/#/wattschapel/4518411494|title=Watts Chapel|publisher=compton-surrey.co.uk|accessdate=19 December 2008}}</ref> Both Limnerslease and the chapel are now maintained, and the house owned, by the Watts Gallery. In 2016 Watts' studio in the house re-opened, restored as far as possible using photographs from Watts' lifetime, as part of the Watts Gallery, and the main residential section can be visited on a guided tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wattsgallery.org.uk/en-gb/about-us/artists-village/watts-studios/|title=Watts Studios \u2013 Watts Gallery|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMany of his paintings are owned by [[Tate Britain]] \u2013 he donated 18 of his symbolic paintings to Tate in 1897, and three more in 1900. Some of these have been loaned to the Watts Gallery in recent years, and are on display there.\n\nRefusing the baronetcy twice offered him by [[Queen Victoria]], he was elected as an Academician to the Royal Academy in 1867 and accepted to be one of the original members of the new [[Order of Merit]] (OM) in 1902 \u2013 in his own words, on behalf of all English artists. The order was announced in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}</ref> and he received the insignia from King [[Edward VII]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 8 August 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36842| }}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27470|page=5679|date=2 September 1902|}}</ref>\n[[File:Cape Town Rhodes memorial energy statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of ''[[Physical Energy (sculpture)|Physical Energy]]'' at [[Rhodes Memorial]] in [[Cape Town]], South Africa.]]\nIn his late paintings, Watts' creative aspirations mutate into mystical images such as ''The Sower of the Systems'', in which Watts seems to anticipate [[abstract art]]. This painting depicts God as a barely visible shape in an energised pattern of stars and nebulae. Some of Watts' other late works also seem to anticipate the paintings of [[Picasso's Blue Period]]. He was also admired as a portrait painter. His portraits were of the most important men and women of the day, intended to form a \"House of Fame\". Many of these are now in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]: 17 were donated in 1895, with more than 30 more added subsequently. In his portraits Watts sought to create a tension between disciplined stability and the power of action. He was also notable for emphasising the signs of strain and wear on his sitter's faces. Sitters included [[Charles Dilke]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] , [[James Martineau]], and [[William Morris]].\n\n===''Physical Energy''===\n\nAlthough best known as a painter, Watts was also a sculptor.

When spoken of in association with the neighbouring [[Hala'ib Triangle]], it is sometimes referred to as the '''Bir Tawil Triangle''', despite the area's [[quadrilateral]] shape; the two \"triangles\" border at a [[quadripoint]].\n\nIts ''[[terra nullius]]'' status results from a discrepancy between the straight political boundary between Egypt and Sudan established in 1899, and the irregular administrative boundary established in 1902. Egypt asserts the political boundary, and Sudan asserts the administrative boundary, with the result that the Hala'ib Triangle is claimed by both and Bir Tawil by neither.

As a result, both states claim the [[Hala'ib Triangle]] and neither claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area, which is only a tenth the size, and has no permanent settlements or access to the sea.

She attended [[University High School (Los Angeles)|University High School]] in [[Los Angeles]] during her senior year and was a member of the school choir. She studied theatre at [[HB Studio]]<ref>[https://hbstudio.org/about-hb-studio/alumni/ HB Studio Alumni]</ref> in [[New York City]].\n\n==Career==\n===Stage and television===\nLuft made her show business debut at age 11 singing \"[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town|Santa Claus Is Coming to Town]]\" on the 1963 Christmas episode of Garland's [[CBS]] television series, ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''. Siblings Liza Minnelli and Joey Luft also appeared.\n\nLuft soon joined the family act on a summer concert tour, the highlight being Garland's third and final appearance at New York City's famed [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] on Broadway in 1967.<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2947 ''Judy Garland: At Home at the Palace'' (show)] at [[Internet Broadway Database]]</ref> In this month-long engagement,  Garland \"shared\" the bill with Luft (then 14 years old) and Joey (12 years old).
