At this meeting, Ray P. Warren was elected as the group's first conductor. In a bid to secure an adequate rehearsal venue from the university for the newly formed band, dePont volunteered the band to provide the music for the [[University_of_Michigan_Law_School|Law School's]] upcoming observance of [[Washington's Birthday]]. This was considered to be one of the most important events of the school year. Delivering on dePont's promise, the band's first public performance was on-stage in University Hall at that celebration on February 22, 1897. University president [[James Burrill Angell]] was satisfied with the band's performance and granted dePont's request for rehearsal space in Room A of University Hall. By 1898, the band was being referred to as the \"University of Michigan Band\" and had become an integral part of the Michigan tradition by playing at the football games.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/marching-band-about-html.aspx?path=spirit | title=About the Michigan Marching Band | website=mgoblue.com | publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Michigan | access-date=2019-03-06 | quote=By the fall of 1898, the presence of the band at the football games had become an integral part of the Michigan football tradition.}}</ref>\n=== 1900 - 1929 ===\nIn these early years, the university provided no financial support for the band. The ensemble disbanded in early 1903 amid a series of leadership changes, but reunited that fall before performing in its first \"snow bowl\" at the game against the [[University of Chicago]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The following year, on October 18, 1904, the band reintroduced the playing of ''[[The Victors]]'' at Michigan football games. Eugene J. Fischer became the band's conductor with the start of the 1906 season.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />[[File:Michigan Marching Band entering Ferry Field, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|The 1920 Michigan Marching Band from the Michiganensian yearbook 1921.]]\n\nAfter Michigan moved out of the [[Big Ten Conference#History|Western Football Conference]] during the 1911 season, [[J. Fred Lawton]] and Earl Vincent Moore composed the fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]],\" which became an immediate hit. Fischer made the song a standard part of the band's football game performances. [[George Olsen]] became the marching band's first drum major in 1914 and inadvertently started the \"[[Michigan_Marching_Band#The Goal Post Toss|Goal Post Toss]]\" tradition during the game against [[Syracuse University]]. During this time, the band was also changing its performance style to incorporate military drill techniques. Thanks to Fischer's prolonged efforts to secure university funding for the band, Wilfred Wilson was hired by the university in 1915 as the ensemble's new conductor.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />\n\nThe Nu Chapter of the band fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], was established to promote and serve the University bands in 1925. Around this time, the university purchased Morris Hall and allocated it as the band's permanent \"home.\" By 1926, membership in the band had grown to nearly 100 musicians prior to Fischer's departure. Nicholas Falcone was appointed as his successor in 1927.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" /> That same year, construction of [[Michigan Stadium]] was completed and dedicated.<ref name=\"Big House History\">{{cite web| title=The Michigan Stadium Story | url=https://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/stadium/stadtext/openday.htm | date=2006-04-10 | publisher=The University of Michigan | accessdate=2019-05-06}}</ref> The band became an adjunct part of the University in 1929.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />\n [[File:Michigan Marching Band performs Yellow and Blue at halftime of the Chicago game, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|'''Michigan Marching Band performs Yellow and Blue at halftime of the Chicago game, 1920''']]\n\n=== 1930 - 1949 ===\nDuring the Michigan-Ohio State football game in 1932, the MMB performed the first \"[[Ohio State University Marching Band#Script Ohio|script Ohio]].\" That field formation was subsequently embellished by the [[Ohio State University Marching Band]], which continues to perform it today.<ref>{{cite web |title=Script Ohio Controversy |work=OSU v Michigan |publisher=Ohio State University Archives |date=2002-10-12 |url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/OSUvsMichigan/scriptohio.htm |accessdate=2019-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026090107/http://library.osu.edu/sites/archives/OSUvsMichigan/scriptohio.htm |archivedate=2006-10-26}}</ref> The band performed at the [[Century of Progress]] exhibition in Chicago in October 1933.<ref>{{cite web | title=Varsity Band Plans Concert at Exhibition | publisher=The Michigan Daily | date=1933-10-24 |url=https://digital.bentley.umich.edu/midaily/mdp.39015071755941/187 |accessdate=2019-05-08}}</ref> Falcone was on medical leave in 1934, and Bernard Hirsch served as acting conductor. Falcone resigned in 1935 after a long struggle with hearing loss, and [[William D. Revelli]], director of the award-winning Hobart, Indiana, high school band, was hired as his successor. In 1936, the term, \"Marching Band\" came into use referring to the portion of the band that played at football games. This group had previously been known as the \"Varsity Band\" or the \"Fighting Band.\" Upon his appointment, Revelli required all male wind instrument majors at the university to participate in the Marching Band. To raise funds for a new band facility, Revelli oversaw an all-campus talent show known as \"Varsity Night.\" This annual event would later evolve into the Band-O-Rama concert series.<ref>{{Citation | title=School of Music, Theatre & Dance (University of Michigan) Publications | publisher=UM Libraries | date=1996 | page=13 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0nlAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PT615&ots=K6gMspPEf2&dq=-site%3Amichiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&pg=PT615#v=onepage&q=-site:michiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&f=false | access-date=2019-05-06 }}</ref>\n[[File:University of Michigan Band halftime show 1949.jpg|thumb|389x389px|1949 Michigan Band performing a halftime show in Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor MI.]]\n\nRevelli formally aligned the band with the School of Music in 1940.

By the end of the war, the band's home had been relocated to [[Harris Hall]] in 1946 and membership in the band stood at 131 men in 1947. During that season, the band first appeared on television in the game against [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] on September 27.

The Lambda Chapter of the band sorority, [[Tau Beta Sigma]] was established in 1948. In 1949, Revelli and his assistant director, Jack K.

Pasquale is the current director of the Michigan Marching Band.<ref name=\"MDaily-Pasquale\" />\n\n====Associate Director====\nDr. Richard Frey is the Associate Director of the Michigan Marching Band. He succeeds Dr. Andrea Brown in the position after her departure to assume the Assistant Director of Bands position at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. Dr. Frey was most recently the Assistant Director of Bands at [[Colorado State University]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. He received the Doctor of Musical Arts degree in Instrumental Conducting from [[Michigan State University]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://smtd.umich.edu/about/faculty-profiles/richard-frey/ |title=Richard Frey &#124; U-M School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance |website=smtd.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance |access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/presidentloh/status/973247012954083328 |author=Wallace D.

Graduate students in the music school or former MMB members that are graduate students in other University programs are hired to help direct the MMB and also to oversee student staff positions.  The MMB also has a color guard instructor, Joan Noble-Pruett, and a percussion instructor, Chuck Ricotta, that each oversee their respective sections to ensure the visual and rhythmic elements of the band are perfect.<ref>{{Citation | title=Band-O-Rama: Victors Valiant! | place=Ann Arbor, MI | publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance | year=2017 | page=11 | language=English | url=https://issuu.com/umichsmtd/docs/bor17_final/10 }}</ref>\n\n====Drum Major====\nThe Michigan Marching Band has one drum major, commonly referred to as the \"Man Up Front\" or \"Woman Up Front,\" for the entire ensemble. Like in most [[Big_Ten_Conference|Big Ten]] bands, the MMB drum major is not a conducting position. The drum major provides whistle commands to provide song tempos and parade instructions. While it is not required of the position, most drum majors perform twirling routines during the halftime show. The drum major is also responsible for teaching proper marching techniques during Band Week. The drum major is best known for the [[Michigan Marching Band#The back bend|back bend]] performed during pregame.\n\nAuditions for this position are held yearly in a two-phase process. The first phase is held in front of the MMB staff which narrows the field of candidates. The second phase is held at the band's spring meeting and the final vote is decided by the current members of the MMB.\n\n====Section Leaders====\nSection leaders are the heads of their sections and are responsible for the music performance. They hold weekly music rehearsals for their section. Section leaders are determined by the staff and generally announced at the \"Spring Meeting,\" traditionally held on the last day of Winter semester.\n\n====Rank Leaders====\nRank Leaders are determined in phases. Generally each year during the final stages of the winter semester, band members are invited to nominate people in their own section to be considered for a Rank Leader Candidate spot. Rank Leader Candidates are then selected by the staff and announced during the Spring Meeting or sometimes later. Rank Leader Candidates then participate in a retreat to learn how to teach the marching technique before Band Week begins. Rank Leaders help the incoming members learn the marching techniques, then have two days of review with all other returning members and the incoming members. Band members are then given the chance to fill out Rank Leader evaluations. The staff then narrows down the potential candidates to the actual Rank Leaders for the year, taking the evaluations into account.\n\nDuring the season, Rank Leaders are in charge of the marching position and style of 12 members on the field. They are given full drill charts to ensure that their rank members are in formation. To save paper, regular members are given coordinate sheets to give their position on the field by numbers rather than graphically.\n\n====Performance Block====\nThe Performance Block is the subset of the MMB that performs pre-game and halftime.  An additional subset is called \"halftime only\" which adds to the performance block for halftime.  The halftime block usually consists of an additional 6 piccolos, 6 alto saxophones, 12 horns, 3 bass drums, 4 snare drums, 4 tenor drums, 6 cymbals, and 6 to 12 sousaphones (depending on the drill requirements).\n\nThe rank leaders along with the MMB staff decide which members in block are to be challenged for their position in block.  This method lessens tension in the band as a member does not need to challenge an individual member of the performance block for their position.  There are no minimum or maximum requirements for challenges, and some members may not be challenged every week.\n\nChallenges are typically held after rehearsal on Fridays for the following game. Challenges consist of a halftime marching audition while playing a musical excerpt from the weekly show, followed by performing a portion of the pre-game show.  Results are posted the following Monday.\n\n====Reserves====\nBand members who are not in the performance block, called \"reserves,\" spend each week rehearsing marching fundamentals on an adjacent practice field while the performance block learns the show to prepare for the game.  The reserves are no less a part of the MMB, as they still march to and from the stadium, perform in the stands during football games, provide ancillary support services during the halftime shows, and may be asked (on short notice) to take the place of a performance block member who cannot perform due to injury, illness, or other circumstances.\n\n===Band Week===\nEvery summer during the two weeks before the first home game, the MMB holds its \"Band Week.\" New members, rank leaders, drumline, and flags arrive first to rehearse marching styles and traditional music. New members learn marching fundamentals from the Drum Major and Rank Leaders. The returning members join a few days later and the music audition is held to determine the players' chairs. After the returning members have been through a couple days of marching rehearsal, \"First Look\" is held. During First Look the entire band performs [[glide step]] and a pre-game portion which are both observed and scored by the staff. These performances are given in groups of 8. After the initial performance block is set, it devotes the remainder of Band Week to rehearsing the performance of pre-game and halftime for the first home game of the season. The reserves spend the remainder of Band Week practicing for the next challenge.\n\n\n\n===Routines===\n\n====Saturday Morning Rehearsal====\nThe Michigan Marching Band practices on Elbel Field in the morning prior to each home game. Practice typically begins at 7:00&nbsp;<small>AM</small> for a game with a noon [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]. The band begins rehearsal with music warm-ups and a review of the halftime music. Next, it rehearses transition elements of the pregame performance. Lastly, the band reviews the drill for the halftime performance. Music is either sung or played at \"half volume\" during this portion of the rehearsal to preserve the band members' [[embouchure]] for the game.\n\n====Step Show====\n[[Image:RevelliHall.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Revelli Hall]]\nThe Michigan Drumline performs the Step Show on the steps of Revelli Hall about an hour and a half before kickoff. The group runs through warm-ups, some pieces arranged specifically for the drumline, the parade cadence series, and closes with \"[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]].\"\n\n====March to the Stadium====\nFollowing the Step Show, the Michigan Marching Band lines up on the steps of Revelli Hall for inspection by the drum major before stepping off to the stadium. Once this is complete, the band begins parading to the stadium by moving out onto Hoover Street. The parade route goes down Hoover Street, turning left onto Greene Street and then into the [[Michigan Stadium]] parking lot. The band then stops in the parking lot among tailgaters and performs a shortened version of \"[[The Victors]]\" the band commonly refers to as \"Parking Lot Victors.\" Once finished, they progress to the mouth of the tunnel of Michigan Stadium where \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" and the trio of \"The Victors\" is played in the direction of the tunnel.\n\n====Pregame Show====\nThe reserve members leave the parade formation, run down the tunnel onto the field and move into the stands to watch pregame. The remaining band members then enter the tunnel and arrange themselves into \"entry lines\" for the start of the pregame performance. The drum major then proceeds to the lower mouth of the tunnel signaling to the stadium announcer that the band is ready. The [[Michigan Stadium]] and Michigan Marching Band announcer, Carl Grapentine, announces the entrance of the band in his signature baritone: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Michigan Marching Band! Baaaand, take the field!\"<ref name=\"Mlive-Grapentine\" />\n\n=====Entries=====\n[[File:DSC 7256 (15329279660).jpg|thumb|right|361x|Band members doing \"Ups\" during Entries]]\nA style of marching used by the Michigan Marching Band that is not meant to be used while playing. This style is characterized by fast exchanges of the legs, with the knees making a 90-degree bend or less. Using this marching style, the band then 'pours' out of the tunnel onto the field to the \"Entry Cadence\" at approximately 220 [[BPM (music)|BPM]] in \"entry lines\" which then fold out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, consisting of 192 musicians. After the last game against a non-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] team, in addition to Entries, members would raise their arms up in a follow-the-leader fashion at a 45-degree angle, known as \"Ups\". Right before the band folds out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band would the drop their arms in a follow-the-leader fashion at double the pace of \"Ups\". Despite the name, Entries are also used at the end of pregame and halftime shows as a quick, organized, and efficient way to get members off the field as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:UConn vs. Michigan 2010 06 (Michigan Marching Band).JPG|thumb|left|\"Tunnel\" formation used in the Pregame show for the football team entrance.]]\n=====\"M Fanfare\"=====\nWhile in the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band plays the \"M Fanfare.\" The \"M Fanfare\" was composed by longtime Michigan Marching Band arranger and composer [[Jerry Bilik]], consisting of portions of \"[[The Victors]],\" \"[[Varsity (fight song)]],\" and \"[[The Yellow and Blue]].\" The band's twirlers and drum major are introduced during the \"M Fanfare.\"\n\n======The Back Bend======\nAt the climax of the \"M Fanfare,\" the drum major performs a signature move. The drum major moves from the middle of the band to the north end 20-yard line. He/she then takes off their hat, turns to face the south end zone, and bends backwards to touch his/her head to the ground. This is done every game. Originally, drum majors kept their hats on and touched their plumes to the ground. \n[[File:Eastern Michigan vs. Michigan 2011 01 (U-M drum major).jpg|thumb|324x324px|Michigan Drum Major Back Bend]]\nThe first drum major to do a back-bend as part of the Michigan Band's pregame show was Mark Brown in the late 1960s. Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.\n\nAlbert Ahronheim was the next drum major after Mark Brown, but did not incorporate the back bend into his pregame routine. Instead, he used his gymnastic skills and performed handsprings and back flips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe back bend returned with Jeff Wilkins in 1975.\n\nIn 1993, Matthew Pickus became the first drum major to remove the hat and touch his head to the ground. This feat was first performed during the pregame of the 1993 Michigan-Notre Dame game. Matthew used the hat-less back bend for the rest of his career as drum major. Since approximately 2003, the hat-less back bend has become the standard for Michigan drum majors.\n\n=====\"The Victors\"=====\nDuring the pregame performance, the band plays the pregame version of \"[[The Victors]]\" while marching across the field to the north end zone. Before the trio starts, an added drum transition occurs, allowing the band to change formations from \"sweep lines\" to the \"hollow block M\" formation. During the transition, Carl Grapentine announces, \"All the Maize and Blue faithful join in a rousing chorus of '[[The Victors]]!'\" These words were introduced during the Becher era.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band: 1983 Pregame | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1983-10-15 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQjVcxTE4Y&t=140 }}</ref> Prior to that, the announcer would say, \"Let's all join and sing for a big Michigan victory!\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band Pregame, October 13, 1979 | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1979-10-13 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy24ifHg9yA&t=131 }}</ref> For the Ohio State game, he would add another \"big\" to the announcement. The trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" is then played while marching to the south end zone.\n\n======The Goal Post Toss======\nDuring \"[[The Victors]]\", the drum major marches down to the north end zone goal post and tosses his/her [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] or baton over the cross bar. Superstition says that if the drum major catches the mace without dropping it, the football team will win the game.\n\n======The Lock Step / High Step======\nFor the past 15 seasons, while playing the break strain of \"[[The Victors]],\" the Michigan Marching Band performs its [[Chair step|lock step]] (formerly known as high step). This is done for 16 counts at half tempo. In this technique, the \"post leg\" remains perpendicular to the ground while the \"free leg\" makes a right angle with the shin being perpendicular to the ground and an extreme downward toe point. The transition to the next step is made by snapping the free leg down and thrusting the post leg up. This style juxtaposes the more fluid, ''traditional step''.\n\n======The Traditional Step======\nIn contrast to the strong, snappy lock step, the traditional step is a more fluid and elegant. With the knee of the free leg only making a 60-degree angle, as opposed to the 90-degree angle, this marching style is used during the majority of the pregame show.\n\n=====Visitor's Fight Song=====\nImmediately following \"[[The Victors]],\" the band plays the visitor's fight song to the south end zone. The upper section of the south end zone is where a large portion of the visiting fans sit. Playing the visitor's fight song is a strong tradition among all [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] marching bands.\n\n=====\"Varsity\"=====\nFollowing the visitor's fight song, the band transitions into the school's 1911-1931 fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]].\" The band once again forms \"sweep lines\" and marches back to the middle of the field and then folds out into another \"Block M\" formation similar to the \"Fanfare M\" formation.\n\n=====\"Blues Brothers\"=====\n[[File:The Cake, Michigan Marching Band, Michigan Stadium, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan (21733694042).jpg|thumb|347x347px|The \"cake\" formation.]]\nOriginating in 1985, once a year, generally at a game without a visiting band, the Michigan Marching Band performs the [[Otis Redding]] hit \"[[I Can't Turn You Loose]],\" made famous in the movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', at midfield. The band forms concentric circles on the field and during a vamp in the music, collapses the circles into what is commonly referred to as \"the cake.\" The entire band fits into a 10-yard diameter circle, centered on the 50-yard line. Once this is complete, the band members scramble back to their \"Fanfare M\" positions. \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" was first performed during the 1980 season during the \"Saturday Afternoon Live\" field show, a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' after which it quickly became popular. \"The Cake\" formation was added in 1985. The song is now also regularly played during the pause in between the third and fourth quarters of football games.\n<br />\n\n[[File:20090926 Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band salute.jpg|thumb|right|347px|Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band in tunnel formation]]\n\n=====\"Let's Go Blue\" and Team Entrance=====\nTime permitting, the band plays \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" to the south, east, north and west sides of Michigan Stadium. \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" was written in the mid 1970s by Joseph Carl, a tuba player who was also in the Hockey Pep Band, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major who also served as a music arranger for the marching band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1984/05/21/627356/a-catchy-intro-to-a-cheer-became-music-to-the-ears-of-myriad-fans |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |last=Stieg |first=Bill |date=1984-05-21 |website=si.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29 |quote='He hummed it to me, and two hours later I had done a complete arrangement and copied parts for everyone,' he said. 'The next Saturday, we played it.'}}</ref> The band then splits the diagonal lines of the \"M\" formation to allow room for the \"Go Blue, M Club Supports You\" banner to be raised for the team's entrance, also known as the \"Tunnel Formation\". The team runs onto the field as the band plays the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" twice.\n\n=====\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"=====\nSince September 22, 2001, the team has been on the field for the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The band uses the Henry Fillmore \"trumpeting arrangement\" of the \"[[Star-Spangled Banner]]\" further arranged by alumnus [[Robert Longfield]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Michigan Marching Band Performs Star-Spangled Banner at 2005 Rose Bowl Game | date = 2005-01-01 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_WjpNGHPok | access-date = 2019-05-06 }}</ref> The band then collapses the split \"M\" formation back to the solid \"Block M\" formation. Following the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]],\" the marching band marches to the north end zone while playing the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" and, once finished, marches (to the \"Entry Cadence\") off the field.\n\n====Postgame Show====\nAfter every home game, the football team runs to the northwest corner of the stadium and joins the band and students in singing \"[[The Yellow and Blue]]\" and a trio of \"[[The Victors]].\" The band then returns to the field and performs \"The Victors\" as written, or in its entirety. They also play selections of the halftime performance. The performance closes with \"Temptation\", \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" \"The Yellow and Blue,\" \"The Victors\" (trio), and the \"Entry Cadence.\" When the football team wins, the band members wear their [[Shako|shakos]] backward during the post-game performance. Visiting bands are invited to join the MMB on the field for a shared postgame show, alternating between musical numbers. After the performance, the band forms into parade lines and marches back through the tunnel and then back to Revelli Hall. When the drum cadence begins, the band chants, \"Go Michigan, beat [whichever team is next on the schedule (e.g. \"The Fighting Irish\")], followed by \"It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine!\" \n\n=====\"Temptation\" & \"Hawaiian War Chant\"=====\n\"[[Temptation (1933 song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\" are percussion features that have been played by the MMB for over 50 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. \"Temptation\" is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. \"Temptation\" is played first, followed by \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, \"Because you can't have one without the other, the 'Hawaiian War Chant!'\" During the post-game band show, when it comes time for \"Temptation,\" the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Albums ===\n* ''Forever Valiant'' (2017)\n*''This is Michigan'' (2011)\n* ''2008 Season Highlights'' (2009)\n* ''Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics'' (2009)\n*''Maize'' (2008)\n* ''2007 Season Highlights'' (2008)\n* ''2006 Season Highlights'' (2007)\n*''Blue'' (2005)\n* ''2005 Season Highlights'' (2005)\n* ''The Victors Valiant'' (2003)\n* ''2002 Season Highlights'' (2002)\n* ''It's All About Blue'' (2000)\n* ''Hurrah for the Yellow and Blue'' (1998)\n* ''A Saturday Tradition'' (1994)\n* ''Fire Up...

At this meeting, Ray P. Warren was elected as the group's first conductor. In a bid to secure an adequate rehearsal venue from the university for the newly formed band, dePont volunteered the band to provide the music for the [[University_of_Michigan_Law_School|Law School's]] upcoming observance of [[Washington's Birthday]]. This was considered to be one of the most important events of the school year. Delivering on dePont's promise, the band's first public performance was on-stage in University Hall at that celebration on February 22, 1897. University president [[James Burrill Angell]] was satisfied with the band's performance and granted dePont's request for rehearsal space in Room A of University Hall. By 1898, the band was being referred to as the \"University of Michigan Band\" and had become an integral part of the Michigan tradition by playing at the football games.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/marching-band-about-html.aspx?path=spirit | title=About the Michigan Marching Band | website=mgoblue.com | publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Michigan | access-date=2019-03-06 | quote=By the fall of 1898, the presence of the band at the football games had become an integral part of the Michigan football tradition.}}</ref>\n=== 1900 - 1929 ===\nIn these early years, the university provided no financial support for the band.

The following year, on October 18, 1904, the band reintroduced the playing of ''[[The Victors]]'' at Michigan football games. Eugene J. Fischer became the band's conductor with the start of the 1906 season.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />[[File:Michigan Marching Band entering Ferry Field, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|The 1920 Michigan Marching Band from the Michiganensian yearbook 1921.]]\n\nAfter Michigan moved out of the [[Big Ten Conference#History|Western Football Conference]] during the 1911 season, [[J. Fred Lawton]] and Earl Vincent Moore composed the fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]],\" which became an immediate hit. Fischer made the song a standard part of the band's football game performances. [[George Olsen]] became the marching band's first drum major in 1914 and inadvertently started the \"[[Michigan_Marching_Band#The Goal Post Toss|Goal Post Toss]]\" tradition during the game against [[Syracuse University]]. During this time, the band was also changing its performance style to incorporate military drill techniques.

In 1936, the term, \"Marching Band\" came into use referring to the portion of the band that played at football games. This group had previously been known as the \"Varsity Band\" or the \"Fighting Band.\" Upon his appointment, Revelli required all male wind instrument majors at the university to participate in the Marching Band.

Pasquale is the current director of the Michigan Marching Band.<ref name=\"MDaily-Pasquale\" />\n\n====Associate Director====\nDr. Richard Frey is the Associate Director of the Michigan Marching Band. He succeeds Dr. Andrea Brown in the position after her departure to assume the Assistant Director of Bands position at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. Dr. Frey was most recently the Assistant Director of Bands at [[Colorado State University]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. He received the Doctor of Musical Arts degree in Instrumental Conducting from [[Michigan State University]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://smtd.umich.edu/about/faculty-profiles/richard-frey/ |title=Richard Frey &#124; U-M School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance |website=smtd.umich.edu |publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance |access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/presidentloh/status/973247012954083328 |author=Wallace D.

Graduate students in the music school or former MMB members that are graduate students in other University programs are hired to help direct the MMB and also to oversee student staff positions.  The MMB also has a color guard instructor, Joan Noble-Pruett, and a percussion instructor, Chuck Ricotta, that each oversee their respective sections to ensure the visual and rhythmic elements of the band are perfect.<ref>{{Citation | title=Band-O-Rama: Victors Valiant! | place=Ann Arbor, MI | publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance | year=2017 | page=11 | language=English | url=https://issuu.com/umichsmtd/docs/bor17_final/10 }}</ref>\n\n====Drum Major====\nThe Michigan Marching Band has one drum major, commonly referred to as the \"Man Up Front\" or \"Woman Up Front,\" for the entire ensemble. Like in most [[Big_Ten_Conference|Big Ten]] bands, the MMB drum major is not a conducting position. The drum major provides whistle commands to provide song tempos and parade instructions. While it is not required of the position, most drum majors perform twirling routines during the halftime show. The drum major is also responsible for teaching proper marching techniques during Band Week. The drum major is best known for the [[Michigan Marching Band#The back bend|back bend]] performed during pregame.\n\nAuditions for this position are held yearly in a two-phase process. The first phase is held in front of the MMB staff which narrows the field of candidates. The second phase is held at the band's spring meeting and the final vote is decided by the current members of the MMB.\n\n====Section Leaders====\nSection leaders are the heads of their sections and are responsible for the music performance. They hold weekly music rehearsals for their section. Section leaders are determined by the staff and generally announced at the \"Spring Meeting,\" traditionally held on the last day of Winter semester.\n\n====Rank Leaders====\nRank Leaders are determined in phases. Generally each year during the final stages of the winter semester, band members are invited to nominate people in their own section to be considered for a Rank Leader Candidate spot. Rank Leader Candidates are then selected by the staff and announced during the Spring Meeting or sometimes later. Rank Leader Candidates then participate in a retreat to learn how to teach the marching technique before Band Week begins. Rank Leaders help the incoming members learn the marching techniques, then have two days of review with all other returning members and the incoming members. Band members are then given the chance to fill out Rank Leader evaluations. The staff then narrows down the potential candidates to the actual Rank Leaders for the year, taking the evaluations into account.\n\nDuring the season, Rank Leaders are in charge of the marching position and style of 12 members on the field. They are given full drill charts to ensure that their rank members are in formation. To save paper, regular members are given coordinate sheets to give their position on the field by numbers rather than graphically.\n\n====Performance Block====\nThe Performance Block is the subset of the MMB that performs pre-game and halftime.  An additional subset is called \"halftime only\" which adds to the performance block for halftime.  The halftime block usually consists of an additional 6 piccolos, 6 alto saxophones, 12 horns, 3 bass drums, 4 snare drums, 4 tenor drums, 6 cymbals, and 6 to 12 sousaphones (depending on the drill requirements).\n\nThe rank leaders along with the MMB staff decide which members in block are to be challenged for their position in block.  This method lessens tension in the band as a member does not need to challenge an individual member of the performance block for their position.  There are no minimum or maximum requirements for challenges, and some members may not be challenged every week.\n\nChallenges are typically held after rehearsal on Fridays for the following game. Challenges consist of a halftime marching audition while playing a musical excerpt from the weekly show, followed by performing a portion of the pre-game show.  Results are posted the following Monday.\n\n====Reserves====\nBand members who are not in the performance block, called \"reserves,\" spend each week rehearsing marching fundamentals on an adjacent practice field while the performance block learns the show to prepare for the game.  The reserves are no less a part of the MMB, as they still march to and from the stadium, perform in the stands during football games, provide ancillary support services during the the halftime shows, and may be asked (on short notice) to take the place of a performance block member who cannot perform due to injury, illness, or other circumstances.\n\n===Band Week===\nEvery summer during the two weeks before the first home game, the MMB holds its \"Band Week.\" New members, rank leaders, drumline, and flags arrive first to rehearse marching styles and traditional music. New members learn marching fundamentals from the Drum Major and Rank Leaders. The returning members join a few days later and the music audition is held to determine the players' chairs. After the returning members have been through a couple days of marching rehearsal, \"First Look\" is held. During First Look the entire band performs [[glide step]] and a pre-game portion which are both observed and scored by the staff. These performances are given in groups of 8. After the initial performance block is set, it devotes the remainder of Band Week to rehearsing the performance of pre-game and halftime for the first home game of the season. The reserves spend the remainder of Band Week practicing for the next challenge.\n\n\n\n===Routines===\n\n====Saturday Morning Rehearsal====\nThe Michigan Marching Band practices on Elbel Field in the morning prior to each home game. Practice typically begins at 7:00&nbsp;<small>AM</small> for a game with a noon [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]. The band begins rehearsal with music warm-ups and a review of the halftime music. Next, it rehearses transition elements of the pregame performance. Lastly, the band reviews the drill for the halftime performance. Music is either sung or played at \"half volume\" during this portion of the rehearsal to preserve the band members' [[embouchure]] for the game.\n\n====Step Show====\n[[Image:RevelliHall.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Revelli Hall]]\nThe Michigan Drumline performs the Step Show on the steps of Revelli Hall about an hour and a half before kickoff. The group runs through warm-ups, some pieces arranged specifically for the drumline, the parade cadence series, and closes with \"[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]].\"\n\n====March to the Stadium====\nFollowing the Step Show, the Michigan Marching Band lines up on the steps of Revelli Hall for inspection by the drum major before stepping off to the stadium. Once this is complete, the band begins parading to the stadium by moving out onto Hoover Street. The parade route goes down Hoover Street, turning left onto Greene Street and then into the [[Michigan Stadium]] parking lot. The band then stops in the parking lot among tailgaters and performs a shortened version of \"[[The Victors]]\" the band commonly refers to as \"Parking Lot Victors.\" Once finished, they progress to the mouth of the tunnel of Michigan Stadium where \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" and the trio of \"The Victors\" is played in the direction of the tunnel.\n\n====Pregame Show====\nThe reserve members leave the parade formation, run down the tunnel onto the field and move into the stands to watch pregame. The remaining band members then enter the tunnel and arrange themselves into \"entry lines\" for the start of the pregame performance. The drum major then proceeds to the lower mouth of the tunnel signaling to the stadium announcer that the band is ready. The [[Michigan Stadium]] and Michigan Marching Band announcer, Carl Grapentine, announces the entrance of the band in his signature baritone: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Michigan Marching Band! Baaaand, take the field!\"<ref name=\"Mlive-Grapentine\" />\n\n=====Entries=====\n[[File:DSC 7256 (15329279660).jpg|thumb|right|361x|Band members doing \"Ups\" during Entries]]\nA style of marching used by the Michigan Marching Band that is not meant to be used while playing. This style is characterized by fast exchanges of the legs, with the knees making a 90-degree bend or less. Using this marching style, the band then 'pours' out of the tunnel onto the field to the \"Entry Cadence\" at approximately 220 [[BPM (music)|BPM]] in \"entry lines\" which then fold out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, consisting of 192 musicians. After the last game against a non-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] team, in addition to Entries, members would raise their arms up in a follow-the-leader fashion at a 45-degree angle, known as \"Ups\". Right before the band folds out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band would the drop their arms in a follow-the-leader fashion at double the pace of \"Ups\". Despite the name, Entries are also used at the end of pregame and halftime shows as a quick, organized, and efficient way to get members off the field as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:UConn vs. Michigan 2010 06 (Michigan Marching Band).JPG|thumb|left|\"Tunnel\" formation used in the Pregame show for the football team entrance.]]\n=====\"M Fanfare\"=====\nWhile in the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band plays the \"M Fanfare.\" The \"M Fanfare\" was composed by longtime Michigan Marching Band arranger and composer [[Jerry Bilik]], consisting of portions of \"[[The Victors]],\" \"[[Varsity (fight song)]],\" and \"[[The Yellow and Blue]].\" The band's twirlers and drum major are introduced during the \"M Fanfare.\"\n\n======The Back Bend======\nAt the climax of the \"M Fanfare,\" the drum major performs a signature move. The drum major moves from the middle of the band to the north end 20-yard line. He/she then takes off their hat, turns to face the south end zone, and bends backwards to touch his/her head to the ground. This is done every game. Originally, drum majors kept their hats on and touched their plumes to the ground. \n[[File:Eastern Michigan vs. Michigan 2011 01 (U-M drum major).jpg|thumb|324x324px|Michigan Drum Major Back Bend]]\nThe first drum major to do a back-bend as part of the Michigan Band's pregame show was Mark Brown in the late 1960s. Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.\n\nAlbert Ahronheim was the next drum major after Mark Brown, but did not incorporate the back bend into his pregame routine. Instead, he used his gymnastic skills and performed handsprings and back flips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe back bend returned with Jeff Wilkins in 1975.\n\nIn 1993, Matthew Pickus became the first drum major to remove the hat and touch his head to the ground. This feat was first performed during the pregame of the 1993 Michigan-Notre Dame game. Matthew used the hat-less back bend for the rest of his career as drum major. Since approximately 2003, the hat-less back bend has become the standard for Michigan drum majors.\n\n=====\"The Victors\"=====\nDuring the pregame performance, the band plays the pregame version of \"[[The Victors]]\" while marching across the field to the north end zone. Before the trio starts, an added drum transition occurs, allowing the band to change formations from \"sweep lines\" to the \"hollow block M\" formation. During the transition, Carl Grapentine announces, \"All the Maize and Blue faithful join in a rousing chorus of '[[The Victors]]!'\" These words were introduced during the Becher era.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band: 1983 Pregame | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1983-10-15 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQjVcxTE4Y&t=140 }}</ref> Prior to that, the announcer would say, \"Let's all join and sing for a big Michigan victory!\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band Pregame, October 13, 1979 | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1979-10-13 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy24ifHg9yA&t=131 }}</ref> For the Ohio State game, he would add another \"big\" to the announcement. The trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" is then played while marching to the south end zone.\n\n======The Goal Post Toss======\nDuring \"[[The Victors]]\", the drum major marches down to the north end zone goal post and tosses his/her [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] or baton over the cross bar. Superstition says that if the drum major catches the mace without dropping it, the football team will win the game.\n\n======The Lock Step / High Step======\nFor the past 15 seasons, while playing the break strain of \"[[The Victors]],\" the Michigan Marching Band performs its [[Chair step|lock step]] (formerly known as high step). This is done for 16 counts at half tempo. In this technique, the \"post leg\" remains perpendicular to the ground while the \"free leg\" makes a right angle with the shin being perpendicular to the ground and an extreme downward toe point. The transition to the next step is made by snapping the free leg down and thrusting the post leg up. This style juxtaposes the more fluid, ''traditional step''.\n\n======The Traditional Step======\nIn contrast to the strong, snappy lock step, the traditional step is a more fluid and elegant. With the knee of the free leg only making a 60-degree angle, as opposed to the 90-degree angle, this marching style is used during the majority of the pregame show.\n\n=====Visitor's Fight Song=====\nImmediately following \"[[The Victors]],\" the band plays the visitor's fight song to the south end zone. The upper section of the south end zone is where a large portion of the visiting fans sit. Playing the visitor's fight song is a strong tradition among all [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] marching bands.\n\n=====\"Varsity\"=====\nFollowing the visitor's fight song, the band transitions into the school's 1911-1931 fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]].\" The band once again forms \"sweep lines\" and marches back to the middle of the field and then folds out into another \"Block M\" formation similar to the \"Fanfare M\" formation.\n\n=====\"Blues Brothers\"=====\n[[File:The Cake, Michigan Marching Band, Michigan Stadium, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan (21733694042).jpg|thumb|347x347px|The \"cake\" formation.]]\nOriginating in 1985, once a year, generally at a game without a visiting band, the Michigan Marching Band performs the [[Otis Redding]] hit \"[[I Can't Turn You Loose]],\" made famous in the movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', at midfield. The band forms concentric circles on the field and during a vamp in the music, collapses the circles into what is commonly referred to as \"the cake.\" The entire band fits into a 10-yard diameter circle, centered on the 50-yard line. Once this is complete, the band members scramble back to their \"Fanfare M\" positions. \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" was first performed during the 1980 season during the \"Saturday Afternoon Live\" field show, a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' after which it quickly became popular. \"The Cake\" formation was added in 1985. The song is now also regularly played during the pause in between the third and fourth quarters of football games.\n<br />\n\n[[File:20090926 Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band salute.jpg|thumb|right|347px|Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band in tunnel formation]]\n\n=====\"Let's Go Blue\" and Team Entrance=====\nTime permitting, the band plays \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" to the south, east, north and west sides of Michigan Stadium. \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" was written in the mid 1970s by Joseph Carl, a tuba player who was also in the Hockey Pep Band, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major who also served as a music arranger for the marching band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1984/05/21/627356/a-catchy-intro-to-a-cheer-became-music-to-the-ears-of-myriad-fans |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |last=Stieg |first=Bill |date=1984-05-21 |website=si.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29 |quote='He hummed it to me, and two hours later I had done a complete arrangement and copied parts for everyone,' he said.

The team runs onto the field as the band plays the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" twice.\n\n=====\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"=====\nSince September 22, 2001, the team has been on the field for the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The band uses the Henry Fillmore \"trumpeting arrangement\" of the \"[[Star-Spangled Banner]]\" further arranged by alumnus [[Robert Longfield]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Michigan Marching Band Performs Star-Spangled Banner at 2005 Rose Bowl Game | date = 2005-01-01 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_WjpNGHPok | access-date = 2019-05-06 }}</ref> The band then collapses the split \"M\" formation back to the solid \"Block M\" formation. Following the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]],\" the marching band marches to the north end zone while playing the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" and, once finished, marches (to the \"Entry Cadence\") off the field.\n\n====Postgame Show====\nAfter every home game, the football team runs to the northwest corner of the stadium and joins the band and students in singing \"[[The Yellow and Blue]]\" and a trio of \"[[The Victors]].\" The band then returns to the field and performs \"The Victors\" as written, or in its entirety. They also play selections of the halftime performance. The performance closes with \"Temptation\", \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" \"The Yellow and Blue,\" \"The Victors\" (trio), and the \"Entry Cadence.\" When the football team wins, the band members wear their [[Shako|shakos]] backward during the post-game performance. Visiting bands are invited to join the MMB on the field for a shared postgame show, alternating between musical numbers. After the performance, the band forms into parade lines and marches back through the tunnel and then back to Revelli Hall. When the drum cadence begins, the band chants, \"Go Michigan, beat [whichever team is next on the schedule (e.g. \"The Fighting Irish\")], followed by \"It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine!\" \n\n=====\"Temptation\" & \"Hawaiian War Chant\"=====\n\"[[Temptation (1933 song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\" are percussion features that have been played by the MMB for over 50 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. \"Temptation\" is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. \"Temptation\" is played first, followed by \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, \"Because you can't have one without the other, the 'Hawaiian War Chant!'\" During the post-game band show, when it comes time for \"Temptation,\" the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Albums ===\n* ''Forever Valiant'' (2017)\n*''This is Michigan'' (2011)\n* ''2008 Season Highlights'' (2009)\n* ''Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics'' (2009)\n*''Maize'' (2008)\n* ''2007 Season Highlights'' (2008)\n* ''2006 Season Highlights'' (2007)\n*''Blue'' (2005)\n* ''2005 Season Highlights'' (2005)\n* ''The Victors Valiant'' (2003)\n* ''2002 Season Highlights'' (2002)\n* ''It's All About Blue'' (2000)\n* ''Hurrah for the Yellow and Blue'' (1998)\n* ''A Saturday Tradition'' (1994)\n* ''Fire Up...

Slightly odd, socially inept and occasionally stupid, but with a heart of gold, David frequently misunderstood other characters to comic effect. Bombhead liked to cook.

He was devastated when Gordon and his wife, Helen, were killed in a car crash and briefly became a [[Christians|Christian]].\n\nWhen Bombhead's mother died, David suffered a mental breakdown. Unable to accept her death, he lived with her body and continued to act as if she were still alive, doing her dry cleaning and cooking her meals.

Cameron had noticed something was wrong with David and wanted to help him in return for Bombhead helping him when he attempted [[suicide]]. Cameron tried to get David to open up but he refused.

After much effort, it became apparent that he would never succeed. It wasn't until Lee decided to hire a collection of clowns as a fundraising exercise for students at HCC that David would finally meet his father, a clown, of which ironically Bombhead had always suffered an irrational fear of. Bombhead's friendship with Lee would finally come to an end when Lee was turned against him by the evil machinations of [[Chris Fenwick]], although once he found out what Chris was up to, Lee made up with Bombhead. David decided to leave Hollyoaks and join the circus to live with his father. Bombhead mattered so much to Lee that after Lee's hearing over diverting college funds, during which Chris used Bombhead's joining the circus against Lee, he punched Chris square in the face, saying, \"This is for Bombhead\".\n\nIn the spinoff ''[[Hollyoaks: Freshers]]'', Lee called Bombhead to ask if he should propose to his girlfriend [[Leanne Holiday]].

The series begins with [[Kagome Higurashi]], a 15-year-old schoolgirl from modern-day [[Tokyo]] who is transported to the [[Sengoku period]] of Japan after falling into a well in her family shrine, where she meets the half dog-demon, [[Inuyasha (character)|Inuyasha]]. When a monster from that era tries to take the magical Shikon Jewel embodied in Kagome, she inadvertently shatters the Jewel into many pieces that are dispersed across Japan. Inuyasha and Kagome start traveling to recover it before the powerful and evil half spider-demon Naraku finds all the shards. Inuyasha and Kagome gain a number of allies during their journey, and their group is joined by Shippo, Miroku, Sango and Kirara. \n\n''Inuyasha'' premiered in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' on November 13, 1996, and concluded on June 18, 2008, with the chapters collected into 56 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Shogakukan]]. In contrast to the typically comedic nature of much of Takahashi's previous work, ''Inuyasha'' deals with a darker and more serious subject matter, using the setting of the Sengoku period to easily display the violent content while still retaining some comedic elements.\n\nThe manga was adapted into two [[anime]] television series produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]. The first was broadcast for 167 episodes on [[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation|Yomiuri TV]] and [[Nippon TV]] in Japan from October 16, 2000 to September 13, 2004. The second series, ''Inuyasha: The Final Act'', began airing five years later on October 3, 2009, to cover the rest of the manga series and ended on March 29, 2010, after 26 episodes. Four feature films and an [[original video animation]] have also been released. Other merchandise include [[video game]]s and a [[light novel]]. \n\n[[Viz Media]] licensed the manga, the two anime series, and movies for North America. Both ''Inuyasha'' and ''Inuyasha: The Final Act'' aired in the United States on [[Adult Swim]] (and later on its revived [[Toonami]] block) from 2002 until 2015.\n\nThe ''Inuyasha'' manga has over 45 million copies in circulation. In 2002, the manga won the 47th [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for the ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' category.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Inuyasha characters}}\nIn modern-day Tokyo, [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kagome Higurashi|Kagome Higurashi]] lives on the grounds of her family's [[Shinto]] shrine with her mother, grandfather and younger brother, Sota. On her fifteenth birthday, when she goes to retrieve her cat, Kagome is dragged into the enshrined {{nihongo|Bone Eater's Well|\u9aa8\u55b0\u3044\u306e\u4e95\u6238|Honekui no Ido}} by a centipede demon that emerged from it. But rather than hit the bottom, Kagome finds herself in the past during Japan's [[Sengoku period]]. The demon is revealed to have originally been defeated fifty years prior by [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kikyo|Kikyo]], a warrior [[miko|priestess]] who is the keeper of the {{nihongo|Shikon Jewel|\u56db\u9b42\u306e\u7389|Shikon no Tama|lit. \"The Jewel of Four Souls\"}}, an artifact created by the sacrifice of the priestess Midoriko which grants its holder's desires. As pointed out by Kikyo's younger sister, [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kaede|Kaede]], Kagome is revealed to be the reincarnation of the now-dead Kikyo, who was the priestess in charge of looking after the sacred jewel. The Shikon Jewel was burned along with Kikyo's remains to cast it out of this world entirely, in order to keep it safe from the hands of those who would abuse it. Then Kagome comes across a boy pinned by a sacred arrow on a tree, learning he is [[Inuyasha (character)|Inuyasha]], a half dog-demon (''[[y\u014dkai]]''), whom Kikyo trapped as her final act when he attempted to steal the jewel. Kagome frees Inuyasha to kill the centipede demon, but Kaede subdues him with a magical beaded necklace to keep him in line with Kagome saying \"sit\" or \"sit, boy\", which causes him to violently crash to the ground. The Shikon Jewel was extracted from Kagome's body by Mistress Centipede, and then later taken by a crow demon, which Kagome destroyed with her arrow, but in doing so, shattered the jewel into many shards that flew across Japan and into the possession of those who gain the individual shards' power.\n\nAfter Inuyasha gains his father's sword Tetsusaiga, placing him at odds with his older half-brother [[List of Inuyasha characters#Sesshomaru|Sesshomaru]], he aids Kagome in collecting the shards and dealing with the threats they cause as they are joined by [[List of Inuyasha characters#Shippo|Shippo]] the young fox demon. Kikyo is partially revived while revealed to have been Inuyasha's lover, but her version of how their falling out occurred brings the events into question. It was when the group is joined by the perverted [[monk]] [[List of Inuyasha characters#Miroku|Miroku]], whose hand is cursed with a wind tunnel that was passed on to him from his grandfather, that his family's curse and the events which resulted in Inuyasha's imprisonment and Kikyo's death were caused by the evil half spider-demon [[List of Inuyasha characters#Naraku|Naraku]]. The evolving Naraku is revealed to have been born from the soul of the evil bandit Onigumo inhabiting a body created by countless demons as part of a pact to acquire the Shikon Jewel for his own ends, seeking out the shard while absorbing demons to increase his power and remove any weaknesses. Inuyasha's group is soon joined after by the demon slayer [[List of Inuyasha characters#Sango|Sango]] and her two-tailed demon-cat [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kirara|Kirara]]. Sango's clan was killed when her younger brother [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kohaku|Kohaku]] fell under Naraku's control and is kept alive by a Jewel shard. Over time, Inuyasha enhances Tetsusaiga into stronger forms while contends with Naraku's minion incarnations like [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kagura|Kagura]] and [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kanna|Kanna]], and the reanimated [[Band of Seven]]. Inuyasha's team is loosely allied by Sesshomaru who took the orphaned girl [[List of Inuyasha characters#Rin|Rin]] as a ward, the resurrected Kikyo, and [[List of Inuyasha characters#Koga|Koga]], the leader of the eastern wolf-demon tribe who seeks to avenge many of his comrades' deaths and has a one-sided crush on Kagome.\n\nWhile Naraku momentarily removes his heart in the form of the [[List of Inuyasha characters#The Infant and Moryomaru|Infant]], who later attempts to overthrow Naraku through his vessel [[List of Inuyasha characters#The Infant and Moryomaru|Moryomaru]], Kohaku regains his freewill and memories and attempts to help out of guilt for indirectly killing his father. During that time, Sesshomaru settles things with Inuyasha to enable his brother to perfect Tetsusaiga to its optimal abilities. Eventually, Koga is forced to stand on the sidelines while Kikyo uses the last of her life force to give Kohaku a second chance at life as Naraku finally reassembles the Shikon Jewel. Although Inuyasha and his allies defeat him, realizing his true desire is for Kikyo's love despite his hatred towards her and that it can never be granted, Naraku uses his wish to trap himself and Kagome in the Shikon Jewel. Revealed to be sentient, the Shikon Jewel intends to have Kagome make a selfish wish so she and Naraku will be trapped in conflict and prolong its existence. But with Inuyasha by her side, Kagome wishes for the Shikon Jewel to disappear which causes Kagome to return to her time with the Well sealed, and she and Inuyasha lose contact for three long years.\n\nIn that time, the Sengoku period changes drastically: Sango and Miroku marry and have three children together; Kohaku resumes his journey to become a strong demon slayer with Kirara as his companion; and Shippo attains the seventh rank as a fox demon. Koga marries Ayame, the leader of the northern wolf-demon tribe, joining their tribes. Kaede takes Rin in her care to get her use to living with humans again if she wants to in the future. Back in the present, Kagome graduates from high school before finally managing to get the Bone Eater's Well in her backyard to work again. Kagome returns to the Sengoku period, where she reunites with Inuyasha, marries him and continues to train to become a priestess.\n\n==Development==\nRumiko Takahashi wrote ''Inuyasha'' after finishing ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]''. In contrast to her previous comedic works such as ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'' (1978-1987), ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'' (1980-1987), and ''[[One Pound Gospel]]'' (1987-2006), Takahashi wanted to create a darker storyline that was thematically closer to her ''[[Mermaid Saga]]'' stories. In order to portray violent themes softly, the story was set in the [[Sengoku period]], when wars were common. Takahashi did no notable research for the designs of samurai or castles because she considered such topics common knowledge. By June 2001, a clear ending to the series hadn't been established because Takahashi still was unsure about how to end the relationship between Inuyasha and Kagome. Furthermore, Takahashi said that she did not have an ending to previous manga she wrote during the beginning, having figured them out as their serialization progressed.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Animerica|date=June 2001|issue=6|issn=1067-0831|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|title=Inuyasha Comes to America |author1=Yoshida, Toshifumi |author2=Nakatani, Andy }}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of Inuyasha volumes}}\n\nWritten and illustrated by [[Rumiko Takahashi]], ''Inuyasha'' premiered in Japan in the November 13, 1996 issue of ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |title=Inuyasha|journal=[[Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]|first=Rumiko|last=Takahashi|issue=50|date=November 13, 1996|issn=1236-2409}}</ref><ref name=\"Ex\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/1.x/14-shonen1.html|title=Shonen Sunday, 1996 Issue 50|first=Eri|last=Izawa|date=December 1996|accessdate=February 9, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130112174508/http://www.ex.org/1.x/14-shonen1.html|archivedate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> where it ran until its conclusion in the June 18, 2008 issue.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-06-10/inuyasha-confirmed-to-end-next-wednesday-in-japan|title=Inuyasha Confirmed to End Next Wednesday in Japan|date=June 10, 2008|work=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}</ref> The chapters were collected into 56 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes published by [[Shogakukan]], with the first volume released in May 1997 and the last released in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/409125201X/ |script-title=ja:\u72ac\u591c\u53c9 1|trans-title=Inuyasha 1|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4091215807/ |script-title=ja:\u72ac\u591c\u53c9 56|trans-title=Inuyasha 56|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}</ref> In 2013, a special epilogue chapter was published in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday'' as part of the \"Heroes Come Back\" anthology comprising short stories by manga artists to raise funds for recovery of the areas afflicted by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.crunchyroll.ca/anime-news/2012/12/26/inuyasha-one-shot-manga-returns-in-quake-charity | title=\"Inuyasha\" One-Shot Manga Returns in Quake Charity | publisher=Crunchyroll | date=December 26, 2012 | accessdate=March 18, 2013 | author=Mikikazu Komatsu | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213002439/http://www.crunchyroll.ca/anime-news/2012/12/26/inuyasha-one-shot-manga-returns-in-quake-charity | archive-date=December 13, 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The chapter was later included in the last volume of ''[[Tank\u014dbon#Wide-ban|wide-ban]]'' reprint of the manga in 2015.\n\n[[Viz Media]] licensed the series for an English-language release in North America. Initially, Viz released it in monthly American comic book format, each issue containing two or three chapters from the original manga, but eventually abandoned this system in favor of trade paperbacks with the same chapter divisions as the Japanese volumes. Viz released its first trade paperback volume in March 1998. At the time, American manga reprints were normally \"flipped\" to conform to the American convention of reading books from left to right by [[mirror]]ing the original artwork; among other effects, this caused right-handed characters to appear left-handed.

The series begins with [[Kagome Higurashi]], a 15-year-old schoolgirl from modern-day [[Tokyo]] who is transported to the [[Sengoku period]] of Japan after falling into a well in her family shrine, where she meets the half dog-demon, [[Inuyasha (character)|Inuyasha]]. When a monster from that era tries to take the magical Shikon Jewel embodied in Kagome, she inadvertently shatters the Jewel into many pieces that are dispersed across Japan. Inuyasha and Kagome start traveling to recover it before the powerful and evil half spider-demon Naraku finds all the shards. Inuyasha and Kagome gain a number of allies during their journey, and their group is joined by Shippo, Miroku, Sango and Kirara. \n\n''Inuyasha'' premiered in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' on November 13, 1996, and concluded on June 18, 2008, with the chapters collected into 56 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Shogakukan]]. In contrast to the typically comedic nature of much of Takahashi's previous work, ''Inuyasha'' deals with a darker and more serious subject matter, using the setting of the Sengoku period to easily display the violent content while still retaining some comedic elements.\n\nThe manga was adapted into two [[anime]] television series produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]]. The first was broadcast for 167 episodes on [[Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation|Yomiuri TV]] and [[Nippon TV]] in Japan from October 16, 2000 to September 13, 2004. The second series, ''Inuyasha: The Final Act'', began airing five years later on October 3, 2009, to cover the rest of the manga series and ended on March 29, 2010, after 26 episodes. Four feature films and an [[original video animation]] have also been released. Other merchandise include [[video game]]s and a [[light novel]]. \n\n[[Viz Media]] licensed the manga, the two anime series, and movies for North America. Both ''Inuyasha'' and ''Inuyasha: The Final Act'' aired in the United States on [[Adult Swim]] (and later on its revived [[Toonami]] block) from 2002 until 2015.\n\nThe ''Inuyasha'' manga has over 45 million copies in circulation. In 2002, the manga won the 47th [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for the ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' category.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Inuyasha characters}}\nIn modern-day Tokyo, [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kagome Higurashi|Kagome Higurashi]] lives on the grounds of her family's [[Shinto]] shrine with her mother, grandfather and younger brother, Sota. On her fifteenth birthday, when she goes to retrieve her cat, Kagome is dragged into the enshrined {{nihongo|Bone Eater's Well|\u9aa8\u55b0\u3044\u306e\u4e95\u6238|Honekui no Ido}} by a centipede demon that emerged from it. But rather than hit the bottom, Kagome finds herself in the past during Japan's [[Sengoku period]]. The demon is revealed to have originally been defeated fifty years prior by [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kikyo|Kikyo]], a warrior [[miko|priestess]] who is the keeper of the {{nihongo|Shikon Jewel|\u56db\u9b42\u306e\u7389|Shikon no Tama|lit. \"The Jewel of Four Souls\"}}, an artifact created by the sacrifice of the priestess Midoriko which grants its holder's desires. As pointed out by Kikyo's younger sister, [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kaede|Kaede]], Kagome is revealed to be the reincarnation of the now-dead Kikyo, who was the priestess in charge of looking after the sacred jewel. The Shikon Jewel was burned along with Kikyo's remains to cast it out of this world entirely, in order to keep it safe from the hands of those who would abuse it. Then Kagome comes across a boy pinned by a sacred arrow on a tree, learning he is [[Inuyasha (character)|Inuyasha]], a half dog-demon (''[[y\u014dkai]]''), whom Kikyo trapped as her final act when he attempted to steal the jewel. Kagome frees Inuyasha to kill the centipede demon, but Kaede subdues him with a magical beaded necklace to keep him in line with Kagome saying \"sit\" or \"sit, boy\", which causes him to violently crash to the ground. The Shikon Jewel was extracted from Kagome's body by Mistress Centipede, and then later taken by a crow demon, which Kagome destroyed with her arrow, but in doing so, shattered the jewel into many shards that flew across Japan and into the possession of those who gain the individual shards' power.\n\nAfter Inuyasha gains his father's sword Tetsusaiga, placing him at odds with his older half-brother [[List of Inuyasha characters#Sesshomaru|Sesshomaru]], he aids Kagome in collecting the shards and dealing with the threats they cause as they are joined by [[List of Inuyasha characters#Shippo|Shippo]] the young fox demon. Kikyo is partially revived while revealed to have been Inuyasha's lover, but her version of how their falling out occurred brings the events into question. It was when the group is joined by the perverted [[monk]] [[List of Inuyasha characters#Miroku|Miroku]], whose hand is cursed with a wind tunnel that was passed on to him from his grandfather, that his family's curse and the events which resulted in Inuyasha's imprisonment and Kikyo's death were caused by the evil half spider-demon [[List of Inuyasha characters#Naraku|Naraku]]. The evolving Naraku is revealed to have been born from the soul of the evil bandit Onigumo inhabiting a body created by countless demons as part of a pact to acquire the Shikon Jewel for his own ends, seeking out the shard while absorbing demons to increase his power and remove any weaknesses. Inuyasha's group is soon joined after by the demon slayer [[List of Inuyasha characters#Sango|Sango]] and her two-tailed demon-cat [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kirara|Kirara]]. Sango's clan was killed when her younger brother [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kohaku|Kohaku]] fell under Naraku's control and is kept alive by a Jewel shard. Over time, Inuyasha enhances Tetsusaiga into stronger forms while contends with Naraku's minion incarnations like [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kagura|Kagura]] and [[List of Inuyasha characters#Kanna|Kanna]], and the reanimated [[Band of Seven]]. Inuyasha's team is loosely allied by Sesshomaru who took the orphaned girl [[List of Inuyasha characters#Rin|Rin]] as a ward, the resurrected Kikyo, and [[List of Inuyasha characters#Koga|Koga]], the leader of the eastern wolf-demon tribe who seeks to avenge many of his comrades' deaths and has a one-sided crush on Kagome.\n\nWhile Naraku momentarily removes his heart in the form of the [[List of Inuyasha characters#The Infant and Moryomaru|Infant]], who later attempts to overthrow Naraku through his vessel [[List of Inuyasha characters#The Infant and Moryomaru|Moryomaru]], Kohaku regains his freewill and memories and attempts to help out of guilt for indirectly killing his father. During that time, Sesshomaru settles things with Inuyasha to enable his brother to perfect Tetsusaiga to its optimal abilities. Eventually, Koga is forced to stand on the sidelines while Kikyo uses the last of her life force to give Kohaku a second chance at life as Naraku finally reassembles the Shikon Jewel. Although Inuyasha and his allies defeat him, realizing his true desire is for Kikyo's love despite his hatred towards her and that it can never be granted, Naraku uses his wish to trap himself and Kagome in the Shikon Jewel. Revealed to be sentient, the Shikon Jewel intends to have Kagome make a selfish wish so she and Naraku will be trapped in conflict and prolong its existence. But with Inuyasha by her side, Kagome wishes for the Shikon Jewel to disappear which causes Kagome to return to her time with the Well sealed, and she and Inuyasha lose contact for three long years.\n\nIn that time, the Sengoku period changes drastically: Sango and Miroku marry and have three children together; Kohaku resumes his journey to become a strong demon slayer with Kirara as his companion; and Shippo attains the seventh rank as a fox demon. Koga marries Ayame, the leader of the northern wolf-demon tribe, joining their tribes. Kaede takes Rin in her care to get her use to living with humans again if she wants to in the future. Back in the present, Kagome graduates from high school before finally managing to get the Bone Eater's Well in her backyard to work again. Kagome returns to the Sengoku period, where she reunites with Inuyasha, marries him and continues to train to become a priestess.\n\n==Development==\nRumiko Takahashi wrote ''Inuyasha'' after finishing ''[[Ranma \u00bd]]''. In contrast to her previous comedic works such as ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'' (1978-1987), ''[[Maison Ikkoku]]'' (1980-1987), and ''[[One Pound Gospel]]'' (1987-2006), Takahashi wanted to create a darker storyline that was thematically closer to her ''[[Mermaid Saga]]'' stories. In order to portray violent themes softly, the story was set in the [[Sengoku period]], when wars were common. Takahashi did no notable research for the designs of samurai or castles because she considered such topics common knowledge. By June 2001, a clear ending to the series hadn't been established because Takahashi still was unsure about how to end the relationship between Inuyasha and Kagome. Furthermore, Takahashi said that she did not have an ending to previous manga she wrote during the beginning, having figured them out as their serialization progressed.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Animerica|date=June 2001|issue=6|issn=1067-0831|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|title=Inuyasha Comes to America |author1=Yoshida, Toshifumi |author2=Nakatani, Andy }}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of Inuyasha volumes}}\n\nWritten and illustrated by [[Rumiko Takahashi]], ''Inuyasha'' premiered in Japan in the November 13, 1996 issue of ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |title=Inuyasha|journal=[[Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]|first=Rumiko|last=Takahashi|issue=50|date=November 13, 1996|issn=1236-2409}}</ref><ref name=\"Ex\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/1.x/14-shonen1.html|title=Shonen Sunday, 1996 Issue 50|first=Eri|last=Izawa|date=December 1996|accessdate=February 9, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130112174508/http://www.ex.org/1.x/14-shonen1.html|archivedate=January 12, 2013}}</ref> where it ran until its conclusion in the June 18, 2008 issue.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-06-10/inuyasha-confirmed-to-end-next-wednesday-in-japan|title=Inuyasha Confirmed to End Next Wednesday in Japan|date=June 10, 2008|work=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}</ref> The chapters were collected into 56 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes published by [[Shogakukan]], with the first volume released in May 1997 and the last released in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/409125201X/ |script-title=ja:\u72ac\u591c\u53c9 1|trans-title=Inuyasha 1|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4091215807/ |script-title=ja:\u72ac\u591c\u53c9 56|trans-title=Inuyasha 56|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}</ref> In 2013, a special epilogue chapter was published in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday'' as part of the \"Heroes Come Back\" anthology comprising short stories by manga artists to raise funds for recovery of the areas afflicted by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.crunchyroll.ca/anime-news/2012/12/26/inuyasha-one-shot-manga-returns-in-quake-charity | title=\"Inuyasha\" One-Shot Manga Returns in Quake Charity | publisher=Crunchyroll | date=December 26, 2012 | accessdate=March 18, 2013 | author=Mikikazu Komatsu | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213002439/http://www.crunchyroll.ca/anime-news/2012/12/26/inuyasha-one-shot-manga-returns-in-quake-charity | archive-date=December 13, 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The chapter was later included in the last volume of ''[[Tank\u014dbon#Wide-ban|wide-ban]]'' reprint of the manga in 2015.\n\n[[Viz Media]] licensed the series for an English-language release in North America. Initially, Viz released it in monthly American comic book format, each issue containing two or three chapters from the original manga, but eventually abandoned this system in favor of trade paperbacks with the same chapter divisions as the Japanese volumes. Viz released its first trade paperback volume in March 1998. At the time, American manga reprints were normally \"flipped\" to conform to the American convention of reading books from left to right by [[mirror]]ing the original artwork; among other effects, this caused right-handed characters to appear left-handed. Viz later stopped flipping its new manga releases, although ''Inuyasha'' was already well into printing by the time this change was made with volume 38.<ref name=\"unflipped\">{{cite news | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-04-23/viz-to-publish-inuyasha-with-unflipped-page-layout | title=Viz to Publish Inuyasha Monthly with 'Unflipped' Page Layout  | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=2009-04-29 | accessdate=2014-05-02}}</ref> As of January 11, 2011, all 56 volumes have been released in North America. From November 2009 to February 2014, Viz reprinted the series in their \"VizBig\" format, combining three of the original volumes into a single omnibus with slightly larger pages and full-color bonus art that was previously reduced to grayscale, and in the original right to left format.<ref name=\"unflipped\"/> Viz Media also issues a separate series of [[Film comic|ani-manga]] volumes which are derived from full-color [[screenshot]]s of the anime episodes. These volumes are slightly smaller than the regular manga volumes, are oriented in the Japanese tradition of right to left, feature new covers with higher quality pages, and a higher price point versus the regular volumes. Each ani-manga volume is arranged into chapters that correspond to the anime episodes rather than the manga.\n\n===Anime===\n\n====''Inuyasha''====\n{{See also|List of Inuyasha episodes}}\nThe first ''Inuyasha'' anime adaptation produced by [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] was released in Japan on [[Yomiuri TV]] on October 16, 2000, and ran for 167 episodes until its conclusion on September 13, 2004.
