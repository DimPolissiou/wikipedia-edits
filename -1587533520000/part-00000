The most influential specimen was [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1]] from [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints]], France. French palaeontologist [[Marcellin Boule]] authored several publications, among the first to establish palaeontology as a science, detailing the specimen, but reconstructed it as ape-like and only remotely related to modern humans. The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule's error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|issue=291|pages=158\u2013164|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00089936}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged. In 1939, American anthropologist [[Carlton Coon]] reconstructed a Neanderthal in a modern business suit and hat to emphasize that they would be, more or less, indistinguishable from modern humans had they survived into the present.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule's error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|issue=291|pages=158\u2013164|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00089936}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

It serves as the home of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), and the [[Philadelphia Wings (2018\u2013)|Philadelphia Wings]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL). The arena lies at the southwest corner of the [[South Philadelphia Sports Complex]], which includes [[Lincoln Financial Field]], [[Citizens Bank Park]], and [[Xfinity Live! Philadelphia|Xfinity Live!]].\n\nThe Wells Fargo Center, originally called '''Spectrum II''', was completed in 1996 to replace the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] as the home arena of the 76ers and Flyers, on the former site of [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] at a cost of $210 million, largely privately financed (though the city and state helped to pay for the local [[infrastructure]]).  It is owned by [[Comcast Spectacor]], which also owns the Flyers, and is operated by its arena-management subsidiary, Global Spectrum. Since opening, it has been known by a number of different names through [[naming rights]] deals and bank mergers, including '''CoreStates Center''' from 1996 to 1998, '''First Union Center''' from 1998 to 2003, and '''Wachovia Center''' from 2003 to 2010. Since 2010, naming rights have been held by financial services company [[Wells Fargo]], after their merger with [[Wachovia]].\n\nIn addition to hosting home games for its main tenants, the arena has been the site of a number of other notable athletic events including Games 1 and 2 from the [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]] and Games 3, 4 and 6 of the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals]], Games 3, 4 and 5 of the [[2001 NBA Finals]], and various collegiate events for the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). Wells Fargo Center has hosted two political conventions, hosting the [[2000 Republican National Convention]] and [[2016 Democratic National Convention]]. The arena is a regular venue for concerts and [[WWE]] events. The arena has a concert [[seating capacity]] of 21,000 seated and at least 21,500 standing.\n\n==Naming rights==\n[[File:Philly (35).jpg|thumb|left|The then-Wachovia Center, December 2005]]\nBefore its construction, the proposed arena was tentatively called \"Spectrum II\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Spectrum II In Peril Again|first1=Bob|last1=Ford|first2=Craig|last2=McCoy|first3=Glen|last3=Macnow|url=http://articles.philly.com/1993-11-30/sports/25947135_1_snider-spectrum-ii-spectacor|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=November 30, 1993|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}</ref> The Wells Fargo Center was originally named for [[CoreStates]] Bank, which agreed to pay $40 million over 21 years for the naming rights, with additional terms to be settled later for an additional eight-year period at the end of the contract.\n\nHowever, the contract has gone through multiple hands due to various bank mergers; first by [[First Union|First Union Bank]] in 1998, [[Wachovia]] in 2003, and currently by [[Wells Fargo]] in July 2010.<ref name=Seravalli>{{cite news |title=It's Officially the Wells Fargo Center|first=Frank|last=Seravalli|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/flyers/97648719.html|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=July 2, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name=OBrien>{{cite web |title=Flyers' Arena Undergoes Name Change from Wachovia to Wells Fargo Center|first=James|last=O'Brien|url=http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2010/07/flyers-arena-undergoes-name-change-from-wachovia-to-wells-fargo-center.php|work=[[NBC Sports]]|publisher=NBC Universal|date=July 2, 2010|accessdate=July 9, 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.the700level.com/2010/02/the-building-the-flyers-and-sixers-play-in-prepares-for-yet-another-new-name.html \"The Building the Flyers and Sixers Play in\" Prepares for Yet Another New Name\"].

The Wells Fargo Center logo decal which sat on the 76ers court was in the most minimal text discernible by television cameras, colored in white to blend in with the floor. (Reportedly, 76ers CEO Scott O'Neil's first idea was to color it with clear-coat paint only visible with UV [[blacklight]]ing showing the logo during the opening of Sixers games when the arena lights were drawn down; however, the team, after discussion with their lawyers, elected not to do so.) With the start of the new year in January 2016 with input from Comcast Spectacor, the logo decal was enlarged and repainted in black.

It serves as the home of the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), and the [[Philadelphia Wings (2018\u2013)|Philadelphia Wings]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL). The arena lies at the southwest corner of the [[South Philadelphia Sports Complex]], which includes [[Lincoln Financial Field]], [[Citizens Bank Park]], and [[Xfinity Live! Philadelphia|Xfinity Live!]].\n\nThe Wells Fargo Center, originally called '''Spectrum II''', was completed in 1996 to replace the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] as the home arena of the 76ers and Flyers, on the former site of [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|John F. Kennedy Stadium]] at a cost of $210 million, largely privately financed (though the city and state helped to pay for the local [[infrastructure]]).  It is owned by [[Comcast Spectacor]], which also owns the Flyers, and is operated by its arena-management subsidiary, Global Spectrum. Since opening, it has been known by a number of different names through [[naming rights]] deals and bank mergers, including '''CoreStates Center''' from 1996 to 1998, '''First Union Center''' from 1998 to 2003, and '''Wachovia Center''' from 2003 to 2010. Since 2010, naming rights have been held by financial services company [[Wells Fargo]], after their merger with [[Wachovia]].\n\nIn addition to hosting home games for its main tenants, the arena has been the site of a number of other notable athletic events including Games 1 and 2 from the [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]] and Games 3, 4 and 6 of the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals]], Games 3, 4 and 5 of the [[2001 NBA Finals]], and various collegiate events for the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).

The Wells Fargo Center logo decal which sat on the 76ers court was in the most minimal text discernible by television cameras, colored in white to blend in with the floor. (Reportedly, 76ers CEO Scott O'Neil's first idea was to color it with clear-coat paint only visible with UV [[blacklight]]ing showing the logo during the opening of Sixers games when the arena lights were drawn down; however, the team, after discussion with their lawyers, elected not to do so.) With the start of the new year in January 2016 with input from Comcast Spectacor, the logo decal was enlarged and repainted in black.

In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor. Previously, boys were organised by year levels, and supervised by Year Level Coordinators, somewhat similar to the current system found in the Middle School (Years 7 to 9).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary - History|last=|first=|publisher=St. Kevin's College|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 11}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, a $16 million indoor pool, gym and sports facility, the Wilding Centre, was blessed by Cardinal [[George Pell]] and opened for the students.\n\nIn 2009 the Godfrey Building was opened.\n\nIn 2010, the Boyd Egan Hall was opened at Glendalough and substantial floods filled the school's ovals and damaged the Fraser Tennis Courts.\n\nIn 2011, work began on a three-storey $14 million Science Wing, located adjacent to [[Heyington railway station]] at the end of the Kearney Building. \n\nIn 2013, the Kearney West Building was officially opened. The building contains science labs and woodwork rooms, which are used for senior classes.\n\nIn 2014, the McMahon Music Centre was opened at Glendalough and the remaining laboratories in the Kearney Building were refurbished. Music and drama facilities in the Cummins Building were modernised as well.\n\nIn 2017, the Tooronga Fields Campus was opened as the St Kevin's offsite sports ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary 2018|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n2018 saw St Kevin's College celebrate its centenary year. A special 100-year logo was created and was used throughout the school year. Several celebrations were conducted, including a free lunch provided by the school, intended to pay homage to the older traditions of the College chartering a train from [[Heyington railway station]] to other parts of Melbourne for a school picnic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 1|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> Special events such as \"The Great Debate\", featuring generations of St Kevin's old boys, took place<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> and a limited-edition 100-year history of the College was published for students and staff.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bound by the Green, Gold and Blue|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2020}}\nSt Kevin's College has five campuses:\n*Glendalough \u2013 The St Kevin's College Junior School in Lansell Road, [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], is named after the location of the St Kevin's Monastery in Ireland.

In 1932, the school was moved to the corner of St George and Orrong Roads, Toorak. Property in Heyington was purchased and developed into playing fields. This location is now the Senior School Campus, housing Years 7 to 8, and Years 10 through to Year 12, in a vertical [[house system]].\n\nThe Heyington Campus, which is next to the [[Glen Waverley, Victoria|Glen Waverley]] railway line, was built in 1960, its main feature being the Kearney Building. \n\nThe Lansell Road property was opened in 1972, and that same year the Orrong Road property was sold. \n\nIn 1982, the K.C. Smith building was constructed for the middle school years on the Senior Campus.\n[[File:SKC Ovals 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Oval Number 1: Scoreboard in the background, and the Pavilion to the right]]In 1990 the Pavilion was opened. Since its opening, the Pavilion has flooded twice, both in 2005. Ovals 1 and 2 were completely submerged.\nThe Cummins Building was refurbished in 1997, and currently houses the creative arts precinct, which includes arts, drama, music and artistic works. The McCarthy Building was opened that year, housing art studios, the campus library and the Administration Block. \n\nThe Lansell Road property is now home to the Glendalough Campus, and in 1999 became a full [[primary school]], housing Prep to Year 6 students. Also in 1999, Year 9 students moved from the Senior Campus to a dedicated campus named Waterford in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Waterford currently resides in the former [[Vaucluse College FCJ]] site in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. 1999 saw a major change in the structure of the school, with the introduction of the House System for Years 10 to 12. This saw the desegregation of year levels and their amalgamation into houses with five tutor groups comprising Year 10, Year 11 and Year 12 boys, accompanied by a tutor. Previously, boys were organised by year levels, and supervised by Year Level Coordinators, somewhat similar to the current system found in the Middle School (Years 7 to 9).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary - History|last=|first=|publisher=St. Kevin's College|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2, 11}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, a $16 million indoor pool, gym and sports facility, the Wilding Centre, was blessed by Cardinal [[George Pell]] and opened for the students.\n\nIn 2009 the Godfrey Building was opened.\n\nIn 2010, the Boyd Egan Hall was opened at Glendalough and substantial floods filled the school's ovals and damaged the Fraser Tennis Courts.\n\nIn 2011, work began on a three-storey $14 million Science Wing, located adjacent to [[Heyington railway station]] at the end of the Kearney Building. \n\nIn 2013, the Kearney West Building was officially opened. The building contains science labs and woodwork rooms, which are used for senior classes.\n\nIn 2014, the McMahon Music Centre was opened at Glendalough and the remaining laboratories in the Kearney Building were refurbished. Music and drama facilities in the Cummins Building were modernised as well.\n\nIn 2017, the Tooronga Fields Campus was opened as the St Kevin's offsite sports ground.<ref>{{Cite book|title=St. Kevin's College Diary 2018|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}</ref>\n\n2018 saw St Kevin's College celebrate its centenary year. A special 100-year logo was created and was used throughout the school year. Several celebrations were conducted, including a free lunch provided by the school, intended to pay homage to the older traditions of the College chartering a train from [[Heyington railway station]] to other parts of Melbourne for a school picnic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 1|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> Special events such as \"The Great Debate\", featuring generations of St Kevin's old boys, took place<ref>{{Cite book|title=Omnia Magazine - 2018 Term 3|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=St. Kevin's College Heyington Library|pages=}}</ref> and a limited-edition 100-year history of the College was published for students and staff.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bound by the Green, Gold and Blue|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2020}}\nSt Kevin's College has five campuses:\n*Glendalough \u2013 The St Kevin's College Junior School in Lansell Road, [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]], is named after the location of the St Kevin's Monastery in Ireland.

In 1971, the album was nominated for the prestigious science fiction prize, the [[Hugo Award]], a rare honor for a musical recording.  Kantner and Slick were a couple during this period. Slick was pregnant during the recording of the album.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|p=231|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> Their daughter, [[China Kantner|China]], was born shortly thereafter.\n\nKantner and Slick with the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra released two follow-up albums: ''[[Sunfighter]]'', an environmentalism-tinged album released in 1971 to celebrate China's birth, and 1973's ''[[Baron von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun]]'', titled after the nicknames [[David Crosby]] had given to the couple. Bassist/keyboardist/vocalist [[David Freiberg]] was given equal billing alongside Kantner and Slick on the latter album. A founding member of [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], Freiberg had known and played with Kantner on the folk circuit in the early 1960s and sang background vocals on ''Blows Against the Empire''. Following a marijuana arrest that resulted in his departure from Quicksilver in 1971, he joined Jefferson Airplane as a vocalist for their 1972 tour, documented on the live ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Winterland]]'' (1973).\n\nKantner was introduced to the teenage guitarist [[Craig Chaquico]] through his friend Jack Traylor during this time.  Chaquico first appeared on ''Sunfighter'' and played with Kantner, Slick and their bands and then with Starship until 1990.\n\nEarly in 1974, Slick released ''[[Manhole (album)|Manhole]]'', her first solo album. It was on that album that Kantner, Slick and Freiberg next worked with [[Pete Sears]] (who had first played on [[Papa John Creach]]'s first solo album). Pete was co-producing a [[Kathi McDonald]] album in the same studio. Sears wrote the music to Grace's raunchy lyrics \"Better Lying Down,\" recorded the song, and also played bass on the song \"Epic #38\". It was during this session at Wally Heider studios in San Francisco that Kantner and Slick first approached Sears about playing in what would eventually become Jefferson Starship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|p=270|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> Sears had worked on three of [[Rod Stewart]]'s early British recordings, and had to go back to England to play on [[Smiler (album)|''Smiler'']], Stewart's last album made in London, so Jorma Kaukonen's brother [[Peter Kaukonen]] first played with the band early in 1974 before Sears returned to the States and replaced him in Jefferson Starship in June 1974. \n\nIn early 1974, with guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bass player Jack Casady having moved on to Hot Tuna full-time, Kantner decided to put together a touring band without them.  The musicians on ''Baron von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun'' formed the core of a new lineup that was formally reborn as Jefferson Starship. They appropriated the name from Kantner's ''Blows Against the Empire'', with manager [[Bill Thompson (manager)|Bill Thompson]] convincing the group that keeping the connection to Jefferson Airplane made sense from a business standpoint.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|p=267|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> It included the other five remaining members of Jefferson Airplane, including Kantner on rhythm guitar and vocals; Slick on vocals and percussion, David Freiberg on vocals and keyboards, [[John Barbata]], who had played with [[the Turtles]] and Crosby, Stills and Nash, on drums and Papa John Creach, from Hot Tuna, on electric violin. Jorma Kaukonen's brother, Peter (who had appeared on the albums ''Blows Against the Empire'' and ''Sunfighter''), was on bass. On lead guitar was Craig Chaquico who had played on three of Kantner and Slick's solo albums, as well as in the band Steelwind. The band began rehearsals in January 1974 and opened its first tour in Chicago on March 19. By April, it was decided that the band would go into the studio to record an album.  British veteran Pete Sears, who had worked on Slick's solo album, ''Manhole'', and played with Rod Stewart and John Cipollina, was selected to replace Peter Kaukonen as the band's bass player.\n\n=== 1974\u20131978 ===\n[[File:Jefferson Starship 1976.JPG|thumb|left|Promotional shot in 1976]]\nIn 1974, after touring as \"Jefferson Starship,\" Kantner, Slick, Freiberg, Chaquico, Pete Sears, Papa John Creach, and John Barbata recorded the album ''[[Dragon Fly (album)|Dragon Fly]]''.

''Modern Times,'' which also went gold, included the song \"Find Your Way Back\" (Chaquico), #29 on US Billboard Charts, as well as the humorous \"Stairway to Cleveland\", in which the band defended the numerous changes it had undergone in its musical style, personnel, and even name. \u2018\u2019Modern Times\u2019\u2019 also featured the promo single, \u201cSave Your Love\u201d, (P. and J.

Paul Kantner's 1983 solo album, ''[[Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra (album)|Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra]]'', included the track \"Circle of Fire\", which was recorded by Jefferson Starship in the summer of 1982.  Other members of the band also appeared on additional tracks on this effort. \u201cNuclear Furniture\u201d, produced by Ron Nevison, reached #28 and featured the singles, \u201cLayin\u2019 It On the Line\u201d (Chaquico and Thomas) and \u201cSorry Me, Sorry You\u201d (P. and J.

They would appear frequently on [[Music Television|MTV]] and other music-oriented television shows as ''Solid Gold'', and 1984's ''Super Night of Rock and Roll'', giving the band a high visibility in the MTV era.

In 1995 they released ''[[Deep Space / Virgin Sky]]'', a live album recorded at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, California on January 21, 1995. The album featured eight new and seven classic tunes.

This was a concept album featuring an ad hoc group of musicians (centered on Kantner, [[Grace Slick]], [[Joey Covington]], and [[Jack Casady]] of Jefferson Airplane; [[David Crosby]] & [[Graham Nash]]; and members of [[Grateful Dead]]) credited on the LP as \"Paul Kantner & Jefferson Starship\", marking the first use of that name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/music/album/paul-kantner-jefferson-starship/blows-against-the-empire/8d6kgx512wh2|title=Blows Against the Empire|website=Microsoft.com|access-date=July 5, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023164225/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/music/album/paul-kantner-jefferson-starship/blows-against-the-empire/8d6kgx512wh2|archive-date=October 23, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"BATE-AllMusic\">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/blows-against-the-empire-mw0000024441|title=Blows Against the Empire |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=September 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509080517/https://www.allmusic.com/album/blows-against-the-empire-mw0000024441|archive-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This agglomeration was informally known as the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra, a moniker later used on a Kantner album in the early 1980s.\n\nOn ''Blows Against the Empire'', Kantner and Slick sang about a group of people escaping Earth in a hijacked starship. In 1971, the album was nominated for the prestigious science fiction prize, the [[Hugo Award]], a rare honor for a musical recording.  Kantner and Slick were a couple during this period. Slick was pregnant during the recording of the album.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|p=231|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> Their daughter, [[China Kantner|China]], was born shortly thereafter.\n\nKantner and Slick with the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra released two follow-up albums: ''[[Sunfighter]]'', an environmentalism-tinged album released in 1971 to celebrate China's birth, and 1973's ''[[Baron von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun]]'', titled after the nicknames [[David Crosby]] had given to the couple. Bassist/keyboardist/vocalist [[David Freiberg]] was given equal billing alongside Kantner and Slick on the latter album. A founding member of [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], Freiberg had known and played with Kantner on the folk circuit in the early 1960s and sang background vocals on ''Blows Against the Empire''. Following a marijuana arrest that resulted in his departure from Quicksilver in 1971, he joined Jefferson Airplane as a vocalist for their 1972 tour, documented on the live ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Winterland]]'' (1973).\n\nKantner was introduced to the teenage guitarist [[Craig Chaquico]] through his friend Jack Traylor during this time.  Chaquico first appeared on ''Sunfighter'' and played with Kantner, Slick and their bands and then with Starship until 1990.\n\nEarly in 1974, Slick released ''[[Manhole (album)|Manhole]]'', her first solo album. It was on that album that Kantner, Slick and Freiberg next worked with [[Pete Sears]] (who had first played on [[Papa John Creach]]'s first solo album). Pete was co-producing a [[Kathi McDonald]] album in the same studio. Sears wrote the music to Grace's raunchy lyrics \"Better Lying Down,\" recorded the song, and also played bass on the song \"Epic #38\". It was during this session at Wally Heider studios in San Francisco that Kantner and Slick first approached Sears about playing in what would eventually become Jefferson Starship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|p=270|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> Sears had worked on three of [[Rod Stewart]]'s early British recordings, and had to go back to England to play on [[Smiler (album)|''Smiler'']], Stewart's last album made in London, so Jorma Kaukonen's brother [[Peter Kaukonen]] first played with the band early in 1974 before Sears returned to the States and replaced him in Jefferson Starship in June 1974. \n\nIn early 1974, with guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bass player Jack Casady having moved on to Hot Tuna full-time, Kantner decided to put together a touring band without them.  The musicians on ''Baron von Tollbooth & the Chrome Nun'' formed the core of a new lineup that was formally reborn as Jefferson Starship. They appropriated the name from Kantner's ''Blows Against the Empire'', with manager [[Bill Thompson (manager)|Bill Thompson]] convincing the group that keeping the connection to Jefferson Airplane made sense from a business standpoint.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tamarakin |first=Jeff |year=2003 |title=Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane |publisher=Simon and Schuster|p=267|isbn=0-671-03403-0}}</ref> It included the other five remaining members of Jefferson Airplane, including Kantner on rhythm guitar and vocals; Slick on vocals and percussion, David Freiberg on vocals and keyboards, [[John Barbata]], who had played with [[the Turtles]] and Crosby, Stills and Nash, on drums and Papa John Creach, from Hot Tuna, on electric violin. Jorma Kaukonen's brother, Peter (who had appeared on the albums ''Blows Against the Empire'' and ''Sunfighter''), was on bass. On lead guitar was Craig Chaquico who had played on three of Kantner and Slick's solo albums, as well as in the band Steelwind. The band began rehearsals in January 1974 and opened its first tour in Chicago on March 19. By April, it was decided that the band would go into the studio to record an album.  British veteran Pete Sears, who had worked on Slick's solo album, ''Manhole'', and played with Rod Stewart and John Cipollina, was selected to replace Peter Kaukonen as the band's bass player.\n\n=== 1974\u20131978 ===\n[[File:Jefferson Starship 1976.JPG|thumb|left|Promotional shot in 1976]]\nIn 1974, after touring as \"Jefferson Starship,\" Kantner, Slick, Freiberg, Chaquico, Pete Sears, Papa John Creach, and John Barbata recorded the album ''[[Dragon Fly (album)|Dragon Fly]]''. Jorma Kaukonen's brother Peter had played bass during the group's spring tour in 1974, but was replaced by [[Pete Sears]] who, like Freiberg, played bass and keyboards.
