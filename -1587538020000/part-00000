{"title_page": "Hillary Clinton email controversy", "text_new": "{{short description|American political controversy surrounding Hillary Clinton's conduct while Secretary of State}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{Hillary Clinton series}}\nDuring [[Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State|her tenure as United States Secretary of State]], [[Hillary Clinton]] drew controversy by using a private [[email server]] for official public communications rather than using official [[United States Department of State|State Department]] email accounts maintained on secure federal servers. An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] examination of Clinton's server found over 100 emails containing classified information, including 65 emails deemed \"Secret\" and 22 deemed \"Top Secret\". An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively classified by the State Department. \n\nSome experts, officials, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] contended that Clinton's use of a private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] and a private server violated federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1924, regarding the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, as well as State Department protocols and procedures, and regulations governing [[recordkeeping]]. Clinton responded that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. News reports by NBC and CNN indicated that the emails discussed \"innocuous\" matters already available in the public domain. For example, the [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|CIA drone program]] has been widely discussed in the public domain since the early 2000s; however, the very existence of the program is technically classified, so sharing a newspaper article that mentions it would constitute a security breach according to the CIA.<ref name=\"secrecy defines\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=DoD Warns Employees of Classified Info in Public Domain |work=Federation of American Scientists |date=June 11, 2013 |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/06/dod-classified/ }}</ref>  \n\nThe controversy was a major point of discussion and contention during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|State Department's Office of the Inspector General]] released a report about the State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. In July, FBI director [[James Comey]] announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" but recommended that no charges be filed. Clinton's opponent, then presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], used the nickname \"Crooked Hillary\" to criticize Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nicknames-for-rivals-from-rocket-man-to-pocahontas |title=Trump's nicknames for rivals, from 'Rocket Man' to 'Pocahontas'|first=Kaitlyn|last=Schallhorn|date=April 17, 2018|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn October 28, 2016, days before the election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered emails.

An [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] examination of Clinton's server found over 100 emails containing classified information, including 65 emails deemed \"Secret\" and 22 deemed \"Top Secret\". An additional 2,093 emails not marked classified were retroactively classified by the State Department. \n\nSome experts, officials, and members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] contended that Clinton's use of a private [[Message transfer agent|messaging system]] and a private server violated federal law, specifically 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f1924, regarding the unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or materials, as well as State Department protocols and procedures, and regulations governing [[recordkeeping]]. Clinton responded that her use complied with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts. News reports by NBC and CNN indicated that the emails discussed \"innocuous\" matters already available in the public domain. For example, the [[Drone strikes in Pakistan|CIA drone program]] has been widely discussed in the public domain since the early 2000s; however, the very existence of the program is technically classified, so sharing a newspaper article that mentions it would constitute a security breach according to the CIA.<ref name=\"secrecy defines\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=DoD Warns Employees of Classified Info in Public Domain |work=Federation of American Scientists |date=June 11, 2013 |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/06/dod-classified/ }}</ref>  \n\nThe controversy was a major point of discussion and contention during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], in which Clinton was the Democratic nominee. In May, the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of State|State Department's Office of the Inspector General]] released a report about the State Department's email practices, including Clinton's. In July, FBI director [[James Comey]] announced that the FBI investigation had concluded that Clinton had been \"extremely careless\" but recommended that no charges be filed. Clinton's opponent, then presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], used the nickname \"Crooked Hillary\" to criticize Clinton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-nicknames-for-rivals-from-rocket-man-to-pocahontas |title=Trump's nicknames for rivals, from 'Rocket Man' to 'Pocahontas'|first=Kaitlyn|last=Schallhorn|date=April 17, 2018|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn October 28, 2016, days before the election, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had started looking into newly discovered emails.
