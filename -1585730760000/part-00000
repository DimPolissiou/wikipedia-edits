A systematic literature review was conducted to objectively determine the best way to calculate individual/household carbon footprints. This review identified 13 calculation principles and subsequently used the same principles to evaluate the 15 most popular online carbon footprint calculators. A recent study's results by Carnegie Mellon's Christopher Weber found that the calculation of carbon footprints for products is often filled with large uncertainties. The variables of owning electronic goods such as the production, shipment, and previous technology used to make that product, can make it difficult to create an accurate carbon footprint.

This assesses the number of \"earths\" that would be required if everyone on the planet consumed resources at the same level as the person calculating their ecological footprint. The carbon footprint is one part of the ecological footprint. The carbon part was popularized by a large campaign of [[BP]] in 2005.<ref name=Safire2008/> Carbon footprints are more focused than ecological footprints since they measure merely emissions of gases that cause climate change into the atmosphere.\n\nCarbon footprint is one of a family of footprint indicators, which also include [[water footprint]] and [[land footprint]].\n\n== Direct carbon emissions ==\nDirect carbon emissions come from sources that are directly from the site that is producing a product.<ref name=\":1\" /> These emissions can also be referred to as scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.\n\nScope 1 emissions are emissions that are directly emitted from the site of the process or service.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Accounting for Carbon Monitoring, Reporting and Verifying Emissions in the Climate Economy|last=Bellassen|first=Valentin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781316162262|location=|pages=6}}</ref> An example for industry would be the emissions related to burning a fuel on site.

Walking, biking, [[carpooling]], [[mass transportation]] and combining trips result in burning less fuel and releasing fewer emissions into the atmosphere. \n\nThe choice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint. Animal sources of protein (especially red meat), rice (typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies), foods transported long-distance or via fuel-inefficient transport (e.g., highly perishable produce flown long-distance) and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet.

Exchanging two-thirds of the animal protein with plant protein is roughly equivalent to switching from a Toyota Camry to a Prius. Finally, throwing food out not only adds its associated carbon emissions to a person or household's footprint, but it also adds the emissions of transporting the wasted food to the garbage dump and the emissions of food decomposition, mostly in the form of the highly potent greenhouse gas, methane.\n\nOptions to reduce the carbon footprint of humans include [[Waste hierarchy|Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse]]. This can be done by using reusable items such as thermoses for daily coffee or plastic containers for water and other cold beverages rather than disposable ones. If that option isn't available, it is best to properly recycle the disposable items after use.<ref name=\"environment.about.com\">{{cite web|url=http://environment.about.com/od/globalwarming/tp/globalwarmtips.htm|title=Personal Steps You Can Take to Fight Global Warming|author=Larry West|work=About.com News & Issues}}</ref>{{reliable source|date=December 2012}} When one household recycles at least half of their household waste, they can save 1.2 tons of carbon dioxide annually.{{cite needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAnother option for reducing the [[carbon]] footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home.

However, there are some general steps that can be taken to reduce carbon footprint on a larger scale.\n\nIn 2016, the EIA reported that in the US electricity is responsible for roughly 37% of Carbon Dioxide emissions, making it a potential target for reductions.<ref>\nEasterlyn, Jonah. \"U.S. Energy Information Administration - EIA - Independent Statistics and Analysis.\" How Much of U.S. Carbon Dioxide Emissions Are Associated with Electricity Generation? - FAQ - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

By calculating or predicting a process\u2019 carbon footprint high emissions areas can be identified and steps can be taken to reduce in those areas.\n\n== Schemes to reduce carbon emissions: Kyoto Protocol, carbon offsetting, and certificates ==\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and the emissions of other GHGs, are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels, like natural gas, crude oil and coal. While this is harmful to the environment, [[carbon offset]]s can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects.\n\nThe [[Kyoto Protocol]] defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Accordingly, from an economic or market perspective, one has to distinguish between a ''mandatory market'' and a ''voluntary market''. Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:\n\n*[[Certified Emission Reduction]] (CER)\n*[[Emission Reduction Unit]] (ERU)\n*[[Verified Emission Reduction]] (VER)\n\n=== Mandatory market mechanisms ===\nTo reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol, with the least economical costs, the following [[Flexible Mechanisms|flexible mechanisms]] were introduced for the mandatory market:\n\n*[[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM)\n*[[Joint Implementation]] (JI)\n*[[Emissions trading]]\n\nThe CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments, while [[Emissions Trading]] allows those instruments to be sold on international markets.\n\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate [[Certified Emissions Reduction]]s (CERs).\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs).\n\nThe CERs and ERUs can then be sold through [[Emissions Trading]]. The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by:\n\n* Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.\n* Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes.\n\nNations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter [[Emissions Trading]] to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls.  Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries.  If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through [[Emissions Trading]].  While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating [[Emissions Trading]] and setting a [[market price]] for emissions.\n\nA well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS).\n\nNew changes are being made to the trading schemes. The [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] is set to make some new changes within the next year. The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\">Callick, Rowan. \"Nations Split on Route to Reduce Carbon Emissions.\" The Australian. 2 March 2011. Web. 1 March 2011.</ref>\n\nOther nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few years. These nations include China, India and the United States.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\" />\n\n=== Voluntary market mechanisms ===\nIn contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions. A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the Verified Emission Reductions (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in mandatory market.\n\nThe voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] is a voluntary yet legally binding [[emissions trading|cap-and-trade emission scheme]] whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go [[carbon neutral]]. Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.\n\nThere are project developers, wholesalers, brokers, and retailers, as well as carbon funds, in the voluntary market. Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above. A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain\u2014from project developer to retailer.<ref name=\"ecosysmarket\">{{cite web|url=http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170031/http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|archivedate=10 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=21 August 2007|df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nWhile some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects, these projects flourish in the voluntary markets. A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects. However, others note the community co-benefits that [[forestry]] projects foster.\nProject types in the voluntary market range from avoided [[deforestation]], afforestation/reforestation, industrial gas [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestration]], increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], fuel switching, [[Carbon capture and storage|methane capture]] from coal plants and [[Climate change and agriculture#Livestock|livestock]], and even [[renewable energy]].

A recent study's results by Carnegie Mellon's Christopher Weber found that the calculation of carbon footprints for products is often filled with large uncertainties. The variables of owning electronic goods such as the production, shipment, and previous technology used to make that product, can make it difficult to create an accurate carbon footprint.

The ACEEE reported that energy efficiency has the potential to save the US over 800 billion kWh per year, based on 2015 data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aceee.org/sites/default/files/publications/researchreports/u1604.pdf|title=The Greatest Energy Story You Haven't Heard: How Investing in Energy Efficiency Changed the US Power Sector and Gave Us a Tool to Tackle Climate Change|last=Molina|first=Maggie|date=October 2016|website=ACEEE}}</ref> Some potential options to increase energy efficiency include, but are not limited to:<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Strategies to Improve Industrial Energy Efficiency|pages=325\u2013330|journal=Procedia Cirp|volume=15|doi=10.1016/j.procir.2014.06.074|date=January 2014|last1=o'Rielly|first1=K.|last2=Jeswiet|first2=J.}}</ref>\n\n* Waste heat recovery systems\n* Insulation for large buildings and combustion chambers\n* Technology upgrades, ie different light sources, lower consumption machines\n\nCarbon Footprints from energy consumption can be reduced through the development of [[alternative energy]] projects, such as solar and wind energy, which are renewable resources.\n\n[[Reforestation]], the restocking of existing forests or woodlands that have previously been depleted, is an example of [[Carbon offset|Carbon Offsetting]], the counteracting of carbon dioxide emissions with an equivalent reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite book |last=Corbett |first=James |chapter=Carbon Footprint |editor1=Brenda Wilmoth Lerner |editor2=K.

By calculating or predicting a process\u2019 carbon footprint high emissions areas can be identified and steps can be taken to reduce in those areas.\n\n== Schemes to reduce carbon emissions: Kyoto Protocol, carbon offsetting, and certificates ==\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and the emissions of other GHGs, are often associated with the burning of fossil fuels, like natural gas, crude oil and coal. While this is harmful to the environment, [[carbon offset]]s can be purchased in an attempt to make up for these harmful effects.\n\nThe [[Kyoto Protocol]] defines legally binding targets and timetables for cutting the GHG emissions of industrialized countries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Accordingly, from an economic or market perspective, one has to distinguish between a ''mandatory market'' and a ''voluntary market''. Typical for both markets is the trade with emission certificates:\n\n*[[Certified Emission Reduction]] (CER)\n*[[Emission Reduction Unit]] (ERU)\n*[[Verified Emission Reduction]] (VER)\n\n=== Mandatory market mechanisms ===\nTo reach the goals defined in the Kyoto Protocol, with the least economical costs, the following [[Flexible Mechanisms|flexible mechanisms]] were introduced for the mandatory market:\n\n*[[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM)\n*[[Joint Implementation]] (JI)\n*[[Emissions trading]]\n\nThe CDM and JI mechanisms requirements for projects which create a supply of emission reduction instruments, while [[Emissions Trading]] allows those instruments to be sold on international markets.\n\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the CDM mechanism generate [[Certified Emissions Reduction]]s (CERs).\n* Projects which are compliant with the requirements of the JI mechanism generate [[Emission Reduction Unit]]s (ERUs).\n\nThe CERs and ERUs can then be sold through [[Emissions Trading]]. The demand for the CERs and ERUs being traded is driven by:\n\n* Shortfalls in national emission reduction obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.\n* Shortfalls amongst entities obligated under local emissions reduction schemes.\n\nNations which have failed to deliver their Kyoto emissions reductions obligations can enter [[Emissions Trading]] to purchase CERs and ERUs to cover their treaty shortfalls.  Nations and groups of nations can also create local emission reduction schemes which place mandatory carbon dioxide emission targets on entities within their national boundaries.  If the rules of a scheme allow, the obligated entities may be able to cover all or some of any reduction shortfalls by purchasing CERs and ERUs through [[Emissions Trading]].  While local emissions reduction schemes have no status under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] itself, they play a prominent role in creating the demand for CERs and ERUs, stimulating [[Emissions Trading]] and setting a [[market price]] for emissions.\n\nA well-known mandatory local emissions trading scheme is the [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS).\n\nNew changes are being made to the trading schemes. The [[EU Emissions Trading Scheme]] is set to make some new changes within the next year. The new changes will target the emissions produced by flight travel in and out of the European Union.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\">Callick, Rowan. \"Nations Split on Route to Reduce Carbon Emissions.\" The Australian. 2 March 2011. Web. 1 March 2011.</ref>\n\nOther nations are scheduled to start participating in Emissions Trading Schemes within the next few years. These nations include China, India and the United States.<ref name=\"Callick, Rowan 2011\" />\n\n=== Voluntary market mechanisms ===\nIn contrast to the strict rules set out for the mandatory market, the voluntary market provides companies with different options to acquire emissions reductions. A solution, comparable with those developed for the mandatory market, has been developed for the voluntary market, the Verified Emission Reductions (VER). This measure has the great advantage that the projects/activities are managed according to the quality standards set out for CDM/JI projects but the certificates provided are not registered by the governments of the host countries or the Executive Board of the UNO. As such, high quality VERs can be acquired at lower costs for the same project quality. However, at present VERs can not be used in mandatory market.\n\nThe voluntary market in North America is divided between members of the Chicago Climate Exchange and the Over The Counter (OTC) market. The [[Chicago Climate Exchange]] is a voluntary yet legally binding [[emissions trading|cap-and-trade emission scheme]] whereby members commit to the capped emission reductions and must purchase allowances from other members or offset excess emissions. The OTC market does not involve a legally binding scheme and a wide array of buyers from the public and private spheres, as well as special events that want to go [[carbon neutral]]. Being carbon neutral refers to achieving net zero carbon emissions by balancing a measured amount of carbon released with an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, or buying enough carbon credits to make up the difference.\n\nThere are project developers, wholesalers, brokers, and retailers, as well as carbon funds, in the voluntary market. Some businesses and nonprofits in the voluntary market encompass more than just one of the activities listed above. A report by Ecosystem Marketplace shows that carbon offset prices increase as it moves along the supply chain\u2014from project developer to retailer.<ref name=\"ecosysmarket\">{{cite web|url=http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170031/http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/documents/acrobat/StateoftheVoluntaryCarbonMarket18July_Final.pdf|archivedate=10 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=21 August 2007|df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nWhile some mandatory emission reduction schemes exclude forest projects, these projects flourish in the voluntary markets. A major criticism concerns the imprecise nature of GHG sequestration quantification methodologies for forestry projects. However, others note the community co-benefits that [[forestry]] projects foster.\nProject types in the voluntary market range from avoided [[deforestation]], afforestation/reforestation, industrial gas [[Carbon dioxide sink|sequestration]], increased [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], fuel switching, [[Carbon capture and storage|methane capture]] from coal plants and [[Climate change and agriculture#Livestock|livestock]], and even [[renewable energy]].

Since 1988, mainland [[Opening of China|China's opening]] to the outside world has been extended to its border areas, areas along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and inland areas. First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region.

In addition, 15 [[Free-trade zone|free trade zones]], 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and [[high-tech]] industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As these open areas adopt different preferential policies, they play the dual roles of \"windows\" in developing the [[Export-oriented economy|foreign-oriented economy]], generating foreign exchanges through exporting products and importing advanced technologies and of \"radiators\" in accelerating inland economic development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPrimarily geared to exporting processed goods, the five SEZs are [[International trade|foreign trade]]-oriented areas which integrate science, industry and innovation with trade. Foreign firms benefit from preferential policies such as [[Tax incentive|lower tax rates]], reduced regulations and special managerial systems.

The government has extended special preferential policies to the Pudong New Area that are not currently enjoyed by the special economic zones. For instance, in addition to the preferential policies of reducing or eliminating [[Customs duties]] and [[income tax]] common to the economic and technological development zones, the state also permits the zone to allow foreign business people to open [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and run [[Tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. In addition, the state has given Shanghai permission to set up a [[stock exchange]], expand its examination and approval authority over investments and allow foreign-funded banks to engage in [[renminbi|RMB]] business.

Since 1988, mainland [[Opening of China|China's opening]] to the outside world has been extended to its border areas, areas along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and inland areas. First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region. In June 1990, the Chinese government opened the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, and additional cities along the Yangtze River valley, with Shanghai's Pudong New Area as its \"dragon head.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of [[Border city|border cities]], and in addition, opened all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions. In addition, 15 [[Free-trade zone|free trade zones]], 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and [[high-tech]] industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As these open areas adopt different preferential policies, they play the dual roles of \"windows\" in developing the [[Export-oriented economy|foreign-oriented economy]], generating foreign exchanges through exporting products and importing advanced technologies and of \"radiators\" in accelerating inland economic development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPrimarily geared to exporting processed goods, the five SEZs are [[International trade|foreign trade]]-oriented areas which integrate science, industry and innovation with trade. Foreign firms benefit from preferential policies such as [[Tax incentive|lower tax rates]], reduced regulations and special managerial systems. In 1999, Shenzhen's new-and high-tech industry reached an output value of high-tech products of 81.98 billion [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]], making up 40.5% of the city's total industrial output value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince its founding in 1992, the Shanghai Pudong New Area has made progress in both absorbing foreign capital and accelerating the economic development of the Yangtze River valley. The government has extended special preferential policies to the Pudong New Area that are not currently enjoyed by the special economic zones. For instance, in addition to the preferential policies of reducing or eliminating [[Customs duties]] and [[income tax]] common to the economic and technological development zones, the state also permits the zone to allow foreign business people to open [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and run [[Tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. In addition, the state has given Shanghai permission to set up a [[stock exchange]], expand its examination and approval authority over investments and allow foreign-funded banks to engage in [[renminbi|RMB]] business. In 1999, the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of the Pudong New Area came to 80 billion yuan, and the total industrial output value, 145 billion yuan.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nIn May 2010, the PRC designated the city of [[Kashgar]] in [[Xinjiang]] a SEZ. Kashgar's annual growth rate was 17.4 percent in 2009, and Kashgar's designation has since increased [[Tourism in China|tourism]] and [[Real estate in China|real estate prices]] in the city. Kashgar is close to China's border with the independent states of former [[Soviet Central Asia]] and the SEZ seeks to capitalize on international trade links between China and those states.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/25/china-s-hottest-cities-and-kashgar.html|title=A New Shenzhen|author=Fish, Isaac Stone|date=2010-09-25|accessdate=2011-07-29|magazine=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref>\n\n== List of SEZs ==\nAs part of its economic reforms and policy of opening to the world, between 1980 and 1984 China established [[special economic zone]]s (SEZs) in [[Shantou]], [[Shenzhen]], and [[Zhuhai]] in [[Guangdong]] Province and [[Xiamen]] in [[Fujian]] Province and designated the entire island province of [[Hainan]] a special economic zone.\n\nIn 1984, China opened 14 other coastal cities to overseas investment (listed north to south): [[Dalian]], [[Qinhuangdao]], [[Tianjin]], [[Yantai]], [[Qingdao]], [[Lianyungang]], [[Nantong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Ningbo]], [[Wenzhou]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Zhanjiang]], and [[Beihai]].\n\nThen, beginning in 1985, the central government expanded the coastal area by establishing the following open economic zones (listed north to south): the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], [[Hebei]] Province (which surrounds [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]]; see [[Jingjinji]]), the [[Shandong]] Peninsula, [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Xiamen]]-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in southern Fujian Province, the [[Pearl River Delta]], and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region.\n\nIn 1990, the Chinese government decided to open the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, as well as more cities in the Yang Zi River Valley.\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of border cities and all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions.\n\nIn addition, 15 free-trade zones, 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and high-tech industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities.

Association'''\n\nThe Mercyhurst women's hockey program predates NCAA governance in the sport. The Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association was formed by Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, the University of Findlay in Findlay, Ohio and Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, when the Title IX law protecting equity in sports was making major changes to women's athletics.\n\nA Mercyhurst Men's Assistant Coach since 1993, Michael Sisti, was named the inaugural head coach. As of the end of the 2019\u201320 season, he remains the only head coach in the program's history. Sisti had been a star forward for Canisius College, where he graduated in 1990.\n\nMercyhurst was immediately successful in the GLWHA. They were 23-6-0 in 1999\u201300. Most of their games were shutout wins, and scored 10 or more goals on six occasions.\n\nIn 2000-01 they were far less successful, going 14-16-3, playing more established programs.\n\nIn 2001\u201302, they saw great success again, with a 24-8-1 record, and the final GLWHA Championship.\n\n'''College Hockey America through 2005-06'''\n\nAs the NCAA became the primary governing body of women's hockey, the conferences began to merge with existing men's conferences. The Mercyhurst men were part of the Metro Atlantic Conference, while Findlay and Wayne States' mens programs were in [[College Hockey America]], which began organizing as a women's conference as well. The new CHA women's conference included Mercyhust, Findlay and Wayne State from the GLWHA, and Niagara University.\n\nIn the first four years of the conference, Mercyhurst dominated the competition. Within the conference, they were 38-1-3, winning every regular season, and every tournament. Their overall record was 102-29-13 for the same period. In the first two years of the conference, the CHA a smaller conference against much more storied conferences, like the ECAC and the WCHA. As a result, Mercyhurst did not receive a bid to appear in the NCAA Tournament. In 2005, the Lakers received their first bid, traveling to powerful Harvard University on March 19. The ensuing game was one of the most bitterly fought in tournament history, with Harvard prevailing 5\u20134 in the third overtime period. During that game, Mercyhurst goaltender Desi Clark set a single game save record of 78 stops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/w_icehockey_rb/2020/D1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Division I Women\u2019s Records|website=Fs.ncaa.org|accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref> That record still stands at the Division I level as of the end of the 2019\u201320 season. In the following year, the Lakers had similar bad luck, this time losing to Wisconsin in 2 overtimes.\n\nThe CHA Conference saw some changes, as Findlay dropped their program in 2004, and the Robert Morris Colonials joining for 2005\u201306, after Quinnipiac joined for a single year (2004\u201305).\n\n'''The Meghan Agosta years'''\n\nBy the mid-2000s Mercyhurst College (it would become Mercyhurst University in 2012), had several advantages in recruiting: The college itself, a small Catholic institustion with very good academics; The success and graduation rate of its athletes; and, the overwhelming success of the team. The campus location near Lake Ontario was attractive to young women from Ontario, New York and Pennsylvania, a large pool of talent.\n\nIn 2006, the Lakers attracted [[Megan Agosta]], perhaps the most sought-after talent in the NCAA. Even before attending college, she had won an Olympic gold medal at the 2006 Turin games with Team Canada. She became one of the best players of the decade in NCAA play.\n\nAgosta would be the first ever freshman to be a top three finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cdn2.sportngin.com/attachments/document/f304-2130731/ALL_TIME_PATTYKAZ.pdf#_ga=2.55151595.1161681440.1585364091-252096202.1583618013 |title=All time Patty kaz statistics |publisher=The Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award.com  |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Mercyhurst successfully recruited [[Vicki Bendus]], who would win the 2010 [[Patty Kazmaier Award]] as the nation's top player, and was a top-10 finalist in the following year.\n\nIn addition, the Lakers recruited Katariina Soikkanen of the Finnish National team, as well as Angelica Lorsell and Johanna Malmstrom who played for the Swedish National Team. The Lakers also had four players on the roster who played on the Canadian Under-22 Team. Mercyhurst had two CHA First Team selections in 2006\u201307, one second team choice, the Player and Rookie of the Year, and four members of the All-Rookie Team.\n\nWith the addition of these players, in addition to a potent roster in totalit, Mercyhurst achieved even more success.\n\nDuring her college career, Agosta would score 157 goals and 303 points, both NCAA records. Her international play meant substantial time off from the Mercyhirst team, making these records all the more impressive.\n\nThe best year in Mercyhurst history came in 2009\u201310. In that season, the Lakers started the season with a record of 19 wins, 1 loss and 3 ties (Conference Record, 6\u20130\u20131). They were the top ranked team in the USA TODAY/USA Hockey Magazine poll for 14 consecutive weeks and were the unanimous choice with all 19 first-place votes eight times. Their only loss came in an October home split with Minnesota-Duluth<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/hockey/2010-01-27-mercyhurst-lakers_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Being No. 1 doesn't faze Lakers; WCHA teams dominate top 15 | first=Eddie | last=Timanus | date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> until the Nation Championship game against Wisconsin on March 22, 2009, which they lost 5\u20130. It was the Laker's only NCAA Championship Game. During that season, Meghan Agosto took time away to participate in her second Olympic games, this time in Vancouver, Canada.

The program started in 1999 and Michael Sisti has been the only coach in the history of the program. From 2000 to 2002, the Lakers were part of the Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association. While in the Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association, the Lakers qualified for the GLWHA tournament twice (in 2001, and 2002). The Lakers were regular season champions in 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302, and won the playoff championships in 2002. For the 2002\u201303 season, the Lakers joined the [[College Hockey America]] conference.\n\n==Season by season results==\n'''''Note:''' GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties''\n{|

Association'''\n\nThe Mercyhurst women's hockey program predates NCAA governance in the sport. The Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association was formed by Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, the University of Findlay in Findlay, Ohio and Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, when the Title IX law protecting equity in sports was making major changes to women's athletics.\n\nA Mercyhurst Men's Assistant Coach since 1993, Michael Sisti, was named the inauguaral head coach. As of the end of the 2019-20 season, he remains the only head coach in the program's history. Sisti had been a star forward for Canisius College, where he graduated in 1990. \n\nMercyhurst was immediately successful in the GLWHA. They were 23-6-0 in 1999-00. Most of their games were shutout wins, and scored 10 or more goals on six occasions. \n\nIn 2000-01 they were far less successful, going 14-16-3, playing more established programs.\n\nIn 2001-02, they saw great success again, with a 24-8-1 record, and the final GLWHA Championship.\n\n'''College Hockey America through 2005-06'''\n\nAs the NCAA became the primary governing body of women's hockey, the conferences began to merge with existing men's conferences. The Mercyhurst men were part of the Metro Atlantic Conference, while Findlay and Wayne States' mens programs were in [[College Hockey America]], which began organizing as a women's conference as well. The new CHA women's conference included Mercyhust, Findlay and Wayne State from the GLWHA, and Niagara University.\n\nIn the first four years of the conference, Mercyhurst dominated the competition. Within the conference, they were 38-1-3, winning every regular season, and every tournament. Their overall record was 102-29-13 for the same period. In the first two years of the conference, the CHA a smaller conference against much more storied conferences, like the ECAC and the WCHA. As a result, Mercyhurst did not receive a bid to appear in the NCAA Tournament. In 2005, the Lakers received their first bid, traveling to powerful Harvard University on March 19. The ensuing game was one of the most bitterly fought in tournament history, with Harvard prevailing 5-4 in the third overtime period. During that game, Mercyhurst goaltender Desi Clark set a single game save record of 78 stops<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/w_icehockey_rb/2020/D1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Division I Women\u2019s Records|website=Fs.ncaa.org|accessdate=24 March 2020}}</ref>. That record still stands at the Division I level as of the end of the 2019-20 season. In the following year, the Lakers had similar bad luck, this time losing to Wisconsin in 2 overtimes.\n\nThe CHA Conference saw some changes, as Findlay dropped their program in 2004, and the Robert Morris Colonials joining for 2005-06, after Quinnipiac joined for a single year (2004-05). \n\n'''The Meghan Agosta years'''\n\nBy the mid-2000s Mercyhurst College (it would become Mercyhurst University in 2012), had several advantages in recruiting: The college itself, a small Catholic institustion with very good academics; The success and graduation rate of its athletes; and, the overwhelming success of the team. The campus location near Lake Ontario was attractive to young women from Ontario, New York and Pennsylvania, a large pool of talent.\n\nIn 2006, the Lakers attracted [[Megan Agosta]], perhaps the most sought-after talent in the NCAA. Even before attending college, she had won an Olympic gold medal at the 2006 Turin games with Team Canada. She became one of the best players of the decade in NCAA play.\n\nAgosta would be the first ever freshman to be a top three finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cdn2.sportngin.com/attachments/document/f304-2130731/ALL_TIME_PATTYKAZ.pdf#_ga=2.55151595.1161681440.1585364091-252096202.1583618013 |title=All time Patty kaz statistics |publisher=The Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award.com  |accessdate=27 March 2020 </ref>\n\nIn 2007, Mercyhurst successfully recruited [[Vicki Bendus]], who would win the 2010 [[Patty Kazmaier Award]] as the nation's top player, and was a top-10 finalist in the following year.\n\nIn addition, the Lakers recruited Katariina Soikkanen of the Finnish National team, as well as Angelica Lorsell and Johanna Malmstrom who played for the Swedish National Team. The Lakers also had four players on the roster who played on the Canadian Under-22 Team. Mercyhurst had two CHA First Team selections in 2006\u201307, one second team choice, the Player and Rookie of the Year, and four members of the All-Rookie Team.\n\nWith the addition of these players, in addition to a potent roster in totalit, Mercyhurst acheived even more success.\n\nDuring her college career, Agosta would score 157 goals and 303 points, both NCAA records. Her international play meant substantial time off from the Mercyhirst team, making these records all the more impressive.\n\nThe best year in Mercyhurst history came in 2009-10. In that season, the Lakers started the season with a record of 19 wins, 1 loss and 3 ties (Conference Record, 6\u20130\u20131). They were the top ranked team in the USA TODAY/USA Hockey Magazine poll for 14 consecutive weeks and were the unanimous choice with all 19 first-place votes eight times. Their only loss came in an October home split with Minnesota-Duluth<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/hockey/2010-01-27-mercyhurst-lakers_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Being No. 1 doesn't faze Lakers; WCHA teams dominate top 15 | first=Eddie | last=Timanus | date=January 27, 2010}}</ref> until the Nation Championship game against Wisconsin on March 22, 2009, which they lost 5-0. It was the Laker's only NCAA Championship Game. During that season, Meghan Agosto took time away to participate in her second Olympic games, this time in Vancouver, Canada. She won her second gold medal and was named the Most Valuable Player in women's hockey in the Olympic Games.\n\n===2019\u201320 Lakers===\n\n{{refbegin}}\n<ref>{{cite

The reverse of the banknote featured a depiction of the Philippine declaration of independence by Emilio Aguinaldo on June 12, 1898.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.\n\nThe [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] has stopped printing this banknote in 1996 (with its last production year is 1995), and it has been replaced by an [[Philippine five peso coin|equivalent coin]].\n\n===10-peso banknote===\nThe 10-peso banknote designed by Rafael Asuncion was issued months after the 5-peso banknote was issued.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored brown.\n\nThe obverse side of the 10-peso banknote featured [[Apolinario Mabini]] on the left and [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] on the right. Bonifacio was the founder of the [[Katipunan]] (KKK), a secret society established to fight the Spanish colonial government. Mabini was the Philippines' first [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]]. Depicted on the right side was one of the flags of the Katipunan (see [[Flags of the Philippine Revolution]]), the ''Kartilya ng Katipunan'', and a letter written by Mabini.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote featured the [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos, Bulacan]], site of the first Philippine Congress and where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Malolos Constitution]] was drafted. The right portion depicted the initiation rites of the Katipunan. Members accepted into the society had to sign their name on the society's roster using their own blood. The design was previously used on the 5-peso  \"Pilipino\" and \"Ang Bagong Lipunan\" notes.\n\nBefore 1997, the 10-peso banknote only depicted Mabini and the Barasoain Church. In recent years, the banknote has since been replaced with a [[Bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] 10-peso coin also bearing the effigies of Bonifacio and Mabini.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has stopped printing this banknote in 2002 (with its last production year is 2001) and was replaced by a [[Philippine ten peso coin|ten peso coin]].\n\n===20-peso banknote===\nThe 20 peso bill was designed by Angel Cacnio. The obverse side of the 20-peso banknote featured [[Manuel L. Quezon]], first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. Along the right side of the banknote was the coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth, and two of Quezon's notable accomplishments. The first was \"''Wikang Pambans\u00e2''\", which is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"national language\". In 1937, the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|National Language Institute]] was founded to establish a single national language for the Philippines. This eventually became the [[Filipino language]],  which is largely based on Tagalog. The second was the \"''Saligang Batas 1935''\" or the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]]. This was the first real constitution that was nationally effected and large parts of it survive in the current constitution.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored orange.\n\nThe reverse side of the 20-peso banknote depicted [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]], more popularly known as Malaca\u00f1ang, the residence of the [[President of the Philippines]], along the banks of the [[Pasig River]]. Quezon was the first Philippine president to live in the Palace.\n\n===50-peso banknote===\nDepicted on the front side of the fifty-peso was [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], the second president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. He served as president from 1944, after Quezon's death, to 1946, when the United States granted the Philippines' independence.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored red and was designed by Rafael Asuncion.\n\nThe [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] was featured on the reverse side of the banknote. This building used to be the Legislative Building, where the House of Representatives that Osmena presided over as Speaker from 1907 to 1922 was located. The building and then renamed Executive House during the Martial Law period and was labeled as such in the fifty-peso banknote until recently.\n\n===100-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 100-peso banknote featured [[Manuel Roxas]], the first president of the independent Philippine Republic. This independence was shown at the right side where the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] was raised while the flag of the [[United States]] was lowered on July 4, 1946.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored violet and was designed by Angel Cacnio.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote depicted the Manila compound of the ''Bangko Sentral''.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote was the smallest-valued banknote to have the new security features implemented in recent years. But before the advent of the new security features, the 100-peso banknote was interesting for having other security features. On the front side was a barely visible \"100\" logo above the signatures of the president and the Central Bank governor. This logo was best seen on crisp new 100-peso banknotes. On the reverse side, the top row of windows of the main building had the words \"''Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas''\" (\"Central Bank of the Philippines\") running the whole length.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote became the subject of controversy after banknotes printed in France in time for the [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]] were printed with the President's name misspelled, the first in Philippine history.  The banknotes, of which a small amount were still in circulation and were legal tender until 2015, spelled the President's name as \"Gloria Macapagal-'''Arrovo'''\" versus the correct [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. The incident was subsequently the subject of public humor as soon as the issue made national headlines. The BSP probed the mistake and corrected the error afterwards.\n\n===200-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 200-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. It also featured the [[Aguinaldo Shrine]] in [[Kawit, Cavite]].\n\nThe back side of the banknote featured a scene from [[Second EDSA Revolution|EDSA II]], with [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], Macapagal's daughter, being sworn in as [[President of the Philippines|president]] by Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] in January 2001. The little girl holding a [[Bible]] in between Arroyo and Davide is Cecilia Paz Razon Abad, daughter of Philippine Budget and Management Secretary [[Florencio Abad]] and [[Batanes]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Representative]] Henedina Razon-Abad.<ref>[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=63539]</ref>\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored green.  This note was also a commemorative banknote, released in 2002 to commemorate [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]].\n\nThe banknote was the subject of criticism by the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].  They said that the legal tender should only feature deceased national heroes and not an incumbent President.  Although, it wasn't the first time that a legal tender featured a sitting President.  Legal tender coinage was minted to commemorate the inauguration of [[Manuel L. Quezon]] as [[President of the Philippines]] in 1935. Emergency currency during World War II had many instances where provincial emergency currency boards placed the image of then President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. In 1975, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas released a 5-peso coin featuring the face of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].  Former presidents [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]] was also pictured in a limited commemorative 2000-peso banknote that honors the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also a limited commemorative gold 1000-peso banknote with the picture of former President [[Joseph Estrada]] was also issued to honor the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also, every banknote series since 1935 has borne the facsimile signature of the incumbent [[President of the Philippines]].\n\nSome critics including Father [[Robert Reyes]] also pointed out that featuring Gloria Arroyo in the 200-peso note could be an electioneering tactic ahead of the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Philippine elections]].<ref>http://www.newsflash.org/2002/04/be/be002037.htm</ref>\n\n===500-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 500-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] To the right of the banknote, there were two popular quotes from Aquino: \"Faith in our people and faith in God\", and \"The Filipino is worth dying for\", under which was signed his nickname, \"Ninoy\". There was also the signature of Aquino, a typewriter with his initials (\"B.S.A.J.\"), and a dove of peace.  A Philippine flag was also to the right of his portrait, near the central part of the front side.\n\nThe reverse side featured a collage of various images in relation to Aquino.  He was (in front of an article about \"[[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cav]]\", out of some of the pictures) a journalist for the ''[[Manila Times]]'', a senator (the pioneer of the Study Now, Pay Later education program), the mayor in his hometown of [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], the governor of [[Tarlac]], and was the main driving force behind the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986,<ref name=\"EDSA 1986\"/><ref name=\"EDSA 1986-2\"/> some three years after his death in 1983.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored yellow.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that unlike the names of the figures on the bills, \"Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.\" was written in gold-colored, cursive writing with a green laurel wreath as opposed to the name being simply written as with the other banknotes.\n\nBefore this note was printed, the 500-peso banknote designed by Romeo Mananquil was to feature [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and was its reverse was to be the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. The [[People Power Revolution]] caused it to be replaced by the current 500-peso banknote. Remnants of this version of the banknote were only for media purposes.\n\nOn August 16, 2009, a proposal was made by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]  to have former President [[Corazon Aquino|Cory Aquino]] accompany her husband, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] on the banknote. The new design was included in the 500-peso NGC note.\n\n===1,000-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 1,000-peso banknote featured the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], Chief Justice;  [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]], civic worker and one of the founders of the [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]];  and [[Vicente Lim]], a general in the Philippine Army, first Filipino graduate of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]: the three are considered heroes of the resistance against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.  It also featured the [[eternal flame]], [[Bay laurel|laurel leaves]], and bank seal.\n\nThe back of the banknote featured the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]], [[Manunggul Jar]] cover and Langgal.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored blue and was designed by Romeo Mananquil.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included optically variable ink, a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing. The words \"Central Bank of the Philippines\" were microprinted in the lower left border on the face of the note.\n\n==Coins==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n|+ BSP Coin Series (1995-2017)\n! colspan=\"2\"| Image \n! rowspan=\"2\"| Face Value \n! colspan=\"4\"| Technical parameters \n! colspan=\"3\"| Description \n! colspan=\"2\"| Years of Issue\n|- \n!

The reverse of the banknote featured a depiction of the Philippine declaration of independence by Emilio Aguinaldo on June 12, 1898.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.\n\nThe [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] has stopped printing this banknote in 1996 (with its last production year is 1995), and it has been replaced by an [[Philippine five peso coin|equivalent coin]].\n\n===10-peso banknote===\nThe 10-peso banknote designed by Rafael Asuncion was issued months after the 5-peso banknote was issued.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored brown.\n\nThe obverse side of the 10-peso banknote featured [[Apolinario Mabini]] on the left and [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] on the right. Bonifacio was the founder of the [[Katipunan]] (KKK), a secret society established to fight the Spanish colonial government. Mabini was the Philippines' first [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]]. Depicted on the right side was one of the flags of the Katipunan (see [[Flags of the Philippine Revolution]]), the ''Kartilya ng Katipunan'', and a letter written by Mabini.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote featured the [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos, Bulacan]], site of the first Philippine Congress and where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Malolos Constitution]] was drafted. The right portion depicted the initiation rites of the Katipunan. Members accepted into the society had to sign their name on the society's roster using their own blood. The design was previously used on the 5-peso  \"Pilipino\" and \"Ang Bagong Lipunan\" notes.\n\nBefore 1997, the 10-peso banknote only depicted Mabini and the Barasoain Church. In recent years, the banknote has since been replaced with a [[Bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] 10-peso coin also bearing the effigies of Bonifacio and Mabini.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has stopped printing this banknote in 2002 (with its last production year is 2001) and was replaced by a [[Philippine ten peso coin|ten peso coin]].\n\n===20-peso banknote===\nThe 20 peso bill was designed by Angel Cacnio. The obverse side of the 20-peso banknote featured [[Manuel L. Quezon]], first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. Along the right side of the banknote was the coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth, and two of Quezon's notable accomplishments. The first was \"''Wikang Pambans\u00e2''\", which is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"national language\". In 1937, the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|National Language Institute]] was founded to establish a single national language for the Philippines. This eventually became the [[Filipino language]],  which is largely based on Tagalog. The second was the \"''Saligang Batas 1935''\" or the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]]. This was the first real constitution that was nationally effected and large parts of it survive in the current constitution.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored orange.\n\nThe reverse side of the 20-peso banknote depicted [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]], more popularly known as Malaca\u00f1ang, the residence of the [[President of the Philippines]], along the banks of the [[Pasig River]]. Quezon was the first Philippine president to live in the Palace.\n\n===50-peso banknote===\nDepicted on the front side of the fifty-peso was [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], the second president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. He served as president from 1944, after Quezon's death, to 1946, when the United States granted the Philippines' independence.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored red and was designed by Rafael Asuncion.\n\nThe [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] was featured on the reverse side of the banknote. This building used to be the Legislative Building, where the House of Representatives that Osmena presided over as Speaker from 1907 to 1922 was located. The building and then renamed Executive House during the Martial Law period and was labeled as such in the fifty-peso banknote until recently.\n\n===100-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 100-peso banknote featured [[Manuel Roxas]], the first president of the independent Philippine Republic. This independence was shown at the right side where the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] was raised while the flag of the [[United States]] was lowered on July 4, 1946.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored violet and was designed by Angel Cacnio.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote depicted the Manila compound of the ''Bangko Sentral''.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote was the smallest-valued banknote to have the new security features implemented in recent years. But before the advent of the new security features, the 100-peso banknote was interesting for having other security features. On the front side was a barely visible \"100\" logo above the signatures of the president and the Central Bank governor. This logo was best seen on crisp new 100-peso banknotes. On the reverse side, the top row of windows of the main building had the words \"''Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas''\" (\"Central Bank of the Philippines\") running the whole length.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote became the subject of controversy after banknotes printed in France in time for the [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]] were printed with the President's name misspelled, the first in Philippine history.  The banknotes, of which a small amount were still in circulation and were legal tender until 2015, spelled the President's name as \"Gloria Macapagal-'''Arrovo'''\" versus the correct [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. The incident was subsequently the subject of public humor as soon as the issue made national headlines. The BSP probed the mistake and corrected the error afterwards.\n\n===200-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 200-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. It also featured the [[Aguinaldo Shrine]] in [[Kawit, Cavite]].\n\nThe back side of the banknote featured a scene from [[Second EDSA Revolution|EDSA II]], with [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], Macapagal's daughter, being sworn in as [[President of the Philippines|president]] by Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] in January 2001. The little girl holding a [[Bible]] in between Arroyo and Davide is Cecilia Paz Razon Abad, daughter of Philippine Budget and Management Secretary [[Florencio Abad]] and [[Batanes]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Representative]] Henedina Razon-Abad.<ref>[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=63539]</ref>\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored green.  This note was also a commemorative banknote, released in 2002 to commemorate [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]].\n\nThe banknote was the subject of criticism by the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].  They said that the legal tender should only feature deceased national heroes and not an incumbent President.  Although, it wasn't the first time that a legal tender featured a sitting President.  Legal tender coinage was minted to commemorate the inauguration of [[Manuel L. Quezon]] as [[President of the Philippines]] in 1935. Emergency currency during World War II had many instances where provincial emergency currency boards placed the image of then President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. In 1975, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas released a 5-peso coin featuring the face of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].  Former presidents [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]] was also pictured in a limited commemorative 2000-peso banknote that honors the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also a limited commemorative gold 1000-peso banknote with the picture of former President [[Joseph Estrada]] was also issued to honor the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also, every banknote series since 1935 has borne the facsimile signature of the incumbent [[President of the Philippines]].\n\nSome critics including Father [[Robert Reyes]] also pointed out that featuring Gloria Arroyo in the 200-peso note could be an electioneering tactic ahead of the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Philippine elections]].<ref>http://www.newsflash.org/2002/04/be/be002037.htm</ref>\n\n===500-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 500-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] To the right of the banknote, there were two popular quotes from Aquino: \"Faith in our people and faith in God\", and \"The Filipino is worth dying for\", under which was signed his nickname, \"Ninoy\". There was also the signature of Aquino, a typewriter with his initials (\"B.S.A.J.\"), and a dove of peace.  A Philippine flag was also to the right of his portrait, near the central part of the front side.\n\nThe reverse side featured a collage of various images in relation to Aquino.  He was (in front of an article about \"[[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cav]]\", out of some of the pictures) a journalist for the ''[[Manila Times]]'', a senator (the pioneer of the Study Now, Pay Later education program), the mayor in his hometown of [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], the governor of [[Tarlac]], and was the main driving force behind the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986,<ref name=\"EDSA 1986\"/><ref name=\"EDSA 1986-2\"/> some three years after his death in 1983.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored yellow.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that unlike the names of the figures on the bills, \"Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.\" was written in gold-colored, cursive writing with a green laurel wreath as opposed to the name being simply written as with the other banknotes.\n\nBefore this note was printed, the 500-peso banknote designed by Romeo Mananquil was to feature [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and was its reverse was to be the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. The [[People Power Revolution]] caused it to be replaced by the current 500-peso banknote. Remnants of this version of the banknote were only for media purposes.\n\nOn August 16, 2009, a proposal was made by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]  to have former President [[Corazon Aquino|Cory Aquino]] accompany her husband, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] on the banknote. The new design was included in the 500-peso NGC note.\n\n===1,000-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 1,000-peso banknote featured the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], Chief Justice;  [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]], civic worker and one of the founders of the [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]];  and [[Vicente Lim]], a general in the Philippine Army, first Filipino graduate of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]: the three are considered heroes of the resistance against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.  It also featured the [[eternal flame]], [[Bay laurel|laurel leaves]], and bank seal.\n\nThe back of the banknote featured the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]], [[Manunggul Jar]] cover and Langgal.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored blue and was designed by Romeo Mananquil.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included optically variable ink, a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing. The words \"Central Bank of the Philippines\" were microprinted in the lower left border on the face of the note.\n\n==Coins==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n|+ BSP Coin Series (1995-2017)\n! colspan=\"2\"| Image \n! rowspan=\"2\"| Face Value \n! colspan=\"4\"| Technical parameters \n! colspan=\"3\"| Description \n! colspan=\"2\"| Years of Issue\n|- \n!

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine gave the album three and a half stars, saying \"The [[ukulele]] doesn't allow for the widest range of expression, which makes it a challenging foil for Eddie Vedder, who never met a feeling he couldn't drive through a wall.

Widely considered as innovators and pioneers of [[electronic music]], they were among the first successful acts to popularize the genre.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=mn0000104714|tab=biography|label=Artist Biography by Jason Ankeny|first=Jason|last=Ankeny|accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref> The group began as part of West Germany's experimental [[krautrock]] scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including [[synthesizer]]s, [[drum machine]]s, and [[vocoder]]s. \n\nOn commercially successful albums such as ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' (1974), ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' (1978), Kraftwerk developed a self-described \"robot pop\" style<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> that combined electronic music with [[pop music|pop]] melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylized image including matching suits. Following the release of ''[[Electric Caf\u00e9]]'' (1986), member [[Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr]] left the group in 1987; the band's other longtime percussionist, [[Karl Bartos]], did the same in 1990.  Founding member Schneider departed in 2008. \n\nThe band's work has influenced a diverse range of artists and many genres of modern music, including [[synthpop]], [[hip hop]], [[post-punk]], [[techno]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[club music]]. In 2014, [[the Recording Academy]] honoured Kraftwerk with a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref>Grammy Academy.

While visiting an exhibition in their hometown about visual artists [[Gilbert and George]], they saw \"two men wearing suits and ties, claiming to bring art into everyday life. The same year, H\u00fctter and Schneider started bringing everyday life into art and form Kraftwerk\".<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite news |first=Jude |last=Rogers |authorlink=Jude Rogers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/27/kraftwerk-most-influential-electronic-band-tate |title=Why Kraftwerk are still the world's most influential band |newspaper=The Observer |date=27 January 2013 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nEarly Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970 to 1974 fluctuated, as H\u00fctter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians during the preparations for and the recording of three albums and sporadic live appearances, most notably guitarist [[Michael Rother]] and drummer [[Klaus Dinger]], who left to form [[Neu!]]<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} The only constant figure in these line-ups was Schneider, whose main instrument at the time was the flute; at times he also played the violin and guitar, all processed through a varied array of electronic devices. H\u00fctter, who left the band for eight months to focus on completing his university studies, played synthesizer and keyboards (including Farfisa organ and electric piano).{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe band released two free-form experimental rock albums, ''[[Kraftwerk (album)|Kraftwerk]]'' (1970) and ''[[Kraftwerk 2]]''. The albums were mostly exploratory musical improvisations played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, organ, flute, and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Both albums are purely instrumental. Live performances from 1972 to 1973 were made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic [[drum machine]], with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} Later in 1973, [[Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr]] joined the group for rehearsals, and the unit performed as a trio on the television show ''Aspekte'' for German television network [[ZDF]].<ref name=\"iwasarobot\">{{cite book |last=Fl\u00fcr |first=Wolfgang |authorlink=Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr |title=\"Kraftwerk\": I Was A Robot |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=1993 |isbn=978-1-86074-417-4}}</ref>\n\nWith ''[[Ralf und Florian]]'', released in 1973, Kraftwerk began to rely more heavily on synthesizers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the [[vocoder]], which would in time become one of its musical signatures. According to English music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]], Kraftwerk were influenced by what he called the \"adrenalized insurgency\" of Detroit artists of the late '60s [[MC5]] and [[the Stooges]].<ref name=\"Reynolds\">{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Reynolds |authorlink=Simon Reynolds |title=Generation Ecstasy: into the world of techno and rave culture |publisher=Routledge |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nThe input, expertise, and influence of producer and engineer [[Conny Plank|Konrad \"Conny\" Plank]] was highly significant in the early years of Kraftwerk. Plank also worked with many of the other leading German electronic acts of that time, including members of [[Can (band)|Can]], Neu!, [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], and [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]]. As a result of his work with Kraftwerk, Plank's studio near [[Cologne]] became one of the most sought-after studios in the late 1970s. Plank coproduced the first four Kraftwerk albums.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\n=== International breakthrough: ''Autobahn'' and ''Radioactivity'' (1974\u201376) ===\n[[File:Kraftwerk by Ueli Frey (1976).jpg|left|270px|thumb|Concert in [[Z\u00fcrich]], 1976]]\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = Kraftwerk - Autobahn (excerpt).ogg\n| title=\"Autobahn\"\n| description = An excerpt from Autobahn's closing section.\n| pos         = right\n}}\n\nThe release of ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' in 1974 saw Kraftwerk moving away from the sound of its first three albums. H\u00fctter and Schneider had invested in newer technology such as the [[Minimoog]] and the [[EMS Synthi AKS]], helping give Kraftwerk a newer, \"disciplined\" sound. ''Autobahn'' would also be the last album that [[Conny Plank]] would engineer. After the commercial success of ''Autobahn'' in the US, where it peaked at number 5 in the [[Billboard 200|Billboard Top LPs & Tapes]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kraftwerk-p4706/charts-awards/billboard-albums |title=allmusic ((( Kraftwerk > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums ))) |website=AllMusic |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref> H\u00fctter and Schneider invested in updating their studio, thus lessening their reliance on outside producers. At this time the painter and graphic artist [[Emil Schult]] became a regular collaborator, designing artwork, cowriting lyrics, and accompanying the group on tour.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe year 1975 saw a turning point in Kraftwerk's live shows. With financial support from [[Phonogram Inc.]], in the US, they were able to undertake a multi-date tour to promote the ''Autobahn'' album, a tour which took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time. The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up in the form of a quartet. H\u00fctter and Schneider continued playing keyboard synthesizers such as the [[Minimoog]] and [[ARP Odyssey]], with Schneider's use of flute diminishing. The pair also started singing live for the first time, and  Schneider processing his voice with a vocoder live. Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr and new recruit [[Karl Bartos]] performed on home-made electronic percussion instruments. Bartos also used a Deagan [[vibraphone]] on stage. The H\u00fctter-Schneider-Bartos-Fl\u00fcr formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk. Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nAfter the 1975 ''Autobahn'' tour, Kraftwerk began work on a follow-up album, ''[[Radio-Activity]]'' (German title: ''Radio-Aktivit\u00e4t''). After further investment in new equipment, the [[Kling Klang Studio]] became a fully working recording studio. The group used the central theme in radio communication, which had become enhanced on their last tour of the United States. With Emil Schult working on artwork and lyrics, Kraftwerk began to compose music for the new record. Even though ''Radio-Activity'' was less commercially successful than ''Autobahn'' in the UK and United States, the album served to open up the European market for Kraftwerk, earning them a [[gold disc]] in France. Kraftwerk made videos and performed several European live dates to promote the album. With the release of ''Autobahn'' and ''Radio-Activity'', Kraftwerk left behind avant-garde experimentation and moved towards the electronic pop tunes for which they are best known.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1976, Kraftwerk toured in support of the ''Radio-Activity'' album. [[David Bowie]] was among the fans of the record and invited the band to support him on his ''[[Station to Station]]'' tour, an offer the group declined.<ref>[[Richard Witts|Witts, Richard]]. \"Vorsprung durch Technik ? Kraftwerk and the British Fixation with Germany\". reproduced in \"Kraftwerk: Music Non-Stop\".  Continuum Books 2012</ref> Despite some innovations in touring, Kraftwerk took a break from live performances after the ''Radio-Activity'' tour of 1976.\n\n=== ''Trans-Europe Express'', ''The Man-Machine'' and ''Computer World'' (1977\u20131982) ===\nAfter having finished the Radio-Activity tour Kraftwerk began recording ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' (German: ''Trans-Europa Express'') at the Kling Klang Studio.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} ''Trans-Europe Express'' was mixed at the [[Record Plant Studios]] in Los Angeles. It was around this time that H\u00fctter and Schneider met David Bowie at the Kling Klang Studio. A collaboration was mentioned in an interview ([[Brian Eno]]) with H\u00fctter, but it never materialised. The release of ''Trans-Europe Express''  in March 1977<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} was marked with an extravagant train journey used as a press conference by EMI France.  The album won a disco award in New York later that year.\n\nIn May 1978 Kraftwerk released ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' (German: ''Die Mensch-Maschine''), recorded at the Kling Klang Studio. Due to the complexity of the recording, the album was mixed at Studio Rudas in D\u00fcsseldorf. The band hired sound engineer Leanard Jackson from Detroit to work with Joschko Rudas on the final mix. ''The Man-Machine'' was the first Kraftwerk album where [[Karl Bartos]] was cocredited as a songwriter. The cover, produced in black, white and red, was inspired by Russian artist [[El Lissitzky]] and the [[Suprematism]] movement. Gunther Frohling photographed the group for the cover, a now-iconic image which featured the quartet dressed in red shirts and black ties. After it was released Kraftwerk did not released another album for three years.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn May 1981 Kraftwerk released ''[[Computer World]]'' (German: ''Computerwelt'') on EMI records.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} It was recorded at Kling Klang Studio between 1978 and 1981.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} Much of this time was spent modifying the studio to make it portable so the band could take it on tour.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} Some of the electronic vocals on ''Computer World'' were generated using a [[Texas Instruments]] language translator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.datamath.org/Speech/LanguageTranslator.htm |title=Datamath |publisher=Datamath |date=5 December 2001 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> \"[[Computer Love (Kraftwerk song)|Computer Love]]\" was released as a single backed with the ''Man-Machine'' track \"[[Das Model|The Model]]\".<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}  Radio DJs were more interested in the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] so the single was repackaged by EMI and re-released with \"The Model\" as the A-side. The single reached number one in the UK, making \"The Model\" Kraftwerk's most successful song in that country.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} As a result, the ''Man-Machine'' album also became a success in the UK, peaking at number 9 in the [[UK albums chart|album chart]] in February 1982.<ref name=\"uk chart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/kraftwerk/#albums |title=Kraftwerk albums Chart |website=Officialcharts.com |accessdate=8 August 2013}}</ref> The band's live set focused increasingly on song-based material, with greater use of vocals and the use of sequencing equipment for both percussion and music. In contrast to their cool and controlled image, the group used sequencers interactively, which allowed for live improvisation. Ironically Kraftwerk did not own a computer at the time of recording ''Computer World''.\n\nKraftwerk returned to live performance with the ''Computer World'' tour of 1981, where the band effectively packed up its entire Kling Klang studio and took it along on the road. They also made greater use of live visuals including back-projected slides and films synchronized with the music as the technology developed, the use of hand-held miniaturized instruments during the set (for example, during \"Pocket Calculator\"), and, perhaps most famously, the use of replica [[mannequin]]s of themselves to perform on stage during the song \"The Robots\".\n\n=== ''Tour de France'' and ''Electric Caf\u00e9'' (1982\u20131989) ===\nIn 1982 Kraftwerk began to work on a new album that initially had the working title ''[[Technicolor]]'' but due to trademark issues was changed to ''[[Techno Pop]]''. One of the songs from these recording sessions was \"[[Tour de France (song)|Tour de France]]\", which [[EMI]] released as a single in 1983. This song was a reflection of the band's new-found obsession for cycling. After the physically demanding ''Computer World'' tour, Ralf H\u00fctter had been looking for forms of exercise that fitted in with the image of Kraftwerk; subsequently he encouraged the group to become vegetarians and take up cycling. \"Tour de France\" included sounds that followed this theme including bicycle chains, gear mechanisms and the breathing of the cyclist. At the time of the single's release Ralf H\u00fctter tried to persuade the rest of the band that they should record a whole album based on cycling. The other members of the band were not convinced, and the theme was left to the single alone.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} \"Tour de France\" was released in German and French. The vocals of the song were recorded on the Kling Klang Studio stairs to create the right atmosphere.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} \"Tour de France\" was featured in the 1984 film ''[[Breakin']]'', showing the influence that Kraftwerk had on black American dance music.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn May or June 1982,<ref>[[Karl Bartos]] 2017, ''Der Klang der Maschine'', ch. 12</ref>, during the recording of \"Tour de France\", Ralf H\u00fctter was involved in a serious cycling accident.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} He suffered head injuries and remained in a coma for several days. During 1983 Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr was beginning to spend less time in the studio. Since the band began using sequencers his role as a drummer was becoming less frequent. He preferred to spend his time travelling with his girlfriend. Fl\u00fcr was also experiencing artistic difficulties with the band. Though he toured the world with Kraftwerk as a drummer in 1981, his playing does not appear on that year's ''Computer World'' or on the 1986 album ''Electric Caf\u00e9''. In 1987 he left the band and was replaced by [[Fritz Hilpert]].\n\n=== ''The Mix'' (1990\u20131999) ===\nAfter years of withdrawal from live performance Kraftwerk began to tour Europe more frequently. In February 1990 the band played a few secret shows in Italy. Karl Bartos left the band shortly afterwards. The next proper tour was in 1991, for the album ''[[The Mix (Kraftwerk album)|The Mix]]''. H\u00fctter and Schneider wished to continue the synth-pop quartet style of presentation, and recruited [[Fernando Abrantes]] as a replacement for Bartos. Abrantes left the band shortly after though. In late 1991, long-time Kling Klang Studio sound engineer Henning Schmitz was brought in to finish the remainder of the tour and to complete a new version of the quartet that remained active until 2008.\n\nIn 1997 Kraftwerk made a famous appearance at the dance festival [[Tribal Gathering]] held in England.<ref>[http://www.physicsroom.org.nz/2cents/kraftwerk.htm 2 Cents: Kraftwerk, Tribal Gathering] (25 May 1997).</ref> In 1998, the group toured the US and Japan for the first time since 1981, along with shows in [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. Three new songs were performed during this period, which remain unreleased. Following this trek, the group decided to take another break.<ref>[http://www.kraftworld.com.br/concerts/1998Tour.htm \"Kraftworld, Kraftwerk 1998\" Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324235555/http://kraftworld.com.br/concerts/1998Tour.htm |date=24 March 2009 }}. ''kraftworld.com''. Retrieved 5 March 2009</ref>\n\nIn July 1999 the single \"Tour de France\" was reissued in Europe by EMI after it had been [[out of print]] for several years. It was released for the first time on CD in addition to a repressing of the 12-inch vinyl single. Both versions feature slightly altered artwork that removed the faces of Fl\u00fcr and Bartos from the four-man cycling paceline depicted on the original cover. In 1999 ex-member Fl\u00fcr published his autobiography in Germany, ''Ich war ein Roboter''. Later English-language editions of the book were titled ''Kraftwerk: I Was a Robot''.\n\nThe single \"[[Expo 2000 (song)|Expo 2000]]\" was released in December 1999. The track was remixed and re-released as \"Expo Remix\" in November 2000.\n\n=== Touring the world (2000\u20132009) ===\n[[File:Kraftwerk live in Stockholm.jpg|thumb|In [[Stockholm]], February 2004]]\nIn August 2003 the band released ''[[Tour de France Soundtracks]]'', its first album of new material since 1986's ''Electric Caf\u00e9''. In January and February 2003, before the release of the album, the band started the extensive ''Minimum-Maximum'' world tour, using four customised [[Sony]] [[VAIO]] laptop computers, effectively leaving the entire Kling Klang studio at home in Germany. The group also obtained a new set of transparent video panels to replace its four large projection screens. This greatly streamlined the running of all of the group's sequencing, sound-generating, and visual-display software. From this point, the band's equipment increasingly reduced manual playing, replacing it with interactive control of sequencing equipment. H\u00fctter retained the most manual performance, still playing musical lines by hand on a controller keyboard and singing live vocals and having a repeating [[ostinato]]. Schneider's live vocoding had been replaced by software-controlled speech-synthesis techniques. In November, the group made a surprising appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, performing \"Aerodynamik\". The same year a promotional box set entitled ''12345678'' (subtitled ''The Catalogue'') was issued, with plans for a proper commercial release to follow.  The box featured [[Audio mastering|remastered]] editions of the group's eight core studio albums, from ''Autobahn'' to ''Tour de France Soundtracks''. This long-awaited box-set would eventually be released in a different set of remasters in November 2009.\n\nIn June 2005 the band's first-ever official live album, ''[[Minimum-Maximum]]'', which was compiled from the shows during the band's tour of spring 2004, received extremely positive reviews.<ref name=\"taylor\">Tony Naylor. [http://www.nme.com/reviews/kraftwerk/7663 \"Kraftwerk: Minimum-Maximum Live\"]. ''[[NME]]'', 2 June 2005. Retrieved 8 August 2013</ref> The album contained reworked tracks from existing studio albums. This included a track titled \"Planet of Visions\" that was a reworking of \"Expo 2000\". In support of this release, Kraftwerk made another quick sweep around the Balkans with dates in [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Turkey]], and Greece. In December, the [[Minimum-Maximum (video)|''Minimum-Maximum'' DVD]] was released. During 2006, the band performed at festivals in Norway, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Spain, Belgium, and Germany.\n\nIn April 2008 the group played three shows in US cities [[Minneapolis]], [[Milwaukee]], and [[Denver]], and were a coheadliner at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. This was their second appearance at the festival since 2004. Further shows were performed in Ireland, Poland, [[Ukraine]], Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore later that year. The touring quartet consisted of Ralf H\u00fctter, Henning Schmitz, [[Fritz Hilpert]], and video technician Stefan Pfaffe, who became an official member in 2008. Original member Florian Schneider was absent from the lineup. H\u00fctter stated that he was working on other projects.<ref>{{cite news |first=Graham |last=Reid |title=Interview: Ralf Hutter of Kraftwerk |date=27 September 2008 |work=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10534357&pnum=0 |accessdate=27 September 2008}}</ref> On 21 November, Kraftwerk officially confirmed Florian Schneider's departure from the band.<ref>{{cite news |author=Music |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/4144592/Kraftwerks-co-founder-Florian-Schneider-leaves-band.html |title=Kraftwerk's co-founder Florian Schneider leaves band |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' commented on that incident: \"There is something brilliantly Kraftwerkian about the news that Florian Schneider, a founder member of the German electronic pioneers, is leaving the band to pursue a solo career.

Live performance has always played an important part in Kraftwerk's activities. Also, despite its live shows generally being based around formal songs and compositions, live [[improvisation]] often plays a noticeable role in its performances. This trait can be traced back to the group's roots in the first experimental Krautrock scene of the late 1960s, but, significantly, it has continued to be a part of its playing even as it makes ever greater use of digital and computer-controlled sequencing in its performances. Some of the band's familiar compositions have been observed to have developed from live improvisations at its concerts or sound-checks.<ref>{{citation |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/preview+behind+kraftwerk+machines/11360476/story.html |title=The man behind Kraftwerk's machines |author=Sperounes, Sandra |work=Edmon Journal |date=14 September 2015 |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Technological innovations ===\nThroughout their career, Kraftwerk have pushed the limits of [[music technology]] with some notable innovations, such as home-made instruments and custom-built devices.

Widely considered as innovators and pioneers of [[electronic music]], they were among the first successful acts to popularize the genre.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=mn0000104714|tab=biography|label=Artist Biography by Jason Ankeny|first=Jason|last=Ankeny|accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref> The group began as part of West Germany's experimental [[krautrock]] scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including [[synthesizer]]s, [[drum machine]]s, and [[vocoder]]s. \n\nOn commercially successful albums such as ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' (1974), ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' (1978), Kraftwerk developed a self-described \"robot pop\" style<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> that combined electronic music with [[pop music|pop]] melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylized image including matching suits. Following the release of ''[[Electric Caf\u00e9]]'' (1986), member [[Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr]] left the group in 1987; the band's other longtime percussionist, [[Karl Bartos]], did the same in 1990.  Founding member Schneider departed in 2008. \n\nThe band's work has influenced a diverse range of artists and many genres of modern music, including [[synthpop]], [[hip hop]], [[post-punk]], [[techno]], [[ambient music|ambient]], and [[club music]]. In 2014, [[the Recording Academy]] honoured Kraftwerk with a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref>Grammy Academy.

While visiting an exhibition in their hometown about visual artists [[Gilbert and George]], they saw \"two men wearing suits and ties, claiming to bring art into everyday life. The same year, H\u00fctter and Schneider started bringing everyday life into art and form Kraftwerk\".<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite news |first=Jude |last=Rogers |authorlink=Jude Rogers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/27/kraftwerk-most-influential-electronic-band-tate |title=Why Kraftwerk are still the world's most influential band |newspaper=The Observer |date=27 January 2013 |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nEarly Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970 to 1974 fluctuated, as H\u00fctter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians during the preparations for and the recording of three albums and sporadic live appearances, most notably guitarist [[Michael Rother]] and drummer [[Klaus Dinger]], who left to form [[Neu!]]<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} The only constant figure in these line-ups was Schneider, whose main instrument at the time was the flute; at times he also played the violin and guitar, all processed through a varied array of electronic devices. H\u00fctter, who left the band for eight months to focus on completing his university studies, played synthesizer and keyboards (including Farfisa organ and electric piano).{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe band released two free-form experimental rock albums, ''[[Kraftwerk (album)|Kraftwerk]]'' (1970) and ''[[Kraftwerk 2]]''. The albums were mostly exploratory musical improvisations played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, organ, flute, and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Both albums are purely instrumental. Live performances from 1972 to 1973 were made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic [[drum machine]], with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} Later in 1973, [[Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr]] joined the group for rehearsals, and the unit performed as a trio on the television show ''Aspekte'' for German television network [[ZDF]].<ref name=\"iwasarobot\">{{cite book |last=Fl\u00fcr |first=Wolfgang |authorlink=Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr |title=\"Kraftwerk\": I Was A Robot |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=1993 |isbn=978-1-86074-417-4}}</ref>\n\nWith ''[[Ralf und Florian]]'', released in 1973, Kraftwerk began to rely more heavily on synthesizers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the [[vocoder]], which would in time become one of its musical signatures. According to English music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]], Kraftwerk were influenced by what he called the \"adrenalized insurgency\" of Detroit artists of the late '60s [[MC5]] and [[the Stooges]].<ref name=\"Reynolds\">{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Reynolds |authorlink=Simon Reynolds |title=Generation Ecstasy: into the world of techno and rave culture |publisher=Routledge |year=1999}}</ref>\n\nThe input, expertise, and influence of producer and engineer [[Conny Plank|Konrad \"Conny\" Plank]] was highly significant in the early years of Kraftwerk. Plank also worked with many of the other leading German electronic acts of that time, including members of [[Can (band)|Can]], Neu!, [[Cluster (band)|Cluster]], and [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia]]. As a result of his work with Kraftwerk, Plank's studio near [[Cologne]] became one of the most sought-after studios in the late 1970s. Plank coproduced the first four Kraftwerk albums.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\n=== International breakthrough: ''Autobahn'' and ''Radioactivity'' (1974\u201376) ===\n[[File:Kraftwerk by Ueli Frey (1976).jpg|left|270px|thumb|Concert in [[Z\u00fcrich]], 1976]]\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = Kraftwerk - Autobahn (excerpt).ogg\n| title=\"Autobahn\"\n| description = An excerpt from Autobahn's closing section.\n| pos         = right\n}}\n\nThe release of ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' in 1974 saw Kraftwerk moving away from the sound of its first three albums. H\u00fctter and Schneider had invested in newer technology such as the [[Minimoog]] and the [[EMS Synthi AKS]], helping give Kraftwerk a newer, \"disciplined\" sound. ''Autobahn'' would also be the last album that [[Conny Plank]] would engineer. After the commercial success of ''Autobahn'' in the US, where it peaked at number 5 in the [[Billboard 200|Billboard Top LPs & Tapes]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kraftwerk-p4706/charts-awards/billboard-albums |title=allmusic ((( Kraftwerk > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums ))) |website=AllMusic |accessdate=9 July 2009}}</ref> H\u00fctter and Schneider invested in updating their studio, thus lessening their reliance on outside producers. At this time the painter and graphic artist [[Emil Schult]] became a regular collaborator, designing artwork, cowriting lyrics, and accompanying the group on tour.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe year 1975 saw a turning point in Kraftwerk's live shows. With financial support from [[Phonogram Inc.]], in the US, they were able to undertake a multi-date tour to promote the ''Autobahn'' album, a tour which took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time. The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up in the form of a quartet. H\u00fctter and Schneider continued playing keyboard synthesizers such as the [[Minimoog]] and [[ARP Odyssey]], with Schneider's use of flute diminishing. The pair also started singing live for the first time, and  Schneider processing his voice with a vocoder live. Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr and new recruit [[Karl Bartos]] performed on home-made electronic percussion instruments. Bartos also used a Deagan [[vibraphone]] on stage. The H\u00fctter-Schneider-Bartos-Fl\u00fcr formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk. Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nAfter the 1975 ''Autobahn'' tour, Kraftwerk began work on a follow-up album, ''[[Radio-Activity]]'' (German title: ''Radio-Aktivit\u00e4t''). After further investment in new equipment, the [[Kling Klang Studio]] became a fully working recording studio. The group used the central theme in radio communication, which had become enhanced on their last tour of the United States. With Emil Schult working on artwork and lyrics, Kraftwerk began to compose music for the new record. Even though ''Radio-Activity'' was less commercially successful than ''Autobahn'' in the UK and United States, the album served to open up the European market for Kraftwerk, earning them a [[gold disc]] in France. Kraftwerk made videos and performed several European live dates to promote the album. With the release of ''Autobahn'' and ''Radio-Activity'', Kraftwerk left behind avant-garde experimentation and moved towards the electronic pop tunes for which they are best known.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1976, Kraftwerk toured in support of the ''Radio-Activity'' album. [[David Bowie]] was among the fans of the record and invited the band to support him on his ''[[Station to Station]]'' tour, an offer the group declined.<ref>[[Richard Witts|Witts, Richard]]. \"Vorsprung durch Technik ? Kraftwerk and the British Fixation with Germany\". reproduced in \"Kraftwerk: Music Non-Stop\".  Continuum Books 2012</ref> Despite some innovations in touring, Kraftwerk took a break from live performances after the ''Radio-Activity'' tour of 1976.\n\n=== ''Trans-Europe Express'', ''The Man-Machine'' and ''Computer World'' (1977\u20131982) ===\nAfter having finished the Radio-Activity tour Kraftwerk began recording ''[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]'' (German: ''Trans-Europa Express'') at the Kling Klang Studio.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} ''Trans-Europe Express'' was mixed at the [[Record Plant Studios]] in Los Angeles. It was around this time that H\u00fctter and Schneider met David Bowie at the Kling Klang Studio. A collaboration was mentioned in an interview ([[Brian Eno]]) with H\u00fctter, but it never materialised. The release of ''Trans-Europe Express''  in March 1977<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} was marked with an extravagant train journey used as a press conference by EMI France.  The album won a disco award in New York later that year.\n\nIn May 1978 Kraftwerk released ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' (German: ''Die Mensch-Maschine''), recorded at the Kling Klang Studio. Due to the complexity of the recording, the album was mixed at Studio Rudas in D\u00fcsseldorf. The band hired sound engineer Leanard Jackson from Detroit to work with Joschko Rudas on the final mix. ''The Man-Machine'' was the first Kraftwerk album where [[Karl Bartos]] was cocredited as a songwriter. The cover, produced in black, white and red, was inspired by Russian artist [[El Lissitzky]] and the [[Suprematism]] movement. Gunther Frohling photographed the group for the cover, a now-iconic image which featured the quartet dressed in red shirts and black ties. After it was released Kraftwerk did not released another album for three years.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn May 1981 Kraftwerk released ''[[Computer World]]'' (German: ''Computerwelt'') on EMI records.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} It was recorded at Kling Klang Studio between 1978 and 1981.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} Much of this time was spent modifying the studio to make it portable so the band could take it on tour.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} Some of the electronic vocals on ''Computer World'' were generated using a [[Texas Instruments]] language translator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.datamath.org/Speech/LanguageTranslator.htm |title=Datamath |publisher=Datamath |date=5 December 2001 |accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref> \"[[Computer Love (Kraftwerk song)|Computer Love]]\" was released as a single backed with the ''Man-Machine'' track \"[[Das Model|The Model]]\".<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}  Radio DJs were more interested in the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] so the single was repackaged by EMI and re-released with \"The Model\" as the A-side. The single reached number one in the UK, making \"The Model\" Kraftwerk's most successful song in that country.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} As a result, the ''Man-Machine'' album also became a success in the UK, peaking at number 9 in the [[UK albums chart|album chart]] in February 1982.<ref name=\"uk chart\">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/kraftwerk/#albums |title=Kraftwerk albums Chart |website=Officialcharts.com |accessdate=8 August 2013}}</ref> The band's live set focused increasingly on song-based material, with greater use of vocals and the use of sequencing equipment for both percussion and music. In contrast to their cool and controlled image, the group used sequencers interactively, which allowed for live improvisation. Ironically Kraftwerk did not own a computer at the time of recording ''Computer World''.\n\nKraftwerk returned to live performance with the ''Computer World'' tour of 1981, where the band effectively packed up its entire Kling Klang studio and took it along on the road. They also made greater use of live visuals including back-projected slides and films synchronized with the music as the technology developed, the use of hand-held miniaturized instruments during the set (for example, during \"Pocket Calculator\"), and, perhaps most famously, the use of replica [[mannequin]]s of themselves to perform on stage during the song \"The Robots\".\n\n=== ''Tour de France'' and ''Electric Caf\u00e9'' (1982\u20131989) ===\nIn 1982 Kraftwerk began to work on a new album that initially had the working title ''[[Technicolor]]'' but due to trademark issues was changed to ''[[Techno Pop]]''. One of the songs from these recording sessions was \"[[Tour de France (song)|Tour de France]]\", which [[EMI]] released as a single in 1983. This song was a reflection of the band's new-found obsession for cycling. After the physically demanding ''Computer World'' tour, Ralf H\u00fctter had been looking for forms of exercise that fitted in with the image of Kraftwerk; subsequently he encouraged the group to become vegetarians and take up cycling. \"Tour de France\" included sounds that followed this theme including bicycle chains, gear mechanisms and the breathing of the cyclist. At the time of the single's release Ralf H\u00fctter tried to persuade the rest of the band that they should record a whole album based on cycling. The other members of the band were not convinced, and the theme was left to the single alone.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} \"Tour de France\" was released in German and French. The vocals of the song were recorded on the Kling Klang Studio stairs to create the right atmosphere.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} \"Tour de France\" was featured in the 1984 film ''[[Breakin']]'', showing the influence that Kraftwerk had on black American dance music.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn May or June 1982,<ref>[[Karl Bartos]] 2017, ''Der Klang der Maschine'', ch. 12</ref>, during the recording of \"Tour de France\", Ralf H\u00fctter was involved in a serious cycling accident.<ref name=\"Bussy\" />{{pn|date=April 2019}} He suffered head injuries and remained in a coma for several days. During 1983 Wolfgang Fl\u00fcr was beginning to spend less time in the studio. Since the band began using sequencers his role as a drummer was becoming less frequent. He preferred to spend his time travelling with his girlfriend. Fl\u00fcr was also experiencing artistic difficulties with the band. Though he toured the world with Kraftwerk as a drummer in 1981, his playing does not appear on that year's ''Computer World'' or on the 1986 album ''Electric Caf\u00e9''. In 1987 he left the band and was replaced by [[Fritz Hilpert]].\n\n=== ''The Mix'' (1990\u20131999) ===\nAfter years of withdrawal from live performance Kraftwerk began to tour Europe more frequently. In February 1990 the band played a few secret shows in Italy. Karl Bartos left the band shortly afterwards. The next proper tour was in 1991, for the album ''[[The Mix (Kraftwerk album)|The Mix]]''. H\u00fctter and Schneider wished to continue the synth-pop quartet style of presentation, and recruited [[Fernando Abrantes]] as a replacement for Bartos. Abrantes left the band shortly after though. In late 1991, long-time Kling Klang Studio sound engineer Henning Schmitz was brought in to finish the remainder of the tour and to complete a new version of the quartet that remained active until 2008.\n\nIn 1997 Kraftwerk made a famous appearance at the dance festival [[Tribal Gathering]] held in England.<ref>[http://www.physicsroom.org.nz/2cents/kraftwerk.htm 2 Cents: Kraftwerk, Tribal Gathering] (25 May 1997).</ref> In 1998, the group toured the US and Japan for the first time since 1981, along with shows in [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]. Three new songs were performed during this period, which remain unreleased. Following this trek, the group decided to take another break.<ref>[http://www.kraftworld.com.br/concerts/1998Tour.htm \"Kraftworld, Kraftwerk 1998\" Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324235555/http://kraftworld.com.br/concerts/1998Tour.htm |date=24 March 2009 }}. ''kraftworld.com''. Retrieved 5 March 2009</ref>\n\nIn July 1999 the single \"Tour de France\" was reissued in Europe by EMI after it had been [[out of print]] for several years. It was released for the first time on CD in addition to a repressing of the 12-inch vinyl single. Both versions feature slightly altered artwork that removed the faces of Fl\u00fcr and Bartos from the four-man cycling paceline depicted on the original cover. In 1999 ex-member Fl\u00fcr published his autobiography in Germany, ''Ich war ein Roboter''. Later English-language editions of the book were titled ''Kraftwerk: I Was a Robot''.\n\nThe single \"[[Expo 2000 (song)|Expo 2000]]\" was released in December 1999. The track was remixed and re-released as \"Expo Remix\" in November 2000.\n\n=== Touring the world (2000\u20132009) ===\n[[File:Kraftwerk live in Stockholm.jpg|thumb|In [[Stockholm]], February 2004]]\nIn August 2003 the band released ''[[Tour de France Soundtracks]]'', its first album of new material since 1986's ''Electric Caf\u00e9''. In January and February 2003, before the release of the album, the band started the extensive ''Minimum-Maximum'' world tour, using four customised [[Sony]] [[VAIO]] laptop computers, effectively leaving the entire Kling Klang studio at home in Germany. The group also obtained a new set of transparent video panels to replace its four large projection screens. This greatly streamlined the running of all of the group's sequencing, sound-generating, and visual-display software. From this point, the band's equipment increasingly reduced manual playing, replacing it with interactive control of sequencing equipment. H\u00fctter retained the most manual performance, still playing musical lines by hand on a controller keyboard and singing live vocals and having a repeating [[ostinato]]. Schneider's live vocoding had been replaced by software-controlled speech-synthesis techniques. In November, the group made a surprising appearance at the MTV European Music Awards in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, performing \"Aerodynamik\". The same year a promotional box set entitled ''12345678'' (subtitled ''The Catalogue'') was issued, with plans for a proper commercial release to follow.  The box featured [[Audio mastering|remastered]] editions of the group's eight core studio albums, from ''Autobahn'' to ''Tour de France Soundtracks''. This long-awaited box-set would eventually be released in a different set of remasters in November 2009.\n\nIn June 2005 the band's first-ever official live album, ''[[Minimum-Maximum]]'', which was compiled from the shows during the band's tour of spring 2004, received extremely positive reviews.<ref name=\"taylor\">Tony Naylor. [http://www.nme.com/reviews/kraftwerk/7663 \"Kraftwerk: Minimum-Maximum Live\"]. ''[[NME]]'', 2 June 2005. Retrieved 8 August 2013</ref> The album contained reworked tracks from existing studio albums. This included a track titled \"Planet of Visions\" that was a reworking of \"Expo 2000\". In support of this release, Kraftwerk made another quick sweep around the Balkans with dates in [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Turkey]], and Greece. In December, the [[Minimum-Maximum (video)|''Minimum-Maximum'' DVD]] was released. During 2006, the band performed at festivals in Norway, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Spain, Belgium, and Germany.\n\nIn April 2008 the group played three shows in US cities [[Minneapolis]], [[Milwaukee]], and [[Denver]], and were a coheadliner at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. This was their second appearance at the festival since 2004. Further shows were performed in Ireland, Poland, [[Ukraine]], Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore later that year. The touring quartet consisted of Ralf H\u00fctter, Henning Schmitz, [[Fritz Hilpert]], and video technician Stefan Pfaffe, who became an official member in 2008. Original member Florian Schneider was absent from the lineup. H\u00fctter stated that he was working on other projects.<ref>{{cite news |first=Graham |last=Reid |title=Interview: Ralf Hutter of Kraftwerk |date=27 September 2008 |work=The New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=10534357&pnum=0 |accessdate=27 September 2008}}</ref> On 21 November, Kraftwerk officially confirmed Florian Schneider's departure from the band.<ref>{{cite news |author=Music |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/4144592/Kraftwerks-co-founder-Florian-Schneider-leaves-band.html |title=Kraftwerk's co-founder Florian Schneider leaves band |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'' commented on that incident: \"There is something brilliantly Kraftwerkian about the news that Florian Schneider, a founder member of the German electronic pioneers, is leaving the band to pursue a solo career.

Live performance has always played an important part in Kraftwerk's activities. Also, despite its live shows generally being based around formal songs and compositions, live [[improvisation]] often plays a noticeable role in its performances. This trait can be traced back to the group's roots in the first experimental Krautrock scene of the late 1960s, but, significantly, it has continued to be a part of its playing even as it makes ever greater use of digital and computer-controlled sequencing in its performances. Some of the band's familiar compositions have been observed to have developed from live improvisations at its concerts or sound-checks.<ref>{{citation |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/preview+behind+kraftwerk+machines/11360476/story.html |title=The man behind Kraftwerk's machines |author=Sperounes, Sandra |work=Edmon Journal |date=14 September 2015 |accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Technological innovations ===\nThroughout their career, Kraftwerk have pushed the limits of [[music technology]] with some notable innovations, such as home-made instruments and custom-built devices.

Some of his works derive their material from chromatically saturated harmonic patterns that combine chords, melodies and motivic ideas that complete the chromatic scale within given sections of works. Formally, some of Paterson's works are highly episodic, such as his \"Sextet\" and \"Hell's Kitchen\", while others are more seamless, such as \"Dark Mountains\" for orchestra, \"A Dream Within A Dream\" for a cappella choir or \"Deep Blue Ocean\" for two pianos.\n\nPaterson's music is generally very colorful, and he incorporates extended techniques in many of his works, such as \"Scorpion Tales\" for two harps, \"The Book of Goddesses\" for flute, harp and percussion, \"Komodo\" and \"Piranha\" for solo marimba and \"Eating Variations\" for baritone and chamber ensemble.

Described by the press as \"an amazingly colorful tone poem\",<ref name=\"vttoday.com\"/> \"A New Eaarth\" consists of alternating sections of pure orchestral music, narration, and sections for orchestra and chorus (these excerpted choral movements also exist as a work for a choir and piano entitled \"Suite from A New Eaarth\"). The work addresses climate change and is divided into four main sections, each section centered on one of the four [[classical elements]] and how they relate to environmental disasters such as flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes and forest fires, all thought to be exacerbated by climate change. The text for this work consists of narrative text by Paterson based on statements and statistics in McKibben's book,<ref name=\"vttoday.com\"/> as well as poems by [[Wendell Berry]], [[James Joyce]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelly]] and [[William Wordsworth]] and well-known quotes and aphorisms.\n\n==Selected Awards and Recognition==\n* (2018) A.I.

As a percussionist, Paterson spent many years developing a six-mallet technique based on the Burton grip. He developed this technique while studying with John Beck at the Eastman School of Music, where he presented the world's first all six-mallet marimba recital.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newmusicusa.org/profile/robert-paterson/|title=Robert Paterson - New Music USA|work=newmusicusa.org}}</ref> As well as composing his own six-mallet works, he has \"been instrumental in the commissioning of six-mallet works for solo marimba\" and has to date, written fourteen works using a six-mallet technique ([[extended technique]]) he developed.<ref>Jones, Timothy, A Survey of Artists and Literature Employing Extended Multiple Mallets in Keyboard Percussion; Its Evolution, Resulting Techniques and Pedagogical Guide, Doctoral Dissertation, College of Fine Arts, Graduate College, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, August 2003, p. 15.</ref> His recording [http://amzn.com/B009AFXUCG Six Mallet Marimba] is the first all six-mallet marimba album ever released, and contains many of Paterson's six-mallet marimba compositions.

Some of his works derive their material from chromatically saturated harmonic patterns that combine chords, melodies and motivic ideas that complete the chromatic scale within given sections of works. Formally, some of Paterson's works are highly episodic, such as his \"Sextet\" and \"Hell's Kitchen\", while others are more seamless, such as \"Dark Mountains\" for orchestra, \"A Dream Within A Dream\" for a cappella choir or \"Deep Blue Ocean\" for two pianos.\n\nPaterson's music is generally very colorful, and he incorporates extended techniques in many of his works, such as \"Scorpion Tales\" for two harps, \"The Book of Goddesses\" for flute, harp and percussion, \"Komodo\" and \"Piranha\" for solo marimba and \"Eating Variations\" for baritone and chamber ensemble. He also occasionally uses [[found object]]s, such as in his work \"Hell's Kitchen\" which calls for kitchen utensils, pots and pans, and even a kitchen sink.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMany of his works also use bell sounds, and Paterson has said, \"I am fascinated with resonance, and how notes ring.

Many composers admit that they do not care to write \u2018funny\u2019 music. It seems as if they think they are in danger of being considered trivial or not serious if they embrace humor.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nPaterson has spent a good part of his career composing vocal works. Although he has set numerous poems by poets such as [[Wallace Stevens]] and [[Robert Creeley]],<ref>da Fonseca-Wollheim, Corinna, Robert Paterson: \u2018Winter Songs and Other Vocal Works\u2019, The New York Times, December 11, 2013</ref> he has also set a myriad of diverse, alternative texts, such as fictitious answering machine messages (\"Thursday\" for soprano and piano), onomatopoeia words (\"The Essence of Gravity\" for a cappella choir), and even nursery rhymes (\"Life is But a Dream\" for a cappella choir). One of these works, \"CAPTCHA\" for baritone and piano, \"...derives its lyrics from the two-word answers to [[reCAPTCHA]] puzzles. The lyrics are a combination of words, numbers and fragments of words and nonsense.\"<ref>Author Unknown, Techman Texts: From passwords to piece of music, Pittsburgh Post Gazette, December 2, 2013.</ref>\n\nWithin his vocal output, one of his primary works is the [[climate change]] inspired \"A New Eaarth\" for orchestra, chorus and narrator, commissioned by the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association, and inspired by [[Eaarth]] by [[Bill McKibben]], who narrated at the premiere. Described by the press as \"an amazingly colorful tone poem\",<ref name=\"vttoday.com\"/> \"A New Eaarth\" consists of alternating sections of pure orchestral music, narration, and sections for orchestra and chorus (these excerpted choral movements also exist as a work for a choir and piano entitled \"Suite from A New Eaarth\").
