The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonization of [[Nigeria]] from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included ethno-religious riots in Northern Nigeria,<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite journal|last=Plotnicov|first=Leonard|date=1971|title=An Early Nigerian Civil Disturbance: The 1945 Hausa-Ibo Riot in Jos|jstor=159448|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=297\u2013305|issn=0022-278X|doi=10.1017/S0022278X00024976}}</ref> [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]], [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup|a counter-coup]] and [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom|persecution of Igbo]] living in Northern Nigeria. Control over the lucrative [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|oil production]] in the [[Niger Delta]] played a vital strategic role.\n\nWithin a year, the Federal Government troops surrounded Biafra, capturing coastal oil facilities and the city of [[Port Harcourt]]. The blockade imposed during the ensuing stalemate led to mass starvation. During the two and half years of the war, there were about 100,000 overall military casualties, while between 500,000 and 2 million Biafran civilians died of starvation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/ice/BIAFRA.HTM|title=ICE Case Studies: The Biafran War|date=1997|website=American University: ICE Case Studies|publisher=American University|access-date=6 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214103207/http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/biafra.htm|archivedate=14 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-1968, images of malnourished and starving Biafran children saturated the mass media of [[Western countries]]. The plight of the starving Biafrans became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' in foreign countries, enabling a significant rise in the funding and prominence of international [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs). The [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Soviet Union]] were the main supporters of the Nigerian government, while [[France]], [[Israel]] and some other countries supported Biafra.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Ethnic division===\nThe civil war can be connected to the British colonial amalgamation in 1914 of [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate|Northern protectorate]], [[Lagos Colony]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern Nigeria protectorate]] (later renamed Eastern Nigeria). Intended for better administration due to the close proximity of these protectorates. However the change did not take into consideration the differences in the culture and religions of the peoples in each area. Competition for political and economic power exacerbated tensions.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nNigeria gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1960, but remained in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], composed of 53 former UK colonies. In 1960, Nigeria had a population of 60 million people, made up of more than 300 differing ethnic and cultural groups. More than fifty years earlier, the United Kingdom had carved an area out of West Africa containing many different ethnic groups calling it Nigeria. When the British arrived the three largest ethnic groups were the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], which formed between 60\u201370% of the population in the southeast{{Citation needed |date=October 2019}}; the [[Hausa-Fulani]] of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]], which formed about 65% of the population in the northern part of the territory{{Citation needed |date=October 2019}}; and the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] which formed about 75% of the population in the southwestern part{{Citation needed |date=October 2019}}. Although these groups have their own homelands, by the 1960s, the people were dispersed across Nigeria, with all three ethnic groups represented substantially in major cities. When the war broke out in 1967, there were still 5,000 Igbos in Lagos.<ref>Olawoyin, ''Historical Analysis of Nigeria\u2013Biafra Conflict'' (1971), pp. 32\u201333. \"The Ibo like the Hausa and Yoruba, are found in hundreds in all towns and cities throughout the Federation. Even at the period of the Civil War, they numbered more than five thousand in Lagos alone.\"</ref>\n\nThe semi-[[feudal]] and [[Islamic]] Hausa-Fulani in the North were traditionally ruled by a feudal, conservative Islamic hierarchy consisting of [[Emir]]s who, in turn, owed their allegiance to a supreme [[Sultan]]. This Sultan was regarded as the source of all political power and religious authority.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe Yoruba political system in the southwest, like that of the Hausa-Fulani, also consisted of a series of monarchs, the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]], The Yoruba monarchs, however, were less [[autocratic]] than those in the North.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The political and social system of the Yoruba accordingly allowed for greater [[upward mobility]], based on acquired rather than inherited wealth and title.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn contrast to the two other groups, Igbos and the ethnic groups of the [[Niger Delta]] in the southeast lived mostly in autonomous, democratically organised communities, although there were ''eze'' or monarchs in many of the ancient cities, such as the [[Kingdom of Nri]]. In its zenith the Kingdom controlled most of Igbo land, including influence on the [[Anioma people]], [[Arochukwu]] (which controlled [[slavery]] in Igbo), and [[Onitsha]] land. Unlike the other two regions, decisions within the Igbo communities were made by a general assembly in which men and women participated.<ref>{{Google books |id=Zm7sWUbDWakC |page=25 |title=Ijeaku, Nnamdi }}</ref>\n\nThe differing political systems among these three peoples reflected and produced divergent customs and values. The Hausa-Fulani commoners, having contact with the political system only through a village head designated by the Emir or one of his subordinates, did not view political leaders as amenable to influence. Political decisions were to be submitted to. As with all other [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] religious and political systems, leadership positions were given to persons willing to be subservient and loyal to superiors. A chief function of this political system in this context was to maintain conservative values, which caused many Hausa-Fulani to view economic and social innovation as subversive or sacrilegious.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn contrast to the Hausa-Fulani, the Igbos and other Biafrans often participated directly in the decisions which affected their lives. They had a lively awareness of the political system and regarded it as an instrument for achieving their personal goals. Status was acquired through the ability to arbitrate disputes that might arise in the village, and through acquiring rather than inheriting wealth.<ref>Olawoyin, ''Historical Analysis of Nigeria\u2013Biafra Conflict'' (1971), pp. 34\u201335. \"In principle, authority in the local community was formerly exercised by a body of elders which met in council presided over by the head of the senior lineage and included heads of other lineage and sub-lineage. Councils were concerned mainly with offences, religion and public issues likely to break up the solidarity of the group, village or town. Men of influence, particularly men of wealth, who held titles, and members of local Ozo and Eze lodges, frequently dominated the lineage heads, but there was no formal concentration of authority in a single individual. Among the Ibo, even where there was no title taking, a man of wealth could attain considerable political power, apart from any authority derived from his place in a kinship system. [\u2026] New laws which affected the community required the consent of the community concerned as expressed at a public meeting.\"</ref> The Igbo had been substantially victimized in the Atlantic slave trade; in the year 1790 it was reported that of 20,000 people sold each year from [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], 16,000 were Igbo.<ref>Olawoyin, ''Historical Analysis of Nigeria\u2013Biafra Conflict'' (1971), p. 30. \"Bonny, which became one of the principal slave markets on the coast, was largely peopled by Ibo. In 1790, according to Adams, 16,000 out of the 20,000 slaves sold there annually were Ibos. The last British slaver sailed from Bonny in 1808, though the trade continued until 1841.\"</ref> With their emphasis upon social achievement and political participation, the Igbo adapted to and challenged colonial rule in innovative ways.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nThese tradition-derived differences were perpetuated and perhaps enhanced by the [[Colonial Nigeria|British system of colonial rule in Nigeria]]. In the North, the British found it convenient to [[indirect rule|rule indirectly]] through the Emirs, thus perpetuating rather than changing the indigenous authoritarian political system. Christian [[missionaries]] were excluded from the North, and the area thus remained virtually closed to European [[cultural imperialism]]. By contrast the richest of the Igbo often sent their sons to British universities, thinking to prepare them to work with the British. During the ensuing years, the Northern Emirs maintained their traditional political and religious institutions, while reinforcing their social structure. At the time of independence in 1960, the North was by far the most underdeveloped area in Nigeria. It had an English literacy rate of 2%, as compared to 19.2% in the East (literacy in Ajami (local languages in Arabic script), learned in connection with religious education, was much higher). The West also enjoyed a much higher literacy level, as it was the first part of the country to have contact with western education, and established a free primary education program under the pre-independence Western Regional Government.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Biafra Story'', Frederick Forsyth, Leo Cooper, 2001 {{ISBN|0-85052-854-2}}</ref><ref>Pierri, ''A New Entry into the World Oil Market'' (2013), p. 108. \"The North had developed very differently from the rest of the country, for it lagged far behind the South in terms of European-educated population. Hence, Northerners feared that incorporation into an independent and unitary Nigerian State molded according to European standards would cause their cultural and political submission to the South.\"</ref>\n\nIn the West, the missionaries rapidly introduced Western forms of education. Consequently, the Yoruba were the first group in Nigeria to adopt Western bureaucratic social norms. They made up the first classes of African civil servants, doctors, lawyers, and other technicians and professionals.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn Eastern areas, missionaries were introduced at a later date because of British [[Anglo-Aro War|difficulty in establishing firm control]] over the highly autonomous communities.<ref>Audrey Chapman, \"Civil War in Nigeria,\" ''Midstream'', Feb 1968</ref> However, the Igbo and other Biafran people actively took to Western education, and they overwhelmingly came to adopt Christianity. Population pressure in the Igbo homeland, combined with aspirations for monetary wages, drove thousands of Igbos to other parts of Nigeria in search of work. By the 1960s, Igbo political culture was more unified and the region relatively prosperous, with tradesmen and literate elites active not just in the traditionally Igbo East, but throughout Nigeria.<ref>Oliver, Roland and Atmore, Anthony. ''Africa Since 1800''. 1994, page 270</ref> By 1966, the ethnic and religious differences between Northerners and the Igbo had combined with additional stratification by virtue of education and economic class.<ref name=\"Jeyifo2013\" />\n\n===Politics and economics of federalism===\nThe British colonial ideology that divided Nigeria into three regions\u2014North, West and East\u2014exacerbated the already well-developed economic, political, and social differences among Nigeria's different ethnic groups. The country was divided in such a way that the North had a slightly higher population than the other two regions combined. There were also wide-spread reports of fraud during Nigeria's first census,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipobinusa.org/nigeria-britains-creation|title=NIGERIA: BRITAIN'S CREATION HANDED OVER TO THE FULANI|website=Indigenous People of Biafra USA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref> and even today population remains a highly political issue in Nigeria.  On this basis the Northern Region was allocated a majority of the seats in the Federal Legislature established by the colonial authorities. Within each of the three regions the dominant ethnic groups, the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, respectively formed political parties that were largely regional and based on ethnic allegiances: the [[Northern People's Congress]] (NPC) in the North; the [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] in the West (AG); and the [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC) in the East. These parties were not exclusively homogeneous in terms of their ethnic or regional make-up; the disintegration of Nigeria resulted largely from the fact that these parties were primarily based in one region and one tribe.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nThe basis of modern Nigeria formed in 1914, when Britain amalgamated the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] protectorates. Beginning with the Northern Protectorate, the British implemented a system of [[indirect rule]] of which they exerted influence through alliances with local forces. This system worked so well, Colonial Governor [[Frederick Lugard]] successfully lobbied to extend it to the Southern Protectorate through amalgamation. In this way, a foreign and hierarchical system of governance was imposed on the Igbos<ref name=\"Ejiogu2013\">{{cite journal |first=E.

The Westernised Nigerian was an isolated individual, possibly because he was seen as a potential rival. He thus became a creature left to seek his own salvation. All that was left for him then was to seek expression in nationalistic organisations.\"</ref> The size of this intellectual class increased significantly in the 1950s, with the massive expansion of the national education program.<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 17\u201318.</ref> During the 1940s and 1950s the Igbo and Yoruba parties were in the forefront of the fight for independence from Britain. Northern leaders, fearful that independence would mean political and economic domination by the more Westernized elites in the South, preferred the perpetuation of British rule. As a condition for accepting independence, they demanded that the country continue to be divided into three regions with the North having a clear majority. Igbo and Yoruba leaders, anxious to obtain an independent country at all costs, accepted the Northern demands.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nHowever, the two Southern regions had significant cultural and ideological differences, leading to discord between the two Southern political parties. Firstly, the AG favored a loose confederacy of regions in the emergent Nigerian nation whereby each region would be in total control of its own distinct territory. The status of Lagos was a sore point for the AG which did not want Lagos, a Yoruba town which was at that time the Federal Capital and seat of national government to be designated as the Capital of Nigeria if it meant loss of Yoruba sovereignty. The AG insisted that Lagos, a Yoruba city situated in Western Nigeria must be completely recognized as a Yoruba town without any loss of identity, control or autonomy by the Yoruba. Contrary to this position, the NCNC was anxious to declare Lagos, by virtue of it being the \"Federal Capital Territory\" as \"no man's land\" - a declaration which as could be expected angered the AG which offered to help fund the development of another territory in Nigeria as \"Federal Capital Territory\" and then threatened secession from Nigeria if it didn't get its way. The threat of secession by the AG was tabled, documented and recorded in numerous constitutional conferences, including the constitutional conference held in London in 1954 with the demand that a right of secession be enshrined in the constitution of the emerging Nigerian nation to allow any part of the emergent nation to opt out of Nigeria, should the need arise.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Separatist Agitations in Nigeria since 1914|first=Tekena N.|last=Tamuno|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=8|issue=4|pages=563\u2013584|doi=10.1017/s0022278x00023909|jstor=159090|year=1970}}</ref> This proposal for inclusion of right of secession by the regions in independent Nigeria by the AG was rejected and resisted by NCNC which vehemently argued for a tightly bound united/unitary structured nation because it viewed the provision of a secession clause as detrimental to the formation of a Unitary Nigerian state. In the face of sustained opposition by the NCNC delegates, later joined by the NPC and backed by threats to view maintenance of the inclusion of secession by the AG as treasonable by the British, the AG was forced to renounce its position of inclusion of the right of secession a part of the Nigerian constitution. Had such a provision been made in the Nigerian constitution, later events which led to the Nigerian/Biafran civil war would have been avoided. The pre-independence alliance between the NCNC and the NPC against the aspirations of the AG would later set the tone for political governance of independent Nigeria by the NCNC/NPC and lead to disaster in later years in Nigeria.<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 3. \"On 31st March 1953, Anthony Enaharo of the Action Group (AG) tabled a motion in the House of Representatives in Lagos which called for independence in 1956.

Most wage earners lived in the Lagos area, and many lived in overcrowded dangerous housing. Labour activity including strikes intensified in 1963, culminating in a nationwide general strike in June 1964. Strikers disobeyed an ultimatum to return to work and at one point were dispersed by riot police. Eventually, they did win wage increases. The strike included people from all ethnic groups.<ref>Diamond, ''Class, Ethnicity and Democracy in Nigeria'' (1988), chapter 6: \"The 1964 General Strike\" (pp. 162\u2013189).</ref> Retired Brigadier General H.

the \"martial races\" theory first developed under the Raj in 19th century India, the British had decided that peoples from northern Nigeria such as the Hausa, Kiv, and Kanuri were the hard \"martial

discouraged.<ref>Barua, Pradeep ''The Military Effectiveness of Post-Colonial States'' (2013) p. 21</ref> As a result by 1958, men from northern Nigeria made up 62% of the Nigeria Regiment while men

Effectiveness of Post-Colonial States'' (2013) p. 21</ref> The previously favored northerners whose egos had been stoked by being told by their British officers that they were the tough and hardy

\n\n===Military coups===\nOn 15 January 1966, Major [[Emmanuel Ifeajuna]] and other junior Army officers (mostly majors and captains) attempted [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The two major political leaders of the north, the Prime Minister, Sir [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] and the Premier of the northern region, Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]] were executed by Major Nzeogwu. Also murdered was Sir Ahmadu Bello's wife and officers of Northern extraction. The President, Sir [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], an Igbo, was on an extended vacation in the West Indies. He did not return until days after the coup. There was widespread suspicion that the Igbo coup plotters had tipped him and other Igbo leaders off regarding the impending coup. In addition to the killings of the Northern political leaders, the Premier of the Western region, Ladoke Akintola and Yoruba senior military officers were also killed. The coup, also referred to as \"The Coup of the Five Majors\", has been described in some quarters as Nigeria's only revolutionary coup.<ref>Alexander Madiebo (1980) ''The Nigerian Revolution and the Nigerian Civil War''; Fourth Dimension Publishers, Enugu.</ref> This was the first coup in the short life of Nigeria's nascent second democracy. Claims of electoral fraud were one of the reasons given by the coup plotters. Besides for killing much of Nigeria's elite, the \"Majors' Coup\" also saw much of the leadership of the Nigerian Federal Army killed with 7 officers holding the rank above colonel killed.<ref>Barua, Pradeep ''The Military Effectiveness of Post-Colonial States'' (2013) p.9</ref> Of the 7 officers killed, 4 were northerners, two were from the southeast, 1 was from the midwest and 1 was a Igbo.<ref>Barua, Pradeep ''The Military Effectiveness of Post-Colonial States'' (2013) p.9</ref>\n\nThis coup was however seen not as a revolutionary coup by other sections of Nigerians, especially in the Northern and Western sections and later revisionists of Nigerian coups. Some alleged, mostly from Eastern part of Nigeria, that the majors sought to spring Action Group leader [[Obafemi Awolowo]] out of jail and make him head of the new government. Their intention was to dismantle the Northern-dominated power structure but their efforts to take power was unsuccessful. [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], an Igbo and loyalist head of the [[Nigerian Army]], suppressed coup operations in the South and he was declared head of state on 16 January after the surrender of the majors.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\n<blockquote>In the end though, the majors were not in the position to embark on this political goal. While their 15th January coup succeeded in seizing political control in the north, it failed in the south, especially in the Lagos-Ibadan-Abeokuta military district where loyalist troops led by army commander Johnson Aguyi-Ironsi succeeded in crushing the revolt. Apart from Ifeajuna who fled the country after the collapse of their coup, the other two January Majors, and the rest of the military officers involved in the revolt, later surrendered to the loyalist High Command and were subsequently detained as a federal investigation of the event began.</blockquote><ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 52\u201355.</ref><ref>''Nigerian Civil War''; Fourth Dimension Publishers, Enugu.</ref>\n\nAguyi-Ironsi suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament. He then abolished the regional confederated form of government and pursued unitary like policies favoured by the NCNC, having apparently been influenced by some NCNC political philosophy. He, however, appointed Colonel [[Hassan Katsina]], son of [[Katsina]] emir [[Usman Nagogo]], to govern the Northern Region, indicating some willingness to maintain cooperation with this bloc.<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 55. \"But perhaps, most importantly, Aguyi-Ironsi's choice of Colonel Hassan Usman Katsina, the son of the powerful emir of Katsina as the governor of the north, was the clearest signal to the north, and the rest of the country, that his government would not undermine the north's two decades of political hegemony in the federation. Aguyi-Ironsi had already said as much in a number of contacts he made with northern leaders, including the Sultan of Sokoto, soon after the failed majors' coup. Although he had no qualms regarding ignoring the West and leaving in jail the leader of the AG (Obafemi Awolowo), he was anxious to reassure the north of the good intentions of his regime, especially in the light of the deaths of Bello and Balewa during the coup attempt.\"</ref> He also preferentially released northern politicians from jail (enabling them to plan his forthcoming overthrow).<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 55\u201356. \"In fact to underscore Ironsi's goodwill to the north, the new head of state ordered the release of most northern politicians from detention by February (1966), without a reciprocal gesture to their southern counterparts. The released northerners took up positions in the various local government administration in the emirats and, ironically, had ample opportunity to plan and execute the massacre of Igbo civilians living in the north, first in May, 1966, and later in July 1966, which were coupled with the overthrow and murder of Aguyi-Ironsi himself (ironically enough, soon after Aguyi-Ironsi completed a conference with northern emirs), and scores of Igbo military personnel, and the September\u2013October 1966 phase of the pogrom which brought the grisly tally of Igbo killed to 80,000 \u2013 100,000 and the expulsion of 2 million others from the north and elsewhere in the federation.\"</ref> Aguyi-Ironsi rejected a British offer of military support but promised to protect British interests.<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 56. \"Britain had offered to send in troops to support Aguyi-Ironsi and his loyalist forces, after Nzeogwu threatened (on January 16) to march on Lagos and the south, from his Kaduna base, to enforce the control of the January Majors nationwide. While Aguyi-Ironsi discreetly turned down the British offer, he however informed London that its interests in Nigeria, the primary British pre-occupation, would be preserved by his government. This meant that the radical reforms of the Nigerian economy envisaged by the revolting majors, now known by Aguyi-Ironsi and in diplomatic circles in Lagos, would not be implemented. But for the British, the very presence of the Aguyi-Ironsi administration, the fastidious circumstances of its origins notwithstanding, had already breached a cardinal tenet of the post-colonial political order in Nigeria which they had worked so assiduously between 1952\u20131960 to construct: that political leadership within the country to oversee these enormous British interests should come from the north.\"</ref>\n\nIronsi fatally did not bring the failed plotters to trial as required by then-military law and as advised by most northern and western officers, rather, coup plotters were maintained in the military on full pay and some were even promoted while apparently awaiting trial. The coup, despite its failures, was widely seen as primarily benefiting the Igbo peoples as the plotters received no repercussions for their actions and no significant Igbo political leaders were affected. While those that executed the coup were mostly Northern, most of the known plotters were Igbo and the military and political leadership of Western and Northern regions had been largely bloodily eliminated while Eastern military/political leadership was largely untouched. However Ironsi, himself an Igbo, was thought to have made numerous attempts to please Northerners. The other event that also fuelled the so-called \"Igbo conspiracy\" was the killing of Northern leaders, and the killing of the Brigader Ademulegun's pregnant wife by the coup executioners.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nDespite the overwhelming contradictions of the coup being executed by mostly Northern soldiers (such as John Atom Kpera, later military governor of [[Benue State]]), the killing of Igbo soldier Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Unegbe by coup executioners, and Ironsi's termination of an Igbo-led coup, the ease by which Ironsi stopped the coup led to suspicion that the Igbo coup plotters planned all along to pave the way for Ironsi to take the reins of power in Nigeria.<!-- Apparently, Ironsi did succeed in quieting the Western Region, and in the first part of 1966 there were a few months of relatively less violence.<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 58.</ref> Commenting this out for now pending verification in another source. -->\n\nColonel [[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu|Odumegwu Ojukwu]] became military governor of the Eastern Region at this time.<ref>Pierri, \"A New Entry into the World Oil Market\" (2013), pp. 115.</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" /> On 24 May 1966, the military government issued Unification Decree #34, which would have replaced the federation with a more centralised system. The Northern bloc found this decree intolerable.<ref>Pierri, \"A New Entry into the World Oil Market\" (2013), pp. 115.  \"Instead, many Northerners were alarmed that the military era would lead to an Igbo domination, especially when on May 24, 1966, the government issued Unification Decree No. 34, through which the federation was abolished and replaced with a unitary system. To Northerners this meant nothing but Igbo domination, facing the prospect of being occupied and ruled by Southern military and civil servants and lacking the safeguard of being involved in the government according to ethnic group divisions.\"</ref>\n\nIn the face of provocation from the Eastern media which repeatedly showed humiliating posters and cartoons of the slain northern politicians, on the night of 29 July 1966, northern soldiers at Abeokuta barracks mutinied, thus precipitating [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup|a counter-coup]], which had already been in the planning stages. Ironsi was on a visit to [[Ibadan]] during their mutiny and there he was killed (along with his host, [[Adekunle Fajuyi]]). The counter-coup led to the installation of Lieutenant-Colonel Yakubu Gowon as Supreme Commander of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Gowon was chosen as a compromise candidate. He was a Northerner, a Christian, from a minority tribe, and had a good reputation within the army.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nIt seems that Gowon immediately faced not only a potential standoff with the East, but secession threats from the Northern and even the Western region.<ref>Stevenson, \"Capitol Gains\" (2014), pp. 318\u2013319.</ref> The counter-coup plotters had considered using the opportunity to withdraw from the federation themselves. Ambassadors from Britain and the United States, however, urged Gowon to maintain control over the whole country.

Before, during and after the slaughter, Col. Gowon could be heard over the radio issuing 'guarantees of safety' to all Easterners, all citizens of Nigeria, but the intent of the soldiers, the only power that counts in Nigeria now or then, was painfully clear.

The completion in 1969 of a new terminal at [[For\u00e7ados]] brought production up from 142,000 barrels/day in 1958 to 540,000 barrels/day in 1969. In 1970, this figure doubled to 1,080,000 barrels/day.

Furthermore, silting of the approaches to the Bonny terminal during the early parts of the war reduced its unit tanker capacity from 70,000 tons to about 40,000 tons. Even with the use of smaller tankers, the short haul from Nigeria to Britain was still more profitable than the Cape route used for Gulf oil. Despite the prospects for Eastern Region oil, the civil war made the source unreliable. Luckily for Shell-BP, prior to the war, it had planned a second terminal off Forcados, which was in Federal territory.

The war broke out just a week before the Six Day War in the Middle East led to the Suez Canal being blocked, forcing oil tankers from the Middle East to use the long route around the Cape of Good Hope, thereby using the cost of Middle Eastern oil.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.65</ref> In turn, this increased the importance of Nigerian oil to Britain, which was cheaper than oil from the Persian Gulf.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.65</ref> Initially, when it was unclear which side would prevail, Britain took a \"wait and see\" approach before deciding decisively for Nigeria.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.65-66</ref>\u00a0Nigeria had a navy of only 6 vessels, the largest of which was a frigate; an air force of 76 planes, none of which were fighters or bombers; and an army of 7,000 men with no tanks and a shortage of officers with command experience.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.72-73</ref> Through Biafra was likewise similarly weak, the two sides appeared evenly matched at the beginning of the war, and Nigerian victory was by no means considered preordained.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.72-73</ref>\u00a0 \n\nBritain backed the Federal Government but, when the war broke out, cautioned them not to damage British oil installations in the East. These oilworks, under the control of Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company (jointly owned by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[British Petroleum]]), controlled 84% of Nigeria's 580,000 barrels per day. Two-thirds of this oil came from the Eastern region, and another third from the newly created Mid-West region. Two-fifths of all Nigerian oil ended up in Britain.<ref name=\"Uche2008pages120to124\">Uche, ''Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War'' (2008), pp. 120\u2013124.</ref> In 1967, 30% of the oil being imported into Britain came from Nigeria.<ref>Stremlau  ''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.66</ref> \n\nShell-BP therefore considered carefully a request by the Federal Government that it refuse to pay the royalties demanded by Biafra. Its lawyers advised that payment to Biafra would be appropriate if this government did in fact maintain law and order in the region in question. The British government advised that paying Biafra could undermine the goodwill of the Federal Government. Shell-BP made the payment, and the government established a blockade on oil exports.<ref name=\"Uche2008pages120to124\" /> Forced to choose a side, Shell-BP and the British government threw in their lot with the Federal Government in Lagos, apparently calculating that this side would be more likely to win the war.<ref name=\"Uche2008pages125to127\">Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), pp. 125\u2013127. \"The Nigerian government subsequently made it explicit to Shell-BP that it expected the company to pay the outstanding oil royalty immediately. Once the oil flow stopped, sitting on a fence ceased to be an option for the British government. Britain subsequently decided to back Nigeria, partly because it was advised that, in the event of war, the odds were 'slightly in favour of the Federal Military Government'. Perhaps more importantly, the British government calculated that supporting Nigeria was its safest option if it were to preserve its oil interests in the country, largely because the Cold War and the rivalry among some Western European states made it likely that other foreign powers would wade into the conflict.\"</ref> As the British High Commissioner in Lagos wrote to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs on 27 July 1967:\n\n<blockquote>Ojukwu, even victorious, will not be in a strong position. He will require all the international help and recognition he can get. The Federal Government would be much better placed both internationally and internally. They would have a cast iron case for the severest treatment of a company which has subsidised a rebel, and I feel fairly convinced they would press their case to the lengths of cancelling the Company's concessions and nationalising their installations. I conclude, therefore, if the company does change its mind and asks the British Government for advice, the best that could be given is for it to clamber hastily back on the Lagos side of the fence with cheque book at the ready.\"<ref name=\"Uche2008pages125to127\" /></blockquote>\n\nShell-BP took this advice.<ref name=\"Uche2008pages125to127\" /> It continued to quietly support Nigeria through the rest of the war, in one case advancing a royalty of \u00a35.5 million to fund the purchase of more British weapons.<ref>Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), p. 132. \"Given Shell-BP's interest in Nigeria taking over the major oilfields still in Biafran hands, it was not surprising that they overtly supported the Nigerian military cause.99 A case in point was in December 1967 when the Nigerian government, frustrated by the slow pace of progress in the war, requested that Shell-BP pay its royalty of \u00a35.5 million in advance, in order to enable it to purchase arms from Britain. Shell-BP promptly complied.\"</ref>\n\nIt was not until Federal forces captured the ocean oil terminal at Bonny on 25 July 1967 that the British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] decided to back Nigeria with military aid.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.76</ref> After the Federal victory at Bonny, Wilson summoned  [[David Hunt (diplomat)|David Hunt ]], the British high commissioner to Nigeria, for a meeting at 10 Downing Street in early August 1967 for his assessment of the situation.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.76</ref> Hunt's view that the Federal forces were the better organised and would win because they could draw upon a greater population led Wilson to side with Nigeria.\n\nDuring the war, Britain covertly supplied Nigeria with weapons and military intelligence and may have also helped it to hire mercenaries.<ref>Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), p. 130. \"In reality, however, the British government supplied many more arms than it was publicly prepared to admit. Apart from direct arms supplies, it provided military intelligence to the Nigerian government and may have helped it to access sophisticated arms and mercenaries through third parties.\"</ref> After the decision was made to back Nigeria, the BBC oriented its reporting to favour this side.<ref>Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), p. 131. \"Furthermore, once the war broke out and the British government decided to back the Nigerian side, the BBC swiftly shifted its reporting on the conflict, in Nigeria's favour. This was noticed and thankfully acknowledged by the Nigerian government.\"</ref> Supplies provided to the Federal Military Government included two vessels and 60 vehicles.<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), pp. 274.</ref>\n\nIn Britain, the humanitarian campaign around Biafra began on 12 June 1968, with media coverage on ITV and in The Sun. The charities [[Oxfam]] and [[Save the Children Fund]] were soon deployed, with large sums of money at their disposal.<ref name=\"OSullivan2014page302\">O'Sullivan, \"Humanitarian Encounters\" (2014), p. 302. \"It took time, however, for popular attention to focus on the crisis. In Britain that occurred only after 12 June 1968, when a film broadcast on ITV and a press campaign led by the ''Sun'' newspaper sparked the humanitarian response into life.\"</ref>\n\n===France===\nFrance provided weapons, mercenary fighters, and other assistance to Biafra and promoted its cause internationally, describing the situation as a genocide. [[Charles de Gaulle]] referred to \"Biafra's just and noble cause\".<ref name=\"Olawoyin1971pages137to139\">Olawoyin, \"Historical Analysis of Nigeria\u2013Biafra Conflict\" (1971), pp. 137\u2013139.</ref> However, France did not recognise Biafra diplomatically.<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), pp. 114\u2013115. \"France, however, categorically refused to officially recognise Biafra, a possibility President Charles de Gaulle ruled out as early as 14 December 1967. At the same time it was well known that France was supporting Biafran leader General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu with covert military aid throughout the war, including mercenaries and weapons.\"</ref> Through Pierre Laureys, France had apparently provided two B-26s, Alouette helicopters, and pilots.<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 119. Foccart says de Gaulle's decision to send military assistance to Biafra was made on 27 September 1967, when the General met personally with Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, who was Biafra's most important African ally throughout the war. On 26 September, the Biafran capital, Enugu, was shelled for the first time by Federal Nigerian forces. The problem with this date is that it appears that France had already supplied Biafra with two B-26 aircraft, Alouette helicopters and pilots in summer 1967 via the French arms dealer Pierre Laureys. In 1971, however, Ralph Uwechue, Biafra's envoy to France, wrote that \"the helicopters had been purchases made by the Eastern Nigerian Regional Government from France for civilian purposes well before the war.\"</ref> France supplied Biafra with captured German and Italian weapons from World War II, sans serial numbers, delivered as part of regular shipments to [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 122. \"De Gaulle made the decision to begin regular French arms shipments to Biafra on 17 or 18 October 1967. De Gaulle was very reluctant to send weapons from French stocks, and only agreed when Foccart suggested sending captured German and Italian weapons from World War II with the serial number scratched off. The weapons would not be sent directly to Ojukwu, but would go through Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, so that it looked like France was replenishing the Ivory Coast's stocks as stipulated in the normal bilateral military assistance agreements.\"</ref> France also sold [[Panhard]] armoured vehicles to the Nigerian federal government.<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), pp. 179. \"France, too, pursued contradictory policies, selling Nigeria Panhard light armoured cars and halting all arms transfers to Lagos only later that year, by which time it was supplying the Biafrans via the Ivory Coast and Gabon. Clapham notes that France's military aid to Biafra prolonged the war for about eighteen months.\"</ref>\n\nFrench involvement in the war can be viewed in the context of its geopolitical strategy (''[[Fran\u00e7afrique]]'') and competition with the British in West Africa. Nigeria represented a base of British influence in the predominantly French-aligned area. France and Portugal used nearby countries in their sphere of influence, especially C\u00f4te d'Ivoire under President [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny]], as waystations for shipments to Biafra.<ref name=\"Olawoyin1971pages137to139\" /><ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015)</ref> To some extent, also, France repeated its earlier policy from the [[Congo Crisis]], when it supported the secession of the southern mining province [[State of Katanga|Katanga]].<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), pp. 116\u2013 117. \"The Katanga secession (1960\u20131963) was in many ways a precursor to the Biafran War for France. French mercenaries went to Katanga to support the Belgian intervention. The Belgians were helping Tshomb\u00e9 fight Congolese forces loyal to Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, who was supported by the Soviet Union. [\u2026] The Katangan secession was ultimately unsuccessful, and thus it is a surprise that de Gaulle's government would support another secession in Biafra four years later. A number of other countries also drew a link between the two conflicts, and Ojukwu released a statement on 11 January 1969 called 'Biafra: the antithesis of Katanga', to reassure foreign powers. [\u2026] Katanga gave France experience in using mercenaries to fight a war in which the consequences of failure were minimal.\"</ref>\n\nEconomically, France gained incentives through oil drilling contracts for the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Fran\u00e7aise de Recherches et d'Exploitation de P\u00e9troli\u00e8res'' (SAFRAP), apparently arranged with Eastern Nigeria in advance of its secession from the Nigerian Federation.<ref>Griffin, ''French Military Policy in the Nigerian Civil War'' (2015), p. 118. \"Nigeria, however, was very important for France due to its size as well as the oil in the Niger River Delta. France had no diplomatic relations with Nigeria after 1960, as Nigeria expelled the French ambassador, Raymond Offroy, following the third French nuclear test in Algeria on 27 December. The severing of diplomatic relations did not halt commercial relations between the two countries, and in 1964, the French national oil company, SAFRAP, was given the rights to search for oil in parts of Eastern Nigeria that would later declare independence under the name of Biafra.\"</ref><ref name=\"Olawoyin1971pages135to136\">Olawoyin, \"Historical Analysis of Nigeria\u2013Biafra Conflict\" (1971), pp. 135\u2013136. \"The French policy may be described as anti-British, anti-Nigerian and pr-Biafra. SAFRAP (a French oil company) is exploring for oil in Biafra as well as in Nigeria. Although France has leaned toward Biafra, SAFRAP has vast exploration rights in the Northern Region; this might have prevented France giving Biafra political recognition. [\u2026] The highlight of increasing world sympathy for Ojukwu was also motivated by the declaration by the French government that it endorsed the principle of Biafra's right to self-determination. Before the start of the Civil War, France had strengthened her economic ties with Biafra. On August 8th, F.G. showed some documents (photostat copies) to the foreign press showing that Biafra had sold oil concessions to France.\"</ref> SAFRAP laid claim to 7% of the Nigerian petroleum supply.<ref name=\"Uche2008pages120to124\" /> In the assessment of a CIA analyst in 1970, France's \"support was actually given to a handful of Biafran bourgeoisie in return for the oil. \"<ref>\"[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve05p1/d160 Telegram from the Central Intelligence Agency to the White House Situation Room],\" CIA, 20262, TDCS DB \u2013 315/00173-70 (ADVANCE), 14 January 1970, in FRUS, Vol. E-5, 2005 (160); as cited in Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 120.</ref> Biafra, for its part, openly appreciated its relationship with France. Ojukwu suggested on 10 August 1967, that Biafra introduce compulsory French classes in secondary, technical and teacher training schools, in order to \"benefit from the rich culture of the French-speaking world\".<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 119.</ref>\n\nFrance led the way, internationally, for political support of Biafra.<ref name=\"Olawoyin1971pages135to136\" /> [[Portugal]] also sent weapons. These transactions were arranged through the \"Biafran Historical Research Centre\" in Paris.<ref name=\"griffin\">Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 122. \"The most important dimension of French military assistance was the shipment of weapons to Biafra, which had severe shortages of not only heavy weapons, but also small arms and ammunition. Portugal also provided weapons to Biafra, as did Czechoslovakia, until the Soviet invasion in 1968. The Biafrans set up an office in Paris called the 'Biafran Historical Research Centre', which was Ojukwu's contact point with Mauricheau-Beupr\u00e9, Falques and Denard. The Centre allowed Ojukwu to purchase arms directly from European arms dealers. Denard would purchase arms from Czechoslovakia and ship them by sea to Biafra via Libreville. Starting in October 1967, there were also direct Czech arms flights, by a network of pilots led by Jack Malloch, a Rhodesian in contact with Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny and Mauricheau-Beupr\u00e9.\"</ref> French-aligned [[Gabon]] and [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] recognised Biafra in May 1968.<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 123.</ref> On 8 May 1968, De Gaulle personally contributed 30,000 francs to medicine purchases for the French Red Cross mission. [[May 1968 events in France|Fairly widespread student-worker unrest]] diverted the government's attention only temporarily. The government declared an arms embargo but maintained arms shipments to Biafra under cover of humanitarian aid.<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 124. \"In May and early June 1968, protests and general strikes in France prevented de Gaulle, Foccart or any other French official from following the situation in Biafra. On 12 June, after the riots had subsided, a French ministerial council decided to impose an official arms embargo on both Nigeria and Biafra, and to start providing direct humanitarian aid to Ojukwu. Robert explains that the humanitarian aid provided a very effective cover for the secret French arms shipments, which began to increase.\"</ref> In July the government redoubled its efforts to involve the public in a humanitarian approach to the conflict. Images of starving children and accusations of genocide filled French newspapers and television programs. Amidst this press blitz, on 31 July 1968, De Gaulle made an official statement in support of Biafra.<ref name=\"Griffin2015page124\">Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 124\u2013125. \"The 31 July 1938 statement in favour of Biafra was preceded by a concerted campaign in the French press during the month of July to inform the French public about events in Biafra. [\u2026] The French government's next step after the 31 July statement was to launch a major campaign to gain public funding for humanitarian operations in Biafra. The campaign was coordinated at the highest levels of government, and the French Foreign Ministry files make it clear that the French television service and the French Red Cross were required to get governmental approval to ask for funds. The French public eventually contributed 12,600,000 francs. The French press continued a concerted campaign throughout August 1968 to alert the public to the humanitarian situation.\"</ref> Maurice Robert, head of ''[[Service de Documentation Ext\u00e9rieure et de Contre-Espionnage]]'' (SDECE, the French foreign intelligence service) African operations, wrote in 2004 that his agency supplied the press with details about the war and told them to use the word \"genocide\" in their reporting.<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 124. \"Robert, in a surprising admission, stated that it was the SDECE that instructed the media to use the term 'genocide' in 1968. He says that the SDECE gave the French press precise information about Biafran casualties and civilian losses, and that ''Le Monde'' was the first to pick up the story. Rony Braumann wrote in 2006 that the SDECE paid the Biafran press service Markpress, located in Geneva, to introduce the theme of genocide to the general public.\"</ref>\n\nFrance declared \"Biafra Week\" on 11\u201317 March 1969, centred on a 2-franc raffle held by the French Red Cross. Soon after, de Gaulle terminated arms shipments, then resigned on 27 April 1969. Interim president [[Alain Poher]] fired General [[Jacques Foccart]], the lead coordinator of France's Africa policy. [[Georges Pompidou]] re-hired Foccart and resumed support for Biafra, including cooperation with the South African secret service to import more weapons.<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), pp. 127\u2013128.</ref>\n\n===United States of America===\nThe United States officially declared neutrality, with US Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] stating that \"America is not in a position to take action as Nigeria is an area under British influence\".<ref name=\"shellbpinflu\" /> Formally, the United States was neutral in the civil war. Strategically, its interests aligned with the Federal Military Government, although there was considerable popular sentiment in support of Biafra. The US also saw value in its alliance with Lagos, and sought to protect $800 million (in the assessment of the State Department) worth of private investment.<ref>Pierri, \"A New Entry into the World Oil Market\" (2013), pp. 105\u2013106.</ref>\n\nOn 9 September 1968, United States [[1968 United States presidential election|presidential candidate]] Richard Nixon stated:\n<blockquote>Until now, efforts to relieve the Biafra people have been thwarted by the desire of central government of Nigeria to pursue total and unconditional victory and by the fear of the Ibo people that surrender means wholesale atrocities and genocide.

Nigeria's need for more aircraft, which Britain and the United States refused to sell, led Gowon to accept a Soviet offer in the summer of 1967 to sell a squadron of 17 MIG-17 fighters.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.79</ref> The British-trained Nigerian military tended to be distrustful of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet ambassador in Lagos, Alexander Romanov, a gregarious and friendly man as well as a skewed  diplomat  established an excellent rapport with Gowon and persuaded him that accepting Soviet weapons would not mean subjection to the Soviet Union.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.79-80</ref> The first MIG-17s arrived in Nigeria in August 1967 together with some about 200 Soviet technicians to train the Nigerians in their use.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.80</ref> Through the MIG-17s turned out to be too sophisticated for the Nigerians to use properly, requiring Egyptian Air Force pilots to fly them, but the Soviet-Nigerian arms deal turned out to be one of the turning points of the war.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.80</ref> Besides establishing an arms pipeline from the Soviet Union to Nigeria, the possibility that the Soviet Union would gain greater influence in Nigeria led Britain to increase its supply of arms to maintain its influence in Lagos while ruling out the possibility of either the United States or Britain either recognizing Biafra.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.80</ref> \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThe Soviet Union consistently supplied Nigeria with weapons, with the diplomatic disclaimer that these were \"strictly for cash on a commercial basis\". In 1968, the USSR agreed to finance the [[Kainji Dam]] on the Niger (somewhat upriver from the Delta). Soviet media outlets initially accused the British of cynically supporting the Biafran secession, then had to adjust these claims later when it turned out that Britain was in fact supporting the Federal Government.<ref name=\"Stent1973\">[[Angela Stent]], \"The Soviet Union and the Nigerian Civil War: A Triumph of Realism\", ''Issue: A Journal of Opinion'' 3.2, Summer 1973.</ref>\n\nOne explanation for Soviet sympathy with the Federal Military Government was a shared opposition to internal secessionist movements. Before the war, the Soviets had seemed sympathetic to the Igbos. But Soviet Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin stated to their chagrin in October 1967 that \"the Soviet people fully understand\" Nigeria's motives and its need \"to prevent the country from being dismembered.\"<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), p. 273. \"From 1967 to 1970, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Poland sold Nigeria twelve L-29 Delfin training aircraft, forty-seven MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighter jets, and five Ilyushin-28 bombers, two of which Egypt transferred to Lagos. This constituted a virtual about-face in Soviet policy, because, until the secession, Moscow had evinced both admiration of the Igbos and sympathy for their plight. The Soviet Union chose pragmatism, in the form of alignment with federal Nigeria, over the ideological (if not idealist) alternative of support for Biafra.\"</ref>\n\nReportedly, the war substantially improved Soviet-Nigerian diplomatic and trade relations, and [[Moskvitch]] cars began to make appearances around Lagos. The USSR became a competitive importer of Nigerian cacao.<ref name=\"Stent1973\" />\n\nNigeria received support from the Soviet Union in the form of aircraft.<ref>Susan Aurelia Gitelson, \"The Linkage Between External and Domestic Policies: Israel's Experience with Ghana and Nigeria\", ''Jewish Social Studies'' 42.2, Spring 1980.</ref>\n\n===China===\nBecause the Soviet Union was one of Nigeria's leading supporters, supplying arms on a generous scale, China declared its support for Biafra.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.237</ref> In its first major statement on the war in September 1968, the New China Press Agency stated the People's Republic of China fully supported the justified struggle for liberation of the people of Biafra against the Nigerian government supported by \"Anglo-American imperialism and Soviet revisionism\".<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.237</ref> China supported arms to Biafra via Tanzania, supplying arms worth some $2 million dollars in 1968-1969.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.237</ref>\n\n===Israel===\nFrom early on, Israel perceived that Nigeria would be an important player in West African politics, and saw good relations with Lagos as an important foreign policy objective. Nigeria and Israel established a linkage in 1957. In 1960 Britain allowed the creation of an Israeli diplomatic mission in Lagos, and Israel made a $10 million loan to the Nigerian government. Israel also developed a cultural relation with the Igbos based on possible shared traditions. These moves represented a significant diplomatic success given the Muslim orientation of the northern-dominated government. Some northern leaders disapproved of contact with Israel and banned Israelis from [[Maiduguri]] and [[Sokoto]].<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), pp. 264\u2013265. \"Israel was certain that Nigeria, the most populous country on the continent (fifty- five million in 1960) and rich in oil, would have a great influence on African poli- tics. The Israeli foreign ministry was determined to establish full diplomatic relations upon that colony's receipt of independence (1 October 1960). Ehud Avriel, ambassador to Ghana and a close confidant of both Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Foreign Minister Golda Meir, cautioned that were Israel to fail to establish ties with Nigeria, \u2018all of our work in West Africa will have come to naught\u2019.\"</ref>\n\nIsrael did not begin arms sales to Nigeria until after Aguyi-Ironsi came to power on January 17, 1966. This was considered an opportune time to develop this relationship with the federal government. Ram Nirgad became Israeli ambassador to Nigeria in January. Thirty tons of mortar rounds were delivered in April.<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), p. 266.</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Region began seeking assistance from Israel in September 1966. Israel apparently turned down their requests repeatedly, although they may have put the Biafran representatives in contact with another arms dealer.<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), p. 267. \"By September 1966, an open arms race had developed between the East and the Federal Government. In mid August, Ojukwu sent two representatives from the Eastern Region on a clandestine visit to Israel in a bid to purchase military hardware.

Private groups in the US, led by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], responded. No one was ever held responsible for these killings.\n\nIn September 1968, the federal army planned what Gowon described as the \"final offensive.\" Initially the final offensive was neutralised by Biafran troops by the end of the year after several Nigerian troops were routed in Biafran ambushes. In the latter stages, a Southern FMG offensive managed to break through. However in 1969, the Biafrans launched several offensives against the Nigerians in their attempts to keep the Nigerians off-balance starting in March when the 14th Division of the Biafran army recaptured [[Owerri]] and moved towards Port Harcourt, but were halted just north of the city. In May 1969, Biafran commandos recaptured oil wells in Kwale. In July 1969, Biafran forces launched a major land offensive supported by foreign [[mercenary]] pilots continuing to fly in food, medical supplies and weapons. Most notable of the mercenaries was Swedish Count [[Carl Gustav von Rosen]] who led air attacks with five [[Malm\u00f6 MFI-9]] MiniCOIN small piston-engined aircraft, armed with rocket pods and machine guns. His Biafran Air Force consisted of three Swedes: von Rosen, Gunnar Haglund and Martin Lang. The other two pilots were Biafrans: Willy Murray-Bruce and Augustus Opke. From 22 May to 8 July 1969 von Rosen's small force attacked Nigerian military airfields in Port Harcourt, Enugu, Benin City and Ughelli, destroying or damaging a number of Nigerian Air Force jets used to attack relief flights, including a few Mig-17's and three of Nigeria's six Ilyushin Il-28 bombers that were used to bomb Biafran villages and farms on a daily basis. Although the Biafran offensives of 1969 were a tactical success, the Nigerians soon recovered.

With this method many tons of food were dropped to many Biafrans who would otherwise have died of starvation.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[Bernard Kouchner]] was one of a number of French doctors who volunteered with the [[French Red Cross]] to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra.

Kouchner and the other French doctors signed this agreement.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nAfter entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army, and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.

This analogy originated in ethnological genealogies that cast the Igbos as the 'Jews of Africa', even as one of Israel's 'lost tribes'. The Biafran leadership drew on this representation that many eastern Nigerians had adopted as their self-perception. This analogy, combined with the genocide charge, was used by the leadership to secure the support of the population, and to build loyalty to Biafra by emphasising the threat from a common enemy. The 'Jews of Africa' envisioned their state like an 'African Israel', a new nation born of genocidal violence. / Soon, the growing cast of Biafra's supporters around the globe adopted this rhetoric, further elaborating it in the process. After the publication of images of starving Biafran children in the western media, analogies and comparisons with the Holocaust abounded internationally.\"</ref>\n\nHumanitarian appeals differed somewhat from place to place. In Britain, humanitarian aid used familiar discourses of imperial responsibility; in Ireland, advertisements appealed to shared Catholicism and experiences of civil war.<ref>O'Sullivan, \"Humanitarian Encounters\" (2014), pp. 304\u2013305. \"In Britain humanitarianism became a vessel through which society could construct a new sense of national purpose; it amounted, in essence, to a benign re-imagining of imperial compassion for a postcolonial world. When the Biafran crisis erupted, it offered an opportunity to renew this emphasis on the country's responsibilities [\u2026] On the surface, the Irish response to Biafra was built on something very different to the British: a shared religion (Catholicism), a common colonial experience and a narrative of humanitarian disaster.

From different starting points, and with differing goals, NGOs in both states assumed the mantel of organised reactions and re-imaginings of their countries' roles for the postcolonial era.

The division was commanded by Col. [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] (who later became president twice), which succeeded in splitting the Biafran enclave into two by the end of the year. The final Nigerian offensive, named \"Operation Tail-Wind\", was launched on 7 January 1970 with the 3rd Marine Commando Division attacking, and supported by the 1st Infantry division to the north and the 2nd Infantry division to the south. The Biafran towns of [[Owerri]] fell on 9 January, and Uli on 11 January. Only a few days earlier, Ojukwu fled into exile by plane to the [[Ivory Coast]], leaving his deputy [[Philip Effiong]] to handle the details of the surrender to General [[Yakubu Gowon]] of the Federal Army on 13 January 1970.

With special reference to the Asaba Massacre, Emma Okocha described the killings as \"the first black-on-black genocide\".<ref name=\"Korieh2013\">{{cite journal | last1 = Korieh | first1 = Chima J | title = Biafra and the discourse on the Igbo Genocide | url = | journal = Journal of Asian and African Studies | volume = 46 | issue = 6| year = 2013 }}</ref> Ekwe-Ekwe places significant blame on the British.<ref>Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe, \"The Achebean Restoration\", ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 48.6, 2013. \"Britain was a central operative, along with the Nigerian state, in the planning and execution of the Igbo genocide right from its outset in 1966 to its concluding phases in 1969/1970. It was Britain's 'punishment' of the Igbo for its audacious lead of the struggle for the freeing of Nigeria from British occupation that began in the 1930s. Twice during that struggle, the occupation regime had casually watched two organised pogroms against the Igbo in north Nigeria \u2013 in 1945 and 1953. These murders, which also included the looting and destruction of tens of thousands of pounds worth of Igbo property and businesses, were carried out by pro-British political forces in the region who were opposed to the restoration of African independence but who Britain would hand over supreme political power of the country to on the eve of its so-called departure from Nigeria in 1960. The pogroms were clearly dress rehearsals for subsequent genocide. / Without British complicity, it was highly unlikely that the Igbo genocide would have been embarked on in its initial phase by the Nigerian state with such unrelenting stretch and consequences between May and October 1966. Without the massive arms support that Nigeria received from Britain especially, it was highly improbably the Nigeria would have been in the military position to pursue its second phase of the genocide\u2013namely, the invasion of Igboland \u2013 between July 1967 and January 1970. Harold Wilson, the British prime minister at the time, was adamant, as the slaughtering worsened, that he 'would accept' the death of 'a half a million' Igbo 'if that was what it took' the Nigerian genocidists on the ground to accomplish their ghastly mission (Morris, 1977:122).\" See also: Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe, \"[http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category.php/comment/88468 Britain and the Igbo genocide: Now for the pertinent questions]\", ''Pambazuka News'', 30 July 2013.</ref>\n\nAnother reference to the war's consideration as a Genocide would be to Bruce Mayrock.<ref name=\"Columbia University Libraries1969\">GS Student immolates self in front of U.N. Building, Columbia Daily Spectator, Volume CXIII, Number 118, 3 June 1969</ref> In the report, Mayrock, a 20-year-old Student at Columbia University, set himself on fire in protest of the killings in Biafra and how they were being overlooked. He died as a result of the burns. While at Columbia, Mayrock worked as a photographer for the Spectator sports department. Members of the youth's family stated Friday that he had worked actively to protest the war in Biafra, writing letters about the war to the President and leading government figures. However, according to one rabbi, who said he was close to the family, the student believed that \"no one was listening.\" \"He was an idealistic young man deeply upset by the events in Biafra,\" the rabbi said. \"People were being killed and he felt no one was doing anything. That's why he did what he did.\"<ref>Student immolates self in front of U.N. Building, Columbia Daily Spectator, Volume CXIII, Number 118, 3 June 1969</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\nReconstruction, helped by the oil money, was swift; however, the old ethnic and religious tensions remained a constant feature of Nigerian politics. Accusations were made of Nigerian government officials diverting resources meant for reconstruction in the former Biafran areas to their ethnic areas. Military government continued in power in Nigeria for many years, and people in the oil-producing areas claimed they were being denied a fair share of oil revenues.<ref>With reason. The pre-1966 tax-sharing agreements on mineral wealth were changed to okay favour the Federal government at the expense of the state. This agreement has, in the 1980s, been modified to further favour the Federal government.</ref> Laws were passed mandating that political parties could not be ethnically or tribally based; however, it has been hard to make this work in practice.\n\nIgbos who ran for their lives during the pogroms and war returned to find their positions had been taken over; and when the war was over the government did not feel any need to re-instate them, preferring to regard them as having resigned. This reasoning was also extended to Igbo-owned properties and houses. People from other regions were quick to take over any house owned by an Igbo, especially in the Port Harcourt area. The Nigerian Government justified this by terming such properties abandoned. This, however, has led to a feeling of an injustice as the Nigerian government policies were seen as further economically disabling the Igbos even long after the war. Further feelings of injustice were caused by Nigeria changing its currency, so that Biafran supplies of pre-war Nigerian currency were no longer honoured. At the end of the war, only N\u00a320 was given to any easterner regardless of the amount of money he or she had had in the bank. This was applied irrespective of their banking in pre-war Nigerian currency or Biafran currency. This was seen as a deliberate policy to hold back the Igbo middle class, leaving them with little wealth to expand their business interests.<ref>[[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], ''On a darkling plain''</ref>\n\n===Fall of Biafra===\nOn 29 May 2000, ''[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian]]'' reported that President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] commuted to retirement the dismissal of all military persons who fought for the breakaway state of Biafra during the Nigerian civil war. In a national broadcast, he said that the decision was based on the principle that \"justice must at all times be tempered with mercy.\"{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nBiafra was more or less wiped off the map until its resurrection by the contemporary [[Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra]].<ref>Heerten & Moses, \"The Nigeria\u2013Biafra War\" (2014), pp. 189\u2013190. \"By contrast, 'Biafra' as an Igbo project of collective assertion and liberation was destroyed in 1970 and has been a taboo subject ever sense\u2014at least until MASSOB placed it back on the agenda.\"</ref> Chinua Achebe's last book, ''There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra'', has also rekindled discussion of the war.

The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonization of [[Nigeria]] from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included ethno-religious riots in Northern Nigeria,<ref name=\"auto3\">{{Cite journal|last=Plotnicov|first=Leonard|date=1971|title=An Early Nigerian Civil Disturbance: The 1945 Hausa-Ibo Riot in Jos|jstor=159448|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=9|issue=2|pages=297\u2013305|issn=0022-278X|doi=10.1017/S0022278X00024976}}</ref> [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]], [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup|a counter-coup]] and [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom|persecution of Igbo]] living in Northern Nigeria. Control over the lucrative [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|oil production]] in the [[Niger Delta]] played a vital strategic role.\n\nWithin a year, the Federal Government troops surrounded Biafra, capturing coastal oil facilities and the city of [[Port Harcourt]]. The blockade imposed during the ensuing stalemate led to mass starvation. During the two and half years of the war, there were about 100,000 overall military casualties, while between 500,000 and 2 million Biafran civilians died of starvation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/ice/BIAFRA.HTM|title=ICE Case Studies: The Biafran War|date=1997|website=American University: ICE Case Studies|publisher=American University|access-date=6 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214103207/http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/biafra.htm|archivedate=14 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-1968, images of malnourished and starving Biafran children saturated the mass media of [[Western countries]]. The plight of the starving Biafrans became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' in foreign countries, enabling a significant rise in the funding and prominence of international [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs). The [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Soviet Union]] were the main supporters of the Nigerian government, while [[France]], [[Israel]] and some other countries supported Biafra.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Ethnic division===\nThe civil war can be connected to the British colonial amalgamation in 1914 of [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate|Northern protectorate]], [[Lagos Colony]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern Nigeria protectorate]] (later renamed Eastern Nigeria). Intended for better administration due to the close proximity of these protectorates. However the change did not take into consideration the differences in the culture and religions of the peoples in each area. Competition for political and economic power exacerbated tensions.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nNigeria gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1960, but remained in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], composed of 53 former UK colonies. In 1960, Nigeria had a population of 60 million people, made up of more than 300 differing ethnic and cultural groups. More than fifty years earlier, the United Kingdom had carved an area out of West Africa containing many different ethnic groups calling it Nigeria. When the British arrived the three largest ethnic groups were the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], which formed between 60\u201370% of the population in the southeast{{Citation needed |date=October 2019}}; the [[Hausa-Fulani]] of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]], which formed about 65% of the population in the northern part of the territory{{Citation needed |date=October 2019}}; and the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] which formed about 75% of the population in the southwestern part{{Citation needed |date=October 2019}}. Although these groups have their own homelands, by the 1960s, the people were dispersed across Nigeria, with all three ethnic groups represented substantially in major cities. When the war broke out in 1967, there were still 5,000 Igbos in Lagos.<ref>Olawoyin, ''Historical Analysis of Nigeria\u2013Biafra Conflict'' (1971), pp. 32\u201333. \"The Ibo like the Hausa and Yoruba, are found in hundreds in all towns and cities throughout the Federation. Even at the period of the Civil War, they numbered more than five thousand in Lagos alone.\"</ref>\n\nThe semi-[[feudal]] and [[Islamic]] Hausa-Fulani in the North were traditionally ruled by a feudal, conservative Islamic hierarchy consisting of [[Emir]]s who, in turn, owed their allegiance to a supreme [[Sultan]]. This Sultan was regarded as the source of all political power and religious authority.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe Yoruba political system in the southwest, like that of the Hausa-Fulani, also consisted of a series of monarchs, the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]], The Yoruba monarchs, however, were less [[autocratic]] than those in the North.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The political and social system of the Yoruba accordingly allowed for greater [[upward mobility]], based on acquired rather than inherited wealth and title.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn contrast to the two other groups, Igbos and the ethnic groups of the [[Niger Delta]] in the southeast lived mostly in autonomous, democratically organised communities, although there were ''eze'' or monarchs in many of the ancient cities, such as the [[Kingdom of Nri]]. In its zenith the Kingdom controlled most of Igbo land, including influence on the [[Anioma people]], [[Arochukwu]] (which controlled [[slavery]] in Igbo), and [[Onitsha]] land. Unlike the other two regions, decisions within the Igbo communities were made by a general assembly in which men and women participated.<ref>{{Google books |id=Zm7sWUbDWakC |page=25 |title=Ijeaku, Nnamdi }}</ref>\n\nThe differing political systems among these three peoples reflected and produced divergent customs and values. The Hausa-Fulani commoners, having contact with the political system only through a village head designated by the Emir or one of his subordinates, did not view political leaders as amenable to influence. Political decisions were to be submitted to. As with all other [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] religious and political systems, leadership positions were given to persons willing to be subservient and loyal to superiors. A chief function of this political system in this context was to maintain conservative values, which caused many Hausa-Fulani to view economic and social innovation as subversive or sacrilegious.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn contrast to the Hausa-Fulani, the Igbos and other Biafrans often participated directly in the decisions which affected their lives. They had a lively awareness of the political system and regarded it as an instrument for achieving their personal goals. Status was acquired through the ability to arbitrate disputes that might arise in the village, and through acquiring rather than inheriting wealth.<ref>Olawoyin, ''Historical Analysis of Nigeria\u2013Biafra Conflict'' (1971), pp. 34\u201335. \"In principle, authority in the local community was formerly exercised by a body of elders which met in council presided over by the head of the senior lineage and included heads of other lineage and sub-lineage. Councils were concerned mainly with offences, religion and public issues likely to break up the solidarity of the group, village or town. Men of influence, particularly men of wealth, who held titles, and members of local Ozo and Eze lodges, frequently dominated the lineage heads, but there was no formal concentration of authority in a single individual. Among the Ibo, even where there was no title taking, a man of wealth could attain considerable political power, apart from any authority derived from his place in a kinship system. [\u2026] New laws which affected the community required the consent of the community concerned as expressed at a public meeting.\"</ref> The Igbo had been substantially victimized in the Atlantic slave trade; in the year 1790 it was reported that of 20,000 people sold each year from [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], 16,000 were Igbo.<ref>Olawoyin, ''Historical Analysis of Nigeria\u2013Biafra Conflict'' (1971), p. 30. \"Bonny, which became one of the principal slave markets on the coast, was largely peopled by Ibo. In 1790, according to Adams, 16,000 out of the 20,000 slaves sold there annually were Ibos. The last British slaver sailed from Bonny in 1808, though the trade continued until 1841.\"</ref> With their emphasis upon social achievement and political participation, the Igbo adapted to and challenged colonial rule in innovative ways.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nThese tradition-derived differences were perpetuated and perhaps enhanced by the [[Colonial Nigeria|British system of colonial rule in Nigeria]]. In the North, the British found it convenient to [[indirect rule|rule indirectly]] through the Emirs, thus perpetuating rather than changing the indigenous authoritarian political system. Christian [[missionaries]] were excluded from the North, and the area thus remained virtually closed to European [[cultural imperialism]]. By contrast the richest of the Igbo often sent their sons to British universities, thinking to prepare them to work with the British. During the ensuing years, the Northern Emirs maintained their traditional political and religious institutions, while reinforcing their social structure. At the time of independence in 1960, the North was by far the most underdeveloped area in Nigeria. It had an English literacy rate of 2%, as compared to 19.2% in the East (literacy in Ajami (local languages in Arabic script), learned in connection with religious education, was much higher). The West also enjoyed a much higher literacy level, as it was the first part of the country to have contact with western education, and established a free primary education program under the pre-independence Western Regional Government.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Biafra Story'', Frederick Forsyth, Leo Cooper, 2001 {{ISBN|0-85052-854-2}}</ref><ref>Pierri, ''A New Entry into the World Oil Market'' (2013), p. 108. \"The North had developed very differently from the rest of the country, for it lagged far behind the South in terms of European-educated population.

Consequently, the Yoruba were the first group in Nigeria to adopt Western bureaucratic social norms. They made up the first classes of African civil servants, doctors, lawyers, and other technicians and professionals.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn Eastern areas, missionaries were introduced at a later date because of British [[Anglo-Aro War|difficulty in establishing firm control]] over the highly autonomous communities.<ref>Audrey Chapman, \"Civil War in Nigeria,\" ''Midstream'', Feb 1968</ref> However, the Igbo and other Biafran people actively took to Western education, and they overwhelmingly came to adopt Christianity. Population pressure in the Igbo homeland, combined with aspirations for monetary wages, drove thousands of Igbos to other parts of Nigeria in search of work. By the 1960s, Igbo political culture was more unified and the region relatively prosperous, with tradesmen and literate elites active not just in the traditionally Igbo East, but throughout Nigeria.<ref>Oliver, Roland and Atmore, Anthony.

The country was divided in such a way that the North had a slightly higher population than the other two regions combined.

On this basis the Northern Region was allocated a majority of the seats in the Federal Legislature established by the colonial authorities. Within each of the three regions the dominant ethnic groups, the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, respectively formed political parties that were largely regional and based on ethnic allegiances: the [[Northern People's Congress]] (NPC) in the North; the [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] in the West (AG); and the [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC) in the East.

Beginning with the Northern Protectorate, the British implemented a system of [[indirect rule]] of which they exerted influence through alliances with local forces.

Northern leaders, fearful that independence would mean political and economic domination by the more Westernized elites in the South, preferred the perpetuation of British rule. As a condition for accepting independence, they demanded that the country continue to be divided into three regions with the North having a clear majority. Igbo and Yoruba leaders, anxious to obtain an independent country at all costs, accepted the Northern demands.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nHowever, the two Southern regions had significant cultural and ideological differences, leading to discord between the two Southern political parties. Firstly, the AG favored a loose confederacy of regions in the emergent Nigerian nation whereby each region would be in total control of its own distinct territory. The status of Lagos was a sore point for the AG which did not want Lagos, a Yoruba town which was at that time the Federal Capital and seat of national government to be designated as the Capital of Nigeria if it meant loss of Yoruba sovereignty. The AG insisted that Lagos, a Yoruba city situated in Western Nigeria must be completely recognized as a Yoruba town without any loss of identity, control or autonomy by the Yoruba. Contrary to this position, the NCNC was anxious to declare Lagos, by virtue of it being the \"Federal Capital Territory\" as \"no man's land\" - a declaration which as could be expected angered the AG which offered to help fund the development of another territory in Nigeria as \"Federal Capital Territory\" and then threatened secession from Nigeria if it didn't get its way. The threat of secession by the AG was tabled, documented and recorded in numerous constitutional conferences, including the constitutional conference held in London in 1954 with the demand that a right of secession be enshrined in the constitution of the emerging Nigerian nation to allow any part of the emergent nation to opt out of Nigeria, should the need arise.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Separatist Agitations in Nigeria since 1914|first=Tekena N.|last=Tamuno|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=8|issue=4|pages=563\u2013584|doi=10.1017/s0022278x00023909|jstor=159090|year=1970}}</ref> This proposal for inclusion of right of secession by the regions in independent Nigeria by the AG was rejected and resisted by NCNC which vehemently argued for a tightly bound united/unitary structured nation because it viewed the provision of a secession clause as detrimental to the formation of a Unitary Nigerian state. In the face of sustained opposition by the NCNC delegates, later joined by the NPC and backed by threats to view maintenance of the inclusion of secession by the AG as treasonable by the British, the AG was forced to renounce its position of inclusion of the right of secession a part of the Nigerian constitution. Had such a provision been made in the Nigerian constitution, later events which led to the Nigerian/Biafran civil war would have been avoided. The pre-independence alliance between the NCNC and the NPC against the aspirations of the AG would later set the tone for political governance of independent Nigeria by the NCNC/NPC and lead to disaster in later years in Nigeria.<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 3. \"On 31st March 1953, Anthony Enaharo of the Action Group (AG) tabled a motion in the House of Representatives in Lagos which called for independence in 1956.

A Commission led by Jeremy Raisman and [[Ronald Tress]] determined that resource royalties would now enter a \"Distributable Pools Account\" with the money split between different parts of government (50% to region of origin, 20% to federal government, 30% to other regions).<ref>Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), pp. 115\u2013116.</ref> To ensure continuing influence, the British promoted unity in the Northern bloc and discord among and within the two Southern regions.

Most wage earners lived in the Lagos area, and many lived in overcrowded dangerous housing. Labour activity including strikes intensified in 1963, culminating in a nationwide general strike in June 1964. Strikers disobeyed an ultimatum to return to work and at one point were dispersed by riot police. Eventually, they did win wage increases. The strike included people from all ethnic groups.<ref>Diamond, ''Class, Ethnicity and Democracy in Nigeria'' (1988), chapter 6: \"The 1964 General Strike\" (pp. 162\u2013189).</ref> Retired Brigadier General H.

The two major political leaders of the north, the Prime Minister, Sir [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] and the Premier of the northern region, Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]] were executed by Major Nzeogwu. Also murdered was Sir Ahmadu Bello's wife and officers of Northern extraction. The President, Sir [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], an Igbo, was on an extended vacation in the West Indies. He did not return until days after the coup. There was widespread suspicion that the Igbo coup plotters had tipped him and other Igbo leaders off regarding the impending coup. In addition to the killings of the Northern political leaders, the Premier of the Western region, Ladoke Akintola and Yoruba senior military officers were also killed. The coup, also referred to as \"The Coup of the Five Majors\", has been described in some quarters as Nigeria's only revolutionary coup.<ref>Alexander Madiebo (1980) ''The Nigerian Revolution and the Nigerian Civil War''; Fourth Dimension Publishers, Enugu.</ref> This was the first coup in the short life of Nigeria's nascent second democracy.

Some alleged, mostly from Eastern part of Nigeria, that the majors sought to spring Action Group leader [[Obafemi Awolowo]] out of jail and make him head of the new government. Their intention was to dismantle the Northern-dominated power structure but their efforts to take power was unsuccessful. [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], an Igbo and loyalist head of the [[Nigerian Army]], suppressed coup operations in the South and he was declared head of state on 16 January after the surrender of the majors.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\n<blockquote>In the end though, the majors were not in the position to embark on this political goal. While their 15th January coup succeeded in seizing political control in the north, it failed in the south, especially in the Lagos-Ibadan-Abeokuta military district where loyalist troops led by army commander Johnson Aguyi-Ironsi succeeded in crushing the revolt. Apart from Ifeajuna who fled the country after the collapse of their coup, the other two January Majors, and the rest of the military officers involved in the revolt, later surrendered to the loyalist High Command and were subsequently detained as a federal investigation of the event began.</blockquote><ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 52\u201355.</ref><ref>''Nigerian Civil War''; Fourth Dimension Publishers, Enugu.</ref>\n\nAguyi-Ironsi suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament. He then abolished the regional confederated form of government and pursued unitary like policies favoured by the NCNC, having apparently been influenced by some NCNC political philosophy. He, however, appointed Colonel [[Hassan Katsina]], son of [[Katsina]] emir [[Usman Nagogo]], to govern the Northern Region, indicating some willingness to maintain cooperation with this bloc.<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 55. \"But perhaps, most importantly, Aguyi-Ironsi's choice of Colonel Hassan Usman Katsina, the son of the powerful emir of Katsina as the governor of the north, was the clearest signal to the north, and the rest of the country, that his government would not undermine the north's two decades of political hegemony in the federation. Aguyi-Ironsi had already said as much in a number of contacts he made with northern leaders, including the Sultan of Sokoto, soon after the failed majors' coup. Although he had no qualms regarding ignoring the West and leaving in jail the leader of the AG (Obafemi Awolowo), he was anxious to reassure the north of the good intentions of his regime, especially in the light of the deaths of Bello and Balewa during the coup attempt.\"</ref> He also preferentially released northern politicians from jail (enabling them to plan his forthcoming overthrow).<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 55\u201356. \"In fact to underscore Ironsi's goodwill to the north, the new head of state ordered the release of most northern politicians from detention by February (1966), without a reciprocal gesture to their southern counterparts. The released northerners took up positions in the various local government administration in the emirats and, ironically, had ample opportunity to plan and execute the massacre of Igbo civilians living in the north, first in May, 1966, and later in July 1966, which were coupled with the overthrow and murder of Aguyi-Ironsi himself (ironically enough, soon after Aguyi-Ironsi completed a conference with northern emirs), and scores of Igbo military personnel, and the September\u2013October 1966 phase of the pogrom which brought the grisly tally of Igbo killed to 80,000 \u2013 100,000 and the expulsion of 2 million others from the north and elsewhere in the federation.\"</ref> Aguyi-Ironsi rejected a British offer of military support but promised to protect British interests.<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 56. \"Britain had offered to send in troops to support Aguyi-Ironsi and his loyalist forces, after Nzeogwu threatened (on January 16) to march on Lagos and the south, from his Kaduna base, to enforce the control of the January Majors nationwide. While Aguyi-Ironsi discreetly turned down the British offer, he however informed London that its interests in Nigeria, the primary British pre-occupation, would be preserved by his government. This meant that the radical reforms of the Nigerian economy envisaged by the revolting majors, now known by Aguyi-Ironsi and in diplomatic circles in Lagos, would not be implemented. But for the British, the very presence of the Aguyi-Ironsi administration, the fastidious circumstances of its origins notwithstanding, had already breached a cardinal tenet of the post-colonial political order in Nigeria which they had worked so assiduously between 1952\u20131960 to construct: that political leadership within the country to oversee these enormous British interests should come from the north.\"</ref>\n\nIronsi fatally did not bring the failed plotters to trial as required by then-military law and as advised by most northern and western officers, rather, coup plotters were maintained in the military on full pay and some were even promoted while apparently awaiting trial. The coup, despite its failures, was widely seen as primarily benefiting the Igbo peoples as the plotters received no repercussions for their actions and no significant Igbo political leaders were affected. While those that executed the coup were mostly Northern, most of the known plotters were Igbo and the military and political leadership of Western and Northern regions had been largely bloodily eliminated while Eastern military/political leadership was largely untouched. However Ironsi, himself an Igbo, was thought to have made numerous attempts to please Northerners. The other event that also fuelled the so-called \"Igbo conspiracy\" was the killing of Northern leaders, and the killing of the Brigader Ademulegun's pregnant wife by the coup executioners.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nDespite the overwhelming contradictions of the coup being executed by mostly Northern soldiers (such as John Atom Kpera, later military governor of [[Benue State]]), the killing of Igbo soldier Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Unegbe by coup executioners, and Ironsi's termination of an Igbo-led coup, the ease by which Ironsi stopped the coup led to suspicion that the Igbo coup plotters planned all along to pave the way for Ironsi to take the reins of power in Nigeria.<!-- Apparently, Ironsi did succeed in quieting the Western Region, and in the first part of 1966 there were a few months of relatively less violence.<ref>Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 58.</ref> Commenting this out for now pending verification in another source. -->\n\nColonel [[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu|Odumegwu Ojukwu]] became military governor of the Eastern Region at this time.<ref>Pierri, \"A New Entry into the World Oil Market\" (2013), pp. 115.</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" /> On 24 May 1966, the military government issued Unification Decree #34, which would have replaced the federation with a more centralised system. The Northern bloc found this decree intolerable.<ref>Pierri, \"A New Entry into the World Oil Market\" (2013), pp. 115.  \"Instead, many Northerners were alarmed that the military era would lead to an Igbo domination, especially when on May 24, 1966, the government issued Unification Decree No. 34, through which the federation was abolished and replaced with a unitary system. To Northerners this meant nothing but Igbo domination, facing the prospect of being occupied and ruled by Southern military and civil servants and lacking the safeguard of being involved in the government according to ethnic group divisions.\"</ref>\n\nIn the face of provocation from the Eastern media which repeatedly showed humiliating posters and cartoons of the slain northern politicians, on the night of 29 July 1966, northern soldiers at Abeokuta barracks mutinied, thus precipitating [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup|a counter-coup]], which had already been in the planning stages. Ironsi was on a visit to [[Ibadan]] during their mutiny and there he was killed (along with his host, [[Adekunle Fajuyi]]). The counter-coup led to the installation of Lieutenant-Colonel Yakubu Gowon as Supreme Commander of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Gowon was chosen as a compromise candidate. He was a Northerner, a Christian, from a minority tribe, and had a good reputation within the army.<ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nIt seems that Gowon immediately faced not only a potential standoff with the East, but secession threats from the Northern and even the Western region.<ref>Stevenson, \"Capitol Gains\" (2014), pp. 318\u2013319.</ref> The counter-coup plotters had considered using the opportunity to withdraw from the federation themselves. Ambassadors from Britain and the United States, however, urged Gowon to maintain control over the whole country.

The violence reached a climax with the massacres of 29 September 1966 ('Black Thursday'). Ojukwu had to deal with an influx to the east of between 700,000 and two million refugees.

Before, during and after the slaughter, Col. Gowon could be heard over the radio issuing 'guarantees of safety' to all Easterners, all citizens of Nigeria, but the intent of the soldiers, the only power that counts in Nigeria now or then, was painfully clear. After counting the disemboweled bodies along the Makurdi road I was escorted back to the city by soldiers who apologised for the stench and explained politely that they were doing me and the world a great favor by eliminating Igbos.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial Conflict and the Question of Genocide: The Nigeria-Biafra War 1967 - 1970|last=Moses|first=A.

Extensive negotiations took place between Ojukwu, representing Eastern Nigeria, and Gowon, representing the Nigerian Federal military government.

This effectively excised the main oil-producing areas from the core Ibo state (East Central State).

Whether Decree No. 14 was designed to forestall secession (would-be Biafra was now to consist of 3 states instead of the Eastern Region, two of them mischievously emphasising the East's long-contained minorities problem of Ibibio/Efik discontent and Calabar-Ogoja-Rivers separatism, and the third a landlocked, oil-less, overpopulated Ibo enclave) or whether it pushed Ojukwu into the final defiance of declaring a secessionist Republic remains a matter of argument.

[\u2026] Nigeria's secured diplomatic status was also crucial for the most significant development in the war's early stages: the FMG's decision to blockade the secessionist state. To cut off Biafra's lines of communication with the outside world, air and sea ports were blockaded, foreign currency transactions banned, incoming mail and telecommunication blocked and international business obstructed. Even with its limited resources, Nigeria was able to organise a successful blockade without gaping holes or long interruptions--mostly because other governments or companies were ready to acquiesce to Lagos' handling of the matter.\"</ref>\n\nAlthough the very young nation had a chronic shortage of weapons to go to war, it was determined to defend itself. Although there was much sympathy in Europe and elsewhere, only five countries (Tanzania, Gabon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Zambia, and Haiti) officially recognised the new republic. Britain supplied amounts of heavy weapons and ammunition to the Nigerian side because of its desire to preserve the country it had created.

In a bid to control the oil in the eastern region, the Federal government placed a shipping embargo on the territory. This embargo did not involve oil tankers. The leadership of Biafra wrote to Shell-BP demanding royalties for the oil that was being explored in their region. After much deliberation, Shell-BP decided to pay Biafra the sum of 250,000 pounds. The news of this payment reached the Federal government, which immediately extended the shipping embargo to oil tankers. The Nigerian government also made it clear to Shell-BP that it expected the company to pay all outstanding oil royalty immediately. With the stalling on the payment for Biafra government ask Shell-BP to stop operations in Biafra and took over from the company.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|last1=Chibuike|first1=Uche|year=2008|title=Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=49|issue=1|pages=111\u2013135|doi=10.1017/S0021853708003393|jstor=40206616|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/71bab9819e562985ba6befdadee45919e114cca4}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of July 1967, Nigerian federal troops and marines captured [[Bonny Island]] in the Niger Delta, thereby taking control of vital Shell-BP facilities.<ref>Uche, ''Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War'' (2008), p. 131. \"Within a month of full military conflict, the Nigerian government captured the important Island of Bonny from the Biafrans. The British High Commissioner articulated the importance of this capture at the time: 'This not only tightens the grip on the blockade and gives the Federal Government a first footing in the Rivers Province; it places in their hands the most valuable part of Shell-BP installations, for the storage tanks, the pumping station and the tanker terminal are all at Bonny.' At the time of the capture, the Nigerian government claimed that the Island was taken 'without any damage' to Shell-BP's installations there.\"</ref> Operations began again in May 1968, when Nigeria captured [[Port Harcourt]]. Its facilities had been damaged and needed repair.<ref>Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), p. 132. \"Despite the return of Gray, and the interest of Shell-BP and the British government in getting the oil machines pumping again, the state of war and its attendant hazards ensured that this could not happen immediately. It was not until May 1968, when Nigerian marines captured Port Harcourt, that it was adjudged safe by Shell-BP to send an advance team to both Bonny and Port Harcourt to assess the state of their production facilities.\"</ref> Oil production and export continued, but at a lower level. The completion in 1969 of a new terminal at [[For\u00e7ados]] brought production up from 142,000 barrels/day in 1958 to 540,000 barrels/day in 1969. In 1970, this figure doubled to 1,080,000 barrels/day. The royalties enabled Nigeria to buy more weapons, hire mercenaries, etc. Biafra proved unable to compete on this economic level.<ref>Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), pp. 133\u2013134. \"The problem was that the oil had to be shipped through Bonny, which at the time was not safe. Furthermore, silting of the approaches to the Bonny terminal during the early parts of the war reduced its unit tanker capacity from 70,000 tons to about 40,000 tons. Even with the use of smaller tankers, the short haul from Nigeria to Britain was still more profitable than the Cape route used for Gulf oil. Despite the prospects for Eastern Region oil, the civil war made the source unreliable. Luckily for Shell-BP, prior to the war, it had planned a second terminal off Forcados, which was in Federal territory. Construction of the terminal and the pipelines, which started during the war, took 18 months and was completed in the middle of 1969.\"</ref>\n\n===Atrocities against ethnic minorities in Biafra===\nMinorities in Biafra suffered atrocities at the hands of those fighting for both sides of the conflict.

Therefore they placed a high priority on maintenance of oil extraction and refining operations. The war broke out just a week before the Six Day War in the Middle East led to the Suez Canal being blocked, forcing oil tankers from the Middle East to use the long route around the Cape of Good Hope, thereby using the cost of Middle Eastern oil.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.65</ref> In turn, this increased the importance of Nigerian oil to Britain, which was cheaper than oil from the Persian Gulf.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.65</ref> Initially, when it was unclear which side would prevail, Britain took a \"wait and see\" approach before deciding decisively for Nigeria.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.65-66</ref>\u00a0Nigeria had a navy of only 6 vessels, the largest of which was a frigate; an air force of 76 planes, none of which were fighters or bombers; and an army of 7,000 men with no tanks and a shortage of officers with command experience.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.72-73</ref> Through Biafra was likewise similarly weak, the two sides appeared evenly matched at the beginning of the war, and Nigerian victory was by no means considered preordained.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.72-73</ref>\u00a0 \n\nBritain backed the Federal Government but, when the war broke out, cautioned them not to damage British oil installations in the East. These oilworks, under the control of Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company (jointly owned by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[British Petroleum]]), controlled 84% of Nigeria's 580,000 barrels per day. Two-thirds of this oil came from the Eastern region, and another third from the newly created Mid-West region. Two-fifths of all Nigerian oil ended up in Britain.<ref name=\"Uche2008pages120to124\">Uche, ''Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War'' (2008), pp. 120\u2013124.</ref> In 1967, 30% of the oil being imported into Britain came from Nigeria.<ref>Stremlau  ''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.66</ref> \n\nShell-BP therefore considered carefully a request by the Federal Government that it refuse to pay the royalties demanded by Biafra. Its lawyers advised that payment to Biafra would be appropriate if this government did in fact maintain law and order in the region in question. The British government advised that paying Biafra could undermine the goodwill of the Federal Government. Shell-BP made the payment, and the government established a blockade on oil exports.<ref name=\"Uche2008pages120to124\" /> Forced to choose a side, Shell-BP and the British government threw in their lot with the Federal Government in Lagos, apparently calculating that this side would be more likely to win the war.<ref name=\"Uche2008pages125to127\">Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), pp. 125\u2013127. \"The Nigerian government subsequently made it explicit to Shell-BP that it expected the company to pay the outstanding oil royalty immediately. Once the oil flow stopped, sitting on a fence ceased to be an option for the British government. Britain subsequently decided to back Nigeria, partly because it was advised that, in the event of war, the odds were 'slightly in favour of the Federal Military Government'. Perhaps more importantly, the British government calculated that supporting Nigeria was its safest option if it were to preserve its oil interests in the country, largely because the Cold War and the rivalry among some Western European states made it likely that other foreign powers would wade into the conflict.\"</ref> As the British High Commissioner in Lagos wrote to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs on 27 July 1967:\n\n<blockquote>Ojukwu, even victorious, will not be in a strong position. He will require all the international help and recognition he can get. The Federal Government would be much better placed both internationally and internally. They would have a cast iron case for the severest treatment of a company which has subsidised a rebel, and I feel fairly convinced they would press their case to the lengths of cancelling the Company's concessions and nationalising their installations. I conclude, therefore, if the company does change its mind and asks the British Government for advice, the best that could be given is for it to clamber hastily back on the Lagos side of the fence with cheque book at the ready.\"<ref name=\"Uche2008pages125to127\" /></blockquote>\n\nShell-BP took this advice.<ref name=\"Uche2008pages125to127\" /> It continued to quietly support Nigeria through the rest of the war, in one case advancing a royalty of \u00a35.5 million to fund the purchase of more British weapons.<ref>Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), p. 132. \"Given Shell-BP's interest in Nigeria taking over the major oilfields still in Biafran hands, it was not surprising that they overtly supported the Nigerian military cause.99 A case in point was in December 1967 when the Nigerian government, frustrated by the slow pace of progress in the war, requested that Shell-BP pay its royalty of \u00a35.5 million in advance, in order to enable it to purchase arms from Britain. Shell-BP promptly complied.\"</ref>\n\nIt was not until Federal forces captured the ocean oil terminal at Bonny on 25 July 1967 that the British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] decided to back Nigeria with military aid.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.76</ref> After the Federal victory at Bonny, Wilson summoned  [[David Hunt (diplomat)|David Hunt ]], the British high commissioner to Nigeria, for a meeting at 10 Downing Street in early August 1967 for his assessment of the situation.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.76</ref> Hunt's view that the Federal forces were the better organised and would win because they could draw upon a greater population led Wilson to side with Nigeria.\n\nDuring the war, Britain covertly supplied Nigeria with weapons and military intelligence and may have also helped it to hire mercenaries.<ref>Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), p. 130. \"In reality, however, the British government supplied many more arms than it was publicly prepared to admit. Apart from direct arms supplies, it provided military intelligence to the Nigerian government and may have helped it to access sophisticated arms and mercenaries through third parties.\"</ref> After the decision was made to back Nigeria, the BBC oriented its reporting to favour this side.<ref>Uche, \"Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War\" (2008), p. 131. \"Furthermore, once the war broke out and the British government decided to back the Nigerian side, the BBC swiftly shifted its reporting on the conflict, in Nigeria's favour.

At the same time it was well known that France was supporting Biafran leader General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu with covert military aid throughout the war, including mercenaries and weapons.\"</ref> Through Pierre Laureys, France had apparently provided two B-26s, Alouette helicopters, and pilots.<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 119. Foccart says de Gaulle's decision to send military assistance to Biafra was made on 27 September 1967, when the General met personally with Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, who was Biafra's most important African ally throughout the war. On 26 September, the Biafran capital, Enugu, was shelled for the first time by Federal Nigerian forces. The problem with this date is that it appears that France had already supplied Biafra with two B-26 aircraft, Alouette helicopters and pilots in summer 1967 via the French arms dealer Pierre Laureys. In 1971, however, Ralph Uwechue, Biafra's envoy to France, wrote that \"the helicopters had been purchases made by the Eastern Nigerian Regional Government from France for civilian purposes well before the war.\"</ref> France supplied Biafra with captured German and Italian weapons from World War II, sans serial numbers, delivered as part of regular shipments to [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), p. 122. \"De Gaulle made the decision to begin regular French arms shipments to Biafra on 17 or 18 October 1967. De Gaulle was very reluctant to send weapons from French stocks, and only agreed when Foccart suggested sending captured German and Italian weapons from World War II with the serial number scratched off. The weapons would not be sent directly to Ojukwu, but would go through Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, so that it looked like France was replenishing the Ivory Coast's stocks as stipulated in the normal bilateral military assistance agreements.\"</ref> France also sold [[Panhard]] armoured vehicles to the Nigerian federal government.<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), pp. 179. \"France, too, pursued contradictory policies, selling Nigeria Panhard light armoured cars and halting all arms transfers to Lagos only later that year, by which time it was supplying the Biafrans via the Ivory Coast and Gabon. Clapham notes that France's military aid to Biafra prolonged the war for about eighteen months.\"</ref>\n\nFrench involvement in the war can be viewed in the context of its geopolitical strategy (''[[Fran\u00e7afrique]]'') and competition with the British in West Africa. Nigeria represented a base of British influence in the predominantly French-aligned area. France and Portugal used nearby countries in their sphere of influence, especially C\u00f4te d'Ivoire under President [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny]], as waystations for shipments to Biafra.<ref name=\"Olawoyin1971pages137to139\" /><ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015)</ref> To some extent, also, France repeated its earlier policy from the [[Congo Crisis]], when it supported the secession of the southern mining province [[State of Katanga|Katanga]].<ref>Griffin, \"French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War\" (2015), pp. 116\u2013 117. \"The Katanga secession (1960\u20131963) was in many ways a precursor to the Biafran War for France. French mercenaries went to Katanga to support the Belgian intervention. The Belgians were helping Tshomb\u00e9 fight Congolese forces loyal to Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, who was supported by the Soviet Union. [\u2026] The Katangan secession was ultimately unsuccessful, and thus it is a surprise that de Gaulle's government would support another secession in Biafra four years later. A number of other countries also drew a link between the two conflicts, and Ojukwu released a statement on 11 January 1969 called 'Biafra: the antithesis of Katanga', to reassure foreign powers. [\u2026] Katanga gave France experience in using mercenaries to fight a war in which the consequences of failure were minimal.\"</ref>\n\nEconomically, France gained incentives through oil drilling contracts for the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Fran\u00e7aise de Recherches et d'Exploitation de P\u00e9troli\u00e8res'' (SAFRAP), apparently arranged with Eastern Nigeria in advance of its secession from the Nigerian Federation.<ref>Griffin, ''French Military Policy in the Nigerian Civil War'' (2015), p. 118. \"Nigeria, however, was very important for France due to its size as well as the oil in the Niger River Delta. France had no diplomatic relations with Nigeria after 1960, as Nigeria expelled the French ambassador, Raymond Offroy, following the third French nuclear test in Algeria on 27 December. The severing of diplomatic relations did not halt commercial relations between the two countries, and in 1964, the French national oil company, SAFRAP, was given the rights to search for oil in parts of Eastern Nigeria that would later declare independence under the name of Biafra.\"</ref><ref name=\"Olawoyin1971pages135to136\">Olawoyin, \"Historical Analysis of Nigeria\u2013Biafra Conflict\" (1971), pp. 135\u2013136. \"The French policy may be described as anti-British, anti-Nigerian and pr-Biafra.

Although France has leaned toward Biafra, SAFRAP has vast exploration rights in the Northern Region; this might have prevented France giving Biafra political recognition. [\u2026] The highlight of increasing world sympathy for Ojukwu was also motivated by the declaration by the French government that it endorsed the principle of Biafra's right to self-determination.

Portugal also provided weapons to Biafra, as did Czechoslovakia, until the Soviet invasion in 1968. The Biafrans set up an office in Paris called the 'Biafran Historical Research Centre', which was Ojukwu's contact point with Mauricheau-Beupr\u00e9, Falques and Denard. The Centre allowed Ojukwu to purchase arms directly from European arms dealers. Denard would purchase arms from Czechoslovakia and ship them by sea to Biafra via Libreville.

The campaign was coordinated at the highest levels of government, and the French Foreign Ministry files make it clear that the French television service and the French Red Cross were required to get governmental approval to ask for funds. The French public eventually contributed 12,600,000 francs.

Nigeria's need for more aircraft, which Britain and the United States refused to sell, led Gowon to accept a Soviet offer in the summer of 1967 to sell a squadron of 17 MIG-17 fighters.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.79</ref> The British-trained Nigerian military tended to be distrustful of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet ambassador in Lagos, Alexander Romanov, a gregarious and friendly man as well as a skewed  diplomat  established an excellent rapport with Gowon and persuaded him that accepting Soviet weapons would not mean subjection to the Soviet Union.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.79-80</ref> The first MIG-17s arrived in Nigeria in August 1967 together with some about 200 Soviet technicians to train the Nigerians in their use.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.80</ref> Through the MIG-17s turned out to be too sophisticated for the Nigerians to use properly, requiring Egyptian Air Force pilots to fly them, but the Soviet-Nigerian arms deal turned out to be one of the turning points of the war.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.80</ref> Besides establishing an arms pipeline from the Soviet Union to Nigeria, the possibility that the Soviet Union would gain greater influence in Nigeria led Britain to increase its supply of arms to maintain its influence in Lagos while ruling out the possibility of either the United States or Britain either recognizing Biafra.<ref>Stremlau \u00a0''The International Politics of the Nigerian Civil War, 1967-1970'' (2015) p.80</ref> \u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nThe Soviet Union consistently supplied Nigeria with weapons, with the diplomatic disclaimer that these were \"strictly for cash on a commercial basis\". In 1968, the USSR agreed to finance the [[Kainji Dam]] on the Niger (somewhat upriver from the Delta). Soviet media outlets initially accused the British of cynically supporting the Biafran secession, then had to adjust these claims later when it turned out that Britain was in fact supporting the Federal Government.<ref name=\"Stent1973\">[[Angela Stent]], \"The Soviet Union and the Nigerian Civil War: A Triumph of Realism\", ''Issue: A Journal of Opinion'' 3.2, Summer 1973.</ref>\n\nOne explanation for Soviet sympathy with the Federal Military Government was a shared opposition to internal secessionist movements. Before the war, the Soviets had seemed sympathetic to the Igbos. But Soviet Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin stated to their chagrin in October 1967 that \"the Soviet people fully understand\" Nigeria's motives and its need \"to prevent the country from being dismembered.\"<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), p. 273. \"From 1967 to 1970, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Poland sold Nigeria twelve L-29 Delfin training aircraft, forty-seven MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighter jets, and five Ilyushin-28 bombers, two of which Egypt transferred to Lagos. This constituted a virtual about-face in Soviet policy, because, until the secession, Moscow had evinced both admiration of the Igbos and sympathy for their plight. The Soviet Union chose pragmatism, in the form of alignment with federal Nigeria, over the ideological (if not idealist) alternative of support for Biafra.\"</ref>\n\nReportedly, the war substantially improved Soviet-Nigerian diplomatic and trade relations, and [[Moskvitch]] cars began to make appearances around Lagos.

Nigeria and Israel established a linkage in 1957. In 1960 Britain allowed the creation of an Israeli diplomatic mission in Lagos, and Israel made a $10 million loan to the Nigerian government. Israel also developed a cultural relation with the Igbos based on possible shared traditions. These moves represented a significant diplomatic success given the Muslim orientation of the northern-dominated government. Some northern leaders disapproved of contact with Israel and banned Israelis from [[Maiduguri]] and [[Sokoto]].<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), pp. 264\u2013265. \"Israel was certain that Nigeria, the most populous country on the continent (fifty- five million in 1960) and rich in oil, would have a great influence on African poli- tics. The Israeli foreign ministry was determined to establish full diplomatic relations upon that colony's receipt of independence (1 October 1960). Ehud Avriel, ambassador to Ghana and a close confidant of both Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Foreign Minister Golda Meir, cautioned that were Israel to fail to establish ties with Nigeria, \u2018all of our work in West Africa will have come to naught\u2019.\"</ref>\n\nIsrael did not begin arms sales to Nigeria until after Aguyi-Ironsi came to power on January 17, 1966.

The Knesset publicly debated this issue on 17 and 22 July 1968, winning applause from the press for its sensitivity. Right-wing and left-wing political groups, and student activists, spoke for Biafra.<ref>Levey, \"Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war\" (2014), pp. 270\u2013271. \"Uri Avneri of ''HaOlam HaZeh\u2014Koach Hadash'' ('This World\u2014New Force', a far left-wing faction) called for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Biafra, while Aryeh Ben-Eliezer, of the right-wing herut party, lambasted Egyptian and Soviet support of Nigeria.

The secessionist state was turned into a landlocked enclave. With federal forces tightening the noose around the secessionist territory, the shrinking Biafran enclave soon encompassed only the heart of Igboland. At the same time, this territory had to absorb increasing numbers of people fleeing federal offensives. After a year of fighting, the rump state was overpopulated, its people impoverished, lacking supplies, food and medicine.\"</ref>\n\nThe Biafran government reported that Nigeria was using hunger and genocide to win the war, and sought aid from the outside world. Private groups in the US, led by Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], responded. No one was ever held responsible for these killings.\n\nIn September 1968, the federal army planned what Gowon described as the \"final offensive.\" Initially the final offensive was neutralised by Biafran troops by the end of the year after several Nigerian troops were routed in Biafran ambushes. In the latter stages, a Southern FMG offensive managed to break through. However in 1969, the Biafrans launched several offensives against the Nigerians in their attempts to keep the Nigerians off-balance starting in March when the 14th Division of the Biafran army recaptured [[Owerri]] and moved towards Port Harcourt, but were halted just north of the city. In May 1969, Biafran commandos recaptured oil wells in Kwale. In July 1969, Biafran forces launched a major land offensive supported by foreign [[mercenary]] pilots continuing to fly in food, medical supplies and weapons. Most notable of the mercenaries was Swedish Count [[Carl Gustav von Rosen]] who led air attacks with five [[Malm\u00f6 MFI-9]] MiniCOIN small piston-engined aircraft, armed with rocket pods and machine guns. His Biafran Air Force consisted of three Swedes: von Rosen, Gunnar Haglund and Martin Lang. The other two pilots were Biafrans: Willy Murray-Bruce and Augustus Opke. From 22 May to 8 July 1969 von Rosen's small force attacked Nigerian military airfields in Port Harcourt, Enugu, Benin City and Ughelli, destroying or damaging a number of Nigerian Air Force jets used to attack relief flights, including a few Mig-17's and three of Nigeria's six Ilyushin Il-28 bombers that were used to bomb Biafran villages and farms on a daily basis. Although the Biafran offensives of 1969 were a tactical success, the Nigerians soon recovered. The Biafran air attacks did disrupt the combat operations of the Nigerian Air Force, but only for a few months.[[File:Malm\u00f6 MFI-9 Biafra Baby two-view silhouette.svg|thumb|Malm\u00f6 MFI-9 Biafra Baby two-view silhouette]]\n\nIn response to the Nigerian government using foreigners to lead some advances, the Biafran government also began hiring foreign [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to extend the war.<ref name=\"Mercs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mercenary-wars.net/biafra/|title=The Biafran conflict in 1966.|access-date=12 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112190931/http://www.mercenary-wars.net/biafra/|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Only German born [[Rolf Steiner]] a Lt.

With this method many tons of food were dropped to many Biafrans who would otherwise have died of starvation.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[Bernard Kouchner]] was one of a number of French doctors who volunteered with the [[French Red Cross]] to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra. The Red Cross required volunteers to sign an agreement, which was seen by some (like Kouchner and his supporters) as being similar to a [[gag order]], that was designed to maintain the organisation's neutrality, whatever the circumstances. Kouchner and the other French doctors signed this agreement.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nAfter entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army, and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.

This analogy originated in ethnological genealogies that cast the Igbos as the 'Jews of Africa', even as one of Israel's 'lost tribes'. The Biafran leadership drew on this representation that many eastern Nigerians had adopted as their self-perception. This analogy, combined with the genocide charge, was used by the leadership to secure the support of the population, and to build loyalty to Biafra by emphasising the threat from a common enemy. The 'Jews of Africa' envisioned their state like an 'African Israel', a new nation born of genocidal violence. / Soon, the growing cast of Biafra's supporters around the globe adopted this rhetoric, further elaborating it in the process.

When the Biafran crisis erupted, it offered an opportunity to renew this emphasis on the country's responsibilities [\u2026] On the surface, the Irish response to Biafra was built on something very different to the British: a shared religion (Catholicism), a common colonial experience and a narrative of humanitarian disaster.

It was Britain's 'punishment' of the Igbo for its audacious lead of the struggle for the freeing of Nigeria from British occupation that began in the 1930s. Twice during that struggle, the occupation regime had casually watched two organised pogroms against the Igbo in north Nigeria \u2013 in 1945 and 1953. These murders, which also included the looting and destruction of tens of thousands of pounds worth of Igbo property and businesses, were carried out by pro-British political forces in the region who were opposed to the restoration of African independence but who Britain would hand over supreme political power of the country to on the eve of its so-called departure from Nigeria in 1960. The pogroms were clearly dress rehearsals for subsequent genocide. / Without British complicity, it was highly unlikely that the Igbo genocide would have been embarked on in its initial phase by the Nigerian state with such unrelenting stretch and consequences between May and October 1966. Without the massive arms support that Nigeria received from Britain especially, it was highly improbably the Nigeria would have been in the military position to pursue its second phase of the genocide\u2013namely, the invasion of Igboland \u2013 between July 1967 and January 1970. Harold Wilson, the British prime minister at the time, was adamant, as the slaughtering worsened, that he 'would accept' the death of 'a half a million' Igbo 'if that was what it took' the Nigerian genocidists on the ground to accomplish their ghastly mission (Morris, 1977:122).\" See also: Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe, \"[http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category.php/comment/88468 Britain and the Igbo genocide: Now for the pertinent questions]\", ''Pambazuka News'', 30 July 2013.</ref>\n\nAnother reference to the war's consideration as a Genocide would be to Bruce Mayrock.<ref name=\"Columbia University Libraries1969\">GS Student immolates self in front of U.N.

Members of the youth's family stated Friday that he had worked actively to protest the war in Biafra, writing letters about the war to the President and leading government figures.

Accusations were made of Nigerian government officials diverting resources meant for reconstruction in the former Biafran areas to their ethnic areas. Military government continued in power in Nigeria for many years, and people in the oil-producing areas claimed they were being denied a fair share of oil revenues.<ref>With reason. The pre-1966 tax-sharing agreements on mineral wealth were changed to okay favour the Federal government at the expense of the state. This agreement has, in the 1980s, been modified to further favour the Federal government.</ref> Laws were passed mandating that political parties could not be ethnically or tribally based; however, it has been hard to make this work in practice.\n\nIgbos who ran for their lives during the pogroms and war returned to find their positions had been taken over; and when the war was over the government did not feel any need to re-instate them, preferring to regard them as having resigned. This reasoning was also extended to Igbo-owned properties and houses. People from other regions were quick to take over any house owned by an Igbo, especially in the Port Harcourt area. The Nigerian Government justified this by terming such properties abandoned. This, however, has led to a feeling of an injustice as the Nigerian government policies were seen as further economically disabling the Igbos even long after the war. Further feelings of injustice were caused by Nigeria changing its currency, so that Biafran supplies of pre-war Nigerian currency were no longer honoured. At the end of the war, only N\u00a320 was given to any easterner regardless of the amount of money he or she had had in the bank. This was applied irrespective of their banking in pre-war Nigerian currency or Biafran currency.

Now there are almost 160 other varieties in Australia's vineyards. \n\nSome are planted only in small quantities and are being used by winemakers for specialised products.<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia's rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> Others are experiencing an ever-increasing demand either for use in the blending process or as wines carrying their names on the labels.

''Vines, Grapes & Wines: A wine drinker's guide to grape varieties.'' Mitchell Beazley, 1986. p. 50. {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Implications of road transport===\nAlthough there are some winemakers who use only grapes grown in their own vineyards, not all winegrowers are winemakers, and the opposite is also true. This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product. As a result, the column headed \"Location - Growers and Makers\" contains both.\n\n==Government rules and regulations==\nThe wine industry operates under the ''Wine Australia Act 2013''<ref name=WineAct>''Wine Australia Act 2013.''

Now there are almost 160 other varieties in Australia's vineyards. \n\nSome are planted only in small quantities and are being used by winemakers for specialised products.<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia's rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> Others are experiencing an ever-increasing demand either for use in the blending process or as wines carrying their names on the labels.

Mitchell Beazley, 1986. p. 50. {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Implications of road transport===\nAlthough there are some winemakers who use only grapes grown in their own vineyards, not all winegrowers are winemakers, and the opposite is also true. This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product. As a result, the column headed \"Location - Growers and Makers\" contains both.\n\n==Government rules and regulations==\nThe wine industry operates under the ''Wine Australia Act 2013''<ref name=WineAct>''Wine Australia Act 2013.''

In 1995, Lucas appeared in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''. He went on to star with them in ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]''. He quickly rose to fame as George Dawes, the giant baby, who would deliver a string of meaningless gags (often in character) and insults before delivering the score, while sitting at and playing a drum kit, often dressed in an adult-sized [[romper suit]]. He also appeared on occasion as [[Marjorie Dawes]], George's mother, who also appears in ''[[Little Britain]]''.\n\nHe again appeared with Reeves & Mortimer in the BBC series ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|Randall & Hopkirk]]'', and ''[[Catterick (TV series)|Catterick]]'' in a variety of roles. In 1999, Lucas paired with [[David Walliams]], with whom he had already worked in both ''[[Mash and Peas]]'' and ''[[Sir Bernard's Stately Homes]]'', to create ''[[Rock Profile]]'', a comedy show that spoofed famous musicians and musical personalities. It is notable for being one of their first comedic collaborations. Lucas has also written for actor [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nHis music video appearances include the [[Damien Hirst]]-directed video for [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\", \"Jesusland\" by [[Ben Folds]] in 2005, \"[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]\" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] and \"[[Vindaloo (song)|Vindaloo]]\" by [[Fat Les]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nLucas ventured into the world of stage musicals in 2002, when he took a role in [[Boy George]]'s musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' at The Venue, London. He played the performance artist [[Leigh Bowery]].\n\n===''Little Britain''===\n''[[Little Britain]]'' is Lucas's most commercially successful work. The show came about when trainee BBC radio producer, [[Ashley Blaker]], tasked with coming up with ideas for a TV or radio series, bumped into Lucas in London.<ref name=\"jc\">[https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/comedian-ashley-blaker-my-unorthodox-life-in-little-britain-1.59969] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The two were old friends from Haberdashers' and Lucas took Blaker to the [[Groucho Club]], where he told Blaker of his ideas for a sketch show. Little Britain was launched as a radio show on [[BBC Radio 4]] and it later became a TV series. Among the many characters he plays in the series, which he writes and acts in along with David Walliams, are apparently \"disabled\" [[Andy Pipkin]], teenage Bristol [[chav]] [[Vicky Pollard]], [[homophobic]] homosexual [[Daffyd Thomas]], and insensitive slimming club organiser [[Marjorie Dawes]]. In January 2005 Lucas and Walliams were named the [[Radio Times's Most Powerful People in TV Comedy|most powerful people in TV comedy]] by ''[[Radio Times]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Methven|first1=Nicola|date=11 January 2005|title=Lucas & Walliams 'funniest'|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lucas+%26+Walliams+%27funniest%27-a0126878529|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=MGN Ltd.|access-date=13 September 2017|via=The Free Library}}</ref>\n\n===After ''Little Britain''===\nIn 2005, he took his first role in a television drama, a supporting part as a [[Venice|Venetian]] duke in the BBC historical serial ''[[Casanova (2005 TV serial)|Casanova]]'', written by [[Russell T Davies]]. Also in 2005, he did voice work in the ITV children's program ''[[King Arthur's Disasters]]'' alongside [[Rik Mayall]].

The show saw Walliams and Lucas each playing multiple characters but, unlike ''Little Britain'', it focused entirely on the working environment of the airline industry. In an interview shown on BBC 3 on 9 February 2011, it was stated that the creators considered bringing travel agent character Carol Beer from ''Little Britain'' to the new series, but decided against it, as they did not want viewers to see the new show as merely a spinoff. Instead, all new characters were introduced.\n\nOn 28 March 2012, Lucas appeared as the \"Generation X\" guest on the Australian game show ''[[Talkin' 'Bout Your Generation]]''. On 10 April 2012, Lucas's own BBC One show ''The Matt Lucas Awards'' began.

In 1995, Lucas appeared in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''. He went on to star with them in ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]''. He quickly rose to fame as George Dawes, the giant baby, who would deliver a string of meaningless gags (often in character) and insults before delivering the score, while sitting at and playing a drum kit, often dressed in an adult-sized [[romper suit]]. He also appeared on occasion as [[Marjorie Dawes]], George's mother, who also appears in ''[[Little Britain]]''.\n\nHe again appeared with Reeves & Mortimer in the BBC series ''[[Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000 TV series)|Randall & Hopkirk]]'', and ''[[Catterick (TV series)|Catterick]]'' in a variety of roles. In 1999, Lucas paired with [[David Walliams]], with whom he had already worked in both ''[[Mash and Peas]]'' and ''[[Sir Bernard's Stately Homes]]'', to create ''[[Rock Profile]]'', a comedy show that spoofed famous musicians and musical personalities. It is notable for being one of their first comedic collaborations. Lucas has also written for actor [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nHis music video appearances include the [[Damien Hirst]]-directed video for [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Country House (song)|Country House]]\", \"Jesusland\" by [[Ben Folds]] in 2005, \"[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]\" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] and \"[[Vindaloo (song)|Vindaloo]]\" by [[Fat Les]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nLucas ventured into the world of stage musicals in 2002, when he took a role in [[Boy George]]'s musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'' at The Venue, London. He played the performance artist [[Leigh Bowery]].\n\n===''Little Britain''===\n''[[Little Britain]]'' is Lucas's most commercially successful work. The show came about when trainee BBC radio producer, [[Ashley Blaker]], tasked with coming up with ideas for a TV or radio series, bumped into Lucas in London.<ref name=\"jc\">[https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/comedian-ashley-blaker-my-unorthodox-life-in-little-britain-1.59969] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref> The two were old friends from Haberdashers' and Lucas took Blaker to the [[Groucho Club]], where he told Blaker of his ideas for a sketch show. Little Britain was launched as a radio show on [[BBC Radio 4]] and it later became a TV series. Among the many characters he plays in the series, which he writes and acts in along with David Walliams, are apparently \"disabled\" [[Andy Pipkin]], teenage Bristol [[chav]] [[Vicky Pollard]], [[homophobic]] homosexual [[Daffyd Thomas]], and insensitive slimming club organiser [[Marjorie Dawes]].

The show saw Walliams and Lucas each playing multiple characters but, unlike ''Little Britain'', it focused entirely on the working environment of the airline industry. In an interview shown on BBC 3 on 9 February 2011, it was stated that the creators considered bringing travel agent character Carol Beer from ''Little Britain'' to the new series, but decided against it, as they did not want viewers to see the new show as merely a spinoff.

{"title_page": "List of premiers of China", "text_new": "{{Short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n\nThis is a '''list of the Premiers of China''' from 1911\u20131912 during the [[Qing dynasty]], 1912 onwards of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] and 1949 onwards of the [[China|People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe first recorded instance of a monarch of China appointing a chief minister was in around 1130 BC, by [[Tang of Shang|King Tang]] of the [[Shang dynasty]]. Since then, almost every monarch in China appointed a chief minister to help him or her to run the administration. This role has been known by several different names, most commonly [[Grand chancellor (China)|Chancellor]]. With the unification of China under the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] of the [[Qin dynasty]] in 221 BC, the power in the premiers' hands was reduced because of the Emperors' intentions of setting up an absolute monarchy. In 1380, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] ordered the death of his Chancellor, and did not appoint another in his lifetime. From then until 1911, a number of people formally shared the responsibility of chief minister to the Emperor. Even when one of them dominated government, such as in the case of [[Li Hongzhang]], they were nevertheless formally just one of several ministers of equal status. During much of the [[Qing dynasty]], for example, the traditional role of the Chancellor was performed collectively by the [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]].\n\nIn mid 1911, the modern position of [[Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet|Premier]] was created, when the Qing Imperial Government created the \"Princes' Cabinet\" as a reform of Chinese politics, shortly before it was overthrown. When [[Yuan Shikai]] took over the premiership, the premiers of China played an influential role in Chinese politics.\n\nThe list below shows premiers of China during the Qing dynasty. Multiple terms in office, consecutive or otherwise, are listed. The first column shows the consecutively numbered term of the premier, while the second column shows his or her chronological position amongst individual premiers.\n\nFor the modern-day positions referred to as Premiers of China, see:\n*{{flagicon|ROC}} [[List of premiers of the Republic of China|List of premiers of the Republic of China (Presidents of Executive Yuan)]] \u2013 since 1912\n*{{flagicon|PRC}} [[List of premiers of the People's Republic of China|List of premiers of the People's Republic of China (Premiers of State Council)]] \u2013 since 1949\n\n==List of Prime Ministers of Qing Imperial Government (1911\u201312)==\nThe Qing Imperial Government created the \"[[Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet|Imperial Family Cabinet]]\" in May 1911, in order to appease popular anger and calls for reform. But the formation of Cabinet brought even more disaffection. Soon the [[Wuchang Uprising]] forced the Qing government to abolish the cabinet, and instead summon [[Yuan Shikai]] to head the government. The imperial government [[Xinhai Revolution|collapsed]] soon afterward.\n\n[[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]] briefly held the post during his brief [[Manchu Restoration|attempt]] to restore the [[Qing dynasty]] in July 1917.\n{{hidden begin\n|title = List of Prime Ministers of Qing Imperial Government\n|titlestyle = background: lightgrey; text-align:center;\n}}\n{{legend2|{{Non-partisan/meta/color}}|Non-Partisan|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#CD853F|[[Beiyang clique]], etc.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Prime Ministers of Qing Imperial Government\n* period: 8 May 1911 \u2013 10 March 1912\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|--\n!

Since then, almost every monarch in China appointed a chief minister to help him or her to run the administration. This role has been known by several different names, most commonly [[Grand chancellor (China)|Chancellor]]. With the unification of China under the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] of the [[Qin dynasty]] in 221 BC, the power in the premiers' hands was reduced because of the Emperors' intentions of setting up an absolute monarchy. In 1380, the [[Hongwu Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] ordered the death of his Chancellor, and did not appoint another in his lifetime. From then until 1911, a number of people formally shared the responsibility of chief minister to the Emperor. Even when one of them dominated government, such as in the case of [[Li Hongzhang]], they were nevertheless formally just one of several ministers of equal status. During much of the [[Qing dynasty]], for example, the traditional role of the Chancellor was performed collectively by the [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]].\n\nIn mid 1911, the modern position of [[Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet|Premier]] was created, when the Qing Imperial Government created the \"Princes' Cabinet\" as a reform of Chinese politics, shortly before it was overthrown. When [[Yuan Shikai]] took over the premiership, the premiers of China played an influential role in Chinese politics.\n\nThe list below shows premiers of China during the Qing dynasty. Multiple terms in office, consecutive or otherwise, are listed. The first column shows the consecutively numbered term of the premier, while the second column shows his or her chronological position amongst individual premiers.\n\nFor the modern-day positions referred to as Premiers of China, see:\n*{{flagicon|ROC}} [[List of premiers of the Republic of China|List of premiers of the Republic of China (Presidents of Executive Yuan)]] (since 1912)\n*{{flagicon|PRC}} [[List of premiers of the People's Republic of China|List of premiers of the People's Republic of China (Premiers of State Council)]] (since 1949)\n\n==List of Prime Ministers of Qing Imperial Government (1911\u201312)==\nThe Qing Imperial Government created the \"[[Prime Minister of the Imperial Cabinet|Imperial Family Cabinet]]\" in May 1911, in order to appease popular anger and calls for reform. But the formation of Cabinet brought even more disaffection. Soon the [[Wuchang Uprising]] forced the Qing government to abolish the cabinet, and instead summon [[Yuan Shikai]] to head the government. The imperial government [[Xinhai Revolution|collapsed]] soon afterward.\n\n[[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]] briefly held the post during his brief [[Manchu Restoration|attempt]] to restore the [[Qing dynasty]] in July 1917.\n{{hidden begin\n|title = List of Prime Ministers of Qing Imperial Government\n|titlestyle = background: lightgrey; text-align:center;\n}}\n{{legend2|{{Non-partisan/meta/color}}|Non-Partisan|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#CD853F|[[Beiyang clique]], etc.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;Prime Ministers of Qing Imperial Government\n* period: 8 May 1911 \u2013 10 March 1912\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|--\n!

He passed and was awarded a \u00a370 scholarship, but this fell short of the amount of money required to live and study at Cambridge. Despite his having graduated with a [[first class honours]] Bachelor of Science degree in engineering, the economic climate of the [[Post\u2013World War I recession|post-war depression]] was such that he was unable to find work as an engineer. Instead, he took up an offer to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics at the University of Bristol free of charge. He was permitted to skip the first year of the course owing to his engineering degree.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=46\u201347}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Dirac graduated, once again with first class honours, and received a \u00a3140 scholarship from the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]].<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=53}}</ref> Along with his \u00a370 scholarship from St John's College, this was enough to live at Cambridge.

Paul and Margit Dirac had two children together, both daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Florence Monica.\n\nMargit, known as Manci, visited her brother in 1934 in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], from her native Hungary and, while at dinner at the Annex Restaurant, met the \"lonely-looking man at the next table\". This account from a Korean physicist, Y. S. Kim, who met and was influenced by Dirac, also says: \"It is quite fortunate for the physics community that Manci took good care of our respected Paul A. M. Dirac. Dirac published eleven papers during the period 1939\u201346....

Heisenberg was a ladies' man who constantly flirted and danced, while Dirac\u2014'an Edwardian geek', as biographer [[Graham Farmelo]] puts it\u2014suffered agonies if forced into any kind of socialising or small talk. 'Why do you dance?' Dirac asked his companion. 'When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure,' Heisenberg replied.

He called the equation for the [[time evolution]] of a quantum-mechanical operator, which he was the first to write down, the \"Heisenberg equation of motion\". Most physicists speak of [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] for half-integer-spin particles and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] for integer-spin particles. While lecturing later in life, Dirac always insisted on calling the former \"Fermi statistics\". He referred to the latter as \"Einstein statistics\" for reasons, he explained, of \"symmetry\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mehra|first1=Jagdish|last2=Rechenberg|first2=Helmut|title=The Historical Development of Quantum Theory|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9780387951805|page=746|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-pL56OcVubgC&pg=PA746&lpg=PA746&dq=Paul+Dirac+Einstein+statistics+Symmetry#v=onepage&q=Paul%20Dirac%20Einstein%20statistics%20Symmetry&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Religious views===\nHeisenberg recollected a conversation among young participants at the 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] about Einstein and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s views on religion between [[Wolfgang Pauli]], Heisenberg and Dirac. Dirac's contribution was a criticism of the political purpose of religion, which Bohr regarded as quite lucid when hearing it from Heisenberg later.<ref>[[Abraham Pais|Pais, A.]], ''Niels Bohr's Times: In Physics, Philosophy, and Polity'' (Oxford: [[Oxford_University_Press#Clarendon_Press|Clarendon Press]], 1991), [https://archive.org/details/nielsbohrstimesi0000pais/page/320 p. 320].</ref>{{rp|320}} Among other things, Dirac said:\n<blockquote>I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest\u2014and scientists have to be\u2014we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards\u2014in heaven if not on earth\u2014all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.<ref name=religion>{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1971|pp=85\u201386}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHeisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli, raised as a Catholic, had kept silent after some initial remarks, but when finally he was asked for his opinion, said: \"Well, our friend Dirac has got a religion and its guiding principle is 'There is no God and Paul Dirac is His prophet.{{' \"}} Everybody, including Dirac, burst into laughter.<ref>{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1971|p=87}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TT_z4llWoIC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}}, who says this was an old joke, pointing out in a footnote that [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] wrote in the 1850s that \"There is no God, and [[Harriet Martineau]] is her prophet.\"</ref>{{rp|138}}\n\nLater in life, Dirac's views towards the idea of God were less acerbic.  As an author of an article appearing in the May 1963 edition of ''[[Scientific American]]'', Dirac wrote:\n<blockquote>It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental [[physical law]]s are described in terms of a [[mathematical theory of great beauty]] and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2010/06/25/the-evolution-of-the-physicists-picture-of-nature/ |title=The Evolution of the Physicist's Picture of Nature |last1=Dirac |first1=Paul |date=May 1963 |work=Scientific American |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1971, at a conference meeting, Dirac expressed his views on the existence of God.<ref name=Kragh>{{cite book|title=Dirac: A Scientific Biography|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/diracscientificb0000krag|chapter-url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521380898|pages=[https://archive.org/details/diracscientificb0000krag/page/256 256\u2013257]|author=Helge Kragh|chapter=The purest soul}}</ref> Dirac explained that the existence of God could only be justified if an improbable event were to have taken place in the past:\n\n<blockquote>It could be that it is extremely difficult to [[Abiogenesis|start life]]. It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10<sup>\u2212100</sup>. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions it will be necessary to assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.<ref name=Kragh /></blockquote>\n\nDirac did not commit himself to any definite view, but he described the possibilities for answering the question of God in a scientific manner.<ref name=Kragh />\n\n===Honours===\nDirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize for physics with [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] \"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory\".<ref name =nobel/> Dirac was also awarded the [[Royal Medal]] in 1939 and both the [[Copley Medal]] and the [[Max Planck Medal]] in 1952.

The remarkable notion of an antiparticle to each fermion particle \u2013 e.g. the positron as antiparticle to the electron \u2013 stems from his equation. He was the first to develop quantum field theory, which underlies all theoretical work on sub-atomic or \"elementary\" particles today, work that is fundamental to our understanding of the forces of nature. He proposed and investigated the concept of a [[magnetic monopole]], an object not yet known empirically, as a means of bringing even greater symmetry to [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations of [[electromagnetism]].\n\n===Gravity===\n{{Main|Dirac delta function}}\nHe quantised the gravitational field, and developed a general theory of [[quantum field]] theories with dynamical constraints, which forms the basis of the [[Gauge theory|gauge theories]] and [[Superstring theory|superstring theories]] of today.<ref>[[Mikhail Shifman|Misha, S.]], ''Quantum Field Theory II'' ([[Singapore]]: [[World Scientific]], 2019), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbySDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA287 p. 287].</ref>{{rp|287}} The influence and importance of his work have increased with the decades, and physicists use the concepts and equations that he developed daily.\n\n===Quantum theory===\nDirac's first step into a new quantum theory was taken late in September 1925. [[Ralph Fowler]], his research supervisor, had received a proof copy of an [[\u00dcber quantentheoretischer Umdeutung|exploratory paper]] by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in the framework of the old quantum theory of Bohr and [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]]. Heisenberg leaned heavily on Bohr's correspondence principle but changed the equations so that they involved directly observable quantities, leading to the [[matrix mechanics|matrix formulation]] of quantum mechanics. Fowler sent Heisenberg's paper on to Dirac, who was on vacation in Bristol, asking him to look into this paper carefully.\n\nDirac's attention was drawn to a mysterious mathematical relationship, at first sight unintelligible, that Heisenberg had reached. Several weeks later, back in Cambridge, Dirac suddenly recognised that this mathematical form had the same structure as the [[Poisson bracket]]s that occur in the [[classical mechanics|classical dynamics]] of particle motion. From this thought, he quickly developed a quantum theory that was based on non-commuting dynamical variables. This led him to a more profound and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics than was achieved by any other worker in this field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Dirac: a genius in the history of physics|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28693|work=Cern Courier|accessdate=13 May 2013|date=15 August 2002}}</ref> Dirac's formulation allowed him to obtain the [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]] rules in a [[Canonical quantization|novel and more illuminating manner]].

In fact, in a paper published in a book in his honour, he wrote: \"The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been dealt with by many authors, and I do not want to discuss it here.

Dirac's equation also contributed to explaining the origin of [[Spin (physics)|quantum spin]] as a relativistic phenomenon.\n\nThe necessity of [[fermion]]s (matter) being created and destroyed in [[Enrico Fermi]]'s 1934 theory of [[beta decay]] led to a reinterpretation of Dirac's equation as a \"classical\" [[field equation]] for any [[point particle]] of spin ''[[Planck constant|\u0127]]''/2, itself subject to quantisation conditions involving [[Anticommutativity|anti-commutators]]. Thus reinterpreted, in 1934 by [[Werner Heisenberg]], as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing all elementary matter particles \u2013 today [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s \u2013 this [[Dirac field]] equation is as central to theoretical physics as the [[Maxwell equations|Maxwell]], [[Yang\u2013Mills theory|Yang\u2013Mills]] and [[General relativity|Einstein]] field equations. Dirac is regarded as the founder of [[quantum electrodynamics]], being the first to use that term. He also introduced the idea of [[vacuum polarisation]] in the early 1930s. This work was key to the development of quantum mechanics by the next generation of theorists, in particular [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] and [[Freeman Dyson|Dyson]] in their formulation of quantum electrodynamics.\n\nDirac's [[The Principles of Quantum Mechanics|''The'' ''Principles of Quantum Mechanics'']], published in 1930, is a landmark in the [[history of science]]. It quickly became one of the standard textbooks on the subject and is still used today. In that book, Dirac incorporated the previous work of [[Werner Heisenberg]] on [[matrix mechanics]] and of [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] on [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] into a single mathematical formalism that associates measurable quantities to operators acting on the [[Hilbert space]] of vectors that describe the state of a [[physical system]].

In 1937, he proposed a speculative [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] model based on the so-called [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis|large numbers hypothesis]]. During World War II, he conducted important theoretical and experimental research on [[uranium enrichment]] by [[gas centrifuge]].\n\nDirac's [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) made predictions that were \u2013 more often than not \u2013 infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as [[renormalisation]] was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. \"I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation\", he said in 1975, \"because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small \u2013 not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=184}}</ref> His refusal to accept [[renormalisation]] resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream.\n\nHowever, from his once rejected notes he managed to work on putting quantum electrodynamics on \"logical foundations\" based on [[Hamiltonian formalism]] that he formulated. He found a rather novel way of deriving the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] \"Schwinger term\" and also the [[Lamb shift]], afresh in 1963, using the Heisenberg picture and without using the joining method used by [[Victor Weisskopf|Weisskopf]] and French, and by the two pioneers of modern QED, [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]] and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]. That was two years before the Tomonaga\u2013Schwinger\u2013Feynman QED was given formal recognition by an award of the Nobel Prize for physics.\n\nWeisskopf and French (FW) were the first to obtain the correct result for the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. At first FW results did not agree with the incorrect but independent results of Feynman and Schwinger.<ref>{{harvnb|Schweber|1994}}</ref> The 1963\u20131964 lectures Dirac gave on quantum field theory at [[Yeshiva University]] were published in 1966 as the Belfer Graduate School of Science, Monograph Series Number, 3. After having relocated to Florida to be near his elder daughter, Mary, Dirac spent his last fourteen years (of both life and physics research) at the [[University of Miami]] in [[Coral Gables, Florida]], and [[Florida State University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].\n\nIn the 1950s in his search for a better QED, Paul Dirac developed the Hamiltonian theory of constraints<ref>Canad J Math 1950 vol 2, 129; 1951 vol 3, 1</ref> based on lectures that he delivered at the 1949 [[International Congress of Mathematicians|International Mathematical Congress]] in Canada. Dirac<ref>1951 \"The Hamiltonian Form of Field Dynamics\" ''Canad Jour Math'', vol 3, 1</ref> had also solved the problem of putting the [[Schwinger\u2013Tomonaga equation]] into the Schr\u00f6dinger representation<ref>Phillips R. J. N. 1987 ''Tributes to Dirac'' p31 London: Adam Hilger</ref> and given explicit expressions for the [[Scalar field|scalar meson field]] ([[pion|spin zero pion]] or [[pseudoscalar meson]]), the vector meson field (spin one rho meson), and the electromagnetic field (spin one massless boson, photon).\n\nThe Hamiltonian of constrained systems is one of Dirac's many masterpieces. It is a powerful generalisation of Hamiltonian theory that remains valid for curved spacetime. The equations for the Hamiltonian involve only six degrees of freedom described by <math>g_{rs}</math>,<math>p^{rs}</math> for each point of the surface on which the state is considered. The  <math>g_{m0}</math> (''m'' = 0, 1, 2, 3) appear in the theory only through the variables <math>g^{r0}</math>, <math> ( -{g^{00}} ) ^{-1/2}</math> which occur as arbitrary coefficients in the equations of motion.\nThere are four constraints or weak equations for each point of the surface <math>x^0</math> = constant. Three of them <math>H_r</math> form the four vector density in the surface. The fourth <math>H_L</math> is a 3-dimensional scalar density in the surface ''H''<sub>L</sub> \u2248 0; ''H<sub>r</sub>'' \u2248 0 (''r'' = 1, 2, 3)\n\nIn the late 1950s, he applied the Hamiltonian methods he had developed to cast Einstein's general relativity in Hamiltonian form<ref>Proc Roy Soc 1958, A vol 246, 333, Phys Rev 1959, vol 114, 924</ref> and to bring to a technical completion the quantisation problem of gravitation and bring it also closer to the rest of physics according to Salam and DeWitt. In 1959 he also gave an invited talk on \"Energy of the Gravitational Field\" at the New York Meeting of the American Physical Society.<ref>Dirac, P. A. M., [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.2.368 \"Energy of the Gravitational Field\"], ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', Vol. 2, Nr. 8, 20 March 1959, pp. 368\u2013371.</ref>{{rp|368\u2013371}} In 1964 he published his ''Lectures on Quantum Mechanics'' (London: Academic) which deals with constrained dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems including quantisation of curved spacetime.

During that time he was offered a permanent position there, which he accepted, becoming a full professor in 1972. Contemporary accounts of his time there describe it as happy except that he apparently found the summer heat oppressive and liked to escape from it to Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.famousscientists.org/paul-dirac/|title=Paul Dirac|website=Famous Scientists}}</ref>\n\nHe would walk about a mile to work each day and was fond of swimming in one of the two nearby lakes (Silver Lake and Lost Lake), and was also more sociable than he had been at Cambridge, where he mostly worked at home apart from giving classes and seminars; at FSU he would usually eat lunch with his colleagues before taking a nap.\n\nDirac published over 60 papers in those last twelve years of his life, including a short book on general relativity. His last paper (1984), entitled \"The inadequacies of quantum field theory,\" contains his final judgment on quantum field theory;\n\n\"These rules of renormalisation give surprisingly, excessively good agreement with experiments. Most physicists say that these working rules are, therefore, correct. I feel that is not an adequate reason. Just because the results happen to be in agreement with observation does not prove that one's theory is correct.\"\n\nThe paper ends with these words;\n\n\"I have spent many years searching for a Hamiltonian to bring into the theory and have not yet found it. I shall continue to work on it as long as I can and other people, I hope, will follow along such lines.\"\n\n(Source: \"Paul Dirac: The Man and his Work\" by Abraham Pais et al.)\n\n===Students===\nAmongst his many students<ref name=mathgene>{{MathGenealogy|id=18524}}</ref><ref name=mactutor>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Dirac}}</ref> were [[Homi J.

He referred to the latter as \"Einstein statistics\" for reasons, he explained, of \"symmetry\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mehra|first1=Jagdish|last2=Rechenberg|first2=Helmut|title=The Historical Development of Quantum Theory|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9780387951805|page=746|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-pL56OcVubgC&pg=PA746&lpg=PA746&dq=Paul+Dirac+Einstein+statistics+Symmetry#v=onepage&q=Paul%20Dirac%20Einstein%20statistics%20Symmetry&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Religious views===\nHeisenberg recollected a conversation among young participants at the 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] about Einstein and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s views on religion between [[Wolfgang Pauli]], Heisenberg and Dirac. Dirac's contribution was a criticism of the political purpose of religion, which Bohr regarded as quite lucid when hearing it from Heisenberg later.<ref>[[Abraham Pais|Pais, A.]], ''Niels Bohr's Times: In Physics, Philosophy, and Polity'' (Oxford: [[Oxford_University_Press#Clarendon_Press|Clarendon Press]], 1991), [https://archive.org/details/nielsbohrstimesi0000pais/page/320 p. 320].</ref>{{rp|320}} Among other things, Dirac said:\n<blockquote>I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest\u2014and scientists have to be\u2014we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards\u2014in heaven if not on earth\u2014all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.<ref name=religion>{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1971|pp=85\u201386}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHeisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli, raised as a Catholic, had kept silent after some initial remarks, but when finally he was asked for his opinion, said: \"Well, our friend Dirac has got a religion and its guiding principle is 'There is no God and Paul Dirac is His prophet.{{' \"}} Everybody, including Dirac, burst into laughter.<ref>{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1971|p=87}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TT_z4llWoIC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}}, who says this was an old joke, pointing out in a footnote that [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] wrote in the 1850s that \"There is no God, and [[Harriet Martineau]] is her prophet.\"</ref>{{rp|138}}\n\nLater in life, Dirac's views towards the idea of God were less acerbic.  As an author of an article appearing in the May 1963 edition of ''[[Scientific American]]'', Dirac wrote:\n<blockquote>It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental [[physical law]]s are described in terms of a [[mathematical theory of great beauty]] and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2010/06/25/the-evolution-of-the-physicists-picture-of-nature/ |title=The Evolution of the Physicist's Picture of Nature |last1=Dirac |first1=Paul |date=May 1963 |work=Scientific American |accessdate=4 April 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1971, at a conference meeting, Dirac expressed his views on the existence of God.<ref name=Kragh>{{cite book|title=Dirac: A Scientific Biography|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/diracscientificb0000krag|chapter-url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521380898|pages=[https://archive.org/details/diracscientificb0000krag/page/256 256\u2013257]|author=Helge Kragh|chapter=The purest soul}}</ref> Dirac explained that the existence of God could only be justified if an improbable event were to have taken place in the past:\n\n<blockquote>It could be that it is extremely difficult to [[Abiogenesis|start life]]. It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10<sup>\u2212100</sup>. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions it will be necessary to assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.<ref name=Kragh /></blockquote>\n\nDirac did not commit himself to any definite view, but he described the possibilities for answering the question of God in a scientific manner.<ref name=Kragh />\n\n===Honours===\nDirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize for physics with [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] \"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory\".<ref name =nobel/> Dirac was also awarded the [[Royal Medal]] in 1939 and both the [[Copley Medal]] and the [[Max Planck Medal]] in 1952.

The remarkable notion of an antiparticle to each fermion particle \u2013 e.g. the positron as antiparticle to the electron \u2013 stems from his equation. He was the first to develop quantum field theory, which underlies all theoretical work on sub-atomic or \"elementary\" particles today, work that is fundamental to our understanding of the forces of nature. He proposed and investigated the concept of a [[magnetic monopole]], an object not yet known empirically, as a means of bringing even greater symmetry to [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations of [[electromagnetism]].\n\n===Gravity===\n{{Main|Dirac delta function}}\nHe quantised the gravitational field, and developed a general theory of [[quantum field]] theories with dynamical constraints, which forms the basis of the [[Gauge theory|gauge theories]] and [[Superstring theory|superstring theories]] of today.<ref>[[Mikhail Shifman|Misha, S.]], ''Quantum Field Theory II'' ([[Singapore]]: [[World Scientific]], 2019), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbySDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA287 p. 287].</ref>{{rp|287}} The influence and importance of his work have increased with the decades, and physicists use the concepts and equations that he developed daily.\n\n===Quantum theory===\nDirac's first step into a new quantum theory was taken late in September 1925. [[Ralph Fowler]], his research supervisor, had received a proof copy of an [[\u00dcber quantentheoretischer Umdeutung|exploratory paper]] by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in the framework of the old quantum theory of Bohr and [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]]. Heisenberg leaned heavily on Bohr's correspondence principle but changed the equations so that they involved directly observable quantities, leading to the [[matrix mechanics|matrix formulation]] of quantum mechanics. Fowler sent Heisenberg's paper on to Dirac, who was on vacation in Bristol, asking him to look into this paper carefully.\n\nDirac's attention was drawn to a mysterious mathematical relationship, at first sight unintelligible, that Heisenberg had reached. Several weeks later, back in Cambridge, Dirac suddenly recognised that this mathematical form had the same structure as the [[Poisson bracket]]s that occur in the [[classical mechanics|classical dynamics]] of particle motion. From this thought, he quickly developed a quantum theory that was based on non-commuting dynamical variables. This led him to a more profound and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics than was achieved by any other worker in this field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Dirac: a genius in the history of physics|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28693|work=Cern Courier|accessdate=13 May 2013|date=15 August 2002}}</ref> Dirac's formulation allowed him to obtain the [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]] rules in a [[Canonical quantization|novel and more illuminating manner]].

Dirac's equation also contributed to explaining the origin of [[Spin (physics)|quantum spin]] as a relativistic phenomenon.\n\nThe necessity of [[fermion]]s (matter) being created and destroyed in [[Enrico Fermi]]'s 1934 theory of [[beta decay]] led to a reinterpretation of Dirac's equation as a \"classical\" [[field equation]] for any [[point particle]] of spin ''[[Planck constant|\u0127]]''/2, itself subject to quantisation conditions involving [[Anticommutativity|anti-commutators]]. Thus reinterpreted, in 1934 by [[Werner Heisenberg]], as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing all elementary matter particles \u2013 today [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s \u2013 this [[Dirac field]] equation is as central to theoretical physics as the [[Maxwell equations|Maxwell]], [[Yang\u2013Mills theory|Yang\u2013Mills]] and [[General relativity|Einstein]] field equations. Dirac is regarded as the founder of [[quantum electrodynamics]], being the first to use that term. He also introduced the idea of [[vacuum polarisation]] in the early 1930s. This work was key to the development of quantum mechanics by the next generation of theorists, in particular [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] and [[Freeman Dyson|Dyson]] in their formulation of quantum electrodynamics.\n\nDirac's [[The Principles of Quantum Mechanics|''The'' ''Principles of Quantum Mechanics'']], published in 1930, is a landmark in the [[history of science]]. It quickly became one of the standard textbooks on the subject and is still used today. In that book, Dirac incorporated the previous work of [[Werner Heisenberg]] on [[matrix mechanics]] and of [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] on [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]] into a single mathematical formalism that associates measurable quantities to operators acting on the [[Hilbert space]] of vectors that describe the state of a [[physical system]].

In 1937, he proposed a speculative [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] model based on the so-called [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis|large numbers hypothesis]]. During World War II, he conducted important theoretical and experimental research on [[uranium enrichment]] by [[gas centrifuge]].\n\nDirac's [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) made predictions that were \u2013 more often than not \u2013 infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as [[renormalisation]] was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. \"I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation\", he said in 1975, \"because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small \u2013 not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!\"<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=184}}</ref> His refusal to accept [[renormalisation]] resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream.\n\nHowever, from his once rejected notes he managed to work on putting quantum electrodynamics on \"logical foundations\" based on [[Hamiltonian formalism]] that he formulated. He found a rather novel way of deriving the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] \"Schwinger term\" and also the [[Lamb shift]], afresh in 1963, using the Heisenberg picture and without using the joining method used by [[Victor Weisskopf|Weisskopf]] and French, and by the two pioneers of modern QED, [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]] and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]. That was two years before the Tomonaga\u2013Schwinger\u2013Feynman QED was given formal recognition by an award of the Nobel Prize for physics.\n\nWeisskopf and French (FW) were the first to obtain the correct result for the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. At first FW results did not agree with the incorrect but independent results of Feynman and Schwinger.<ref>{{harvnb|Schweber|1994}}</ref> The 1963\u20131964 lectures Dirac gave on quantum field theory at [[Yeshiva University]] were published in 1966 as the Belfer Graduate School of Science, Monograph Series Number, 3. After having relocated to Florida to be near his elder daughter, Mary, Dirac spent his last fourteen years (of both life and physics research) at the [[University of Miami]] in [[Coral Gables, Florida]], and [[Florida State University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].\n\nIn the 1950s in his search for a better QED, Paul Dirac developed the Hamiltonian theory of constraints<ref>Canad J Math 1950 vol 2, 129; 1951 vol 3, 1</ref> based on lectures that he delivered at the 1949 [[International Congress of Mathematicians|International Mathematical Congress]] in Canada. Dirac<ref>1951 \"The Hamiltonian Form of Field Dynamics\" ''Canad Jour Math'', vol 3, 1</ref> had also solved the problem of putting the [[Schwinger\u2013Tomonaga equation]] into the Schr\u00f6dinger representation<ref>Phillips R. J. N. 1987 ''Tributes to Dirac'' p31 London: Adam Hilger</ref> and given explicit expressions for the [[Scalar field|scalar meson field]] ([[pion|spin zero pion]] or [[pseudoscalar meson]]), the vector meson field (spin one rho meson), and the electromagnetic field (spin one massless boson, photon).\n\nThe Hamiltonian of constrained systems is one of Dirac's many masterpieces. It is a powerful generalisation of Hamiltonian theory that remains valid for curved spacetime. The equations for the Hamiltonian involve only six degrees of freedom described by <math>g_{rs}</math>,<math>p^{rs}</math> for each point of the surface on which the state is considered. The  <math>g_{m0}</math> (''m'' = 0, 1, 2, 3) appear in the theory only through the variables <math>g^{r0}</math>, <math> ( -{g^{00}} ) ^{-1/2}</math> which occur as arbitrary coefficients in the equations of motion.\nThere are four constraints or weak equations for each point of the surface <math>x^0</math> = constant. Three of them <math>H_r</math> form the four vector density in the surface. The fourth <math>H_L</math> is a 3-dimensional scalar density in the surface ''H''<sub>L</sub> \u2248 0; ''H<sub>r</sub>'' \u2248 0 (''r'' = 1, 2, 3)\n\nIn the late 1950s, he applied the Hamiltonian methods he had developed to cast Einstein's general relativity in Hamiltonian form<ref>Proc Roy Soc 1958, A vol 246, 333, Phys Rev 1959, vol 114, 924</ref> and to bring to a technical completion the quantisation problem of gravitation and bring it also closer to the rest of physics according to Salam and DeWitt. In 1959 he also gave an invited talk on \"Energy of the Gravitational Field\" at the New York Meeting of the American Physical Society.<ref>Dirac, P. A. M., [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.2.368 \"Energy of the Gravitational Field\"], ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', Vol. 2, Nr. 8, 20 March 1959, pp. 368\u2013371.</ref>{{rp|368\u2013371}} In 1964 he published his ''Lectures on Quantum Mechanics'' (London: Academic) which deals with constrained dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems including quantisation of curved spacetime. He also published a paper entitled \"Quantization of the Gravitational Field\" in the 1967 ICTP/IAEA Trieste Symposium on Contemporary Physics.\n\n=== Professorship at Florida State University ===\n\nFrom September 1970 to January 1971, Dirac was Visiting Professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee. During that time he was offered a permanent position there, which he accepted, becoming a full professor in 1972. Contemporary accounts of his time there describe it as happy except that he apparently found the summer heat oppressive and liked to escape from it to Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.famousscientists.org/paul-dirac/|title=Paul Dirac|website=Famous Scientists}}</ref>\n\nHe would walk about a mile to work each day and was fond of swimming in one of the two nearby lakes (Silver Lake and Lost Lake), and was also more sociable than he had been at Cambridge, where he mostly worked at home apart from giving classes and seminars; at FSU he would usually eat lunch with his colleagues before taking a nap.\n\nDirac published over 60 papers in those last twelve years of his life, including a short book on general relativity. His last paper (1984), entitled \"The inadequacies of quantum field theory,\" contains his final judgment on quantum field theory;\n\n\"These rules of renormalisation give surprisingly, excessively good agreement with experiments. Most physicists say that these working rules are, therefore, correct. I feel that is not an adequate reason. Just because the results happen to be in agreement with observation does not prove that one's theory is correct.\"\n\nThe paper ends with these words;\n\n\"I have spent many years searching for a Hamiltonian to bring into the theory and have not yet found it. I shall continue to work on it as long as I can and other people, I hope, will follow along such lines.\"\n\n(Source: \"Paul Dirac: The Man and his Work\" by Abraham Pais et al.)\n\n===Students===\nAmongst his many students<ref name=mathgene>{{MathGenealogy|id=18524}}</ref><ref name=mactutor>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Dirac}}</ref> were [[Homi J.

He donated the royalties from this book to the university for the establishment of the [[Dirac Prize|Dirac Lecture Series]].

Suddenly two [[dragons]] are fighting above the clouds, during which the White Dragon is killed suddenly by the Black Dragon, an occurrence believed to have been impossible for centuries.\n\nNews of the kingdom declining and nothing heard from Prince Arren troubles the King of the once tranquil kingdom of Enlad. The [[wizard (paranormal)|wizard]] Root speaks of dragons and men once being \"as one\", divided by their particular desires (freedom and possessions respectively), which is the cause of the [[yin and yang|world's balance]], gradually weakening. Suddenly the King is fatally stabbed with a [[dagger]] in a dark corridor by his own son, Prince Arren, who steals his father's [[sword]] and flees the castle, as his father perishes.\n\nIn the desert, Arren is rescued from [[wolves]] by the [[Magician (fantasy)|archmage]] Sparrowhawk. Together they travel to the city of Hort Town. When Arren explores the town alone, he rescues a young girl named Therru from slavers, but is later captured by the same slave master, Hare. His sword is dumped in the sea. Sparrowhawk rescues Arren from the slave caravan and takes him to a farm run by Sparrowhawk's oldest and greatest friend Tenar, who lives with Therru.\n\nSparrowhawk's intervention against Hare's slave caravan angers Lord Cob, a powerful [[warlock]] and the ruler of Hort Town, who wants the archmage brought to the castle. Meanwhile, Sparrowhawk tells Arren that he seeks a way to restore the upset balance, then resumes his search in Hort Town. While there he buys Arren's sword from a merchant's stall and manages to evade capture from Hare whilst learning about Cob's castle.\n\nArren confesses to Therru that he killed his father and that he feels an unknown presence following him. Because of this, Arren leaves the farm, but is met by the presence, which is a mirror image of himself. Arren falls unconscious after stumbling into a [[swamp]] while fleeing from the image. Cob takes him to the castle, where he manipulates him into revealing his \"true name\", Prince Lebannen, to control him. Meanwhile, Hare captures Tenar as bait to lure Sparrowhawk into the castle, leaving Therru tied to a post as a messenger. She frees herself, and encounters Sparrowhawk, who gives her Arren's sword to give to Arren. Sparrowhawk breaks into the castle to save Tenar and confronts Cob. Sparrowhawk learns that Cob is causing the world's Balance to collapse by opening the door between life and death to try and gain eternal life. Sparrowhawk tries to warn Cob of the dangers of upsetting the balance, and Cob sends Arren out to kill him. Sparrowhawk frees the prince from Cob's control but is captured by Hare, his great mystical strength and powers having been weakened within the stronghold of Cob's castle.\n\nMeanwhile, Therru sees the same copy of Arren and follows him to the castle, where he reveals that he is the light within Arren and tells Therru his true name. Therru enters the castle and learns of Sparrowhawk and Tenar's sunrise execution. She finds Arren, guilty and hopeless, and brings hope back to him, calling him by his true name and confiding in him her own true name, Tehanu. They rush to rescue Sparrowhawk and Tenar. Arren confronts Cob, who tries to kill him. He fights back and finally unsheathes his sword, which was sealed with magic. Arren cuts off Cob's staff-holding hand. Unable to use any of his magic powers, Cob rapidly begins to age. He captures Therru and flees to the highest tower of the castle, with Arren in pursuit. Cornering Cob, Arren tries to explain what he learned about life and death from Therru and Sparrowhawk to Cob, but the withering Dark Lord refuses to listen and uses the last of his magic to strangle Therru to death. Instead of dying, she reveals her true form as the Black Dragon, possessing life everlasting. Therru kills Cob with her fire breath and rescues Arren from the collapsing tower.\n\nSparrowhawk and Tenar leave the castle while Therru and Arren land in a field where Therru changes back into a human. Arren tells Therru he will leave for home to repent for his crime, but will come back to see her some day.

As such, she turned down his request.<ref name=\"GedoSenkiResponse\"/>\n\nIn 2003, after winning an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his film ''[[Spirited Away]]'', Hayao Miyazaki received Le Guin's approval but was busy directing [[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|''Howl's Moving Castle'']]. Studio Ghibli head Toshio Suzuki decided that Hayao's son Gor\u014d Miyazaki, who was advising on the film, should be given his first directing job for the adaptation. Hayao was dissatisfied with the decision, thinking that Gor\u014d lacked the necessary experience. They reportedly did not speak to one another during production of the film. Hayao later acknowledged his son's work upon its first preview.<ref>See Nausicaa.net [http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/earthsea/blog/blog112.html Goro Miyazaki's Blog].</ref> Some feel that a major section of the plot was adapted from the director's father, Hayao Miyazaki's ''[[The Journey of Shuna]]'' graphic novel, with many direct references. Le Guin, who had become a devoted fan of Hayao Miyazaki's work following their first encounter and had wished for him to direct the film, was also disappointed by the selection of Goro as director, but was told by Studio Ghibli that Hayao would oversee the film's production.<ref name=\"GedoSenkiResponse\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack for ''Tales from Earthsea'' was composed and managed by Tamiya Terashima and was released by [[Tokuma Japan Communications]] and Studio Ghibli Records as a [[Surround sound|multichannel]] hybrid [[Super Audio CD|SACD]]-CD on 12 July 2006. [[Carlos N\u00fa\u00f1ez Mu\u00f1oz|Carlos N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] was a key collaborator on the soundtrack, contributing his [[ocarina]], [[whistle]] and [[Galician gaita]] (bagpipe) to 11 of the 21 tracks. Newcomer singer, [[Aoi Teshima]], sang in 2 of the tracks. A follow-up album, \"Melodies from Gedo Senki\", was released on 17 January 2007 and included unreleased Gedo Senki OST tracks and new tracks by N\u00fa\u00f1ez.<ref>Ghibliworld, [http://pages.citebite.com/x1f1q8t3f0kkj MEMORIES FROM GEDO SENKI WITH CARLOS NUNEZ], 19 December 2006</ref><ref>{{in lang|ja}} Studio Ghibli, [http://www.ghibli.jp/10info/003503.html \u30ab\u30eb\u30ed\u30b9\u30fb\u30cc\u30cb\u30a7\u30b9\u306e\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30e0\u306e\u767a\u58f2\u6c7a\u5b9a\uff01], 11 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Trailer==\nStudio Ghibli released the first and second trailers on its official web site.

Le Guin]], the author of the ''Earthsea'' series, for permission to create an animated adaptation of Earthsea. Le Guin, who was unfamiliar with his work and anime in general, turned down the offer. Years later, after seeing ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', she reconsidered her refusal, believing that if anyone should be allowed to direct an Earthsea film, it should be Hayao Miyazaki.<ref name=\"Ursula K.

While she was positive about the aesthetic of the film, writing that \"much of it was beautiful\",<ref name=\"Ursula K. LeGuin, Gedo Senki\" /> she took great issue with its re-imagining of the moral sense of the books and greater focus on physical violence. \"[E]vil has been comfortably externalized in a villain\", Le Guin writes, \"the wizard Kumo/Cob, who can simply be killed, thus solving all problems. In modern fantasy (literary or governmental), killing people is the usual solution to the so-called war between good and evil. My books are not conceived in terms of such a war, and offer no simple answers to simplistic questions.\"<ref name=\"Ursula K. LeGuin, Gedo Senki\" />\n\nShe stated that the plot departed so greatly from her story that she was \"watching an entirely different story, confusingly enacted by people with the same names as in my story\". She also praised certain depictions of nature in the film, but felt that the production values of the film were not as high as previous works directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and that the film's excitement was focused too much around scenes of violence. Her initial response to Gor\u014d Miyazaki was \"[I]t is not my book. It is your movie. It is a good movie\".<ref name=\"GedoSenkiResponse\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ursulakleguinarchive.com/GedoSenkiResponse.html|title=Gedo Senki, a First Response|author=Ursula K.

In Japan, the film found both strong proponents and detractors. Many of the opinions can best be summed up in a response to Le Guin's comments on her website, that the weak points of the film were the result of \"when too much responsibility was shouldered by someone not equipped for it\".<ref name=\"GedoSenkiCorrespondents\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ursulakleguin.com/GedoSenkiCorrespondents.html |title=Gedo Senki: Responses from Correspondents |accessdate= |author=Ursula K.

The [[wizard (paranormal)|wizard]] Root speaks of dragons and men once being \"as one\", divided by their particular desires (freedom and possessions respectively), which is the cause of the [[yin and yang|world's balance]], gradually weakening. Suddenly the King is fatally stabbed with a [[dagger]] in a dark corridor by his own son, Prince Arren, who steals his father's [[sword]] and flees the castle, as his father perishes.\n\nIn the desert, Arren is rescued from [[wolves]] by the [[Magician (fantasy)|archmage]] Sparrowhawk. Together they travel to the city of Hort Town. When Arren explores the town alone, he rescues a young girl named Therru from slavers, but is later captured by the same slave master, Hare. His sword is dumped in the sea. Sparrowhawk rescues Arren from the slave caravan and takes him to a farm run by Sparrowhawk's oldest and greatest friend Tenar, who lives with Therru.\n\nSparrowhawk's intervention against Hare's slave caravan angers Lord Cob, a powerful [[warlock]] and the ruler of Hort Town, who wants the archmage brought to the castle. Meanwhile, Sparrowhawk tells Arren that he seeks a way to restore the upset balance, then resumes his search in Hort Town. While there he buys Arren's sword from a merchant's stall and manages to evade capture from Hare whilst learning about Cob's castle.\n\nArren confesses to Therru that he killed his father and that he feels an unknown presence following him. Because of this, Arren leaves the farm, but is met by the presence, which is a mirror image of himself. Arren falls unconscious after stumbling into a [[swamp]] while fleeing from the image. Cob takes him to the castle, where he manipulates him into revealing his \"true name\", Prince Lebannen, to control him. Meanwhile, Hare captures Tenar as bait to lure Sparrowhawk into the castle, leaving Therru tied to a post as a messenger. She frees herself, and encounters Sparrowhawk, who gives her Arren's sword to give to Arren. Sparrowhawk breaks into the castle to save Tenar and confronts Cob. Sparrowhawk learns that Cob is causing the world's Balance to collapse by opening the door between life and death to try and gain eternal life. Sparrowhawk tries to warn Cob of the dangers of upsetting the balance, and Cob sends Arren out to kill him. Sparrowhawk frees the prince from Cob's control but is captured by Hare, his great mystical strength and powers having been weakened within the stronghold of Cob's castle.\n\nMeanwhile, Therru sees the same copy of Arren and follows him to the castle, where he reveals that he is the light within Arren and tells Therru his true name. Therru enters the castle and learns of Sparrowhawk and Tenar's sunrise execution. She finds Arren, guilty and hopeless, and brings hope back to him, calling him by his true name and confiding in him her own true name, Tehanu. They rush to rescue Sparrowhawk and Tenar. Arren confronts Cob, who tries to kill him. He fights back and finally unsheathes his sword, which was sealed with magic. Arren cuts off Cob's staff-holding hand. Unable to use any of his magic powers, Cob rapidly begins to age. He captures Therru and flees to the highest tower of the castle, with Arren in pursuit. Cornering Cob, Arren tries to explain what he learned about life and death from Therru and Sparrowhawk to Cob, but the withering Dark Lord refuses to listen and uses the last of his magic to strangle Therru to death. Instead of dying, she reveals her true form as the Black Dragon, possessing life everlasting. Therru kills Cob with her fire breath and rescues Arren from the collapsing tower.\n\nSparrowhawk and Tenar leave the castle while Therru and Arren land in a field where Therru changes back into a human. Arren tells Therru he will leave for home to repent for his crime, but will come back to see her some day. After he and Therru reunite with Sparrowhawk and Tenar, the four of them spend time together. Arren and Sparrowhawk depart for Enlad, bidding Therru and Tenar goodbye. Therru looks up to see her fellow dragons airborne, indicating that the balance of the world has been restored.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bunta Sugawara]] ([[Timothy Dalton]] in the English Dub) as [[Ged (Earthsea)|Ged/Sparrowhawk]], a famous, powerful, wise, and noble sorcerer of Earthsea, known as the Archmage, who is trying to solve the mystery on why the world's Balance in collapsing.

As such, she turned down his request.<ref name=\"GedoSenkiResponse\"/>\n\nIn 2003, after winning an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for his film ''[[Spirited Away]]'', Hayao Miyazaki received Le Guin's approval but was busy directing [[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|''Howl's Moving Castle'']]. Studio Ghibli head Toshio Suzuki decided that Hayao's son Gor\u014d Miyazaki, who was advising on the film, should be given his first directing job for the adaptation. Hayao was dissatisfied with the decision, thinking that Gor\u014d lacked the necessary experience. They reportedly did not speak to one another during production of the film. Hayao later acknowledged his son's work upon its first preview.<ref>See Nausicaa.net [http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/earthsea/blog/blog112.html Goro Miyazaki's Blog].</ref> Some feel that a major section of the plot was adapted from the director's father, Hayao Miyazaki's ''[[The Journey of Shuna]]'' graphic novel, with many direct references. Le Guin, who had become a devoted fan of Hayao Miyazaki's work following their first encounter and had wished for him to direct the film, was also disappointed by the selection of Goro as director, but was told by Studio Ghibli that Hayao would oversee the film's production.<ref name=\"GedoSenkiResponse\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe soundtrack for ''Tales from Earthsea'' was composed and managed by Tamiya Terashima and was released by [[Tokuma Japan Communications]] and Studio Ghibli Records as a [[Surround sound|multichannel]] hybrid [[Super Audio CD|SACD]]-CD on 12 July 2006.

Newcomer singer, [[Aoi Teshima]], sang in 2 of the tracks.

Le Guin]], the author of the ''Earthsea'' series, for permission to create an animated adaptation of Earthsea. Le Guin, who was unfamiliar with his work and anime in general, turned down the offer. Years later, after seeing ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'', she reconsidered her refusal, believing that if anyone should be allowed to direct an Earthsea film, it should be Hayao Miyazaki.<ref name=\"Ursula K.

While she was positive about the aesthetic of the film, writing that \"much of it was beautiful\",<ref name=\"Ursula K. LeGuin, Gedo Senki\" /> she took great issue with its re-imagining of the moral sense of the books and greater focus on physical violence. \"[E]vil has been comfortably externalized in a villain\", Le Guin writes, \"the wizard Kumo/Cob, who can simply be killed, thus solving all problems. In modern fantasy (literary or governmental), killing people is the usual solution to the so-called war between good and evil. My books are not conceived in terms of such a war, and offer no simple answers to simplistic questions.\"<ref name=\"Ursula K. LeGuin, Gedo Senki\" />\n\nShe stated that the plot departed so greatly from her story that she was \"watching an entirely different story, confusingly enacted by people with the same names as in my story\". She also praised certain depictions of nature in the film, but felt that the production values of the film were not as high as previous works directed by Hayao Miyazaki, and that the film's excitement was focused too much around scenes of violence. Her initial response to Gor\u014d Miyazaki was \"[I]t is not my book. It is your movie. It is a good movie\".<ref name=\"GedoSenkiResponse\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ursulakleguin.com/GedoSenkiResponse.html |title=Gedo Senki, a First Response |accessdate=2006-08-15 |author=Ursula K.

In Japan, the film found both strong proponents and detractors. Many of the opinions can best be summed up in a response to Le Guin's comments on her website, that the weak points of the film were the result of \"when too much responsibility was shouldered by someone not equipped for it\".<ref name=\"GedoSenkiCorrespondents\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ursulakleguin.com/GedoSenkiCorrespondents.html |title=Gedo Senki: Responses from Correspondents |accessdate= |author=Ursula K.
