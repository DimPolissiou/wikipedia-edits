Although critics were split on several aspects of the show, in particular how it handled mental health and its depictions of rape and suicide, they highly praised Langford's performance. Langford later received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance.\n\n==Storyline (television series)==\nAt the beginning of the series, we learn that 17-year-old schoolgirl Hannah Baker has committed suicide by cutting her wrists. Her school locker becomes a memorial adorned with students' letters and her pictures. On his doorstep, Hannah's friend [[Tony Padilla (13 Reasons Why)| Tony Padilla ]] finds a box containing seven [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette tapes]], each containing a recording of Hannah narrating 13 reasons for her suicide.\n\nClay listens to the first tape, side A where Hannah talks about moving to town and becoming friends with her neighbor Kat, who is moving away before start of sophomore year. Kat throws a going-away party at Hannah\u2019s house so that Hannah can meet some new friends. Clay also attends the party, having been invited by Hannah at work. Clay recalls that [[Bryce Walker]] initially started to flirt with Hannah in which Hannah was receptive and flirted back until Kat realizing what is going on, breaks up the conversation by sending Bryce towards the beer. Both Kat and Clay warn her about Bryce. Kat then introduces her to [[Justin Foley (character)|Justin Foley]], Kat\u2019s boyfriend along with his friend [[Zach Dempsey]]. Kat  intends for Hannah to be interested in Zach, but Hannah instead finds herself smitten with Justin. Hannah later asks Kat for permission to pursue Justin, to which Kat consents. Hannah prints out Justin\u2019s class schedule to \u201cbump\u201d into him between classes and goes to his basketball game. Justin becomes interested and asks for her phone number. They begin a relationship, but it is ended by a bad first kiss between the two. Justin does nothing to stop the spread of a rumor about the encounter. Justin later shows Bryce a revealing photograph of Hannah, and Bryce circulates the photograph to everyone at school from Justin\u2019s phone, embarrassing Hannah. Clay recalls Hannah being hurt by his comment about the photograph. Each subsequent tape reveals Hannah\u2019s thirteen reasons she killed herself. Hannah warns listeners to follow certain rules; everyone mentioned on the tapes must listen to the complete set then pass it along to the next person addressed. If they fail to do so, the second set of tapes, held by a personal friend and classmate Tony, who is not on the tapes, will be released. Clay, who was in love with Hannah, reminisces about the time he spent with her. He finds listening to Hannah's story difficult, but his friend Tony finds him and reveals he plays a part in enforcing Hannah's will by making sure the tapes are heard; he knows Clay is mentioned on them. He warns Clay  things will go wrong if he does not obey the tapes.<ref name=\"one\">{{cite magazine|first=Shirlley|last=Li|title=Episode 1: \"Tape 1, Side A\"|url=https://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|access-date=April 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413074236/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/|archive-date=April 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn the B-side of the first tape, Hannah talks about her friendship with Jessica Davis and Alex Standall, who later start dating and stop hanging out with Hannah.

Although critics were split on several aspects of the show, in particular how it handled mental health and its depictions of rape and suicide, they highly praised Langford's performance. Langford later received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance.\n\n==Storyline (television series)==\nAt the beginning of the series, we learn that 17-year-old schoolgirl Hannah Baker has committed suicide by cutting her wrists. Her school locker becomes a memorial adorned with students' letters and her pictures. On his doorstep, Hannah's friend [[ Tony Padilla ]] finds a box containing seven [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette tapes]], each containing a recording of Hannah narrating 13 reasons for her suicide.\n\nClay listens to the first tape, side A where Hannah talks about moving to town and becoming friends with her neighbor Kat, who is moving away before start of sophomore year. Kat throws a going-away party at Hannah\u2019s house so that Hannah can meet some new friends. Clay also attends the party, having been invited by Hannah at work. Clay recalls that [[Bryce Walker]] initially started to flirt with Hannah in which Hannah was receptive and flirted back until Kat realizing what is going on, breaks up the conversation by sending Bryce towards the beer. Both Kat and Clay warn her about Bryce. Kat then introduces her to [[Justin Foley (character)|Justin Foley]], Kat\u2019s boyfriend along with his friend [[Zach Dempsey]]. Kat  intends for Hannah to be interested in Zach, but Hannah instead finds herself smitten with Justin. Hannah later asks Kat for permission to pursue Justin, to which Kat consents. Hannah prints out Justin\u2019s class schedule to \u201cbump\u201d into him between classes and goes to his basketball game. Justin becomes interested and asks for her phone number. They begin a relationship, but it is ended by a bad first kiss between the two. Justin does nothing to stop the spread of a rumor about the encounter. Justin later shows Bryce a revealing photograph of Hannah, and Bryce circulates the photograph to everyone at school from Justin\u2019s phone, embarrassing Hannah. Clay recalls Hannah being hurt by his comment about the photograph. Each subsequent tape reveals Hannah\u2019s thirteen reasons she killed herself. Hannah warns listeners to follow certain rules; everyone mentioned on the tapes must listen to the complete set then pass it along to the next person addressed. If they fail to do so, the second set of tapes, held by a personal friend and classmate Tony, who is not on the tapes, will be released. Clay, who was in love with Hannah, reminisces about the time he spent with her. He finds listening to Hannah's story difficult, but his friend Tony finds him and reveals he plays a part in enforcing Hannah's will by making sure the tapes are heard; he knows Clay is mentioned on them. He warns Clay  things will go wrong if he does not obey the tapes.<ref name=\"one\">{{cite magazine|first=Shirlley|last=Li|title=Episode 1: \"Tape 1, Side A\"|url=https://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|access-date=April 12, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413074236/http://ew.com/recap/13-reasons-why-season-1/|archive-date=April 13, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn the B-side of the first tape, Hannah talks about her friendship with Jessica Davis and Alex Standall, who later start dating and stop hanging out with Hannah.
