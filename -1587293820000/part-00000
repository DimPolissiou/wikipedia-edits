In his tweets, Nav shared his thoughts that had ranged \"from angry and bitter to motivational and inspirational\".

Scott and producer [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] later confirmed this was an error, and re-mixed and re-released the track on streaming services with the updated vocal mix a week after the release of the song and album.\n\nIn March 2019 during an interview with Pitchfork, Nav expressed his frustration stating that \"Fame is something I want, it's a good problem to have. I'm still not there, because when I walk out of fucking Delilah in L.A. and [[TMZ]] will be standing out there with cameras and not even take a picture of me, I get sick.

The most notable and ongoing presence of Gatorade in popular culture is the [[Gatorade shower]], originally called the \"Gatorade Dunk\", where players from a victorious team pick up the Gatorade cooler, sneak up behind the head coach, and pour the contents of the cooler (generally Gatorade and ice) over his head at the end of an [[American football]] game. This tradition was popularized in the mid-1980s when [[Harry Carson]] and [[Jim Burt (American football)|Jim Burt]], of the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], doused head coach [[Bill Parcells]] during the 1985 season. Burt's teammates picked up on this practice and popularized it during the team's championship season of 1986\u201387. The tradition has since become a recurring tradition across other team sports, including [[Canadian football]].<ref name=gatoradeshower>{{cite news|last=Trex|first=Ethan|title=Who invented the Gatorade shower?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/wayoflife/01/07/mf.gatorade.shower.inventors/index.html#cnnSTCText|accessdate=January 24, 2011|publisher=CNN|date=January 7, 2010}}</ref> The name is often used even when non-Gatorade drinks such as water or [[Powerade]] are substituted.\n\n== Gatorade and oral rehydration ==\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]], aid agencies were struggling to save the lives of thousands of Rwandan refugees dying of [[dehydration]] due to [[cholera]] in camps in eastern [[Zaire]].<ref>Barbara Crossette, [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/weekinreview/the-world-reason-left-in-the-dust-as-refugees-pick-routes.html \"The World; Reason Left in the Dust as Refugees Pick Routes\"], ''The New York Times'', July 24, 1994.</ref> The [[aid agency]] [[AmeriCares]] was heavily criticized for choosing to provide Gatorade as a form of [[oral rehydration solution]].<ref>Kevin M.

She was originally USS ''Shackle'' (ARS-9), a {{sclass-|Diver|rescue and salvage ship|0}} [[rescue and salvage ship]] commissioned by the [[United States Navy]] for service in [[World War II]]. She was responsible for coming to the aid of stricken vessels and received three [[battle stars]] during World War II, before a long career with the Coast Guard. ''Acushnet'' patrolled the waters of the North Pacific and was one of the last World War II era ships on active duty in the US fleet upon her retirement in 2011.\n\n==United States Navy service - 1944 to 1946==\n{{main article|USS Shackle (ARS-9)}}\nUSS ''Shackle'' was laid down on 26 October 1942 by the [[Basalt Rock Company]] in [[Napa, California]]; launched on 1 April 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Walker Cochran; and commissioned on 5 February 1944, Lieutenant Charles G. Jenkins, Jr., in command. At the time of its building, the country was at war and in need of more naval vessels. As a result of the necessity, three ships, identified only as \"naval auxiliaries\" underwent construction. The project took less than a year to complete and would become fleet rescue and salvage vessels serving in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]]. These vessels would later all become Coast Guard cutters.\n\n''Shackle''{{'}}s first station was at [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]], where she served as a salvage ship in the West Pacific throughout the remainder of World War II. ''Shackle''{{'}}s first year was spent completing extensive salvage assignments clearing wreckage in the channels at Pearl Harbor and [[Midway Island]]. The vessel spent the rest of the year in [[Guam]], [[Eniwetok]], [[Tinian]] and [[Saipan]].<ref name=\"Service' 1994\">USCGC Fiftieth Anniversary pamphlet ''USCGC Acushnet Over 50 Years of Service'' dated 1994.</ref>\n\nOn February 15, 1945, ''Shackle'' sailed for the invasion of Iwo Jima where it successfully completed over 44 diving and salvage assignments. One of these was the battle repair of {{USS|Terry|DD-513|6}} which was hit by a Japanese shore battery. During March 1945, ''Shackle'' served as a supporting unit for the [[Okinawa]] invasion. Between D-Day (April 1, 1945) and September 20, 1945, the ship completed 55 salvage and rescue operations on larger naval craft damaged by kamikaze attacks. There were 108 general alarms during the period.<ref name=\"Service' 1994\"/>\n\n''Shackle'' was also assigned to mine sweeping operations in the [[East China Sea]] where over 200 enemy mines of all types were sunk or destroyed. ''Shackle'' also cleared the vital docking area of the wreckage of sunken Japanese cable laying ship at [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka Naval Base]], [[Tokyo Bay]], Japan. During all of these operations the ''Shackle'' suffered no damage or casualties. As part of her service in the Pacific Theater Shakle received three World War II battle stars, the [[WWII Victory Medal]], the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]], the [[American Campaign Medal]], and the [[Navy Occupation Service Medal]].\n\nOn August 23, 1946 USS ''Shackle'' was commissioned into the [[United States Coast Guard]] as USCGC ''Acushnet'' (WAT-167), a search and rescue vessel and was homeported in [[Portland, Maine]].\n<gallery>\nImage:Oninawa_zoom.jpg|Close-up of USS ''Shackle'' at Okinawa during World War II\nImage:USS_SHACKLE_ARS9_During_WWII.jpeg|USS ''Shackle'' circa 1944.\nImage:Shackle_ARS9_hardhat_Diver.jpeg|Ship Fitter (First Class) Jack B.

She remained at [[San Diego, California]], until ordered to [[San Francisco, California]], where, on 29 June, she was decommissioned and transferred to the Coast Guard. First homeported in [[Portland, Maine]] as a Coast Guard tug, and renamed USCGC ''Acushnet'' (WAT-167), she earned a sound reputation as a dependable friend to fishermen and boaters in distress.\n\n==North East and International Ice Patrol Service - 1946 to 1968==\nWhile in Portland, Maine ''Acushnet'' became a friend to the maritime community with her search-and-rescue endeavors. While in Maine, ''Acushnet'' not only served as a vessel for SAR, but also as part of the International Ice Patrol. ''Acushnet'' and her role in the International Ice patrol was featured in the April 22nd 1957 edition of Life Magazine.<ref>[[Life (magazine)|Life]] (1957, April 22) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jUkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA30&dq=life%20Apr%2022%201957&lr&as_brr=0&as_pt=MAGAZINES&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=true Icy Menace in the North Atlantic: The International Patrol warms all shipping away from the worst invasion of big bergs in years. ''Life'' Vol 42, No 16, pages 56-58]</ref> Between 1946 and 1959, ''Acushnet'' responded to a major fire in Bar Harbor, Maine, salvaged a vessel that ran aground in the Kennebec River, and assisted two tankers that broke in half during a violent storm.\n\nOn 18 February 1952, ''Acushnet'' participated in what is listed as the ten most significant Coast Guard rescues. Two [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]], {{SS|Pendleton}} and {{SS|Fort Mercer}}, split in two in a fierce storm off [[Cape Cod]], and ''Acushnet'' took 18 men off the stern of ''Fort Mercer'' in heavy seas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/Pendleton_Mercer_Stancliff.asp|title=The ''Fort Mercer'' and ''Pendleton'' Rescues|publisher=USCG website|accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref>  The ships collided twice and the merchant seamen jumped to the safety of ''Acushnet''{{'}}s fantail.<ref>Tougias, Michael, ''The Coast Guard's Most Daring Sea Rescue''</ref>\n\nIn the year 1950, ''Acushnet'' became active in the International Ice Patrol and spent a total of seven patrol months sharing that responsibility with the cutters ''Androscoggin'' and ''Evergreen''. ''Acushnet''{{'}}s salvage gear was removed in late 1959 and replaced with search-and-rescue gear. From 1960 to 1968 ''Acushnet'' completed four towing missions for over {{convert|950|mi}}, assisted a vessel that broke in two, escorted four disabled vessels and assisted in two medevacs. A few of ''Acushnet''{{'}}s more noteworthy cases during that time frame include the following: in 1960, it salvaged the 300-ton USCGC ''General Greene'' which had been driven one hundred yards ashore in high winds. One of her more dramatic cases in Portland included the rescue of the entire crew of ten people from the disabled seagoing dredge ''Cartagena'', which was adrift in {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} seas and {{convert|75|kn|adj=on}} winds {{convert|200|nmi}} off of Cape Cod on Christmas Day, 1961. In May 1963, ''Acushnet'' salvaged a crashed Coast Guard helicopter {{convert|600|yd}} off Duxbury Beach, Massachusetts.\n\nThe fall of 1967 took ''Acushnet'' south, where the cutter rescued a Cuban refugee from a distressed {{convert|17|ft|adj=on}} pleasure craft {{convert|50|nmi}} south of Key West, Florida.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:USCGC Acushnet (WAT-167) underway on 9 September 1947 (CB 072947-5).jpg|USCGC ''Acushnet'' circa the 1950s\nImage:USCGC Acushnet (WAT-167) on ice patrol in the North Atlantic, in February 1951.jpg|USCGC ''Acushnet'' while conducting an International Ice Patrol\n</gallery>\n\n==Redesignated as an oceanographic ship - 1968 to 1971==\nRedesignated an [[oceanographic]] ship, WAGO-167, on July 8, 1968 and assigned to oceanographic, [[meteorological]], and polar operations, she commenced duties as a research support ship. During fiscal year 1970, she underwent conversion during which alterations were made to her hull and scientific equipment, and research and storage spaces were added at a shipyard in [[San Diego, California]]. As part of the National Data Buoy Project of NOAA ''Acushnet'' spent three years attached to the Office of Naval Research and the Scripps Oceanographic Institute in San Diego, California. Her primary mission on eleven extended deployments through June 1971, the cutter aided in positioning buoys. While serving as a WAGO, ''Acushnet'' assisted in only one rescue case a medevac in 1970.\n\n==Caribbean service \u2013 1971 to 1990==\nIn July 1971, ''Acushnet'' transferred to the [[Gulf Coast]]; and, based at [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], she continued her oceanographic work with the [[National Data Buoy Center]], this time aiding the Mississippi Test Facility. On August 24, 1971 ''Acushnet'', affectionately known to the crew a \"NOAA's Ark\", arrived in Gulfport with 64 crew and a 100-ton buoy that was towed from San Diego as its first new support assignment.\n\nOnce established in Gulfport, ''Acushnet'' continued to play a diverse and important role in the search-and-rescue mission. In the fall of 1973 the cutter played a major role in the ''Key Largo'' fire south of New Orleans opposite the town of Phoenix. ''Acushnet'' was again called to respond after a collision on the Mississippi River. ''Acushnet'' and the cutter ''Dependable'' were presented the Coast Guard Unit Commendation for extinguishing a fire on the tanker ''Key Trader'' after it collided with another vessel, the Norwegian ore ship ''Baune'', and burst into flames in the river.\n\nBetween the years 1975 and 1978, ''Acushnet'' conducted search-and-rescue research of the Gulf of Mexico shelf area, conducted the first marriage on board a Coast Guard vessel since the mid-19th century, and made her first drug seizure of 18 tons of marijuana and 21 smugglers.\n\nIn late 1978, the cutter embarked on a patrol to participate in the Global Weather Experiment, 140-nation effort to gather worldwide weather information. In 82 days, ''Acushnet'' covered over {{convert|18,000|mi}} from Peru to New Zealand. For this operation ''Acushnet'' received the Meritorious Unit Commendation. Additionally in 1978, ''Acushnet'' was designated a Medium Endurance Cutter (WMEC 167) and was formally assigned law enforcement and search-and-rescue missions.\n\nIn August\u2013September 1979, Mobile, Alabama, was hit by [[Hurricane Frederick]] while ''Acushnet'' was there in drydock, although no damage occurred to the cutter. Her first patrol out of drydock was immediately canceled and ''Acushnet'' was sent to pick up survivors of a collision between an oil tanker and a merchant vessel.\n\nFrom May 17 to June 6, 1980, ''Acushnet'' participated in the largest immigration crisis in the history of the Coast Guard, the [[Mariel Boat Lift]] from Cuba. The cutter escorted the vessel ''Red Diamond'' with 800 refugees into Key West. In addition, she assisted 35 boats, aided 120 refugees directly, and fueled two 41-foot Coast Guard boats. For her efforts, the cutter received the Humanitarian Service Award. During its time in Gulfport, ''Acushnet'' interdicted nearly 200 Cuban and Haitian refugees, retrieving some of them from shark-infested waters.\n\nDrug interdiction during the rest of the '80s 'proved to be successful. In 1980, ''Acushnet'' seized 52 tons of marijuana. Between September and November of the same year, ''Acushnet'' confiscated marijuana on 7 vessels totaling a seizure of over 76 tons. Between 1987 and 1989 ''Acushnet'' had yet two more seizures of marijuana and hashish oil valued at over 1.5 million. m/v ''Blind Melon'' and sloop ''Stormy Weather''. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==West Coast service - 1990 to 1998==\n''Acushnet'' moved to Eureka, California in July 1990. During a September patrol, a lookout spotted floating objects in the water. These \"objects\" were the three crew members of the fishing boat ''Miss Patty'', which had capsized before it could radio for help. During Operation Sandtrap in July 1991, ''Acushnet'' intercepted the sailing vessel ''Malekula'' carrying twelve tons of hashish from Indochina. The cutter pulled 32 bales from the burning and sinking ''Malekula'', despite efforts by smugglers to scuttle the sailboat.\n\nIn October 1991, ''Acushnet'' made her first trip to the waters of Alaska. The cutter was diverted for two weeks to coordinate anti-pollution efforts when the 518-foot ''Hyundai No. 12'' ran hard aground near the Shumagin Islands. She also responded to a mayday call made by the fishing vessel ''Tonquin'' in the Gulf of Alaska, rescuing one man out of a five-man crew from stormy and frigid waters during a five-day search. The cutter coordinated a search involving several fishing boats and a tanker in the area. As a result, three additional crew members were rescued.\n\n==Alaska/Bering Sea Patrol service - 1999 to 2011==\nAs the majority of ''Acushnet''{{'}}s patrols became Alaska Patrols, in 1998 she moved to [[Ketchikan, Alaska]] where she was employed in law enforcement, fisheries, and search and rescue missions in Alaska. This considerably shortened her transit time to the Bering Sea.\n\nOn 23 February 2007 ''Acushnet'' was designated as the \"oldest commissioned cutter\" in the fleet following the decommissioning of USCGC ''Storis''. She carries gold hull numbers to show this distinction, and the formal title of \"Queen Of The Fleet\". She was scheduled for decommissioning in late 2008. In March 2008 letters to the editor appeared in the [[Boston Herald]] and [[Maine Sunday Telegram]] calling for Boston and Portland to consider the Acushnet as a possible museum ship. The 2008 decommissioning was canceled and ''Acushnet'' continued to conduct patrols in Alaska until March 2011 when she was auctioned as surplus property by the GSA.\n\n==Decommissioning==\n\nOn 11 March 2011, ''Acushnet'' was decommissioned and retired from active duty after more than 67 years of service.<ref name=Juneau>\n{{cite news\n |url         = http://juneauempire.com/stories/021610/sta_563672837.shtml\n |title       = Begich questions Coast Guard nominee on cutter retirement\n |publisher   = [[Juneau Empire]]\n |date        = 2010-02-16\n |accessdate  = 2011-12-03\n |quote       = U.S. Sen.

She was originally USS ''Shackle'' (ARS-9), a {{sclass-|Diver|rescue and salvage ship|0}} [[rescue and salvage ship]] commissioned by the [[United States Navy]] for service in [[World War II]]. She was responsible for coming to the aid of stricken vessels and received three [[battle stars]] during World War II, before a long career with the Coast Guard. ''Acushnet'' patrolled the waters of the North Pacific and was one of the last World War II era ships on active duty in the US fleet upon her retirement in 2011.\n\n==United States Navy service - 1944 to 1946==\n{{main article|USS Shackle (ARS-9)}}\nUSS ''Shackle'' was laid down on 26 October 1942 by the [[Basalt Rock Company]] in [[Napa, California]]; launched on 1 April 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Walker Cochran; and commissioned on 5 February 1944, Lieutenant Charles G. Jenkins, Jr., in command. At the time of its building, the country was at war and in need of more naval vessels. As a result of the necessity, three ships, identified only as \"naval auxiliaries\" underwent construction. The project took less than a year to complete and would become fleet rescue and salvage vessels serving in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]]. These vessels would later all become Coast Guard cutters.\n\n''Shackle''{{'}}s first station was at [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]], where she served as a salvage ship in the West Pacific throughout the remainder of World War II. ''Shackle''{{'}}s first year was spent completing extensive salvage assignments clearing wreckage in the channels at Pearl Harbor and [[Midway Island]]. The vessel spent the rest of the year in [[Guam]], [[Eniwetok]], [[Tinian]] and [[Saipan]].<ref name=\"Service' 1994\">USCGC Fiftieth Anniversary pamphlet ''USCGC Acushnet Over 50 Years of Service'' dated 1994.</ref>\n\nOn February 15, 1945, ''Shackle'' sailed for the invasion of Iwo Jima where it successfully completed over 44 diving and salvage assignments. One of these was the battle repair of {{USS|Terry|DD-513|6}} which was hit by a Japanese shore battery. During March 1945, ''Shackle'' served as a supporting unit for the [[Okinawa]] invasion. Between D-Day (April 1, 1945) and September 20, 1945, the ship completed 55 salvage and rescue operations on larger naval craft damaged by kamikaze attacks. There were 108 general alarms during the period.<ref name=\"Service' 1994\"/>\n\n''Shackle'' was also assigned to mine sweeping operations in the [[East China Sea]] where over 200 enemy mines of all types were sunk or destroyed. ''Shackle'' also cleared the vital docking area of the wreckage of sunken Japanese cable laying ship at [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka Naval Base]], [[Tokyo Bay]], Japan. During all of these operations the ''Shackle'' suffered no damage or casualties. As part of her service in the Pacific Theater Shakle received three World War II battle stars, the [[WWII Victory Medal]], the [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]], the [[American Campaign Medal]], and the [[Navy Occupation Service Medal]].\n\nOn August 23, 1946 USS ''Shackle'' was commissioned into the [[United States Coast Guard]] as USCGC ''Acushnet'' (WAT-167), a search and rescue vessel and was homeported in [[Portland, Maine]].\n<gallery>\nImage:Oninawa_zoom.jpg|Close-up of USS ''Shackle'' at Okinawa during World War II\nImage:USS_SHACKLE_ARS9_During_WWII.jpeg|USS ''Shackle'' circa 1944.\nImage:Shackle_ARS9_hardhat_Diver.jpeg|Ship Fitter (First Class) Jack B.

She remained at [[San Diego, California]], until ordered to [[San Francisco, California]], where, on 29 June, she was decommissioned and transferred to the Coast Guard. First homeported in [[Portland, Maine]] as a Coast Guard tug, and renamed USCGC ''Acushnet'' (WAT-167), she earned a sound reputation as a dependable friend to fishermen and boaters in distress.\n\n==North East and International Ice Patrol Service - 1946 to 1968==\nWhile in Portland, Maine ''Acushnet'' became a friend to the maritime community with her search-and-rescue endeavors. While in Maine, ''Acushnet'' not only served as a vessel for SAR, but also as part of the International Ice Patrol. ''Acushnet'' and her role in the International Ice patrol was featured in the April 22nd 1957 edition of Life Magazine.<ref>[[Life (magazine)|Life]] (1957, April 22) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jUkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA30&dq=life%20Apr%2022%201957&lr&as_brr=0&as_pt=MAGAZINES&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=true Icy Menace in the North Atlantic: The International Patrol warms all shipping away from the worst invasion of big bergs in years. ''Life'' Vol 42, No 16, pages 56-58]</ref> Between 1946 and 1959, ''Acushnet'' responded to a major fire in Bar Harbor, Maine, salvaged a vessel that ran aground in the Kennebec River, and assisted two tankers that broke in half during a violent storm.\n\nOn 18 February 1952, ''Acushnet'' participated in what is listed as the ten most significant Coast Guard rescues. Two [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]], {{SS|Pendleton}} and {{SS|Fort Mercer}}, split in two in a fierce storm off [[Cape Cod]], and ''Acushnet'' took 18 men off the stern of ''Fort Mercer'' in heavy seas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/Pendleton_Mercer_Stancliff.asp|title=The ''Fort Mercer'' and ''Pendleton'' Rescues|publisher=USCG website|accessdate=2011-04-16}}</ref>  The ships collided twice and the merchant seamen jumped to the safety of ''Acushnet''{{'}}s fantail.<ref>Tougias, Michael, ''The Coast Guard's Most Daring Sea Rescue''</ref>\n\nIn the year 1950, ''Acushnet'' became active in the International Ice Patrol and spent a total of seven patrol months sharing that responsibility with the cutters ''Androscoggin'' and ''Evergreen''. ''Acushnet''{{'}}s salvage gear was removed in late 1959 and replaced with search-and-rescue gear. From 1960 to 1968 ''Acushnet'' completed four towing missions for over {{convert|950|mi}}, assisted a vessel that broke in two, escorted four disabled vessels and assisted in two medevacs. A few of ''Acushnet''{{'}}s more noteworthy cases during that time frame include the following: in 1960, it salvaged the 300-ton USCGC ''General Greene'' which had been driven one hundred yards ashore in high winds. One of her more dramatic cases in Portland included the rescue of the entire crew of ten people from the disabled seagoing dredge ''Cartagena'', which was adrift in {{convert|30|ft|adj=on}} seas and {{convert|75|kn|adj=on}} winds {{convert|200|nmi}} off of Cape Cod on Christmas Day, 1961. In May 1963, ''Acushnet'' salvaged a crashed Coast Guard helicopter {{convert|600|yd}} off Duxbury Beach, Massachusetts.\n\nThe fall of 1967 took ''Acushnet'' south, where the cutter rescued a Cuban refugee from a distressed {{convert|17|ft|adj=on}} pleasure craft {{convert|50|nmi}} south of Key West, Florida.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:USCGC Acushnet (WAT-167) underway on 9 September 1947 (CB 072947-5).jpg|USCGC ''Acushnet'' circa the 1950s\nImage:ACU_50s_ice_berg.jpg|USCGC ''Acushnet'' while conducting an International Ice Patrol\n</gallery>\n\n==Redesignated as an oceanographic ship - 1968 to 1971==\nRedesignated an [[oceanographic]] ship, WAGO-167, on July 8, 1968 and assigned to oceanographic, [[meteorological]], and polar operations, she commenced duties as a research support ship. During fiscal year 1970, she underwent conversion during which alterations were made to her hull and scientific equipment, and research and storage spaces were added at a shipyard in [[San Diego, California]]. As part of the National Data Buoy Project of NOAA ''Acushnet'' spent three years attached to the Office of Naval Research and the Scripps Oceanographic Institute in San Diego, California. Her primary mission on eleven extended deployments through June 1971, the cutter aided in positioning buoys. While serving as a WAGO, ''Acushnet'' assisted in only one rescue case a medevac in 1970.\n\n==Caribbean service \u2013 1971 to 1990==\nIn July 1971, ''Acushnet'' transferred to the [[Gulf Coast]]; and, based at [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], she continued her oceanographic work with the [[National Data Buoy Center]], this time aiding the Mississippi Test Facility. On August 24, 1971 ''Acushnet'', affectionately known to the crew a \"NOAA's Ark\", arrived in Gulfport with 64 crew and a 100-ton buoy that was towed from San Diego as its first new support assignment.\n\nOnce established in Gulfport, ''Acushnet'' continued to play a diverse and important role in the search-and-rescue mission. In the fall of 1973 the cutter played a major role in the ''Key Largo'' fire south of New Orleans opposite the town of Phoenix. ''Acushnet'' was again called to respond after a collision on the Mississippi River. ''Acushnet'' and the cutter ''Dependable'' were presented the Coast Guard Unit Commendation for extinguishing a fire on the tanker ''Key Trader'' after it collided with another vessel, the Norwegian ore ship ''Baune'', and burst into flames in the river.\n\nBetween the years 1975 and 1978, ''Acushnet'' conducted search-and-rescue research of the Gulf of Mexico shelf area, conducted the first marriage on board a Coast Guard vessel since the mid-19th century, and made her first drug seizure of 18 tons of marijuana and 21 smugglers.\n\nIn late 1978, the cutter embarked on a patrol to participate in the Global Weather Experiment, 140-nation effort to gather worldwide weather information. In 82 days, ''Acushnet'' covered over {{convert|18,000|mi}} from Peru to New Zealand. For this operation ''Acushnet'' received the Meritorious Unit Commendation. Additionally in 1978, ''Acushnet'' was designated a Medium Endurance Cutter (WMEC 167) and was formally assigned law enforcement and search-and-rescue missions.\n\nIn August\u2013September 1979, Mobile, Alabama, was hit by [[Hurricane Frederick]] while ''Acushnet'' was there in drydock, although no damage occurred to the cutter. Her first patrol out of drydock was immediately canceled and ''Acushnet'' was sent to pick up survivors of a collision between an oil tanker and a merchant vessel.\n\nFrom May 17 to June 6, 1980, ''Acushnet'' participated in the largest immigration crisis in the history of the Coast Guard, the [[Mariel Boat Lift]] from Cuba. The cutter escorted the vessel ''Red Diamond'' with 800 refugees into Key West. In addition, she assisted 35 boats, aided 120 refugees directly, and fueled two 41-foot Coast Guard boats. For her efforts, the cutter received the Humanitarian Service Award. During its time in Gulfport, ''Acushnet'' interdicted nearly 200 Cuban and Haitian refugees, retrieving some of them from shark-infested waters.\n\nDrug interdiction during the rest of the '80s 'proved to be successful. In 1980, ''Acushnet'' seized 52 tons of marijuana. Between September and November of the same year, ''Acushnet'' confiscated marijuana on 7 vessels totaling a seizure of over 76 tons. Between 1987 and 1989 ''Acushnet'' had yet two more seizures of marijuana and hashish oil valued at over 1.5 million. m/v ''Blind Melon'' and sloop ''Stormy Weather''. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==West Coast service - 1990 to 1998==\n''Acushnet'' moved to Eureka, California in July 1990. During a September patrol, a lookout spotted floating objects in the water. These \"objects\" were the three crew members of the fishing boat ''Miss Patty'', which had capsized before it could radio for help. During Operation Sandtrap in July 1991, ''Acushnet'' intercepted the sailing vessel ''Malekula'' carrying twelve tons of hashish from Indochina. The cutter pulled 32 bales from the burning and sinking ''Malekula'', despite efforts by smugglers to scuttle the sailboat.\n\nIn October 1991, ''Acushnet'' made her first trip to the waters of Alaska. The cutter was diverted for two weeks to coordinate anti-pollution efforts when the 518-foot ''Hyundai No. 12'' ran hard aground near the Shumagin Islands. She also responded to a mayday call made by the fishing vessel ''Tonquin'' in the Gulf of Alaska, rescuing one man out of a five-man crew from stormy and frigid waters during a five-day search. The cutter coordinated a search involving several fishing boats and a tanker in the area. As a result, three additional crew members were rescued.\n\n==Alaska/Bering Sea Patrol service - 1999 to 2011==\nAs the majority of ''Acushnet''{{'}}s patrols became Alaska Patrols, in 1998 she moved to [[Ketchikan, Alaska]] where she was employed in law enforcement, fisheries, and search and rescue missions in Alaska. This considerably shortened her transit time to the Bering Sea.\n\nOn 23 February 2007 ''Acushnet'' was designated as the \"oldest commissioned cutter\" in the fleet following the decommissioning of USCGC ''Storis''. She carries gold hull numbers to show this distinction, and the formal title of \"Queen Of The Fleet\". She was scheduled for decommissioning in late 2008.

Created by [[Ken Sugimori]], Meowth first appeared in the video games [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] and subsequent sequels. In addition, it was one of the Pok\u00e9mon to get an Alolan Form variant of the Dark type. It now also has a Galarian Form, which is a Steel type. It later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Meowth is considered by many fans as Team Rocket's mascot because a Meowth that is able to speak a human language is a member of the Team Rocket Trio, together with two Team Rocket grunts called Jessie and James. Meowth is voiced by Inuko Inuyama in Japanese, and by [[Nathan Price]] (dub episodes 1-32), [[Maddie Blaustein]] (dub episodes 33-419), and [[Jimmy Zoppi|James Carter Cathcart]] (dub episodes 420 - current) in English.\nin episode 380 of pok\u00e9mon of the original series a guest character by the name \u201cAland Hassan\u201d came in and killed meowth via guillotine\n\nKnown as the Scratch [[Cat]] Pok\u00e9mon, it spends most of the daytime sleeping and prowls the city streets at night. Meowth evolves into Persian in Kanto and Alola and [[Perrserker]] in Galar. Meowth is among the most recognizable Pok\u00e9mon, largely because it is a [[Fictional character|central character]] in the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime]] series. This particular Meowth, belonging to Team Rocket, the anime's main [[antagonist]]s, is one of the few Pok\u00e9mon that have the ability to speak [[human language]]. The episode \"Go West Young Meowth\" shows the character's backstory, in which Meowth attempted to impress a female Meowth called Meowzie ({{nihongo|'''Madonnya'''|\u30de\u30c9\u30f3\u30cb\u30e3|Madonnya}} in Japanese version) by teaching himself how to walk on two legs and speak [[English language|English]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2236659/pokemon-civil-rights/|work=[[MTV.com]]|title=21 Burning Questions About Civil Rights in the Pok\u00e9mon World|last=McNally|first=Victoria|date=2015-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-weirdest-mysteries-in-the-pokemon-universe/1100-6423313/|work=[[Gamespot]]|title=The Weirdest Mysteries in the Pok\u00e9mon Universe|last=Rougeau|first=Michael|date=2014-11-22}}</ref>\n\nIn the English version of the franchise, he is given a [[Brooklyn accent]].

Created by [[Ken Sugimori]], Meowth first appeared in the video games [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] and subsequent sequels. In addition, it was one of the Pok\u00e9mon to get an Alolan Form variant of the Dark type. It now also has a Galarian Form, which is a Steel type. It later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Meowth is considered by many fans as Team Rocket's mascot because a Meowth that is able to speak a human language is a member of the Team Rocket Trio, together with two Team Rocket grunts called Jessie and James. Meowth is voiced by Inuko Inuyama in Japanese, and by [[Nathan Price]] (dub episodes 1-32), [[Maddie Blaustein]] (dub episodes 33-419), and [[Jimmy Zoppi|James Carter Cathcart]] (dub episodes 420 - current) in English.\n\nKnown as the Scratch [[Cat]] Pok\u00e9mon, it spends most of the daytime sleeping and prowls the city streets at night. Meowth evolves into Persian in Kanto and Alola and [[Perrserker]] in Galar. Meowth is among the most recognizable Pok\u00e9mon, largely because it is a [[Fictional character|central character]] in the [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime]] series. This particular Meowth, belonging to Team Rocket, the anime's main [[antagonist]]s, is one of the few Pok\u00e9mon that have the ability to speak [[human language]]. The episode \"Go West Young Meowth\" shows the character's backstory, in which Meowth attempted to impress a female Meowth called Meowzie ({{nihongo|'''Madonnya'''|\u30de\u30c9\u30f3\u30cb\u30e3|Madonnya}} in Japanese version) by teaching himself how to walk on two legs and speak [[English language|English]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2236659/pokemon-civil-rights/|work=[[MTV.com]]|title=21 Burning Questions About Civil Rights in the Pok\u00e9mon World|last=McNally|first=Victoria|date=2015-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-weirdest-mysteries-in-the-pokemon-universe/1100-6423313/|work=[[Gamespot]]|title=The Weirdest Mysteries in the Pok\u00e9mon Universe|last=Rougeau|first=Michael|date=2014-11-22}}</ref>\n\nIn the English version of the franchise, he is given a [[Brooklyn accent]].
