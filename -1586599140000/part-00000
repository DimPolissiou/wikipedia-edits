It is ascribed to the [[Ibadi]]s, with their cultural identity originally traced to the [[Maghreb]]; they had their capital at Tahert as an Ibadi Kingdom. They were forced to leave Tahert consequent to a devastating fire in 909 (it is reported that destruction was caused by the founder of the (Shi'ite) [[Fatimid Dynasty]]<ref name=world/>). They first moved to Sedrata and finally to the M'Zab valley. They settled in five fortified villages located on rocky outcrops, known locally as \u201cKosars\u201d, although they could have lived in one larger village encompassing all the five. The habitation was planned with meticulous details to precise layouts defined by set principles of community living within a defensive environment.  Gharda\u00efa's foundation has been dated to 1048<ref>http://www.opvm.dz/public/opvm/catalogue/index/id/dc673ccd14b3f39992e5e70652d70fef Office de protection et de promotion de la vall\u00e9e du M'Zab</ref> or 1053.<ref>http://www.monographie.caci.dz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=77 Chambre alg\u00e9rienne de commerce et d'industrie</ref>\n\nEach village was planned in a diverse topography comprising a small island, a ridge, a hilltop, a peak and a recess. The villages were fortified in such a manner that they were inaccessible to the nomadic groups. The five villages set up with identical planning concepts were Gharda\u00efa, Melika, Beni Isguen, Bou Noura and El Atteuf. The identical \u201cminiature citadels\u201d, as they are termed, each had their own mosque with minaret functioning as watch towers, and the houses built around the mosque in concentric circles and surrounded by a high walls (extending up to the ramparts). The buildings together gave the feel of a fortress to each village. The mosque also provided for storage of grains and arms for defence.<ref name=Unesco/><ref name=Valley/><ref name=world/>\n\nHowever, during the summer season the inhabitants migrated to a \"citadel\" outside the fortified villages, in an informal setting of artificial palm grove, a [[cemetery]] and a mosque.<ref name=world/>\n\nThe ksar was created in 476/1085 by two tribes : the Aoulad Ammi-A\u00efssa and the Aoulad Ba-Slimane. Each of those two tribes contained different fractions, a specific area and a cemetery'''<ref name=\":0\" />'''. Gharda\u00efa is the richest city of the M'Zab Vall\u00e9e. It already had a dynamic commercial and craft activity. On the social aspect, it is the only Ksar, along with Melika, that housed not only Ibadites Berbers, but also Malekits Arabs and a Jewish community until the Algerian Independance.\n\nTo build the Ksar, the founders of Gharda\u00efa, a small group of people, under a Cheikh, chose a hill 200m South from the M'Zab Oued for defensive purposes. More on the West, they created a palm grove for subsistence farming. The Ksar of Gharda\u00efa, as it is today, did not appear in one time. According to the public agency in charge of protecting the M'Zab Heritage, Gharda\u00efa has seen four phases of evolution until 1882, when it was annexed by the french army in 1882.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.secheresse.info/spip.php?article91042|title=\u00c9volution du trac\u00e9 urbain des ksour de la vall\u00e9e du M\u2019Zab : d\u2019el-Ateuf \u00e0 Tafilelt, sauvegarde d\u2019un patrimoine mill\u00e9naire|last=Ali Khodja|first=Mehdi|date=15 July 2019|website=secheresse.info/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Gharda\u00efa commune map.png|thumb|upright=1.40|Map of major settlements within the province of Gharda\u00efa]]\nThe city is located within the [[Sahara Desert]] in northern-central Algeria. [[Gharda\u00efa Province]] is divided into 13 [[communes of Algeria|''communes'']] or municipalities, which includes the Gharda\u00efa municipality. It is bordered by Ouargla and El Bayadh Wilayas. It is nestled in the [[M'zab]] valley, lying on the left bank of the [[Wadi Mzab]], which is commonly dry throughout the year. The commune of Gharda\u00efa now covers an area of {{convert|590|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and includes a number of suburbs, towns and villages in addition to Gharda\u00efa. Suburb settlements include [[M\u00e9lika]], [[B\u00e9ni Isguen]], [[Bounoura]] (Has Bunur) and [[El Atteuf]] (Tadjnint), all of which lie to the southeast of Gharda\u00efa city and the ancient [[ksar]] of [[Metlili|Metlili-Chaamba]] or Metlili which lies {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southwest.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Outside of the Mzab valley, [[Berriane]] (Has Ibergane) and [[El Guerrara]] (Iguerraren) are towns of note, the first {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north, and the second {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northeast.\n\n===Hydrology===\nGharda\u00efa's ancient water distribution system was devised by the Mozabites, as a response to the ephemeral flows of its oueds (rivers). Realising the preciousness of this natural resource, the Mozabites developed a unique hydraulic system of tunnels to harvest rainwater and divert it to the oases. They have an equitable water distribution to all gardens and also maintain good flood protection measures.<ref name=\"Ham & Luckham & Sattin\"/><ref name=\"Mozambite\"/> The water supply is accessed in a number of ways through a complex irrigation system that distributes water from many wells.<ref name=\"Tilouine\"/> Well drilling extends to a depth ranging from {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, drawing the water from the [[Albian]] fossil groundwater continental infill whose reserves are estimated at 1.5 trillion m<sup>3</sup>.\n\n==Climate==\nGharda\u00efa has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The region is marked by large temperature differences between day and night, and summer and winter ranging from lows of 5&nbsp;\u00b0C (41&nbsp;\u00b0F)  to highs of 46&nbsp;\u00b0C (114.8&nbsp;\u00b0F). The prevailing winds of summer are extremely hot, extremely dry and strong and those of winter are warm and dry. Sandstorms generally occur from March to May.

The houses in particular are oriented in such a way that it admits sunlight into every dwelling, as this is strongly believed to be healthy: \"Inhabitants of the house where sun comes in will never see a doctor\".

It is ascribed to the [[Ibadi]]s, with their cultural identity originally traced to the [[Maghreb]]; they had their capital at Tahert as an Ibadi Kingdom. They were forced to leave Tahert consequent to a devastating fire in 909 (it is reported that destruction was caused by the founder of the (Shi'ite) [[Fatimid Dynasty]]<ref name=world/>). They first moved to Sedrata and finally to the M'Zab valley. They settled in five fortified villages located on rocky outcrops, known locally as \u201cKosars\u201d, although they could have lived in one larger village encompassing all the five. The habitation was planned with meticulous details to precise layouts defined by set principles of community living within a defensive environment.  Gharda\u00efa's foundation has been dated to 1048<ref>http://www.opvm.dz/public/opvm/catalogue/index/id/dc673ccd14b3f39992e5e70652d70fef Office de protection et de promotion de la vall\u00e9e du M'Zab</ref> or 1053.<ref>http://www.monographie.caci.dz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=77 Chambre alg\u00e9rienne de commerce et d'industrie</ref>\n\nEach village was planned in a diverse topography comprising a small island, a ridge, a hilltop, a peak and a recess. The villages were fortified in such a manner that they were inaccessible to the nomadic groups. The five villages set up with identical planning concepts were Gharda\u00efa, Melika, Beni Isguen, Bou Noura and El Atteuf. The identical \u201cminiature citadels\u201d, as they are termed, each had their own mosque with minaret functioning as watch towers, and the houses built around the mosque in concentric circles and surrounded by a high walls (extending up to the ramparts). The buildings together gave the feel of a fortress to each village. The mosque also provided for storage of grains and arms for defence.<ref name=Unesco/><ref name=Valley/><ref name=world/> \n\nHowever, during the summer season the inhabitants migrated to a \"citadel\" outside the fortified villages, in an informal setting of artificial palm grove, a [[cemetery]] and a mosque.<ref name=world/>\n\nThe ksar was created in 476/1085 by two tribes : the Aoulad Ammi-A\u00efssa and the Aoulad Ba-Slimane. Each of those two tribes contained different fractions, a specific area and a cemetery'''<ref name=\":0\" />'''. Gharda\u00efa is the richest city of the M'Zab Vall\u00e9e. It already had a dynamic commercial and craft activity. On the social aspect, it is the only Ksar, along with Melika, that housed not only Ibadites Berbers, but also Malekits Arabs and a Jewish community until the Algerian Independance.\n\nTo build the Ksar, the founders of Gharda\u00efa, a small group of people, under a Cheikh, chose a hill 200m South from the M'Zab Oued for defensive purposes. More on the West, they created a palm grove for subsistence farming. The Ksar of Gharda\u00efa, as it is today, did not appear in one time. According to the public agency in charge of protecting the M'Zab Heritage, Gharda\u00efa has seen four phases of evolution until 1882, when it was annexed by the french army in 1882<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.secheresse.info/spip.php?article91042|title=\u00c9volution du trac\u00e9 urbain des ksour de la vall\u00e9e du M\u2019Zab : d\u2019el-Ateuf \u00e0 Tafilelt, sauvegarde d\u2019un patrimoine mill\u00e9naire|last=Ali Khodja|first=Mehdi|date=15 July 2019|website=http://www.secheresse.info/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Gharda\u00efa commune map.png|thumb|upright=1.40|Map of major settlements within the province of Gharda\u00efa]]\nThe city is located within the [[Sahara Desert]] in northern-central Algeria. [[Gharda\u00efa Province]] is divided into 13 [[communes of Algeria|''communes'']] or municipalities, which includes the Gharda\u00efa municipality. It is bordered by Ouargla and El Bayadh Wilayas. It is nestled in the [[M'zab]] valley, lying on the left bank of the [[Wadi Mzab]], which is commonly dry throughout the year. The commune of Gharda\u00efa now covers an area of {{convert|590|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and includes a number of suburbs, towns and villages in addition to Gharda\u00efa. Suburb settlements include [[M\u00e9lika]], [[B\u00e9ni Isguen]], [[Bounoura]] (Has Bunur) and [[El Atteuf]] (Tadjnint), all of which lie to the southeast of Gharda\u00efa city and the ancient [[ksar]] of [[Metlili|Metlili-Chaamba]] or Metlili which lies {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southwest.{{fact|date=November 2019}} Outside of the Mzab valley, [[Berriane]] (Has Ibergane) and [[El Guerrara]] (Iguerraren) are towns of note, the first {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the north, and the second {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the northeast.\n\n===Hydrology===\nGharda\u00efa's ancient water distribution system was devised by the Mozabites, as a response to the ephemeral flows of its oueds (rivers). Realising the preciousness of this natural resource, the Mozabites developed a unique hydraulic system of tunnels to harvest rainwater and divert it to the oases. They have an equitable water distribution to all gardens and also maintain good flood protection measures.<ref name=\"Ham & Luckham & Sattin\"/><ref name=\"Mozambite\"/> The water supply is accessed in a number of ways through a complex irrigation system that distributes water from many wells.<ref name=\"Tilouine\"/> Well drilling extends to a depth ranging from {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, drawing the water from the [[Albian]] fossil groundwater continental infill whose reserves are estimated at 1.5 trillion m<sup>3</sup>.\n\n==Climate==\nGharda\u00efa has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''BWh''), with extremely hot summers and mild winters. The region is marked by large temperature differences between day and night, and summer and winter ranging from lows of 5&nbsp;\u00b0C (41&nbsp;\u00b0F)  to highs of 46&nbsp;\u00b0C (114.8&nbsp;\u00b0F). The prevailing winds of summer are extremely hot, extremely dry and strong and those of winter are warm and dry. Sandstorms generally occur from March to May. In October 2008, Gharda\u00efa was severely affected by flooding due to heavy rain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7648355.stm|title=Deadly floods hit Algerian oasis|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 February 2013|date=2008-10-02}}</ref>\n\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Gharda\u00efa\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 16.3\n|Feb high C = 19.0\n|Mar high C = 22.3\n|Apr high C = 26.5\n|May high C = 31.5\n|Jun high C = 37.2\n|Jul high C = 40.4\n|Aug high C = 39.8\n|Sep high C = 34.5\n|Oct high C = 28.2\n|Nov high C = 21.3\n|Dec high C = 17.3\n|year high C = 27.9\n|Jan mean C = 10.9\n|Feb mean C = 13.2\n|Mar mean C = 16.3\n|Apr mean C = 20.1\n|May mean C = 25.0\n|Jun mean C = 30.4\n|Jul mean C = 33.5\n|Aug mean C = 33.1\n|Sep mean C = 28.3\n|Oct mean C = 22.4\n|Nov mean C = 15.9\n|Dec mean C = 12.0\n|year mean C = 21.8\n|Jan low C = 5.5\n|Feb low C = 7.4\n|Mar low C = 10.2\n|Apr low C = 13.6\n|May low C = 18.4\n|Jun low C = 23.6\n|Jul low C = 26.5\n|Aug low C = 26.4\n|Sep low C = 22.1\n|Oct low C = 16.6\n|Nov low C = 10.5\n|Dec low C = 6.7\n|year low C = 15.6\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 8.2\n|Feb precipitation mm = 4.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 8.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 6.8\n|May precipitation mm = 4.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 2.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 0.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 3.1\n|Sep precipitation mm = 11.4\n|Oct precipitation mm = 7.3\n|Nov precipitation mm = 12.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 5.4\n|year precipitation mm = 75.0\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 2.6\n|Feb precipitation days = 1.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 2.5\n|Apr precipitation days = 1.7\n|May precipitation days = 1.8\n|Jun precipitation days = 1.4\n|Jul precipitation days = 0.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 1.1\n|Sep precipitation days = 2.8\n|Oct precipitation days = 2.4\n|Nov precipitation days = 2.8\n|Dec precipitation days = 2.0\n|year precipitation days = 23.6\n|Jan humidity = 54.4\n|Feb humidity = 45.0\n|Mar humidity = 39.8\n|Apr humidity = 35.1\n|May humidity = 30.5\n|Jun humidity = 25.9\n|Jul humidity = 22.3\n|Aug humidity = 25.9\n|Sep humidity = 36.9\n|Oct humidity = 45.0\n|Nov humidity = 50.2\n|Dec humidity = 54.7\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]] (average temperatures and precipitation, 1976\u20132005)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=1360|title=World Weather Information Service\u2013Ghardaia|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=21 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"climatebase\">{{cite web|url=http://climatebase.ru/station/60566/?lang=en|title=Ghardaia, Algeria|publisher=Climatebase.ru|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref>}}\n\n==Layout and architecture==\nThe unique layout of the Gharda\u00efa village is dictated by the rocky terrain of the region.

Built in 1907 by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Sir W.G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co Ltd]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], United Kingdom, she was the third state-owned icebreaker of Finland and the last Finnish steam-powered icebreaker to remain in service. When ''Tarmo'' was decommissioned in 1970, a decision was made to preserve the vessel as a [[museum ship]]. After a long wait in [[Helsinki]], ''Tarmo'' was towed to [[Kotka]] and completely restored in the early 1990s.\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\n[[File:Tarmo 1907.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Tarmo'' at Armstrong Whitworth shipyard before launching.]]\n\nThe number of merchant ships calling at Finnish ports and requiring icebreaker assistance during the winter months had increased steadily since the first Finnish state-owned icebreakers, [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] and [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']], were built in the 1890s. In 1902 General [[Nikolai Sj\u00f6man]], the director of the [[Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority]], made a proposal to the [[Senate of Finland]] for the construction of the third state-owned icebreaker. While reluctant at first, in May 1906 the Senate announced that the old ''Murtaja'' could be replaced with a new icebreaker and a call for bids was sent to a number of suitable shipyards. On 4 September 1906 a decision was made to order a new icebreaker even though no buyer had been found for the old ''Murtaja''.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\nBy 1 November 1906 [[Tendering|tender]]s for the construction of a new icebreaker, similar to but slightly larger than ''Sampo'', had been received from four European shipyards. The most expensive tender, 1,608,900 [[Finnish markka]]s (FIM), was given by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]] from Germany. It was followed by [[Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth & Co Ltd]] from England (FIM 1,575,000), [[Gourlay Brothers Ship Builders of Dundee]] from [[Scotland]] (FIM 1,432,500), and [[Burmeister & Wain]] from [[Denmark]] (FIM 1,422,500). When a fifth tender for FIM 1,485,000 was received from the English shipbuilder [[Hawthorn Leslie and Company|R. & W. Hawthorn Leslie and Company]] nine days after the deadline, Armstrong Whitworth lowered their bid by 100,000 markkas to FIM 1,475,000. [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard]] was also asked to participate in the call for tenders, but the domestic shipbuilding was not yet ready to accept such demanding projects and there were difficulties in acquiring and importing steel suitable for icebreakers.<ref name=\"pohjanpalo143\">Pohjanpalo 1978, p. 143.</ref><ref>Ramsay 1949, p. 285.</ref> The tenders were evaluated by an expert committee appointed by the Senate and, after careful consideration, the icebreaker offered by Armstrong Whitworth turned out to be the most suitable. A number of changes were proposed to the original design including moving the bow propeller slightly abaft and upwards to protect it from grounding and improve the icebreaking characteristics of the ship by reducing the stem angle to 20 degrees. The shipbuilding contract was signed on 15 February 1907, and with the proposed changes the price of the vessel was 1,631,548.81 Finnish markkas.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\nThe new icebreaker was launched on 9 September 1907 and given the name ''Tarmo'', meaning \"vigor\" and \"spirit\" in the [[Finnish language]]. The ship was delivered on 17 December 1907 and on 30 December she left Newcastle under the command of Captain [[Leonard Mel\u00e1n]] and headed down the [[River Tyne]] to [[Hanko]], Finland, where she arrived on 3 January 1908.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n''Tarmo'' was officially commissioned on 4 January 1908. Leonard Mel\u00e1n was replaced by Captain [[Johan Rosqvist]], an experienced winter navigator known for his ability to predict the movements of ice fields with almost supernatural accuracy. However, the winter of 1908 was relatively mild and there was hardly any ice to break before the end of February.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" /> When the icebreaking capability of the new vessel could finally be assessed, it was found out that the new ship was not as maneuverable as the smaller and less powerful ''Sampo'', and the changes made to the original design did not improve her performance. However, despite the shortcomings ''Tarmo'' was still a valuable addition to the state-owned icebreaker fleet, and after a number of changes her icebreaking characteristics were in par with ''Sampo''.<ref name=\"laurell82-85\">Laurell 1992, pp. 82\u201385.</ref>\n\nIn May 1908, ''Tarmo'' was sent for the first time to the [[Bothnian Bay]] to open the harbors and fairways for the spring. On 2 June, she was run hard aground near [[Raahe]] due to an error by a [[maritime pilot|pilot]] when navigating by sight, resulting in extensive damage to the bottom plating and a lost propeller blade. Kept afloat by her own pumps, she returned to Raahe for emergency repairs and continued to Helsinki, where she was drydocked from 7 June until early August.<ref name=\"laurell82-85\" /> In 1912 she was again run aground near Hanko, but the damage was not as extensive as on the first time.<ref name=\"laurell88-89\">Laurell 1992, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1910s, ''Tarmo'' assisted ships to the port of Helsinki and moved to Hanko with ''Sampo'' after the New Year. As the spring approached, she was sent first to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] and finally to the eastern part of the [[Gulf of Finland]] to open the ports for the spring. However, during the winter months the icebreakers were not sent beyond Vaasa, partially due to the grounding of ''Tarmo'' outside Raahe in 1908.<ref name=\"laurell88-89\" />\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nIn August 1914 [[Russian Empire|Russia]] joined the First World War and navigating in the Baltic Sea became dangerous due to [[naval mine]]s and [[Kaiserliche Marine|German]] [[U-boat]]s. The Finnish icebreakers were placed under the command of the [[Baltic Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and given the task of assisting naval ships and troop transportations in the Gulf of Finland. Despite the harsh winters, icebreaker assistance to merchant vessels was largely neglected, and several ships were destroyed by ice.<ref name=\"laurell91\">Laurell 1992, p. 91.</ref> The Russians armed ''Tarmo'' with one 47&nbsp;mm deck gun.<ref name=\"anttila\" />\n\n=== Finnish Civil War ===\n\nWhen the [[Parliament of Finland]] accepted the declaration of independence given by the Senate on 6 December 1917, the state-owned icebreakers under Finnish command raised the [[Flag of Finland|colours of the independent Finland]] for the first time. However, when the [[Red Guard (Finland)|Red Guard]] took over Helsinki and the [[Finnish Civil War]] began on 27 January 1918, ''Tarmo'' was still under Russian command. After negotiations with the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] it was agreed that the Finnish icebreaker would be returned once the evacuation of the Russian forces \u2013 later known as the [[Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet]] \u2014 had been completed.<ref name=\"laurell99101\">Laurell 1992, pp. 99\u2013101.</ref> However, after an attempt to evacuate the remaining members of the Senate from the occupied city by air had failed, Lieutenant [[Yrj\u00f6 Roos]] was given an order to capture ''Tarmo'' from the Russians and bring her to a safe harbour at the Gulf of Bothnia. When the Germans captured the city of [[Tallinn]] on the other side of the Gulf of Finland, it was decided to take ''Tarmo'' there.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\" />\n\n''Tarmo'' had a crew of 42 under the command of Acting Captain [[Hjalmar Kauppi]] and eight armed Russian sailors commanded by Lieutenant [[Nicolai Telegin]]. After both commanders agreed with the takeover, Telegin obtained a forged travel order for ''Tarmo'' to head to the Gulf of Finland on 3 March 1918 to assist icebound Soviet transport ships. He also sent two of his soldiers ashore, reducing the number of enemy soldiers to six. Shortly before the departure, Roos brought Senators [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]], the future [[President of Finland]], and [[Jalmar Castr\u00e9n]] to ''Tarmo'' disguised as engineers who had arrived to investigate ships damaged by ice. A small number of capturers had also hidden themselves on board the icebreaker on the previous night.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\" />\n\nWhen the icebreaker was near the island of [[Aegna]], the Finnish capturers cut the wireless antennas and stormed the Russian troops. Within minutes, the soldiers had been overpowered without casualties on either side and the ship was turned towards Tallinn. When a German plane was spotted approaching the ship, the capturers panicked as the largely red temporary state flag of Finland could be mistaken for the red Soviet revolutionary flag, and hastily replaced it with a large white [[tablecloth]].<ref>[http://www.klubi.fi/klubilehti/klubilehti22008.pdf Senaattori Svinhufvud laivakaapparina].

Helsingin Suomalainen Klubi. {{retrieved | accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref> The German pilot later commented that he would have attacked ''Tarmo'' had he not dropped all his bombs on the [[Icebreaker Yermak|Soviet icebreaker ''Yermak'']] earlier that day.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\" />\n\n''Tarmo'' was placed under German command and her armament was increased by two 75&nbsp;mm deck guns. In addition to transporting German troops to [[Naissaar]], she also participated in mine clearing operations in the Estonian west coast. On 25 March 1918, after the Finnish Senate had accepted military assistance from Germany, ''Tarmo'' was ordered to transport Finnish and German soldiers to the island of [[Suursaari]]. On 31 March, after having been immobilized by drifting ice for several days, the crew of ''Tarmo'' spotted a black cloud of smoke coming from the east. When the approaching ship was recognized as ''Yermak'', the largest and most powerful Soviet icebreaker in service at that time, the deck guns were manned and around twenty shots were fired at the ship some {{convert|6|nmi}} away. ''Yermak'', which had been under fire from a coastal artillery battery at Lavansaari only a couple of days earlier, turned around and retreated without returning fire.<ref name=\"anttila\" /> This engagement has been considered the first time a naval ship flying the flag of independent Finland opened fire against an enemy ship.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\">Laurell 1992, pp. 108\u2013112.</ref>\n\nWhen ''Tarmo'' returned to Tallinn, her crew was surprised to see another large icebreaker flying the Finnish flag moored at the harbour. The Soviet icebreaker ''Volynets'' had been captured only two days earlier and renamed [[Suur T\u00f5ll (icebreaker)|''W\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']]. Both ships were used to transport 3,000 German soldiers \u2014 [[Detachment Brandenstein]] \u2014 to [[Loviisa]]. On 18 April 1918, ''Tarmo'' arrived in Helsinki and was handed back to the Finnish Board of Navigation.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\" />\n\n=== Interwar period ===\n\n[[File:Tarmo and Jaakarhu.jpg|thumb|right|Finnish state-owned icebreakers ''Tarmo'' and [[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu (icebreaker)|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'']]]]\nDuring the interwar period ''Tarmo'' was stationed at the Gulf of Finland, where in addition to assisting ships she often had to rescue local fishermen trapped on drifting ice floes.<ref name=\"laurell185-189\">Laurell 1992, pp. 185\u2013189.</ref> In early 1919 she was used for transporting volunteers to Tallinn to aid with the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. She also transported [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] to Stockholm and Copenhagen in February 1919.<ref name=\"laurell122\">Laurell 1992, p. 122.</ref>\n\nThe interwar period also saw the expansion of the Finnish icebreaker fleet, first by two large steam-powered icebreakers [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] and ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'', and finally by the diesel-electric [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']], which was the first large Finnish icebreaker built completely in Finland.<ref name=\"laurell190\">Laurell 1992, p. 190.</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\n==== Winter War ====\n[[File:Tarmo toisen maailmansodan aikaan Sagg\u00f6 Ahvenanmaa.jpg|thumb|Tarmo in camouflage in 1939.]]\nWhen relations with the [[Soviet Union]] deteriorated in late 1939, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers were again armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker flotilla.<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, pp. 259\u2013260.</ref> ''Tarmo'' had been fitted with gun mounts already in 1931, and shortly before the [[Winter War]] began she was armed with four [[120 mm 50 caliber Pattern 1905|{{convert|120|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} 50-caliber]] [[Vickers]] naval guns of Russian origin on two twin mounts. It was soon apparent that the guns, which were used on all large Finnish icebreakers, were not very suitable for naval use due to their relatively short range and slow rate of fire. On 11 January 1940, after spending the early days of the war near Turku, ''Tarmo'' was ordered to the Gulf of Finland because the ice conditions had become too severe for the smaller ''Murtaja''. When the two icebreakers met in Helsinki on 13 January, a [[Madsen 20 mm anti-aircraft cannon]] was moved from ''Murtaja'' to ''Tarmo''.<ref name=\"anttila\">Anttila 2008, pp. 80\u201391.</ref>\n\nAfter the Soviet troops had captured the island of [[Sommers]] in December 1939, a small transport ship had become trapped in ice near the island. On 16 January ''Tarmo'' was ordered to sink the ship, [[SS Kazakhstan|''Kazakhstan'']], before the Soviet icebreakers could release the icebound vessel. ''Tarmo'' left in the following night, but it was soon found out that the guns could not be aimed \u2013 when the temperature had dropped to {{convert|-40|C|F|abbr=on}}, the frozen storage grease had jammed the guns \u2013 and the icebreaker returned to Kotka. In the following night, after the guns had been thawed, ''Tarmo'' headed towards Sommers again. On the second sortie, she was also carrying 80 Finnish soldiers, who were to take back the island while the icebreaker bombarded the Soviet forces with her deck guns. When ''Tarmo'' was some ten miles from Sommers, her old rival from the previous war, the Soviet icebreaker ''Yermak'', was spotted on the western side of the island.<ref name=\"anttila\" /><ref name=\"laurell266-271\" />\n\nWhen a thick cloud of black smoke was spotted on ''Yermak'', the Soviet icebreaker turned back east without firing a shot and called in reinforcements \u2013 her crew had mistaken ''Tarmo'' for the [[Finnish coastal defence ship V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen|Finnish coastal defence ship ''V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']] and ordered an airstrike against the ship they thought to be the most powerful warship of the Finnish Navy. In the meantime ''Tarmo'' opened fire on ''Kazakhstan''. However, the guns malfunctioned again and only two shells were fired from the stern gun at the Soviet ship some seven miles away, both of which fell short. Continuing the naval engagement without operational guns was deemed futile and a decision was made to turn back to Kotka and return once the guns could be used again. On the way back the Soviet fighters and bombers attacked ''Tarmo'' several times, but none of the planes scored a hit on the Finnish icebreaker due to intense anti-aircraft fire. Around half past noon ''Tarmo'' arrived in Kotka and lunch was served for the crew.<ref name=\"anttila\" /><ref name=\"laurell266-271\">Laurell 1992, pp. 266\u2013271.</ref>\n\nAt 13:15 a lone Soviet bomber flying at {{convert|3000|m|ft}} dropped three {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bombs on ''Tarmo''. The first bomb missed the icebreaker and exploded harmlessly on ice in front of the ship, but the second hit the foredeck, destroying the anchors, and the third penetrated the wooden weather deck in front of the bridge and detonated on the tweendeck. The blast immediately killed 38 crew members and wounded ten, one of whom died later in hospital, and started a fire that quickly spread aft. By 18:00 the fire department had the blaze, which had ignited the ammunition stores and destroyed nearly all wooden parts from amidships aft, under control. The bow of ''Tarmo'' had been reduced to a pile of mangled pipes, twisted frames and torn plating, from which the twin barrels of the forward 120&nbsp;mm guns were pointing to the sky. Her forward engine room was full of water that had frozen around the steam engine.<ref name=\"anttila\" /><ref name=\"laurell266-271\" />\n\nDespite the devastating damage, ''Tarmo'' had not developed any leaks following the bombing. Furthermore, her boilers and stern engine were intact, and by 8 February her bow engine was running again as well. The damaged steel structures were cut at tweendeck level and the 120&nbsp;mm deck guns were removed. On 9 February ''Tarmo'' left for Helsinki for further repairs under her own power. However, as the wheelhouse had been destroyed, the helmsman was stationed in the aft engine room and the commands were shouted through the skylight. Due to the ever-present danger of Soviet airstrikes, ''Tarmo'' moved only at night and spent the days camouflaged. Since the navigational aids could not be lit up during the war, a ski patrol moved in front of the icebreaker and used flashlights and tree branches to guide the ship through the archipelago. ''Tarmo'' arrived at Hietalahti shipyard on 10 February.<ref name=\"anttila\" /> Her bow was rebuilt only to the tweendeck level, the cabin of the first mate was turned into a bomb shelter with {{convert|10|mm|in|1|adj=on}} armour plates, and the armament was increased by two [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40 mm guns]] and one 47&nbsp;mm gun.<ref name=\"laurell266-271\" />\n\nAfter the repairs were finished on 8 March 1940, ''Tarmo'' was ordered to [[Vyborg Bay]] to break ice in front of advancing Soviet troops and tanks. When the icebreaker left for the mission on 10 March, it was soon found out that her icebreaking capability had been significantly reduced, and by afternoon she had not even passed the fort of [[Suomenlinna]] outside Helsinki. The following day, after having been attacked by Soviet fighters several times, ''Tarmo'' turned back to Helsinki \u2013 she had advanced only {{convert|16|nmi}} in two days, but had nearly exhausted her coal stores and anti-aircraft munitions. When she arrived in Helsinki on 12 March 1940, the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] had been signed and the Winter War was over.<ref name=\"laurell266-271\" />\n\n==== Interim Peace ====\n\nDuring the period which later became known as the [[Interim Peace]], ''Tarmo'' was disarmed and her armour was removed. Already on 13 March 1940 she was sent to Hanko to open a channel to the icebound harbour, but was unable to break through the pack ice fields and had to return to Helsinki. Later most of the damage the icebreaker had suffered during the war was repaired. In addition to rebuilding the bridge, the crew accommodation was improved considerably.<ref name=\"laurell275-278\">Laurell 1992, pp. 275\u2013278.</ref>\n\n==== Continuation War ====\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] started in June 1941, the state-owned icebreakers were again armed and assigned to the icebreaker flotilla. After spending the summer months guarding fairways in the [[Archipelago Sea]], icebreakers ''Tarmo'' and ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' participated in [[Operation Nordwind (1941)|Operation Nordwind]] together with Finnish and German naval ships on 13 September 1941.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\">Laurell 1992, pp. 282\u2013290</ref> The joint Finnish-German distraction manoeuvre was a complete failure. Not only did it fail to achieve its goal \u2013 it is uncertain if the Soviet forces even noticed the fleet \u2013 but when the ships turned back, [[Paravane (weapon)|paravanes]] dragged a Soviet naval mine against the hull of [[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|Finnish coastal defence ship ''Ilmarinen'']], the flagship of the Finnish Navy, which sank in seven minutes following the explosion, claiming 271 lives.<ref>[http://koti.mbnet.fi/~karsikas/psl/ Panssarilaiva Ilmarisen tuho 13.9.1941]. {{retrieved |accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Soviet forces retreated from Hanko by the end of 1941 and the fighting moved outside the Finnish borders, the icebreaker flotilla was disbanded and ''Tarmo'' resumed her normal peacetime duties as an escort icebreaker. During the extremely difficult winter of 1942, ''Tarmo'' assisted 177 vessels and sailed {{convert|8957|nmi}}, more than any other Finnish icebreaker during the season. After saving the crew and cargo of German steamer [[SS Helgoland|''Helgoland'']], which was damaged by ice and later sank, Captain [[Yrj\u00f6 Malmi]] was awarded the [[Order of the German Eagle]] by [[Adolf Hitler]]. The winters of 1943 and 1944 were easier and several ports were kept open through the winter.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\" />\n\nAfter the Continuation War ended with the signing of the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944, Finland had to hand over the newest state-owned icebreakers, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' and ''Voima'', to the Soviet Union as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]]. Other icebreakers, including ''Tarmo'', were used to tow Soviet naval ships and submarines through the Finnish archipelago during the latter stages of the Second World War.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\" />\n\n=== Post-war years and decommissioning ===\n\nDuring the first post-war years the war-worn Finnish state-owned icebreaker fleet, reduced to four steam-powered icebreakers and the diesel-electric ''Sisu'', was overburdened with work. Due to the lack of modern tonnage, all available ships were taken into use, and during the winter months this meant a large number of older ships with low engine power and inadequate ice-strengthening. In 1946, ''Tarmo'' lost her rudder and the whole [[sternpost]] while assisting ships in the Archipelago Sea. Using the bow and stern propellers to steer the icebreaker, Captain Malmi managed to return to Helsinki \u2014 a voyage of {{convert|150|nmi}} \u2014 and even enter the drydock without assistance from [[tugboat]]s.<ref>Laurell 1992, p. 306.</ref>\n\nThe boilers of ''Tarmo'' were converted for heavy fuel oil in 1950, which increased her endurance from one week to more than one month in normal ice conditions and quadrupled her range. Furthermore, the number of stokers tending the boilers could be reduced from 15 to 9. Her superstructure was also expanded and the crew accommodation was brought up to modern standards. However, as late as in 1952 she still lacked a [[gyrocompass]], [[echosounder]] and even a [[radar]], all of which were standard equipment on board the merchant ships she assisted during the winter months.<ref name=\"laurell315-316\">Laurell 1992, pp. 315\u2013316.</ref><ref name=\"kaukiainen229\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 229.</ref>\n\nOnce the war reparations to the Soviet Union had been paid, the rebuilding of the Finnish state-owned icebreaker fleet began with the commissioning of the new [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] in 1954. When the harsh winters of the 1950s showed that more modern icebreakers were needed, a series of slightly smaller diesel-electric icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago, and one by one the old steam-powered icebreakers were decommissioned and scrapped. From 1960 ''Tarmo'' was the only state-owned steam-powered icebreaker in service.<ref name=\"laurell319-336\">Laurell 1992, pp. 319\u2013336</ref>\n\nWhen the new diesel-electric [[Finnish icebreaker Tarmo (1963)|''Tarmo'']] was commissioned in 1963, the old ''Tarmo'' was renamed ''Apu'' and handed over to the Finnish Navy. In 1964, she spent two months in Tallinn as an accommodation ship for the crews of [[Riga class frigate|''Riga'' class frigates]] [[Finnish frigate H\u00e4meenmaa|''H\u00e4meenmaa'']] and [[Finnish frigate Uusimaa|''Uusimaa'']] that had been recently purchased from the Soviet Union. In 1966, ''Apu'' was handed back to the Finnish Maritime Administration and resumed her icebreaker duties until the commissioning of the next diesel-electric icebreaker, [[Finnish icebreaker Varma (1968)|''Varma'']], in 1968. ''Apu'' was decommissioned in the following spring, but instead of scrapping her it was decided to turn the last Finnish steam-powered icebreaker into a museum ship. On 29 May 1969 she was moored at [[Hylkysaari]] next to the [[Helsinki Zoo]] and given back her original name.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\">Laurell 1992, pp. 337\u2013342.</ref>\n\nHowever, the retirement of ''Tarmo'' did not go as planned. The winter of 1970 turned out to be very harsh and the old icebreaker had to be recommissioned. After her propellers had been re-installed in the Suomenlinna drydock, ''Tarmo'' was again renamed ''Apu'' and ordered to the [[Archipelago Sea]] to escort icebound ships. However, her efforts were often described being \"mostly of moral nature\", and in the spring of 1970 she was returned to her moorings at Hylkysaari. When the new diesel-electric [[Finnish icebreaker Apu (1970)|''Apu'']] was commissioned in the summer of 1970, it was certain that the old icebreaker could finally be retired.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" />\n\n=== Museum ship ===\n\n[[File:Tarmo Helsinki 20161129.jpg|thumb|right|''Tarmo'' being towed to Suomenlinna dry dock on 29 November 2016 after having been afloat for 24 years.]]\n\nIt took nearly 20 years until ''Tarmo'' was finally restored. In the 1970s and 1980s the Finnish Board of Navigation used its limited funding to maintain the ship in floating condition and the [[Maritime Historical Society of Finland]] tried to raise restoration funds, but despite the preservation efforts the wooden interior fittings and weather decks deteriorated over the years.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" />\n\nWhen the [[Cabinet of Finland]] allotted two million Finnish markkas for the restoration of the old icebreaker, ''Tarmo'' was towed to Kotka in November 1990. After her interiors had been extensively documented and photographed, all fittings and furnishing were removed and stored ashore. When ''Tarmo'' was drydocked for inspection, her bottom plating was found out to be in surprisingly good condition. The deteriorated weather decks and aftship cabins were completely rebuilt.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" />\n\nAlthough the engine rooms, boiler rooms and machinery workshops remain largely in their initial configuration and one officer cabin on the tweendeck was spared by the fire in the 1940s, the aim of the restoration work was never to return ''Tarmo'' to her original condition. Instead, she was rebuilt as she appeared after her last major refit in 1951, although with modern heating and air conditioning systems. Her hold was turned into an exhibition space and a cafeteria was opened in the crew mess. Although she was not repaired to operational condition \u2013 her stern engine was decoupled from the propeller shaft and equipped with an electrical turning gear \u2013 there are no permanent changes that would prevent her from ever sailing under her own power.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" />\n\nThe restoration work was completed on 19 May 1992 and a couple of days later the Board of Navigation handed the old icebreaker over to the [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]].<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" /> Since then she has been moored in Kotka as part of the permanent exhibition of the Maritime Museum of Finland.\n\n''Tarmo'' was drydocked during the winter of 2016\u20132017 for the first time in 24 years after the [[Parliament of Finland]] granted 950,000 euro for the renovation project. She was towed to [[Suomenlinna]] in November 2016 and returned to Kotka in May 2017.<ref>[http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9322562 J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtajavanhus Tarmo p\u00e4\u00e4si telakalle \u2013 k\u00e4ytt\u00e4ytyi merimatkalla yll\u00e4tt\u00e4v\u00e4n kiltisti].

She is also slightly larger than the older icebreaker, having an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|67.10|m|ftin}}, [[waterline length]] of {{convert|64.15|m|ftin}}, and moulded breadth of {{convert|14.33|m|ftin}}, both slightly greater than those of ''Sampo''. When loaded to an average draft of {{convert|5.7|m|ftin}}, ''Tarmo'' has displacement of 2,400 tons, some 350 tons more than that of her predecessor.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" /> Both ''Tarmo'' and ''Sampo'' were served by a crew of 43.<ref name=\"kaukiainen378\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 376.</ref>\n\n''Tarmo'' was powered by two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]] manufactured in [[Wallsend]], one driving a propeller in the stern and the other a second propeller in the bow.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\">Laurell 1992, pp. 72\u201379.</ref> The main function of the bow propeller was to reduce friction between the hull and the ice although the exact details of the icebreaking process were not known at that time.<ref name=\"laurell52-56\">Laurell 1992, pp. 52\u201356.</ref> The stern engine produced 1,700 [[indicated horsepower|ihp]] at 97 rpm and the bow engine 1,300 ihp at 107 rpm, but for short periods of time they could put out 2,400 ihp at 98 rpm and 1,450 ihp at 120 rpm, respectively. This made her considerably more powerful than ''Sampo'', whose two engines had together produced only 3,052 ihp during sea trials and were rated at 2,800 ihp. ''Tarmo'' could maintain a speed of {{convert|13|kn}} in open water, typical for icebreakers of her type at that time.<ref name=\"laurell344\">Laurell 1992, p. 344.</ref> Like all icebreakers of her age, ''Tarmo'' was also equipped with sails \u2013 two [[staysail]]s and two [[Bermuda sail]]s \u2013 although they were rarely, if ever, used. In the early 1930s, the sails were cut up piece by piece for other uses and eventually disappeared from the inventory.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\n''Tarmo'' had five coal-fired boilers for the main engines in two boiler rooms and a small auxiliary boiler for heating, deck equipment and electricity generation. Her midship fuel stores could hold 450 tons of coal, which was fed to the fireboxes at a rate of 3\u20134 tons per hour by six [[Fireman (steam engine)|stokers]] and was enough for roughly one week of sailing in ice.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\nLike the other Finnish state-owned icebreakers, ''Tarmo'' was equipped for escort icebreaker duties with a towing winch, a cable and a stern notch. In difficult ice conditions the ship being assisted was taken into tow, and in extremely difficult compressive ice it was pulled to the icebreaker's stern notch.<ref name=\"laurell198-200\">Laurell 1992, p. 198-200.</ref> For salvage operations ''Tarmo'' had a powerful [[centrifugal pump]] capable of pumping water simultaneously through nine thick hoses.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Tarmo (ship, 1907)|''Tarmo''}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book |last=Anttila |first=Risto |title=s/s Suursaari 1927\u20131945  |publisher=KR-Kirjat Oy | location = Loimaa |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-951-9387-66-6}}\n*{{cite book |last= Kaukiainen |first= Yrj\u00f6 |title= Navigare Necesse \u2013 Merenkulkulaitos 1917\u20131992 |publisher=Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6776-4}}\n*{{cite book |last= Laurell |first= Seppo |title= H\u00f6yrymurtajien aika |publisher= Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6775-6}}\n*{{cite book |last= Pohjanpalo |first= Jorma |title= 100 vuotta Suomen talvimerenkulkua |publisher= Merenkulkuhallitus | location = Valtion painatuskeskus, Helsinki |year= 1978 |isbn= 951-46-3661-9}}\n*{{cite book |last= Ramsay |first= Henrik |title= J\u00e4\u00e4saarron murtajat |publisher=Werner S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m Osakeyhti\u00f6 (WSOY) | location = Helsinki |year= 1949 }}\n\n{{Icebreakers of Finland}}\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{coord|60|28|24|N|26|56|39.4|E|region:FI-ES_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarmo (1907)}}\n[[Category:Icebreakers of Finland]]\n[[Category:Ships built by Armstrong Whitworth]]\n[[Category:1907 ships]]\n[[Category:World War I naval ships of Russia]]\n[[Category:World War II naval ships of Finland]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Finland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Tarmo (disambiguation){{!}}Tarmo}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n| Ship image               = [[Image:Tarmo 01 800x600.jpg|300px|SS Tarmo in the port of Kotka]]\n| Ship caption             = Finnish icebreaker ''Tarmo'' at the Kotka Maritime Museum in 2006\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n| Hide header              = \n| Ship country             = Finland\n| Ship flag                = {{shipboxflag|Finland|state}}\n| Ship name                =*1907\u20131963: ''Tarmo''\n*1963\u20131969; 1970: ''Apu''\n*1969; 1970\u2013: ''Tarmo''\n| Ship namesake            = [[Finnish language|Finnish]] for \"vigor\" or \"spirit\"\n| Ship owner               =*[[Finnish Board of Navigation]] (1907\u20131992)<ref name=\"lloyds\">[[Lloyd's Register]] of Ships, [http://www.plimsollshipdata.org/pdffile.php?name=*44a0571.pdf 1944\u20131945].</ref>\n*[[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]] (1992\u2013)\n| Ship operator            = \n| Ship registry            = [[Helsinki]], {{FIN}}<ref name=\"lloyds\" />\n| Ship route               = \n| Ship ordered             = 15 February 1907\n| Ship awarded             = \n| Ship builder             = [[Armstrong Whitworth|Sir W.G.

Built in 1907 by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Sir W.G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co Ltd]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], United Kingdom, she was the third state-owned icebreaker of Finland and the last Finnish steam-powered icebreaker to remain in service. When ''Tarmo'' was decommissioned in 1970, a decision was made to preserve the vessel as a [[museum ship]]. After a long wait in [[Helsinki]], ''Tarmo'' was towed to [[Kotka]] and completely restored in the early 1990s.\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\n[[File:Tarmo 1907.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Tarmo'' at Armstrong Whitworth shipyard before launching.]]\n\nThe number of merchant ships calling at Finnish ports and requiring icebreaker assistance during the winter months had increased steadily since the first Finnish state-owned icebreakers, [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] and [[Sampo (1898 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']], were built in the 1890s. In 1902 General [[Nikolai Sj\u00f6man]], the director of the [[Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority]], made a proposal to the [[Senate of Finland]] for the construction of the third state-owned icebreaker. While reluctant at first, in May 1906 the Senate announced that the old ''Murtaja'' could be replaced with a new icebreaker and a call for bids was sent to a number of suitable shipyards. On 4 September 1906 a decision was made to order a new icebreaker even though no buyer had been found for the old ''Murtaja''.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\nBy 1 November 1906 [[Tendering|tender]]s for the construction of a new icebreaker, similar to but slightly larger than ''Sampo'', had been received from four European shipyards. The most expensive tender, 1,608,900 [[Finnish markka]]s (FIM), was given by [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft]] from Germany. It was followed by [[Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth & Co Ltd]] from England (FIM 1,575,000), [[Gourlay Brothers Ship Builders of Dundee]] from [[Scotland]] (FIM 1,432,500), and [[Burmeister & Wain]] from [[Denmark]] (FIM 1,422,500). When a fifth tender for FIM 1,485,000 was received from the English shipbuilder [[Hawthorn Leslie and Company|R. & W. Hawthorn Leslie and Company]] nine days after the deadline, Armstrong Whitworth lowered their bid by 100,000 markkas to FIM 1,475,000. [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard]] was also asked to participate in the call for tenders, but the domestic shipbuilding was not yet ready to accept such demanding projects and there were difficulties in acquiring and importing steel suitable for icebreakers.<ref name=\"pohjanpalo143\">Pohjanpalo 1978, p. 143.</ref><ref>Ramsay 1949, p. 285.</ref> The tenders were evaluated by an expert committee appointed by the Senate and, after careful consideration, the icebreaker offered by Armstrong Whitworth turned out to be the most suitable. A number of changes were proposed to the original design including moving the bow propeller slightly abaft and upwards to protect it from grounding and improve the icebreaking characteristics of the ship by reducing the stem angle to 20 degrees. The shipbuilding contract was signed on 15 February 1907, and with the proposed changes the price of the vessel was 1,631,548.81 Finnish markkas.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\nThe new icebreaker was launched on 9 September 1907 and given the name ''Tarmo'', meaning \"vigor\" and \"spirit\" in the [[Finnish language]]. The ship was delivered on 17 December 1907 and on 30 December she left Newcastle under the command of Captain [[Leonard Mel\u00e1n]] and headed down the [[River Tyne]] to [[Hanko]], Finland, where she arrived on 3 January 1908.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n''Tarmo'' was officially commissioned on 4 January 1908. Leonard Mel\u00e1n was replaced by Captain [[Johan Rosqvist]], an experienced winter navigator known for his ability to predict the movements of ice fields with almost supernatural accuracy. However, the winter of 1908 was relatively mild and there was hardly any ice to break before the end of February.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" /> When the icebreaking capability of the new vessel could finally be assessed, it was found out that the new ship was not as maneuverable as the smaller and less powerful ''Sampo'', and the changes made to the original design did not improve her performance. However, despite the shortcomings ''Tarmo'' was still a valuable addition to the state-owned icebreaker fleet, and after a number of changes her icebreaking characteristics were in par with ''Sampo''.<ref name=\"laurell82-85\">Laurell 1992, pp. 82\u201385.</ref>\n\nIn May 1908, ''Tarmo'' was sent for the first time to the [[Bothnian Bay]] to open the harbors and fairways for the spring. On 2 June, she was run hard aground near [[Raahe]] due to an error by a [[maritime pilot|pilot]] when navigating by sight, resulting in extensive damage to the bottom plating and a lost propeller blade. Kept afloat by her own pumps, she returned to Raahe for emergency repairs and continued to Helsinki, where she was drydocked from 7 June until early August.<ref name=\"laurell82-85\" /> In 1912 she was again run aground near Hanko, but the damage was not as extensive as on the first time.<ref name=\"laurell88-89\">Laurell 1992, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1910s, ''Tarmo'' assisted ships to the port of Helsinki and moved to Hanko with ''Sampo'' after the New Year. As the spring approached, she was sent first to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] and finally to the eastern part of the [[Gulf of Finland]] to open the ports for the spring. However, during the winter months the icebreakers were not sent beyond Vaasa, partially due to the grounding of ''Tarmo'' outside Raahe in 1908.<ref name=\"laurell88-89\" />\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nIn August 1914 [[Russian Empire|Russia]] joined the First World War and navigating in the Baltic Sea became dangerous due to [[naval mine]]s and [[Kaiserliche Marine|German]] [[U-boat]]s. The Finnish icebreakers were placed under the command of the [[Baltic Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and given the task of assisting naval ships and troop transportations in the Gulf of Finland. Despite the harsh winters, icebreaker assistance to merchant vessels was largely neglected, and several ships were destroyed by ice.<ref name=\"laurell91\">Laurell 1992, p. 91.</ref> The Russians armed ''Tarmo'' with one 47&nbsp;mm deck gun.<ref name=\"anttila\" />\n\n=== Finnish Civil War ===\n\nWhen the [[Parliament of Finland]] accepted the declaration of independence given by the Senate on 6 December 1917, the state-owned icebreakers under Finnish command raised the [[Flag of Finland|colours of the independent Finland]] for the first time. However, when the [[Red Guard (Finland)|Red Guard]] took over Helsinki and the [[Finnish Civil War]] began on 27 January 1918, ''Tarmo'' was still under Russian command. After negotiations with the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] it was agreed that the Finnish icebreaker would be returned once the evacuation of the Russian forces \u2013 later known as the [[Ice Cruise of the Baltic Fleet]] \u2014 had been completed.<ref name=\"laurell99101\">Laurell 1992, pp. 99\u2013101.</ref> However, after an attempt to evacuate the remaining members of the Senate from the occupied city by air had failed, Lieutenant [[Yrj\u00f6 Roos]] was given an order to capture ''Tarmo'' from the Russians and bring her to a safe harbour at the Gulf of Bothnia. When the Germans captured the city of [[Tallinn]] on the other side of the Gulf of Finland, it was decided to take ''Tarmo'' there.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\" />\n\n''Tarmo'' had a crew of 42 under the command of Acting Captain [[Hjalmar Kauppi]] and eight armed Russian sailors commanded by Lieutenant [[Nicolai Telegin]]. After both commanders agreed with the takeover, Telegin obtained a forged travel order for ''Tarmo'' to head to the Gulf of Finland on 3 March 1918 to assist icebound Soviet transport ships. He also sent two of his soldiers ashore, reducing the number of enemy soldiers to six. Shortly before the departure, Roos brought Senators [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]], the future [[President of Finland]], and [[Jalmar Castr\u00e9n]] to ''Tarmo'' disguised as engineers who had arrived to investigate ships damaged by ice. A small number of capturers had also hidden themselves on board the icebreaker on the previous night.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\" />\n\nWhen the icebreaker was near the island of [[Aegna]], the Finnish capturers cut the wireless antennas and stormed the Russian troops. Within minutes, the soldiers had been overpowered without casualties on either side and the ship was turned towards Tallinn. When a German plane was spotted approaching the ship, the capturers panicked as the largely red temporary state flag of Finland could be mistaken for the red Soviet revolutionary flag, and hastily replaced it with a large white [[tablecloth]].<ref>[http://www.klubi.fi/klubilehti/klubilehti22008.pdf Senaattori Svinhufvud laivakaapparina]. Klubilehti 2/2008. Helsingin Suomalainen Klubi. {{retrieved | accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref> The German pilot later commented that he would have attacked ''Tarmo'' had he not dropped all his bombs on the [[Icebreaker Yermak|Soviet icebreaker ''Yermak'']] earlier that day.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\" />\n\n''Tarmo'' was placed under German command and her armament was increased by two 75&nbsp;mm deck guns. In addition to transporting German troops to [[Naissaar]], she also participated in mine clearing operations in the Estonian west coast. On 25 March 1918, after the Finnish Senate had accepted military assistance from Germany, ''Tarmo'' was ordered to transport Finnish and German soldiers to the island of [[Suursaari]]. On 31 March, after having been immobilized by drifting ice for several days, the crew of ''Tarmo'' spotted a black cloud of smoke coming from the east. When the approaching ship was recognized as ''Yermak'', the largest and most powerful Soviet icebreaker in service at that time, the deck guns were manned and around twenty shots were fired at the ship some {{convert|6|nmi}} away. ''Yermak'', which had been under fire from a coastal artillery battery at Lavansaari only a couple of days earlier, turned around and retreated without returning fire.<ref name=\"anttila\" /> This engagement has been considered the first time a naval ship flying the flag of independent Finland opened fire against an enemy ship.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\">Laurell 1992, pp. 108\u2013112.</ref>\n\nWhen ''Tarmo'' returned to Tallinn, her crew was surprised to see another large icebreaker flying the Finnish flag moored at the harbour. The Soviet icebreaker ''Volynets'' had been captured only two days earlier and renamed [[Suur T\u00f5ll (icebreaker)|''W\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']]. Both ships were used to transport 3,000 German soldiers \u2014 [[Detachment Brandenstein]] \u2014 to [[Loviisa]]. On 18 April 1918, ''Tarmo'' arrived in Helsinki and was handed back to the Finnish Board of Navigation.<ref name=\"laurell108-112\" />\n\n=== Interwar period ===\n\n[[File:Tarmo and Jaakarhu.jpg|thumb|right|Finnish state-owned icebreakers ''Tarmo'' and [[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu (icebreaker)|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'']]]]\nDuring the interwar period ''Tarmo'' was stationed at the Gulf of Finland, where in addition to assisting ships she often had to rescue local fishermen trapped on drifting ice floes.<ref name=\"laurell185-189\">Laurell 1992, pp. 185\u2013189.</ref> In early 1919 she was used for transporting volunteers to Tallinn to aid with the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. She also transported [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim]] to Stockholm and Copenhagen in February 1919.<ref name=\"laurell122\">Laurell 1992, p. 122.</ref>\n\nThe interwar period also saw the expansion of the Finnish icebreaker fleet, first by two large steam-powered icebreakers [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] and ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'', and finally by the diesel-electric [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']], which was the first large Finnish icebreaker built completely in Finland.<ref name=\"laurell190\">Laurell 1992, p. 190.</ref>\n\n=== Second World War ===\n\n==== Winter War ====\n[[File:Tarmo toisen maailmansodan aikaan Sagg\u00f6 Ahvenanmaa.jpg|thumb|Tarmo in camouflage in 1939.]]\nWhen relations with the [[Soviet Union]] deteriorated in late 1939, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers were again armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker flotilla.<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, pp. 259\u2013260.</ref> ''Tarmo'' had been fitted with gun mounts already in 1931, and shortly before the [[Winter War]] began she was armed with four [[120 mm 50 caliber Pattern 1905|{{convert|120|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} 50-caliber]] [[Vickers]] naval guns of Russian origin on two twin mounts. It was soon apparent that the guns, which were used on all large Finnish icebreakers, were not very suitable for naval use due to their relatively short range and slow rate of fire. On 11 January 1940, after spending the early days of the war near Turku, ''Tarmo'' was ordered to the Gulf of Finland because the ice conditions had become too severe for the smaller ''Murtaja''. When the two icebreakers met in Helsinki on 13 January, a [[Madsen 20 mm anti-aircraft cannon]] was moved from ''Murtaja'' to ''Tarmo''.<ref name=\"anttila\">Anttila 2008, pp. 80\u201391.</ref>\n\nAfter the Soviet troops had captured the island of [[Sommers]] in December 1939, a small transport ship had become trapped in ice near the island. On 16 January ''Tarmo'' was ordered to sink the ship, [[SS Kazakhstan|''Kazakhstan'']], before the Soviet icebreakers could release the icebound vessel. ''Tarmo'' left in the following night, but it was soon found out that the guns could not be aimed \u2013 when the temperature had dropped to {{convert|-40|C|F|abbr=on}}, the frozen storage grease had jammed the guns \u2013 and the icebreaker returned to Kotka. In the following night, after the guns had been thawed, ''Tarmo'' headed towards Sommers again. On the second sortie, she was also carrying 80 Finnish soldiers, who were to take back the island while the icebreaker bombarded the Soviet forces with her deck guns. When ''Tarmo'' was some ten miles from Sommers, her old rival from the previous war, the Soviet icebreaker ''Yermak'', was spotted on the western side of the island.<ref name=\"anttila\" /><ref name=\"laurell266-271\" />\n\nWhen a thick cloud of black smoke was spotted on ''Yermak'', the Soviet icebreaker turned back east without firing a shot and called in reinforcements \u2013 her crew had mistaken ''Tarmo'' for the [[Finnish coastal defence ship V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen|Finnish coastal defence ship ''V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen'']] and ordered an airstrike against the ship they thought to be the most powerful warship of the Finnish Navy. In the meantime ''Tarmo'' opened fire on ''Kazakhstan''. However, the guns malfunctioned again and only two shells were fired from the stern gun at the Soviet ship some seven miles away, both of which fell short. Continuing the naval engagement without operational guns was deemed futile and a decision was made to turn back to Kotka and return once the guns could be used again. On the way back the Soviet fighters and bombers attacked ''Tarmo'' several times, but none of the planes scored a hit on the Finnish icebreaker due to intense anti-aircraft fire. Around half past noon ''Tarmo'' arrived in Kotka and lunch was served for the crew.<ref name=\"anttila\" /><ref name=\"laurell266-271\">Laurell 1992, pp. 266\u2013271.</ref>\n\nAt 13:15 a lone Soviet bomber flying at {{convert|3000|m|ft}} dropped three {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bombs on ''Tarmo''. The first bomb missed the icebreaker and exploded harmlessly on ice in front of the ship, but the second hit the foredeck, destroying the anchors, and the third penetrated the wooden weather deck in front of the bridge and detonated on the tweendeck. The blast immediately killed 38 crew members and wounded ten, one of whom died later in hospital, and started a fire that quickly spread aft. By 18:00 the fire department had the blaze, which had ignited the ammunition stores and destroyed nearly all wooden parts from amidships aft, under control. The bow of ''Tarmo'' had been reduced to a pile of mangled pipes, twisted frames and torn plating, from which the twin barrels of the forward 120&nbsp;mm guns were pointing to the sky. Her forward engine room was full of water that had frozen around the steam engine.<ref name=\"anttila\" /><ref name=\"laurell266-271\" />\n\nDespite the devastating damage, ''Tarmo'' had not developed any leaks following the bombing. Furthermore, her boilers and stern engine were intact, and by 8 February her bow engine was running again as well. The damaged steel structures were cut at tweendeck level and the 120&nbsp;mm deck guns were removed. On 9 February ''Tarmo'' left for Helsinki for further repairs under her own power. However, as the wheelhouse had been destroyed, the helmsman was stationed in the aft engine room and the commands were shouted through the skylight. Due to the ever-present danger of Soviet airstrikes, ''Tarmo'' moved only at night and spent the days camouflaged. Since the navigational aids could not be lit up during the war, a ski patrol moved in front of the icebreaker and used flashlights and tree branches to guide the ship through the archipelago. ''Tarmo'' arrived at Hietalahti shipyard on 10 February.<ref name=\"anttila\" /> Her bow was rebuilt only to the tweendeck level, the cabin of the first mate was turned into a bomb shelter with {{convert|10|mm|in|1|adj=on}} armour plates, and the armament was increased by two [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40 mm guns]] and one 47&nbsp;mm gun.<ref name=\"laurell266-271\" />\n\nAfter the repairs were finished on 8 March 1940, ''Tarmo'' was ordered to [[Vyborg Bay]] to break ice in front of advancing Soviet troops and tanks. When the icebreaker left for the mission on 10 March, it was soon found out that her icebreaking capability had been significantly reduced, and by afternoon she had not even passed the fort of [[Suomenlinna]] outside Helsinki. The following day, after having been attacked by Soviet fighters several times, ''Tarmo'' turned back to Helsinki \u2013 she had advanced only {{convert|16|nmi}} in two days, but had nearly exhausted her coal stores and anti-aircraft munitions. When she arrived in Helsinki on 12 March 1940, the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] had been signed and the Winter War was over.<ref name=\"laurell266-271\" />\n\n==== Interim Peace ====\n\nDuring the period which later became known as the [[Interim Peace]], ''Tarmo'' was disarmed and her armour was removed. Already on 13 March 1940 she was sent to Hanko to open a channel to the icebound harbour, but was unable to break through the pack ice fields and had to return to Helsinki. Later most of the damage the icebreaker had suffered during the war was repaired. In addition to rebuilding the bridge, the crew accommodation was improved considerably.<ref name=\"laurell275-278\">Laurell 1992, pp. 275\u2013278.</ref>\n\n==== Continuation War ====\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] started in June 1941, the state-owned icebreakers were again armed and assigned to the icebreaker flotilla. After spending the summer months guarding fairways in the [[Archipelago Sea]], icebreakers ''Tarmo'' and ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' participated in [[Operation Nordwind (1941)|Operation Nordwind]] together with Finnish and German naval ships on 13 September 1941.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\">Laurell 1992, pp. 282\u2013290</ref> The joint Finnish-German distraction manoeuvre was a complete failure. Not only did it fail to achieve its goal \u2013 it is uncertain if the Soviet forces even noticed the fleet \u2013 but when the ships turned back, [[Paravane (weapon)|paravanes]] dragged a Soviet naval mine against the hull of [[Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen|Finnish coastal defence ship ''Ilmarinen'']], the flagship of the Finnish Navy, which sank in seven minutes following the explosion, claiming 271 lives.<ref>[http://koti.mbnet.fi/~karsikas/psl/ Panssarilaiva Ilmarisen tuho 13.9.1941]. {{retrieved |accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Soviet forces retreated from Hanko by the end of 1941 and the fighting moved outside the Finnish borders, the icebreaker flotilla was disbanded and ''Tarmo'' resumed her normal peacetime duties as an escort icebreaker. During the extremely difficult winter of 1942, ''Tarmo'' assisted 177 vessels and sailed {{convert|8957|nmi}}, more than any other Finnish icebreaker during the season. After saving the crew and cargo of German steamer [[SS Helgoland|''Helgoland'']], which was damaged by ice and later sank, Captain [[Yrj\u00f6 Malmi]] was awarded the [[Order of the German Eagle]] by [[Adolf Hitler]]. The winters of 1943 and 1944 were easier and several ports were kept open through the winter.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\" />\n\nAfter the Continuation War ended with the signing of the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944, Finland had to hand over the newest state-owned icebreakers, ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' and ''Voima'', to the Soviet Union as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]]. Other icebreakers, including ''Tarmo'', were used to tow Soviet naval ships and submarines through the Finnish archipelago during the latter stages of the Second World War.<ref name=\"laurell282-290\" />\n\n=== Post-war years and decommissioning ===\n\nDuring the first post-war years the war-worn Finnish state-owned icebreaker fleet, reduced to four steam-powered icebreakers and the diesel-electric ''Sisu'', was overburdened with work. Due to the lack of modern tonnage, all available ships were taken into use, and during the winter months this meant a large number of older ships with low engine power and inadequate ice-strengthening. In 1946, ''Tarmo'' lost her rudder and the whole [[sternpost]] while assisting ships in the Archipelago Sea. Using the bow and stern propellers to steer the icebreaker, Captain Malmi managed to return to Helsinki \u2014 a voyage of {{convert|150|nmi}} \u2014 and even enter the drydock without assistance from [[tugboat]]s.<ref>Laurell 1992, p. 306.</ref>\n\nThe boilers of ''Tarmo'' were converted for heavy fuel oil in 1950, which increased her endurance from one week to more than one month in normal ice conditions and quadrupled her range. Furthermore, the number of stokers tending the boilers could be reduced from 15 to 9. Her superstructure was also expanded and the crew accommodation was brought up to modern standards. However, as late as in 1952 she still lacked a [[gyrocompass]], [[echosounder]] and even a [[radar]], all of which were standard equipment on board the merchant ships she assisted during the winter months.<ref name=\"laurell315-316\">Laurell 1992, pp. 315\u2013316.</ref><ref name=\"kaukiainen229\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 229.</ref>\n\nOnce the war reparations to the Soviet Union had been paid, the rebuilding of the Finnish state-owned icebreaker fleet began with the commissioning of the new [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] in 1954. When the harsh winters of the 1950s showed that more modern icebreakers were needed, a series of slightly smaller diesel-electric icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago, and one by one the old steam-powered icebreakers were decommissioned and scrapped. From 1960 ''Tarmo'' was the only state-owned steam-powered icebreaker in service.<ref name=\"laurell319-336\">Laurell 1992, pp. 319\u2013336</ref>\n\nWhen the new diesel-electric [[Finnish icebreaker Tarmo (1963)|''Tarmo'']] was commissioned in 1963, the old ''Tarmo'' was renamed ''Apu'' and handed over to the Finnish Navy. In 1964, she spent two months in Tallinn as an accommodation ship for the crews of [[Riga class frigate|''Riga'' class frigates]] [[Finnish frigate H\u00e4meenmaa|''H\u00e4meenmaa'']] and [[Finnish frigate Uusimaa|''Uusimaa'']] that had been recently purchased from the Soviet Union. In 1966, ''Apu'' was handed back to the Finnish Maritime Administration and resumed her icebreaker duties until the commissioning of the next diesel-electric icebreaker, [[Finnish icebreaker Varma (1968)|''Varma'']], in 1968. ''Apu'' was decommissioned in the following spring, but instead of scrapping her it was decided to turn the last Finnish steam-powered icebreaker into a museum ship. On 29 May 1969 she was moored at [[Hylkysaari]] next to the [[Helsinki Zoo]] and given back her original name.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\">Laurell 1992, pp. 337\u2013342.</ref>\n\nHowever, the retirement of ''Tarmo'' did not go as planned. The winter of 1970 turned out to be very harsh and the old icebreaker had to be recommissioned. After her propellers had been re-installed in the Suomenlinna drydock, ''Tarmo'' was again renamed ''Apu'' and ordered to the [[Archipelago Sea]] to escort icebound ships. However, her efforts were often described being \"mostly of moral nature\", and in the spring of 1970 she was returned to her moorings at Hylkysaari. When the new diesel-electric [[Finnish icebreaker Apu (1970)|''Apu'']] was commissioned in the summer of 1970, it was certain that the old icebreaker could finally be retired.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" />\n\n=== Museum ship ===\n\n[[File:Tarmo Helsinki 20161129.jpg|thumb|right|''Tarmo'' being towed to Suomenlinna dry dock on 29 November 2016 after having been afloat for 24 years.]]\n\nIt took nearly 20 years until ''Tarmo'' was finally restored. In the 1970s and 1980s the Finnish Board of Navigation used its limited funding to maintain the ship in floating condition and the [[Maritime Historical Society of Finland]] tried to raise restoration funds, but despite the preservation efforts the wooden interior fittings and weather decks deteriorated over the years.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" />\n\nWhen the [[Cabinet of Finland]] allotted two million Finnish markkas for the restoration of the old icebreaker, ''Tarmo'' was towed to Kotka in November 1990. After her interiors had been extensively documented and photographed, all fittings and furnishing were removed and stored ashore. When ''Tarmo'' was drydocked for inspection, her bottom plating was found out to be in surprisingly good condition. The deteriorated weather decks and aftship cabins were completely rebuilt.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" />\n\nAlthough the engine rooms, boiler rooms and machinery workshops remain largely in their initial configuration and one officer cabin on the tweendeck was spared by the fire in the 1940s, the aim of the restoration work was never to return ''Tarmo'' to her original condition. Instead, she was rebuilt as she appeared after her last major refit in 1951, although with modern heating and air conditioning systems. Her hold was turned into an exhibition space and a cafeteria was opened in the crew mess. Although she was not repaired to operational condition \u2013 her stern engine was decoupled from the propeller shaft and equipped with an electrical turning gear \u2013 there are no permanent changes that would prevent her from ever sailing under her own power.<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" />\n\nThe restoration work was completed on 19 May 1992 and a couple of days later the Board of Navigation handed the old icebreaker over to the [[Finnish National Board of Antiquities]].<ref name=\"laurell337-342\" /> Since then she has been moored in Kotka as part of the permanent exhibition of the Maritime Museum of Finland.\n\n''Tarmo'' was drydocked during the winter of 2016\u20132017 for the first time in 24 years after the [[Parliament of Finland]] granted 950,000 euro for the renovation project. She was towed to [[Suomenlinna]] in November 2016 and returned to Kotka in May 2017.<ref>[http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9322562 J\u00e4\u00e4nmurtajavanhus Tarmo p\u00e4\u00e4si telakalle \u2013 k\u00e4ytt\u00e4ytyi merimatkalla yll\u00e4tt\u00e4v\u00e4n kiltisti].

She is also slightly larger than the older icebreaker, having an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|67.10|m|ftin}}, [[waterline length]] of {{convert|64.15|m|ftin}}, and moulded breadth of {{convert|14.33|m|ftin}}, both slightly greater than those of ''Sampo''. When loaded to an average draft of {{convert|5.7|m|ftin}}, ''Tarmo'' has displacement of 2,400 tons, some 350 tons more than that of her predecessor.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" /> Both ''Tarmo'' and ''Sampo'' were served by a crew of 43.<ref name=\"kaukiainen378\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 376.</ref>\n\n''Tarmo'' was powered by two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]] manufactured in [[Wallsend]], one driving a propeller in the stern and the other a second propeller in the bow.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\">Laurell 1992, pp. 72\u201379.</ref> The main function of the bow propeller was to reduce friction between the hull and the ice although the exact details of the icebreaking process were not known at that time.<ref name=\"laurell52-56\">Laurell 1992, pp. 52\u201356.</ref> The stern engine produced 1,700 [[indicated horsepower|ihp]] at 97 rpm and the bow engine 1,300 ihp at 107 rpm, but for short periods of time they could put out 2,400 ihp at 98 rpm and 1,450 ihp at 120 rpm, respectively. This made her considerably more powerful than ''Sampo'', whose two engines had together produced only 3,052 ihp during sea trials and were rated at 2,800 ihp. ''Tarmo'' could maintain a speed of {{convert|13|kn}} in open water, typical for icebreakers of her type at that time.<ref name=\"laurell344\">Laurell 1992, p. 344.</ref> Like all icebreakers of her age, ''Tarmo'' was also equipped with sails \u2013 two [[staysail]]s and two [[Bermuda sail]]s \u2013 although they were rarely, if ever, used. In the early 1930s, the sails were cut up piece by piece for other uses and eventually disappeared from the inventory.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\n''Tarmo'' had five coal-fired boilers for the main engines in two boiler rooms and a small auxiliary boiler for heating, deck equipment and electricity generation. Her midship fuel stores could hold 450 tons of coal, which was fed to the fireboxes at a rate of 3\u20134 tons per hour by six [[Fireman (steam engine)|stokers]] and was enough for roughly one week of sailing in ice.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\nLike the other Finnish state-owned icebreakers, ''Tarmo'' was equipped for escort icebreaker duties with a towing winch, a cable and a stern notch. In difficult ice conditions the ship being assisted was taken into tow, and in extremely difficult compressive ice it was pulled to the icebreaker's stern notch.<ref name=\"laurell198-200\">Laurell 1992, p. 198-200.</ref> For salvage operations ''Tarmo'' had a powerful [[centrifugal pump]] capable of pumping water simultaneously through nine thick hoses.<ref name=\"laurell72-79\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Commons category|Tarmo (ship, 1907)|Finnish icebreaker ''Tarmo''}}\n*{{cite book |last=Anttila |first=Risto |title=s/s Suursaari 1927\u20131945  |publisher=KR-Kirjat Oy | location = Loimaa |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-951-9387-66-6}}\n*{{cite book |last= Kaukiainen |first= Yrj\u00f6 |title= Navigare Necesse \u2013 Merenkulkulaitos 1917\u20131992 |publisher=Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6776-4}}\n*{{cite book |last= Laurell |first= Seppo |title= H\u00f6yrymurtajien aika |publisher= Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6775-6}}\n*{{cite book |last= Pohjanpalo |first= Jorma |title= 100 vuotta Suomen talvimerenkulkua |publisher= Merenkulkuhallitus | location = Valtion painatuskeskus, Helsinki |year= 1978 |isbn= 951-46-3661-9}}\n*{{cite book |last= Ramsay |first= Henrik |title= J\u00e4\u00e4saarron murtajat |publisher=Werner S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m Osakeyhti\u00f6 (WSOY) | location = Helsinki |year= 1949 }}\n\n{{Icebreakers of Finland}}\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{coord|60|28|24|N|26|56|39.4|E|region:FI-ES_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tarmo (1907)}}\n[[Category:Icebreakers of Finland]]\n[[Category:Ships built by Armstrong Whitworth]]\n[[Category:1907 ships]]\n[[Category:World War I naval ships of Russia]]\n[[Category:World War II naval ships of Finland]]\n[[Category:Museum ships in Finland]]\n", "name_user": "Tupsumato", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarmo_(1907_icebreaker)"}

Built in 1898 by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Sir W.G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co Ltd]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], United Kingdom and named after [[Sampo|a magical artifact]] from the [[Finnish mythology]], she was the second state-owned icebreaker of Finland and the first European icebreaker equipped with a bow propeller. When ''Sampo'' was decommissioned and broken up in 1960, she was also the second last steam-powered icebreaker in the Finnish icebreaker fleet.\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nPrior to building ''Sampo'', Finland had only one state-owned icebreaker, [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']], which was built in 1890 and was one of the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world. However, the 930-ton single-screw vessel was not powerful enough to keep even the southernmost port of Finland, [[Hanko]], open during severe winters and the icebreaking characteristics of its [[spoon-shaped bow]] were not as good as was hoped for.<ref name=\"laurell30\">Laurell 1992, p. 30.</ref><ref name=\"laurell44\">Laurell 1992, p. 44.</ref> A committee, appointed by the [[Senate of Finland]] in 1895 to find a solution to the problem, came to a conclusion that a second state-owned icebreaker would be needed.<ref name=\"laurell52-56\">Laurell 1992, p. 52-56.</ref>\n\nIn the 1890s the Senate sent two engineers and [[Leonard Mel\u00e1n]], who later became the captain of ''Sampo'', to investigate a new icebreaker design that had been developed in the United States in the 1880s and find out its icebreaking capability. Unlike the European icebreakers, the 1888-built [[train ferry]] [[St Ignace (ship)|''St Ignace'']] had two propellers, one at both end of the ship. Convinced about the superiority of the new design, the winter navigation committee recommended that the new icebreaker should be of the so-called \"American type\".<ref name=\"laurell52-56\">Laurell 1992, p. 52-56.</ref>\n\nIn February 1897 the Senate sent a [[request for tender]] to eight shipbuilders for the construction of a new icebreaker. On 6 June 1897 the contract was signed with Sir W.G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co Ltd from Newcastle upon Tyne. While not the cheapest, the shipyard had the shortest delivery time \u2014 only seven months \u2014 for an icebreaker with a bow propeller.<ref name=\"laurell58-59\" />\n\nWhile the initial delivery date was 18 January 1898, ''Sampo'' was not delivered until October of the same year due to problems with material deliveries and strikes among the shipyard's workers. She was launched in the spring of 1898 and left for the first sea trials on 23 August. However, the bow propeller shaft seized shortly after leaving the dock and the icebreaker returned to the shipyard. The coal consumption was also 11% greater than what was specified in the contract, but instead of making changes the heating system the shipyard reduced the price by \u00a3700. The second sea trial on 21 September was successful and ''Sampo'' left for Finland on 25 October 1898 and arrived to Helsinki four days later.<ref name=\"laurell60-61\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n''Sampo'' was officially commissioned on 15 November 1898 and began assisting ships outside the port of Hanko while the smaller ''Murtaja'' was stationed closer to the harbour. From the first day on the new icebreaker, capable of breaking through ridges up to six metres thick by ramming, performed beyond expectations and was generally deemed the best icebreaker in Europe at that time. On 9 March 1899, her performance was demonstrated to the director of the [[Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority]]  when both state-owned icebreakers headed to the sea, ''Murtaja'' running in a previously opened channel and ''Sampo'' alongside in unbroken ice. However, on the way back to the port ''Sampo'', followed by ''Murtaja'', encountered a thick ice ridge and came to a halt. The smaller icebreaker could not stop in time and collided with ''Sampo'', causing damage to her stern structures but fortunately no injuries to the passengers. ''Sampo'' ended her first winter season on 16 May 1899, during which she had assisted 128 ships.<ref name=\"laurell64-65\" />\n\nThe first decade of ''Sampo'' passed without major incidents. In 1907, another icebreaker with a bow propeller, [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']], was ordered from the builders of ''Sampo''.<ref name=\"laurell72-73\">Laurell 1992, p. 72-73.</ref>\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nIn August 1914 [[Russian Empire|Russia]] joined the First World War and navigating in the Baltic Sea became dangerous due to [[naval mine]]s and [[Kaiserliche Marine|German]] [[U-boat]]s. The Finnish icebreakers were placed under the command of the [[Baltic Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and given the task of assisting naval ships and troop transportations in the Gulf of Finland. Unlike ''Tarmo'', ''Sampo'' was not armed with a deck gun. Icebreaker assistance to merchant ships was largely neglected.<ref name=\"laurell91-93\">Laurell 1992, p. 91-93.</ref> ''Sampo'' survived the war without damage.\n\nOn 6 December 1917 the [[Parliament of Finland]] accepted the declaration of independence given by the Senate and on 29 December the icebreakers ''Murtaja'' and ''Sampo'' raised the [[flag of Finland|state flag of the independent Finland]] for the first time.<ref name=\"laurell99\">Laurell 1992, p. 99.</ref> However, already in early January 1918 the ship was seized by the Russian revolutionary fleet and ordered to assist the Russian troops stationed in Finland.

The Russian [[commissar]] who was on board at the time was taken into custody and left on ice outside the port of [[Pori]] before the icebreaker headed for [[G\u00e4vle]] to wait for further orders.<ref name=\"laurell103-107\">Laurell 1992, p. 103-107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Sampo (1898) assisting Castor in February 1918.jpg|thumb|''Sampo'' assisting {{SS|Castor}} during the [[Finnish Civil War]] in February 1918.]]\n\n''Sampo'' had a significant impact on the outcome of the Civil War when it assisted three convoys to the White-controlled ports in northern Finland. The ships brought more than a thousand [[J\u00e4ger Movement|J\u00e4gers]], Finnish volunteers trained in Germany, and enough weapons for the whole White Guard. The first convoy left [[Danzig]] on 11 February 1918 and was picked up by ''Sampo'' three days later outside the island of [[M\u00e4rket]]. The steamships [[SS Mira (Finnish ship)|''Mira'']] and [[SS Poseidon|''Poseidon'']], owned by the [[Finland Steamship Company]] and carrying 85 J\u00e4gers and weapons for the Finnish troops, arrived at [[Vaasa]] on 18 February. On 20 February, ''Sampo'' encountered the second convoy in the [[Stockholm archipelago]]. The ships, passenger steamship [[Arcturus (steamship)|''Arcturus'']] and cargo steamer [[SS Castor|''Castor'']], had left [[Liep\u0101ja|Libau]] on 14 February with the bulk of the troops, 950 J\u00e4gers, and some 1,200 tons of coal. ''Castor'' was left outside [[G\u00e4vle]] while ''Arcturus'' was escorted through difficult ice conditions to Vaasa, where it arrived on 25 February in the midst of a large crowd of cheering people. The last ship, [[SS Virgo|''Virgo'']], left [[Neufahrwasser]] on 20 February with 25 soldiers and full cargo of weapons, and was assisted to Vaasa on 2 March.<ref name=\"laurell103-107\" />\n\nOn 4 April, while heading out from the port of Hanko with German warships, the convoy led by ''Sampo'' encountered another Finnish icebreaker, ''Murtaja'', coming from [[Ut\u00f6, Finland|Ut\u00f6]] with the steamship [[SS Dragsfj\u00e4rd|''Dragsfj\u00e4rd'']]. Both ships were filled with Red Guard and Russian soldiers, but after several warning shots from the German naval vessels most of the enemy soldiers fled on ice and ''Murtaja'' was taken over by the Whites.<ref name=\"laurell103-107\" />\n\n''Sampo'' arrived to Helsinki for the summer on 12 May 1918, three days before the Civil War ended to decisive White victory.<ref name=\"laurell103-107\" />\n\n=== Interwar period ===\n\nWhile ''Sampo'' had not been damaged in the war, she was docked at the [[Hietalahti shipyard]] for extensive maintenance and repairs \u2014 when she left to the port of Hanko in mid-February 1919, 69 bottom plates had been replaced.<ref name=\"laurell121-122\">Laurell 1992, p. 121-122.</ref> In December 1922 ''Sampo'' struck a rock in the port of [[Loviisa]] and her bow propeller shaft was damaged, but there was no time for repairs and for the rest of the season she had to assist ships to the port of Helsinki without her bow propeller.<ref name=\"laurell131-132\">Laurell 1992, p. 131-132.</ref> Another incident occurred on 24 March 1926 when the bow propeller of ''Sampo'' hit a stone bank in the port of Helsinki, came loose and dropped to the bottom. It was found after searching for a couple of days and winched on board. On 30 March, while ''Sampo'' was assisting a Finnish steamship [[SS Albert Kasimir|''Albert Kasimir'']], the stern propeller shaft snapped when the engine was reversed and the propeller dropped to the bottom. While the icebreaker still had its bow propeller, it was of no use as it was waiting for installation on the foredeck. ''Murtaja'' towed the immobilized icebreaker to Hanko on the following day and to Helsinki for repairs on 20 April.<ref name=\"laurell156-157\">Laurell 1992, p. 156-157.</ref>\n\nBetween 1919 and 1922 ''Sampo'' assisted 636 ships, more than any other Finnish icebreaker during that time.<ref name=\"laurell131-132\"/> In the 1920s the need for new icebreakers was recognized and two new steam-powered icebreakers were built.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> From 1926 on ''Sampo'' and ''Tarmo'' began their winter season from the eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland, assisting ships to [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Koivisto]], [[Viipuri]] and [[Kotka]], and moved to western ports as the harbours were closed for winter.<ref name=\"laurell158-159\">Laurell 1992, p. 158-159.</ref> In 1929 the whole [[Baltic Sea]] was frozen and ''Sampo'' was sent to the [[Danish straits]] for two months.<ref name=\"laurell176\">Laurell 1992, p. 176.</ref>\n\n==== Winter War ====\n[[File:Sampo grounded 1940.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Sampo'' grounded and camouflaged with tree branches.]]\n\nDue to the worsening relations with the Soviet Union, ''Sampo'' and other state-owned icebreakers were armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker fleet shortly before the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939. The Finnish icebreakers had been equipped with gun mounts already in the 1920s and were armed with light artillery. However, a bit over month into the war ''Sampo'' ran hard aground and was out of service for more than a year.<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, p. 259-260.</ref>\n\nOn 6 January 1940 ''Sampo'' was assisting a convoy of three merchant ships towards [[Pori]] in difficult conditions \u2014 the temperature was nearly {{convert|-30|C|F}} and fog reduced the visibility to zero. The icebreaker was proceeding in light ice conditions at {{convert|8|kn|abbr=out}} when she collided with an underwater obstacle and suddenly stopped, throwing the [[helmsman]] through the wheelhouse windows and damaging the ship's radio antennas. The collision had damaged the forward steam engine and propeller shaft, and ''Sampo'' was resting high on the rocks with the bow propeller above the water.<ref name=\"laurell263-265\">Laurell 1992, p. 263-265</ref>\n\nThe first rescue attempts were made on the following day when two [[tugboat]]s tried to turn the stern of ''Sampo'' towards open water together with the icebreaker's own engine and rudder. However, the task was deemed impossible and the tugboats evacuated the pilot and the women working in the icebreaker's kitchen to [[M\u00e4ntyluoto]]. On 8 January ''Sampo'' was further damaged when the wind pushed a large ice floe against the side of the icebreaker and the waves began pounding her hull against the rocks. Both engine rooms flooded and the pumps stopped. In the following night ''Sampo'' slowly settled in the bottom, listing the partially submerged icebreaker approximately 20 degrees starboard. The remaining crew members were evacuated in heavy weather and freezing temperatures on the following day. The salvaging ''Sampo'' was awarded to the Finnish [[marine salvage|salvage]] company [[Neptun Maritime|Neptun Oy]], but the task was deemed impossible in the presence of ice.<ref name=\"laurell263-265\" />\n\nWhile waiting for the spring thaw, ''Sampo'' was [[camouflage]]d with tree branches to resemble a small island. This was not very successful, because during the last weeks of the Winter War the Soviet bombers made several attempts to destroy the ship. However, despite dropping at least 250 bombs on the grounded icebreaker the enemy pilots never scored a hit.<ref name=\"laurell263-265\" />\n\nThe Winter War ended on 13 March 1940 with ''Sampo'' still grounded outside Pori.<ref name=\"Laurell277\">Laurell 1992, p. 277.</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==== Interim peace ====\n[[File:Assistans Sampo.jpg|thumb|right|Neptun's salvage ship ''[[Assistans]]'' next to the partially submerged ''Sampo''.]]\n\nNeptun began salvaging the grounded ''Sampo'' in May 1940 by emptying the coal storages and melting the ice masses inside the vessel with steam. The icebreaker was towed to [[Turku]] in June because the longer distance to Helsinki was deemed too risky \u2014 large stones had wedged between the mangled bottom plating, and had they fallen during the transit, ''Sampo'' would have filled with water and sunk. The icebreaker arrived in Turku on the [[Midsummer Eve]] of 1940 and after emergency repairs was towed to [[Hietalahti shipyard]] in Helsinki, where it remained for extensive repairs until 13 March 1941.<ref name=\"Laurell277\" />\n\n=== The Second World War ===\n\n==== Continuation War ====\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] began on 25 June 1941, the Finnish icebreakers were re-armed and their anti-aircraft armament was improved. The winter of 1942 was the worst since the 1740s and ''Sampo'' was sent to assist ships stuck in ice all the way to the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The following winters were much milder and ''Sampo'' survived the war without major incidents.<ref name=\"laurell282-291\">Laurell 1992, p. 282-291.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, after the war had ended to the [[Moscow Armistice]], the [[Allied Control Commission (Finland)|Allied Control Commission]] ordered ''Sampo'' to assist ships in the Soviet port of [[Leningrad]].<ref name=\"kaukiainen\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 226.</ref>\n\n=== Post-war years ===\n\nAfter the newest and most powerful state-owned icebreakers, [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] and [[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu (icebreaker)|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'']], were handed over to Soviet Union as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]], Finland was left with four old steam-powered icebreakers and the small [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']], which had been rejected due to the extensive damage it had sustained in the war.<ref name=\"kaukiainen165\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 165.</ref> The newest steam-powered icebreaker, ''Tarmo'', was almost 40 years old and along with the others long overdue for replacement \u2014 even the largest Finnish icebreakers were not wide and powerful enough to assist the biggest post-war cargo ships. There was also a severe shortage of coal and occasionally the Finnish icebreakers had to rely on firewood.<ref name=\"laurell304\">Laurell 1992, p. 304.</ref> The steam-powered icebreakers were completely overhauled for the last time in 1951\u20131952 when they finally received modern navigation equipment \u2014 even as late as 1952 some had neither [[gyrocompass]], [[sonar]] nor [[radar]] \u2014 and their crew spaces were rebuilt to modern standards.<ref name=\"Laurell315\">Laurell 1992, p. 315.</ref> There were talks about converting the furnaces of ''Sampo'' from coal to oil, but it was not deemed necessary as the old icebreaker was due to decommissioning in the near future.\n\nOnce the war reparations to the Soviet Union had been paid in 1952, Finland started renewing its icebreaker fleet. The first state-owned icebreaker built after the Second World War, diesel-electric [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], was delivered in 1954 as a replacement for ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu''.<ref name=\"laurell318\">Laurell 1992, p. 318.</ref> During the winter of 1956, the coldest of the decade, the new icebreaker assisted, among other ships, the old steam-powered icebreakers \u2014 ''Sampo'' had even ran out of coal while attempting to free herself after having been immobilized by the severe ice conditions.<ref name=\"laurell320330\">Laurell 1992, p. 320, 330</ref>\n\n=== Decommissioning ===\n\nWhen the harsh winters of the 1950s showed that more modern icebreakers were needed, a series of slightly smaller diesel-electric icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago. [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|''Karhu'']] replaced ''Murtaja'' in 1958, the new [[Finnish icebreaker Murtaja (1959)|''Murtaja'']] replaced [[Apu (1899 icebreaker)|''Apu'']] in 1959 and the new diesel-electric [[Sampo (1960 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] replaced the old steam-powered one in 1960.<ref name=\"laurell330-335\">Laurell 1992, p. 330-335.</ref>\n\nOne of the last tasks of the old icebreaker was to tow the recently decommissioned [[full rigged ship|full rigged]] [[training ship]] ''[[Suomen Joutsen]]'' from [[Porkkala]] to [[Turku]], where the three-masted [[frigate]] would be converted to a Seamen's School for the [[Finnish Merchant Navy]], on 15\u201317 January 1960. ''Sampo'' was decommissioned shortly afterwards, on 9 May. The last Finnish steam-powered icebreaker, [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']], remained in service until 1970.<ref name=\"laurell330-335\"/>\n\nWhile initially there were talks about saving ''Sampo'' and turning her into a [[museum ship]], the cultural and historical importance of the old steam-powered icebreaker was not recognized at that time and the 62-year-old ship was sold for scrap. She was broken up on a small shipyard in [[Mathildedal]] in [[Southwest Finland]].<ref name=\"teijo\">Sipil\u00e4, P. Romutuksia ja uudisrakenteita Teijon telakalla. Laiva 1/2001.</ref> Her wooden [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] was salvaged and put on display in the main office of the [[Finnish Maritime Administration]], and the wooden paneling and furniture of the salon was bought by the Finnish yacht club [[Suomalainen Pursiseura]] for their club restaurant in [[Sirpalesaari]], [[Helsinki]]. In addition the bow propeller shaft of ''Sampo'' serves the Finnish winter navigation to this day as part of a sea mark on a small skerry southeast from the island of [[Ut\u00f6, Finland|Ut\u00f6]].<ref name=\"laurell330-335\" />\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n''Sampo'' was {{convert|61.40|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|58.35|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[waterline length|at the waterline]].

The bow was reinforced with a wide ice belt up to one inch ({{convert|1|in|cm|1|disp=output only|abbr=on}}) thick and all steel structures were dimensioned beyond [[Lloyd's Register]] requirements.<ref name=\"laurell58-59\" /> The angle of the stem, the first part of the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it under the weight of the ship, was 24 degrees.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> Other innovative features included propeller blades that could be replaced underwater by the icebreaker's divers.\n\n''Sampo'' was powered by two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]], one driving a propeller in the stern and the other a second propeller in the bow. The main function of the bow propeller was to reduce friction between the hull and the ice, although the exact details of the icebreaking process were not known at that time.<ref name=\"laurell52-56\" /> The stern engine produced 1,600 [[indicated horsepower|ihp]] at 110 rpm and the bow engine 1,400 ihp at 115 rpm.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> During the sea trials the maximum indicated output of the two steam engines was 3,052 ihp and when the engines were producing 2,500 ihp, the icebreaker could maintain a speed of 12.4 knots in open water.<ref name=\"laurell60-61\" /> ''Sampo'' had five coal-fired boilers for the main engines in two boiler rooms and a small auxiliary boiler for heating, deck equipment and light generator in the foremost boiler room.<ref name=\"laurell58-59\" /> The fuel stores could hold 350 tons of coal that was fed to the fireboxes at a rate of 2.4\u20133.2 tons per hour.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> Like all icebreakers of her age, ''Sampo'' was also equipped with sails although they were rarely, if ever, used.<ref name=\"laurell77\">Laurell 1992, p. 77.</ref>\n\n''Sampo'' was equipped for escort icebreaker duties with a towing winch, a cable and a stern notch.

Built in 1898 by [[Armstrong Whitworth|Sir W.G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co Ltd]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], United Kingdom and named after [[Sampo|a magical artifact]] from the [[Finnish mythology]], she was the second state-owned icebreaker of Finland and the first European icebreaker equipped with a bow propeller. When ''Sampo'' was decommissioned and broken up in 1960, she was also the second last steam-powered icebreaker in the Finnish icebreaker fleet.\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nPrior to building ''Sampo'', Finland had only one state-owned icebreaker, [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']], which was built in 1890 and was one of the first purpose-built icebreakers in the world. However, the 930-ton single-screw vessel was not powerful enough to keep even the southernmost port of Finland, [[Hanko]], open during severe winters and the icebreaking characteristics of its [[spoon-shaped bow]] were not as good as was hoped for.<ref name=\"laurell30\">Laurell 1992, p. 30.</ref><ref name=\"laurell44\">Laurell 1992, p. 44.</ref> A committee, appointed by the [[Senate of Finland]] in 1895 to find a solution to the problem, came to a conclusion that a second state-owned icebreaker would be needed.<ref name=\"laurell52-56\">Laurell 1992, p. 52-56.</ref>\n\nIn the 1890s the Senate sent two engineers and [[Leonard Mel\u00e1n]], who later became the captain of ''Sampo'', to investigate a new icebreaker design that had been developed in the United States in the 1880s and find out its icebreaking capability. Unlike the European icebreakers, the 1888-built [[train ferry]] [[St Ignace (ship)|''St Ignace'']] had two propellers, one at both end of the ship. Convinced about the superiority of the new design, the winter navigation committee recommended that the new icebreaker should be of the so-called \"American type\".<ref name=\"laurell52-56\">Laurell 1992, p. 52-56.</ref>\n\nIn February 1897 the Senate sent a [[request for tender]] to eight shipbuilders for the construction of a new icebreaker. On 6 June 1897 the contract was signed with Sir W.G. Armstrong, Whitworth & Co Ltd from Newcastle upon Tyne. While not the cheapest, the shipyard had the shortest delivery time \u2014 only seven months \u2014 for an icebreaker with a bow propeller.<ref name=\"laurell58-59\" />\n\nWhile the initial delivery date was 18 January 1898, ''Sampo'' was not delivered until October of the same year due to problems with material deliveries and strikes among the shipyard's workers. She was launched in the spring of 1898 and left for the first sea trials on 23 August. However, the bow propeller shaft seized shortly after leaving the dock and the icebreaker returned to the shipyard. The coal consumption was also 11% greater than what was specified in the contract, but instead of making changes the heating system the shipyard reduced the price by \u00a3700. The second sea trial on 21 September was successful and ''Sampo'' left for Finland on 25 October 1898 and arrived to Helsinki four days later.<ref name=\"laurell60-61\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n''Sampo'' was officially commissioned on 15 November 1898 and began assisting ships outside the port of Hanko while the smaller ''Murtaja'' was stationed closer to the harbour. From the first day on the new icebreaker, capable of breaking through ridges up to six metres thick by ramming, performed beyond expectations and was generally deemed the best icebreaker in Europe at that time. On 9 March 1899, her performance was demonstrated to the director of the [[Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority]]  when both state-owned icebreakers headed to the sea, ''Murtaja'' running in a previously opened channel and ''Sampo'' alongside in unbroken ice. However, on the way back to the port ''Sampo'', followed by ''Murtaja'', encountered a thick ice ridge and came to a halt. The smaller icebreaker could not stop in time and collided with ''Sampo'', causing damage to her stern structures but fortunately no injuries to the passengers. ''Sampo'' ended her first winter season on 16 May 1899, during which she had assisted 128 ships.<ref name=\"laurell64-65\" />\n\nThe first decade of ''Sampo'' passed without major incidents. In 1907, another icebreaker with a bow propeller, [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']], was ordered from the builders of ''Sampo''.<ref name=\"laurell72-73\">Laurell 1992, p. 72-73.</ref>\n\n=== First World War ===\n\nIn August 1914 [[Russian Empire|Russia]] joined the First World War and navigating in the Baltic Sea became dangerous due to [[naval mine]]s and [[Kaiserliche Marine|German]] [[U-boat]]s. The Finnish icebreakers were placed under the command of the [[Baltic Fleet]] of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and given the task of assisting naval ships and troop transportations in the Gulf of Finland. Unlike ''Tarmo'', ''Sampo'' was not armed with a deck gun. Icebreaker assistance to merchant ships was largely neglected.<ref name=\"laurell91-93\">Laurell 1992, p. 91-93.</ref> ''Sampo'' survived the war without damage.\n\nOn 6 December 1917 the [[Parliament of Finland]] accepted the declaration of independence given by the Senate and on 29 December the icebreakers ''Murtaja'' and ''Sampo'' raised the [[flag of Finland|state flag of the independent Finland]] for the first time.<ref name=\"laurell99\">Laurell 1992, p. 99.</ref> However, already in early January 1918 the ship was seized by the Russian revolutionary fleet and ordered to assist the Russian troops stationed in Finland. The [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] in [[Korpo]] and [[Nagu]] attempted to retake ''Sampo'' later in January but failed.<ref name=\"laurell100-101\">Laurell 1991, p. 100-101.</ref>\n\n=== Finnish Civil War ===\n\nOn 27 January 1918 the [[Red Guard (Finland)|Red Guard]] took over Helsinki and the [[Finnish Civil War]] began.<ref name=\"laurell100-101\" /> However, on the same day ''Sampo'' managed to escape to Sweden and join the [[Whites (Finland)|Whites]]. The Russian [[commissar]] who was on board at the time was taken into custody and left on ice outside the port of [[Pori]] before the icebreaker headed for [[G\u00e4vle]] to wait for further orders.<ref name=\"laurell103-107\">Laurell 1992, p. 103-107.</ref>\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Sampo (1898) assisting Castor in February 1918.jpg|thumb|''Sampo'' assisting {{SS|Castor}} during the [[Finnish Civil War]] in February 1918.]]\n\n''Sampo'' had a significant impact on the outcome of the Civil War when it assisted three convoys to the White-controlled ports in northern Finland. The ships brought more than a thousand [[J\u00e4ger Movement|J\u00e4gers]], Finnish volunteers trained in Germany, and enough weapons for the whole White Guard. The first convoy left [[Danzig]] on 11 February 1918 and was picked up by ''Sampo'' three days later outside the island of [[M\u00e4rket]]. The steamships [[SS Mira (Finnish ship)|''Mira'']] and [[SS Poseidon|''Poseidon'']], owned by the [[Finland Steamship Company]] and carrying 85 J\u00e4gers and weapons for the Finnish troops, arrived at [[Vaasa]] on 18 February. On 20 February, ''Sampo'' encountered the second convoy in the [[Stockholm archipelago]]. The ships, passenger steamship [[Arcturus (steamship)|''Arcturus'']] and cargo steamer [[SS Castor|''Castor'']], had left [[Liep\u0101ja|Libau]] on 14 February with the bulk of the troops, 950 J\u00e4gers, and some 1,200 tons of coal. ''Castor'' was left outside [[G\u00e4vle]] while ''Arcturus'' was escorted through difficult ice conditions to Vaasa, where it arrived on 25 February in the midst of a large crowd of cheering people. The last ship, [[SS Virgo|''Virgo'']], left [[Neufahrwasser]] on 20 February with 25 soldiers and full cargo of weapons, and was assisted to Vaasa on 2 March.<ref name=\"laurell103-107\" />\n\nOn 4 April, while heading out from the port of Hanko with German warships, the convoy led by ''Sampo'' encountered another Finnish icebreaker, ''Murtaja'', coming from [[Ut\u00f6, Finland|Ut\u00f6]] with the steamship [[SS Dragsfj\u00e4rd|''Dragsfj\u00e4rd'']]. Both ships were filled with Red Guard and Russian soldiers, but after several warning shots from the German naval vessels most of the enemy soldiers fled on ice and ''Murtaja'' was taken over by the Whites.<ref name=\"laurell103-107\" />\n\n''Sampo'' arrived to Helsinki for the summer on 12 May 1918, three days before the Civil War ended to decisive White victory.<ref name=\"laurell103-107\" />\n\n=== Interwar period ===\n\nWhile ''Sampo'' had not been damaged in the war, she was docked at the [[Hietalahti shipyard]] for extensive maintenance and repairs \u2014 when she left to the port of Hanko in mid-February 1919, 69 bottom plates had been replaced.<ref name=\"laurell121-122\">Laurell 1992, p. 121-122.</ref> In December 1922 ''Sampo'' struck a rock in the port of [[Loviisa]] and her bow propeller shaft was damaged, but there was no time for repairs and for the rest of the season she had to assist ships to the port of Helsinki without her bow propeller.<ref name=\"laurell131-132\">Laurell 1992, p. 131-132.</ref> Another incident occurred on 24 March 1926 when the bow propeller of ''Sampo'' hit a stone bank in the port of Helsinki, came loose and dropped to the bottom. It was found after searching for a couple of days and winched on board. On 30 March, while ''Sampo'' was assisting a Finnish steamship [[SS Albert Kasimir|''Albert Kasimir'']], the stern propeller shaft snapped when the engine was reversed and the propeller dropped to the bottom. While the icebreaker still had its bow propeller, it was of no use as it was waiting for installation on the foredeck. ''Murtaja'' towed the immobilized icebreaker to Hanko on the following day and to Helsinki for repairs on 20 April.<ref name=\"laurell156-157\">Laurell 1992, p. 156-157.</ref>\n\nBetween 1919 and 1922 ''Sampo'' assisted 636 ships, more than any other Finnish icebreaker during that time.<ref name=\"laurell131-132\"/> In the 1920s the need for new icebreakers was recognized and two new steam-powered icebreakers were built.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> From 1926 on ''Sampo'' and ''Tarmo'' began their winter season from the eastern parts of the Gulf of Finland, assisting ships to [[Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast|Koivisto]], [[Viipuri]] and [[Kotka]], and moved to western ports as the harbours were closed for winter.<ref name=\"laurell158-159\">Laurell 1992, p. 158-159.</ref> In 1929 the whole [[Baltic Sea]] was frozen and ''Sampo'' was sent to the [[Danish straits]] for two months.<ref name=\"laurell176\">Laurell 1992, p. 176.</ref>\n\n==== Winter War ====\n[[File:Sampo grounded 1940.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''Sampo'' grounded and camouflaged with tree branches.]]\n\nDue to the worsening relations with the Soviet Union, ''Sampo'' and other state-owned icebreakers were armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker fleet shortly before the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939. The Finnish icebreakers had been equipped with gun mounts already in the 1920s and were armed with light artillery. However, a bit over month into the war ''Sampo'' ran hard aground and was out of service for more than a year.<ref name=\"laurell259-260\">Laurell 1992, p. 259-260.</ref>\n\nOn 6 January 1940 ''Sampo'' was assisting a convoy of three merchant ships towards [[Pori]] in difficult conditions \u2014 the temperature was nearly {{convert|-30|C|F}} and fog reduced the visibility to zero. The icebreaker was proceeding in light ice conditions at {{convert|8|kn|abbr=out}} when she collided with an underwater obstacle and suddenly stopped, throwing the [[helmsman]] through the wheelhouse windows and damaging the ship's radio antennas. The collision had damaged the forward steam engine and propeller shaft, and ''Sampo'' was resting high on the rocks with the bow propeller above the water.<ref name=\"laurell263-265\">Laurell 1992, p. 263-265</ref>\n\nThe first rescue attempts were made on the following day when two [[tugboat]]s tried to turn the stern of ''Sampo'' towards open water together with the icebreaker's own engine and rudder. However, the task was deemed impossible and the tugboats evacuated the pilot and the women working in the icebreaker's kitchen to [[M\u00e4ntyluoto]]. On 8 January ''Sampo'' was further damaged when the wind pushed a large ice floe against the side of the icebreaker and the waves began pounding her hull against the rocks. Both engine rooms flooded and the pumps stopped. In the following night ''Sampo'' slowly settled in the bottom, listing the partially submerged icebreaker approximately 20 degrees starboard. The remaining crew members were evacuated in heavy weather and freezing temperatures on the following day. The salvaging ''Sampo'' was awarded to the Finnish [[marine salvage|salvage]] company [[Neptun Maritime|Neptun Oy]], but the task was deemed impossible in the presence of ice.<ref name=\"laurell263-265\" />\n\nWhile waiting for the spring thaw, ''Sampo'' was [[camouflage]]d with tree branches to resemble a small island. This was not very successful, because during the last weeks of the Winter War the Soviet bombers made several attempts to destroy the ship. However, despite dropping at least 250 bombs on the grounded icebreaker the enemy pilots never scored a hit.<ref name=\"laurell263-265\" />\n\nThe Winter War ended on 13 March 1940 with ''Sampo'' still grounded outside Pori.<ref name=\"Laurell277\">Laurell 1992, p. 277.</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==== Interim peace ====\n[[File:Assistans Sampo.jpg|thumb|right|Neptun's salvage ship ''[[Assistans]]'' next to the partially submerged ''Sampo''.]]\n\nNeptun began salvaging the grounded ''Sampo'' in May 1940 by emptying the coal storages and melting the ice masses inside the vessel with steam. The icebreaker was towed to [[Turku]] in June because the longer distance to Helsinki was deemed too risky \u2014 large stones had wedged between the mangled bottom plating, and had they fallen during the transit, ''Sampo'' would have filled with water and sunk. The icebreaker arrived in Turku on the [[Midsummer Eve]] of 1940 and after emergency repairs was towed to [[Hietalahti shipyard]] in Helsinki, where it remained for extensive repairs until 13 March 1941.<ref name=\"Laurell277\" />\n\n=== The Second World War ===\n\n==== Continuation War ====\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] began on 25 June 1941, the Finnish icebreakers were re-armed and their anti-aircraft armament was improved. The winter of 1942 was the worst since the 1740s and ''Sampo'' was sent to assist ships stuck in ice all the way to the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The following winters were much milder and ''Sampo'' survived the war without major incidents.<ref name=\"laurell282-291\">Laurell 1992, p. 282-291.</ref>\n\nIn 1946, after the war had ended to the [[Moscow Armistice]], the [[Allied Control Commission (Finland)|Allied Control Commission]] ordered ''Sampo'' to assist ships in the Soviet port of [[Leningrad]].<ref name=\"kaukiainen\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 226.</ref>\n\n=== Post-war years ===\n\nAfter the newest and most powerful state-owned icebreakers, [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] and [[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu (icebreaker)|''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'']], were handed over to Soviet Union as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]], Finland was left with four old steam-powered icebreakers and the small [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[Sisu (1938 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']], which had been rejected due to the extensive damage it had sustained in the war.<ref name=\"kaukiainen165\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 165.</ref> The newest steam-powered icebreaker, ''Tarmo'', was almost 40 years old and along with the others long overdue for replacement \u2014 even the largest Finnish icebreakers were not wide and powerful enough to assist the biggest post-war cargo ships. There was also a severe shortage of coal and occasionally the Finnish icebreakers had to rely on firewood.<ref name=\"laurell304\">Laurell 1992, p. 304.</ref> The steam-powered icebreakers were completely overhauled for the last time in 1951\u20131952 when they finally received modern navigation equipment \u2014 even as late as 1952 some had neither [[gyrocompass]], [[sonar]] nor [[radar]] \u2014 and their crew spaces were rebuilt to modern standards.<ref name=\"Laurell315\">Laurell 1992, p. 315.</ref> There were talks about converting the furnaces of ''Sampo'' from coal to oil, but it was not deemed necessary as the old icebreaker was due to decommissioning in the near future.\n\nOnce the war reparations to the Soviet Union had been paid in 1952, Finland started renewing its icebreaker fleet. The first state-owned icebreaker built after the Second World War, diesel-electric [[Voima (1952 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], was delivered in 1954 as a replacement for ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu''.<ref name=\"laurell318\">Laurell 1992, p. 318.</ref> During the winter of 1956, the coldest of the decade, the new icebreaker assisted, among other ships, the old steam-powered icebreakers \u2014 ''Sampo'' had even ran out of coal while attempting to free herself after having been immobilized by the severe ice conditions.<ref name=\"laurell320330\">Laurell 1992, p. 320, 330</ref>\n\n=== Decommissioning ===\n\nWhen the harsh winters of the 1950s showed that more modern icebreakers were needed, a series of slightly smaller diesel-electric icebreakers were built for operations within the archipelago. [[Finnish icebreaker Karhu (1958)|''Karhu'']] replaced ''Murtaja'' in 1958, the new [[Finnish icebreaker Murtaja (1959)|''Murtaja'']] replaced [[Apu (1899 icebreaker)|''Apu'']] in 1959 and the new diesel-electric [[Sampo (1960 icebreaker)|''Sampo'']] replaced the old steam-powered one in 1960.<ref name=\"laurell330-335\">Laurell 1992, p. 330-335.</ref>\n\nOne of the last tasks of the old icebreaker was to tow the recently decommissioned [[full rigged ship|full rigged]] [[training ship]] ''[[Suomen Joutsen]]'' from [[Porkkala]] to [[Turku]], where the three-masted [[frigate]] would be converted to a Seamen's School for the [[Finnish Merchant Navy]], on 15\u201317 January 1960. ''Sampo'' was decommissioned shortly afterwards, on 9 May. The last Finnish steam-powered icebreaker, [[Tarmo (1907 icebreaker)|''Tarmo'']], remained in service until 1970.<ref name=\"laurell330-335\"/>\n\nWhile initially there were talks about saving ''Sampo'' and turning her into a [[museum ship]], the cultural and historical importance of the old steam-powered icebreaker was not recognized at that time and the 62-year-old ship was sold for scrap. She was broken up on a small shipyard in [[Mathildedal]] in [[Southwest Finland]].<ref name=\"teijo\">Sipil\u00e4, P. Romutuksia ja uudisrakenteita Teijon telakalla. Laiva 1/2001.</ref> Her wooden [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] was salvaged and put on display in the main office of the [[Finnish Maritime Administration]], and the wooden paneling and furniture of the salon was bought by the Finnish yacht club [[Suomalainen Pursiseura]] for their club restaurant in [[Sirpalesaari]], [[Helsinki]]. In addition the bow propeller shaft of ''Sampo'' serves the Finnish winter navigation to this day as part of a sea mark on a small skerry southeast from the island of [[Ut\u00f6, Finland|Ut\u00f6]].<ref name=\"laurell330-335\" />\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n''Sampo'' was {{convert|61.40|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[length overall|long overall]] and {{convert|58.35|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} [[waterline length|at the waterline]]. Her [[moulded breadth]] was {{convert|13.00|m|ft|2|abbr=out}} and breadth at the waterline slightly smaller, {{convert|12.80|m|ft|2|abbr=out}}. The draught of the icebreaker at maximum displacement, 2,050 tons, was defined in the contract as {{convert|17|ft|3|in|m|2}} in the bow and {{convert|18|ft|3|in|m|2}} in the stern.<ref name=\"laurell58-59\" /><ref name=\"laurell344\" /> She was initially operated by a crew of 36, but this was later increased by two divers and additional [[Fireman (steam engine)|stokers]].<ref name=\"laurell291\">Laurell 1992, p. 291.</ref>\n\nThe hull of ''Sampo'' was built of [[Siemens-Martin steel]] and divided into watertight compartments by eight transverse bulkheads. The bow was reinforced with a wide ice belt up to one inch ({{convert|1|in|cm|1|disp=output only|abbr=on}}) thick and all steel structures were dimensioned beyond [[Lloyd's Register]] requirements.<ref name=\"laurell58-59\" /> The angle of the stem, the first part of the icebreaker to encounter ice and bend it under the weight of the ship, was 24 degrees.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> Other innovative features included propeller blades that could be replaced underwater by the icebreaker's divers.\n\n''Sampo'' was powered by two [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|triple-expansion steam engines]], one driving a propeller in the stern and the other a second propeller in the bow. The main function of the bow propeller was to reduce friction between the hull and the ice, although the exact details of the icebreaking process were not known at that time.<ref name=\"laurell52-56\" /> The stern engine produced 1,600 [[indicated horsepower|ihp]] at 110 rpm and the bow engine 1,400 ihp at 115 rpm.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> During the sea trials the maximum indicated output of the two steam engines was 3,052 ihp and when the engines were producing 2,500 ihp, the icebreaker could maintain a speed of 12.4 knots in open water.<ref name=\"laurell60-61\" /> ''Sampo'' had five coal-fired boilers for the main engines in two boiler rooms and a small auxiliary boiler for heating, deck equipment and light generator in the foremost boiler room.<ref name=\"laurell58-59\" /> The fuel stores could hold 350 tons of coal that was fed to the fireboxes at a rate of 2.4\u20133.2 tons per hour.<ref name=\"laurell344\" /> Like all icebreakers of her age, ''Sampo'' was also equipped with sails although they were rarely, if ever, used.<ref name=\"laurell77\">Laurell 1992, p. 77.</ref>\n\n''Sampo'' was equipped for escort icebreaker duties with a towing winch, a cable and a stern notch. In difficult ice conditions the ship being assisted was taken into tow, and in extremely difficult compressive ice it was pulled to the icebreaker's stern notch.<ref name=\"laurell198-200\">Laurell 1992, p. 198-200.</ref> For salvage operations ''Sampo'' had a powerful [[centrifugal pump]] capable of pumping 700 tons of water per hour.<ref name=\"laurell58-59\" />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Commons category|Sampo (ship, 1898)|''Sampo''}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n{{cite book |last= Kaukiainen |first= Yrj\u00f6 |title= Navigare Necesse - Merenkulkulaitos 1917&ndash;1992 |publisher= Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6776-4}}\n\n{{cite book |last= Laurell |first= Seppo |title= H\u00f6yrymurtajien aika |publisher= Gummerus Kirjapaino Oy | location = Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 |year= 1992 |isbn= 951-47-6775-6}}\n\n{{Icebreakers of Finland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sampo (1898)}}\n[[Category:Icebreakers of Finland]]\n[[Category:Ships built by Armstrong Whitworth]]\n[[Category:1898 ships]]\n[[Category:World War I naval ships of Russia]]\n[[Category:World War II naval ships of Finland]]\n", "name_user": "Tupsumato", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampo_(1898_icebreaker)"}

During the season, reduced to 24 teams after three promotions and relegations, [[Ernest Erbstein]] was appointed as the team's technical director and the Englishman [[Leslie Lievesley]] became the coach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chesterfield-fc.co.uk/page/PastPlayersDetail/0,,10435~979069,00.html | title = Past players |publisher=Chesterfield F.C. | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}</ref>\nThe campaign also saw injuries to [[Virgilio Maroso]], [[Eusebio Castigliano]], [[Romeo Menti]] and [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofc.it/storia|title=La Storia del Torino Fc|publisher=Torino Football Club|language=Italian|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>, plus the long suspension for [[Aldo Ballarin]]. The Granata, which debuted with a victory against [[Aurora Pro Patria 1919|Pro Patria]], suffered a defeat in the second round to [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]; the team recovered with five straight wins, including that of the [[Turin derby|derby]], but lost again, in [[Milan]], against the ''Rossoneri''.\nThe club would relinquish the lead in the standings<ref>{{Cite book|author=Ormezzano|title=Toro 49|p= 164}}.</ref>, then recapture it, finishing midway through the season on par with [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], from which a third defeat was suffered, losing 3\u20130. In the return leg of the derby Torino would defeat [[Juventus]] 3\u20130. \nTorino's advantage increased in the standings, gaining a maximum of six point on [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in second place<ref>{{cite book|author=Colombero,|title=Pacifico|p=120}}</ref>. However, a pair of draws (in [[Trieste]] and [[Bari]]) allowed Inter to close the gap within four points from Torino. On 30 April 1949, the two clubs met in Milan, ending 0\u20130, with Torino approaching their fifth consecutive title (the record would be equaled).\nThe team travelled to Portugal to play in a friendly against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. However, upon return Torino perished in the [[Superga air disaster]].\n\n=== Superga air disaster ===\n{{main|Superga air disaster}}\nThe airplane with the team crashed at [[Basilica di Superga]] nearby Torino. There were deaths of team chairmen and club workers, baggage men and three of the best journalists  in the country at the time: [[Renato Casalbore]] (founder of Tuttosport magazine); [[Renato Tosatti]] (from journal Gazzetta del Popolo) and [[Luigi Cavallero]] (from journal La Stampa). \nThe shocking corpse identification was made by former Italian National Team manager [[Vittorio Pozzo]]. The spezzino player [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]], injured, did not travel to Lisboa. The following persons in the Torino circle did not travel: second goalkeeper [[Renato Gandolfi]] (instead third  goalkeeper [[Dino Ballarin]] did), the radio anchor [[Nicol\u00f2 Carosio]] and former manager of Italian National Team also journalist Vittorio Pozzo (Torino prefered to give the seat to Cavallero).\n<ref>{{cite web |author=Patrick Jennings |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46788983 |title=The plane crash that killed Serie A's champions and their English coach |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpWbGJPo1-c&source=video&vgc=rss&usg=AFQjCNFfzesVbEpVRJXx4KxoHr8LKgclPQ |title=TG-R \"Leonardo\": possibili cause della sciagura di Superga: l'ipotesi dell'altimetro guasto|publisher= Andrea Sinaglia YouTube }}</ref>\n\n====Legacy====\nThe impact of the tragedy in Italy was colossal.

Game which Toro lost 4-3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toro.it/press/view/3228|title=3 May 1949: Benfica-Torino 4-3|publisher=toro.it}}</ref> Torino was named winner of the championship  by  the Federation, and the Youth squad was able to play the last 4 rounds.\nFinished a short summer interval from the end of previous season, competition officially resumed in Italy after the [[1948 Summer Olympics]]. Prematurely eliminated, [[Vittorio Pozzo]] lost his position as sole commissioner of the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] and [[Ferruccio Novo]] took his place.\n\nNew season began in mid-September with a Torino almost identical to that of the previous championships; there was only [[Franco Ossola]] permanently in place of [[Pietro Ferraris]], who, at age 36, had moved to [[Novara Calcio|Novara]]. The [[central midfielder|midfielder]] [[Rubens Fadini]] arrived from Gallarate, [[Dino Ballarin]], brother of the goalkeeper [[Aldo Ballarin|Aldo]] was signed from Chioggia; the Hungarian-Czechoslovakian [[J\u00falius Schubert]], a left-sided midfielder; and strikers [[Emile Bongiorni]] and [[Ruggero Grava]] arrived from [[Racing Club de France|Racing Parigi]] and [[CO Roubaix-Tourcoing|Roubaix-Tourcoing]] respectively.\nThe club began the season after a long tour in [[Brazil]] where the team met [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]], losing only once. During the season, reduced to 24 teams after three promotions and relegations, [[Ernest Erbstein]] was appointed as the team's technical director and the Englishman [[Leslie Lievesley]] became the coach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chesterfield-fc.co.uk/page/PastPlayersDetail/0,,10435~979069,00.html | title = Past players |publisher=Chesterfield F.C. | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}</ref>\nThe campaign also saw injuries to [[Virgilio Maroso]], [[Eusebio Castigliano]], [[Romeo Menti]] and [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofc.it/storia|title=La Storia del Torino Fc|publisher=Torino Football Club|language=Italian|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>, plus the long suspension for [[Aldo Ballarin]]. The Granata, which debuted with a victory against [[Aurora Pro Patria 1919|Pro Patria]], suffered a defeat in the second round to [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]; the team recovered with five straight wins, including that of the [[Turin derby|derby]], but lost again, in [[Milan]], against the ''Rossoneri''.\nThe club would relinquish the lead in the standings<ref>{{Cite book|author=Ormezzano|title=Toro 49|p= 164}}.</ref>, then recapture it, finishing midway through the season on par with [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], from which a third defeat was suffered, losing 3\u20130. In the return leg of the derby Torino would defeat [[Juventus]] 3\u20130. \nTorino's advantage increased in the standings, gaining a maximum of six point on [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in second place<ref>{{cite book|author=Colombero,|title=Pacifico|p=120}}</ref>. However, a pair of draws (in [[Trieste]] and [[Bari]]) allowed Inter to close the gap within four points from Torino. On 30 April 1949, the two clubs met in Milan, ending 0\u20130, with Torino approaching their fifth consecutive title (the record would be equaled).\nThe team travelled to Portugal to play in a friendly against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. However, upon return Torino perished in the [[Superga air disaster]].\n\n=== Superga air disaster ===\n{{main|Superga air disaster}}\nThe airplane with the team crashed at [[Basilica di Superga]] nearby Torino. There were deaths of team chairmen and club workers, baggage men and three of the best journalists  in the country at the time: [[Renato Casalbore]] (founder of Tuttosport magazine); [[Renato Tosatti]] (from journal Gazzetta del Popolo) and [[Luigi Cavallero]] (from journal La Stampa). \nThe shocking corpse identification was made by former Italian National Team manager [[Vittorio Pozzo]].

Built in 1939 at [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Hietalahti Shipyard]] in [[Helsinki]], she was one of the world's first [[diesel-electric]] icebreakers. In addition to icebreaking duties, she served as a [[submarine tender]] for the [[Finnish Navy]] during the summer months until the end of the [[Continuation War]].\n\nIn 1975, ''Sisu'' was handed over to the Finnish Navy and renamed '''''Louhi'''''. She was decommissioned in 1986 and sold for scrap.\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nWhile the economic growth stagnated in Finland in the early 1930s following the [[Great Depression]], international trade began to recover relatively soon and in particular the export of forest products from the ports in the [[Bothnian Bay]] was growing. Already in 1932, a delegation from [[Northern Ostrobothnia]] submitted a proposal for the construction of a new state-owned icebreaker. In 1935, another large delegation of politicians and representatives from coastal cities proposed expanding the state-owned icebreaker fleet. They were also strongly supported by the growing Finnish forest industry.<ref name=\"laurell190\" /><ref name=\"ramsay338\">Ramsay 1949, pp. 338\u2013346.</ref><ref name=\"kaukiainen114\">Kaukiainen 1992, pp. 114\u2013117.</ref>\n\nAt the time, Finland had a fleet of six steam-powered icebreakers to keep trade routes open through the winter months. Following the commissioning of ''[[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu]]'' in 1926, the [[Finnish Board of Navigation]] had planned to replace the smallest vessels of the state-owned fleet, the 1890-built [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] and the 1899-built [[Apu (1899 icebreaker)|''Apu'']], with a new medium-sized icebreaker.<ref name=\"kaukiainen114\" /> These icebreakers represented the first generation of icebreaker design in the Baltic Sea and were considered obsolete because they had no bow propeller.<ref name=\"ramsay175\">Ramsay 1949, pp. 175\u2013176.</ref> However, the plans were shelved due to the recession.<ref name=\"ramsay338\" />\n\nIn June 1935, a small expert committee led by Captain [[Ilmari Jokinen]], the director of the Finnish Board of Navigation, began investigating the feasibility of a dual-use vessel that could be used as an icebreaker during the winter and as a [[submarine tender]] for the [[Finnish Navy]] during the summer months. The committee found the idea feasible and, in addition, recommended replacing traditional reciprocating [[steam engine]]s with a [[diesel-electric]] power plant pioneered by the Swedish icebreaker [[Ymer (1933 icebreaker)|''Ymer'']] in 1933. While a second expert committee, formed from experienced Finnish naval architects and icebreaker captains in March 1936, proposed purchasing two new icebreakers, the [[Parliament of Finland]] allocated [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 36 million for ordering one medium-sized icebreaker.<ref name=\"kaukiainen114\" />\n\nThe construction of the new icebreaker was awarded to [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab]] and the work began in March 1937.<ref name=\"kaukiainen114\" /> Previously, the Helsinki-based shipyard had completed the unfinished [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] in 1924 and built a port icebreaker for the city of Helsinki in 1936.<ref name=\"ramsay338\" /> On 24 September 1938, the vessel was given the name ''Sisu'', a [[Finnish language|Finnish]] [[sisu|word describing will, determination and perseverance]], that had been chosen by the Finnish schoolchildren. The sponsor of the vessel was Walborg Jokinen, the wife of the late Captain Ilmari Jokinen.<ref name=\"laurell190\" /> While ''Sisu'' was delivered behind the original 20-month schedule and the vessel turned out to be more expensive as predicted, she was generally considered to be a successful design. She was handed over to the Finnish Board of Navigation in March 1939.<ref name=\"ramsay338\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Second World War (1939\u20131944) ===\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Sisu with submarines.jpg|thumb|left|''Sisu'' together with two Finnish submarines.]]\n\nIn late 1939, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers were armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker flotilla due to deteriorating foreign relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. When the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939, ''Sisu'' was still in Helsinki where she was being outfitted for her secondary role as a submarine tender. In the beginning of the war she operated with the Finnish submarines [[Finnish submarine Vesihiisi|''Vesihiisi'']], [[Finnish submarine Vesikko|''Vesikko'']] and [[Finnish submarine Saukko|''Saukko'']] in the [[Gulf of Finland]], but later moved to the [[Archipelago Sea]] to support [[Finnish submarine Vetehinen|''Vetehinen'']] and [[Finnish submarine Iku-Turso|''Iku-Turso'']]. In January 1940, the icebreaker was sent to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] to escort merchant ships after the ice conditions in the Baltic Sea had become too difficult for the submarines.<ref name=\"laurell259\">Laurell 1992, pp. 259\u2013262.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] started in June 1941 after a short period known as the [[Interim Peace]], the state-owned icebreakers resumed their wartime duties. when the whole Baltic Sea froze during the extremely difficult winter of 1942, ''Sisu'' had to escort ships all the way to [[Pillau]] (today Baltiysk in [[Kaliningrad]]) and [[Swinem\u00fcnde]] (today \u015awinouj\u015bcie in Poland). When Finland began suffering from food shortages, ''Sisu'' was paired up with ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'', and together the two most powerful Finnish icebreakers helped to bring in Finnish and German merchant ships carrying much-needed supplies.<ref name=\"laurell282\">Laurell 1992, pp. 282\u2013290.</ref>\n\nOn 19 September 1943, ''Sisu'' struck a Soviet [[naval mine|mine]] that had been dropped on the shipping lane west of the island fort of [[Rys\u00e4kari]] off Helsinki. While no-one was injured, the explosion damaged the propeller shafts and the icebreaker had to be towed to Hietalahti Shipyard for extensive repairs. While the vessel returned to service three months later, these damages were never fully repaired and followed ''Sisu'' until her final decommissioning in the 1980s.<ref name=\"laurell282\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen165\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 165.</ref>\n\nUnlike the other state-owned icebreakers, ''Sisu'' was manned through the Second World War due to her role as a depot ship. During the Winter War, ''Sisu'' was armed with two [[Obukhov State Plant|Obukhov]] 102&nbsp;mm naval guns and two [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|Vickers 40 mm anti-aircraft guns]]. The latter were replaced with two [[Madsen 20 mm cannon]]s and two machine guns in the Continuation War. In 1944, the main battery was replaced with two 105&nbsp;mm [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]] naval guns and one more Madsen 20&nbsp;mm cannon was added to the anti-aircraft battery.<ref>''Suomen Laivasto 1918\u20131968, osa 2''. Meriupseeriyhdistys, 1968.</ref> During the war, ''Sisu'' was painted with camouflage colors.\n\n=== Post-war career (1944\u20131975) ===\n\nWhen the Continuation War ended with the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944, Finland had to hand over its best ice-strengthened tonnage to the Soviet Union as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]]. While this included ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' and ''Voima'', Finland's newest and most powerful steam-powered icebreakers, the Soviets were not interested in the diesel-electric ''Sisu''. The power plant and propulsion system represented unfamiliar technology at the time when all Soviet icebreakers were still powered by reciprocating steam engines.<ref name=\"kaukiainen165\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 165.</ref> In addition, the damages ''Sisu'' had sustained in the mine explosion in 1943 had not been fully repaired.<ref>Kaukiainen 1992, p. 226.</ref> While minor repairs were carried out during the post-war summer layups, no major repairs were not done until 1954 when additional funding was granted for this purpose and the icebreaker was drydocked at Hietalahti shipyard.<ref>Kaukiainen 1992, p. 229.</ref>\n\nSince Finland was no longer allowed to have submarines according to the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty of 1947]], ''Sisu'' lost her secondary role as a submarine tender. While she was briefly used as a training ship for the Finnish Naval Academy in 1949, the icebreaker was not suited to gunnery training and the civilian crew was against co-operation with the Navy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Riimala |first1=Erkki |last2=Hillo |first2=Hannu |title=Navis Fennica: Suomen merenkulun historia. Osa 3, Telakat, satamat ja valtion alukset |publisher=WSOY | location = Helsinki |year= 1994}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 January 1959, ''Sisu'' arrived in [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] to have one of her generators repaired. Late in the evening, a faulty radiator in one of the cabins started a fire that quickly spread in the aft part of the vessel. While it was brought under control within three hours through the co-operative effort of the city fire department, a local [[volunteer fire department]] and three industrial fire brigades from nearby factories, the fire and water destroyed six cabins and damaged the vessel's electric system, turning gear and aft propulsion motors. However, the main engine room was protected by a carbon dioxide fire suppression system and the excessive use of water prevented the fuel oil tanks below the main deck from exploding. Although the vessel was fully crewed and part of the crew was sleeping, no-one was injured in the fire. ''Sisu'' returned to service after extensive repairs on 26 April 1959.<ref>Navigator 1959:2, p. 40.</ref><ref>Laurell 1992, p. 336.</ref>\n\nThe Finnish Board of Navigation decommissioned ''Sisu'', now the oldest and smallest icebreaker in the state-owned fleet, in 1974.<ref>Kaukiainen 1992, p. 324.</ref> At the time, Finland had a fleet of nine diesel-electric icebreakers in service and two more under construction. The new icebreakers, which had nearly five times the displacement and more than five times the power of the old ''Sisu'', were designed to guarantee year-round traffic to all Finnish ports in the Bothnian Bay.<ref>*{{cite book |last= J\u00e4\u00e4salo |first= Helge |title= Pohjoiset satamat auki |publisher= Kustanneosakeyhti\u00f6 Pohjoinen |year= 1980 |isbn= 951-9152-17-2}}</ref> The second of these icebreakers was named [[Sisu (1976 icebreaker)|''Sisu'']] in 1975.\n\n=== As ''Louhi'' (1975\u20131986) ===\n\nThe old ''Sisu'' was handed to the Finnish Navy in 1975 and given the name ''Louhi''. The name, which has [[Louhi|its origins]] in the [[Finnish mythology]], had previously been used for the [[Finnish minelayer Louhi|1917-built minelayer]] that sank in 1945 with a loss of 11 lives after striking a mine or having been hit by a torpedo from a German U-boat.\n\n''Louhi'' operated primarily as a depot ship for [[Tuima-class missile boat|''Tuima''-class missile boats]] and [[Nuoli-class fast gunboat|''Nuoli''-class fast gunboats]]. She also towed the missile boats between operations because the ''Tuima'' class was powered by three 56-cylinder [[radial engine]]s of Soviet origin that had poor fuel economy. During the hardest winters, she sometimes resumed her duties as an icebreaker.\n\n''Louhi'' was decommissioned in 1986. While the hull of the vessel was still in acceptable condition, the main engines were worn-out and it was becoming increasingly difficult to find spare parts for the original diesel-electric power plant dating back to the late 1930s. The Finnish Navy tried to sell the vessel with public newspaper announcement, but after it was determined that most onboard systems had deteriorated beyond repair, it was decided to sell the old icebreaker for scrap. The 1939-built vessel was broken up in [[Naantali]] shortly before the 1959-built [[Murtaja (1959 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] arrived at the same shipbreaker.<ref>Laiva 1/2012.</ref> The name ''Louhi'' was later given to a [[Finnish pollution control vessel Louhi|2011-built multipurpose vessel]] operated by the Finnish Navy.\n\n== Technical details==\n\n=== General characteristics ===\n\nIn terms of size and hull form, ''Sisu'' was comparable to the 1924-built [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']], but had a more rounded midship and a smaller stem angle of 23 degrees from horizontal.

Built in 1939 at [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] [[Hietalahti shipyard|Hietalahti Shipyard]] in [[Helsinki]], she was one of the world's first [[diesel-electric]] icebreakers. In addition to icebreaking duties, she served as a [[submarine tender]] for the [[Finnish Navy]] during the summer months until the end of the [[Continuation War]].\n\nIn 1975, ''Sisu'' was handed over to the Finnish Navy and renamed '''''Louhi'''''. She was decommissioned in 1986 and sold for scrap.\n\n== Development and construction ==\n\nWhile the economic growth stagnated in Finland in the early 1930s following the [[Great Depression]], international trade began to recover relatively soon and in particular the export of forest products from the ports in the [[Bothnian Bay]] was growing. Already in 1932, a delegation from [[Northern Ostrobothnia]] submitted a proposal for the construction of a new state-owned icebreaker. In 1935, another large delegation of politicians and representatives from coastal cities proposed expanding the state-owned icebreaker fleet. They were also strongly supported by the growing Finnish forest industry.<ref name=\"laurell190\" /><ref name=\"ramsay338\">Ramsay 1949, pp. 338\u2013346.</ref><ref name=\"kaukiainen114\">Kaukiainen 1992, pp. 114\u2013117.</ref>\n\nAt the time, Finland had a fleet of six steam-powered icebreakers to keep trade routes open through the winter months. Following the commissioning of ''[[J\u00e4\u00e4karhu]]'' in 1926, the [[Finnish Board of Navigation]] had planned to replace the smallest vessels of the state-owned fleet, the 1890-built [[Murtaja (1890 icebreaker)|''Murtaja'']] and the 1899-built [[Apu (1899 icebreaker)|''Apu'']], with a new medium-sized icebreaker.<ref name=\"kaukiainen114\" /> These icebreakers represented the first generation of icebreaker design in the Baltic Sea and were considered obsolete because they had no bow propeller.<ref name=\"ramsay175\">Ramsay 1949, pp. 175\u2013176.</ref> However, the plans were shelved due to the recession.<ref name=\"ramsay338\" />\n\nIn June 1935, a small expert committee led by Captain [[Ilmari Jokinen]], the director of the Finnish Board of Navigation, began investigating the feasibility of a dual-use vessel that could be used as an icebreaker during the winter and as a [[submarine tender]] for the [[Finnish Navy]] during the summer months. The committee found the idea feasible and, in addition, recommended replacing traditional reciprocating [[steam engine]]s with a [[diesel-electric]] power plant pioneered by the Swedish icebreaker [[Ymer (1933 icebreaker)|''Ymer'']] in 1933. While a second expert committee, formed from experienced Finnish naval architects and icebreaker captains in March 1936, proposed purchasing two new icebreakers, the [[Parliament of Finland]] allocated [[Finnish markka|FIM]] 36 million for ordering one medium-sized icebreaker.<ref name=\"kaukiainen114\" />\n\nThe construction of the new icebreaker was awarded to [[Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad|Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab]] and the work began in March 1937.<ref name=\"kaukiainen114\" /> Previously, the Helsinki-based shipyard had completed the unfinished [[Voima (1924 icebreaker)|''Voima'']] in 1924 and built a port icebreaker for the city of Helsinki in 1936.<ref name=\"ramsay338\" /> On 24 September 1938, the vessel was given the name ''Sisu'', a [[Finnish language|Finnish]] [[sisu|word describing will, determination and perseverance]], that had been chosen by the Finnish schoolchildren. The sponsor of the vessel was Walborg Jokinen, the wife of the late Captain Ilmari Jokinen.<ref name=\"laurell190\" /> While ''Sisu'' was delivered behind the original 20-month schedule and the vessel turned out to be more expensive as predicted, she was generally considered to be a successful design. She was handed over to the Finnish Board of Navigation in March 1939.<ref name=\"ramsay338\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Second World War (1939\u20131944) ===\n\n[[File:Finnish icebreaker Sisu with submarines.jpg|thumb|left|''Sisu'' together with two Finnish submarines.]]\n\nIn late 1939, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers were armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker flotilla due to deteriorating foreign relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. When the [[Winter War]] began on 30 November 1939, ''Sisu'' was still in Helsinki where she was being outfitted for her secondary role as a submarine tender. In the beginning of the war she operated with the Finnish submarines [[Finnish submarine Vesihiisi|''Vesihiisi'']], [[Finnish submarine Vesikko|''Vesikko'']] and [[Finnish submarine Saukko|''Saukko'']] in the [[Gulf of Finland]], but later moved to the [[Archipelago Sea]] to support [[Finnish submarine Vetehinen|''Vetehinen'']] and [[Finnish submarine Iku-Turso|''Iku-Turso'']]. In January 1940, the icebreaker was sent to the [[Gulf of Bothnia]] to escort merchant ships after the ice conditions in the Baltic Sea had become too difficult for the submarines.<ref name=\"laurell259\">Laurell 1992, pp. 259\u2013262.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continuation War]] started in June 1941 after a short period known as the [[Interim Peace]], the state-owned icebreakers resumed their wartime duties. when the whole Baltic Sea froze during the extremely difficult winter of 1942, ''Sisu'' had to escort ships all the way to [[Pillau]] (today Baltiysk in [[Kaliningrad]]) and [[Swinem\u00fcnde]] (today \u015awinouj\u015bcie in Poland). When Finland began suffering from food shortages, ''Sisu'' was paired up with ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'', and together the two most powerful Finnish icebreakers helped to bring in Finnish and German merchant ships carrying much-needed supplies.<ref name=\"laurell282\">Laurell 1992, pp. 282\u2013290.</ref>\n\nOn 19 September 1943, ''Sisu'' struck a Soviet [[naval mine|mine]] that had been dropped on the shipping lane west of the island fort of [[Rys\u00e4kari]] off Helsinki. While no-one was injured, the explosion damaged the propeller shafts and the icebreaker had to be towed to Hietalahti Shipyard for extensive repairs. While the vessel returned to service three months later, these damages were never fully repaired and followed ''Sisu'' until her final decommissioning in the 1980s.<ref name=\"laurell282\" /><ref name=\"kaukiainen165\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 165.</ref>\n\nUnlike the other state-owned icebreakers, ''Sisu'' was manned through the Second World War due to her role as a depot ship. During the Winter War, ''Sisu'' was armed with two [[Obukhov State Plant|Obukhov]] 102&nbsp;mm naval guns and two [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|Vickers 40 mm anti-aircraft guns]]. The latter were replaced with two [[Madsen 20 mm cannon]]s and two machine guns in the Continuation War. In 1944, the main battery was replaced with two 105&nbsp;mm [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]] naval guns and one more Madsen 20&nbsp;mm cannon was added to the anti-aircraft battery.<ref>''Suomen Laivasto 1918\u20131968, osa 2''. Meriupseeriyhdistys, 1968.</ref> During the war, ''Sisu'' was painted with camouflage colors.\n\n=== Post-war career (1944\u20131975) ===\n\nWhen the Continuation War ended with the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944, Finland had to hand over its best ice-strengthened tonnage to the Soviet Union as [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations]]. While this included ''J\u00e4\u00e4karhu'' and ''Voima'', Finland's newest and most powerful steam-powered icebreakers, the Soviets were not interested in the diesel-electric ''Sisu''. The power plant and propulsion system represented unfamiliar technology at the time when all Soviet icebreakers were still powered by reciprocating steam engines.<ref name=\"kaukiainen165\">Kaukiainen 1992, p. 165.</ref> In addition, the damages ''Sisu'' had sustained in the mine explosion in 1943 had not been fully repaired.<ref>Kaukiainen 1992, p. 226.</ref> While minor repairs were carried out during the post-war summer layups, no major repairs were not done until 1954 when additional funding was granted for this purpose and the icebreaker was drydocked at Hietalahti shipyard.<ref>Kaukiainen 1992, p. 229.</ref>\n\nSince Finland was no longer allowed to have submarines according to the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaty of 1947]], ''Sisu'' lost her secondary role as a submarine tender. While she was briefly used as a training ship for the Finnish Naval Academy in 1949, the icebreaker was not suited to gunnery training and the civilian crew was against co-operation with the Navy.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Riimala |first1=Erkki |last2=Hillo |first2=Hannu |title=Navis Fennica: Suomen merenkulun historia.

Late in the evening, a faulty radiator in one of the cabins started a fire that quickly spread in the aft part of the vessel. While it was brought under control within three hours through the co-operative effort of the city fire department, a local [[volunteer fire department]] and three industrial fire brigades from nearby factories, the fire and water destroyed six cabins and damaged the vessel's electric system, turning gear and aft propulsion motors. However, the main engine room was protected by a carbon dioxide fire suppression system and the excessive use of water prevented the fuel oil tanks below the main deck from exploding. Although the vessel was fully crewed and part of the crew was sleeping, no-one was injured in the fire. ''Sisu'' returned to service after extensive repairs on 26 April 1959.<ref>Navigator 1959:2, p. 40.</ref><ref>Laurell 1992, p. 336.</ref>\n\nThe Finnish Board of Navigation decommissioned ''Sisu'', now the oldest and smallest icebreaker in the state-owned fleet, in 1974.<ref>Kaukiainen 1992, p. 324.</ref> At the time, Finland had a fleet of nine diesel-electric icebreakers in service and two more under construction.

The name, which has [[Louhi|its origins]] in the [[Finnish mythology]], had previously been used for the [[Finnish minelayer Louhi|1917-built minelayer]] that sank in 1945 with a loss of 11 lives after striking a mine or having been hit by a torpedo from a German U-boat.\n\n''Louhi'' operated primarily as a depot ship for [[Tuima-class missile boat|''Tuima''-class missile boats]] and [[Nuoli-class fast gunboat|''Nuoli''-class fast gunboats]]. She also towed the missile boats between operations because the ''Tuima'' class was powered by three 56-cylinder [[radial engine]]s of Soviet origin that had poor fuel economy. During the hardest winters, she sometimes resumed her duties as an icebreaker.\n\n''Louhi'' was decommissioned in 1986. While the hull of the vessel was still in acceptable condition, the main engines were worn-out and it was becoming increasingly difficult to find spare parts for the original diesel-electric power plant dating back to the late 1930s.

The mansion was constructed  during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir [[Herbert Leon]] in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. During [[World War II]], the estate housed the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&CS team of codebreakers included [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]]. The nature of the work there was secret until many years after the war.\n\nAccording to the official historian of British Intelligence, the \"[[Ultra]]\" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.<ref name=\"HinsleyLecture\">{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}</ref> The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the  development of [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.{{efn|Colossus itself was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]] in London, to solve a problem posed by mathematician [[Max Newman]] at the GC&CS. From there, it (and nine more) were installed and operated in Bletchley.}} Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations. It receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|title=Bletchley Park Welcomes 2015'S 200,000th Visitor|publisher=Bletchley Park|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202043901/https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The separate [[The National Museum of Computing|National Museum of Computing]], which includes a working replica [[Bombe]] machine and a rebuilt [[Colossus computer]], is housed in Block H on the site.\n\n==History==\nThe site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]].

In 1939{{ndash}}40, [[John Tiltman]] (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at [[Sarafand al-Amar|Sarafand]] in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.<ref>{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13\u201334}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese signals===\nAn outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB).

The mansion was constructed  during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir [[Herbert Leon]] in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. During [[World War II]], the estate housed the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&CS team of codebreakers included [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]]. The nature of the work there was secret until many years after the war.\n\nAccording to the official historian of British Intelligence, the \"[[Ultra]]\" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.<ref name=\"HinsleyLecture\">{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}</ref> The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the  development of [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.{{efn|Colossus itself was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]] in London, to solve a problem posed by mathematician [[Max Newman]] at the GC&CS. From there, it (and nine more) were installed and operated in Bletchley.}} Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations. It receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|title=Bletchley Park Welcomes 2015'S 200,000th Visitor|publisher=Bletchley Park|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202043901/https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The separate [[The National Museum of Computing|National Museum of Computing]], which includes a working replica [[Bombe]] machine and a rebuilt [[Colossus computer]], is housed in Block H on the site.\n\n==History==\nThe site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]].

They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] and his team at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]]. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944.

Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.<ref>{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13\u201334}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese signals===\nAn outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB).

The -''m''-/-''v''- alternation is a common enough phenomenon in Dravidian phonology\".{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xxi}}\n\nFurthermore, another Dravidianist and linguist, [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti]], in his book ''Dravidian Languages'' states:{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|loc=p. 2, footnote 2}} {{quote|Joseph (1989: IJDL 18.2:134-42) gives extensive references to the use of the term ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}'', ''dramila'' first as the name of a people, then of a country. Sinhala BCE inscriptions cite ''{{IAST|dame\u1e0da}}''-, ''damela''- denoting Tamil merchants. Early Buddhist and Jaina sources used ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- to refer to a people of south India (presumably Tamil); ''{{IAST|damilara\u1e6d\u1e6dha}}''- was a southern non-Aryan country; ''{{IAST|drami\u1e37a}}''-, ''{{IAST|drami\u1e0da}}'', and ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- were used as variants to designate a country in the south (''{{IAST|B\u1e5bhatsamhita-}}'', ''K\u0101dambar\u012b'', ''Da\u015bakum\u0101racarita-'', fourth to seventh centuries CE) (1989: 134\u2013138). It appears that ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- was older than ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- which could be its Sanskritization.}}\n\nBased on what Krishnamurti states (referring to a scholarly paper published in the ''International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics''), the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}'' itself is later than ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'' since the dates for the forms with -r- are centuries later than the dates for the forms without -r- (''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'', ''{{IAST|dame\u1e0da}}''-, ''damela''- etc.).\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe 14th century Sanskrit text ''[[Lilatilakam]]'', which is a grammar of [[Manipravalam]], states that the spoken languages of present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu were similar, terming them as \"Drami\u1e0da\". The author doesn't consider the \"Kar\u1e47\u1e47\u0101\u1e6da\" (Kannada) and the \"Andhra\" (Telugu) languages as \"Drami\u1e0da\", because they were very different from the language of the \"Tamil Veda\" (''[[Tiruvaymoli]]''), but states that some people would include them in the \"Drami\u1e0da\" category.{{sfn|Shulman|2016|p=6}}\n\nIn 1816, [[Alexander D. Campbell]] suggested the existence of a Dravidian language family in his ''Grammar of the Teloogoo Language'',<ref>Alexander Duncan Campbell (1816) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PubopwMmteIC ''A Grammar of the Teloogoo Language''], ''commonly termed the Gentoo, peculiar to the Hindoos inhabiting the north eastern provinces of the Indian peninsula'', College of Fort St. George Press, Madras {{oclc|416559272}}</ref> in which he and [[Francis Whyte Ellis|Francis W. Ellis]] argued that [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] descended from a common, non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ancestor.{{sfnp|Sreekumar|2009}} In 1856 [[Robert Caldwell]] published his ''Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages'',<ref>Robert Caldwell (1856) [https://archive.org/details/cu31924023009966 ''A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages''], Williams and Norgate, London {{oclc|20216805}}</ref> which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established Dravidian as one of the major language groups of the world. Caldwell coined the term \"Dravidian\" for this family of languages, based on the usage of the [[Sanskrit]] word \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e (Dravid\u0101) in the work ''Tantrav\u0101rttika'' by {{IAST|[[Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da]]}}.{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xx}} In his own words, Caldwell says,\n\n{{quote|The word I have chosen is 'Dravidian', from {{IAST|Dr\u0101vi\u1e0da}}, the adjectival form of {{IAST|Dravi\u1e0da}}. This term, it is true, has sometimes been used, and is still sometimes used, in almost as restricted a sense as that of Tamil itself, so that though on the whole it is the best term I can find, I admit it is not perfectly free from ambiguity. It is a term which has already been used more or less distinctively by Sanskrit philologists, as a generic appellation for the South Indian people and their languages, and it is the only single term they ever seem to have used in this manner. I have, therefore, no doubt of the propriety of adopting it.{{sfnp|Caldwell|1856|p=4}}}} The 1961 publication of the ''Dravidian Etymological Dictionary'' by [[T. Burrow]] and [[M. B.

After the [[Indo-Aryan migrations]] into north-western India, starting ca. 1500 BCE, and the establishment of the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru kingdom]] ca. 1100 BCE, a process of [[Sanskritisation]] started, which resulted in a [[language shift]] in northern India. Southern India has remained majority Dravidian, but pockets of Dravidian can be found in central India, Pakistan and Nepal.\n\nThe [[Kurukh people|Kurukh]] and [[Malto people|Malto]] are pockets of Dravidian languages in central India, spoken by people who may have migrated from south India. They do have myths about external origins.<ref>P. 83 ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration'' Debate by Edwin Bryant</ref> The Kurukh have traditionally claimed to be from the [[Deccan Peninsula]],<ref>P. 18 ''The Or\u0101ons of Ch\u014dt\u0101 N\u0101gpur: their history, economic life, and social organization.'' by Sarat Chandra Roy, Rai Bahadur;  Alfred C Haddon</ref> more specifically [[Karnataka]].

The existence of the isolated northern outlier ''Brahui'' is consistent with the hypothesis that Dravidian formerly occupied much of North India but was displaced by the invading Indo-Aryan languages, and the presence in the Indo-Aryan languages of certain linguistic features, such as retroflex consonants, is often attributed to Dravidian substrate influence.\"}} However, it has been argued that the absence of any Old Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui suggests that the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from central India less than 1,000 years ago.

Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. 30 Jun. 2008</ref> Many of these features are already present in the oldest known [[Indo-Aryan language]], the language of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (c.{{nbsp}}1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=6}}\n\n[[Vedic Sanskrit]] has [[retroflex consonant]]s ({{IAST|\u1e6d}}/{{IAST|\u1e0d}}, {{IAST|\u1e47}}) with about 88 words in the ''Rigveda'' having unconditioned retroflexes.{{sfnp|Kuiper|1991}}{{sfnp|Witzel|1999}} Some sample words are ''{{IAST|I\u1e6danta}}'', ''{{IAST|Ka\u1e47va}}'', ''{{IAST|\u015baka\u1e6d\u012b}}'', ''{{IAST|keva\u1e6da}}'', ''{{IAST|pu\u1e47ya}}'' and ''{{IAST|ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka}}''.\nSince other [[Indo-European languages]], including other [[Indo-Iranian languages]], lack retroflex consonants, their presence in Indo-Aryan is often cited as evidence of substrate influence from close contact of the Vedic speakers with speakers of a foreign language family rich in retroflex consonants.{{sfnp|Kuiper|1991}}{{sfnp|Witzel|1999}} The Dravidian family is a serious candidate since it is rich in retroflex phonemes reconstructible back to the [[Proto-Dravidian language|Proto-Dravidian stage]].{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983|p=40}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=36}}\n\nIn addition, a number of grammatical features of Vedic Sanskrit not found in its sister [[Avestan language]] appear to have been borrowed from Dravidian languages.  These include the [[gerund]], which has the same function as in Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=36\u201337}} Some linguists explain this asymmetrical borrowing by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian [[substratum]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=40\u201341}} These scholars argue that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Indic is [[language shift]], that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages.{{sfnp|Erdosy|1995|p=18}} Although each of the innovative traits in Indic could be accounted for by internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once; moreover, it accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.{{sfnp|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=141\u2013144}}\n\n==Grammar==\nThe most characteristic grammatical features of Dravidian languages are:<ref name=\"britannicaDVD\"/>\n* Dravidian languages are [[Agglutination|agglutinative]].\n* Word order is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] (SOV).\n* Most Dravidian languages have a [[clusivity]] distinction (notably, [[Kannada]] does not).\n* The major word classes are nouns (substantives, numerals, pronouns), adjectives, verbs, and indeclinables (particles, enclitics, adverbs, interjections, onomatopoetic words, echo words).\n* Proto-Dravidian used only suffixes, never prefixes or infixes, in the construction of inflected forms. Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.\n* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the ancestral system probably having \"male:non-male\" in the singular and \"person:non-person\" in the plural.\n* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.\n* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.\n* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.\n* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.\n* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, [[negative verbs]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nDravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages have accepted large numbers of loan words from [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the [[orthography]] shows distinctions in voice and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of [[phonology]] and [[phonotactics]]: aspiration of [[plosives]] is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting. For instance, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the [[Tamil alphabet]] lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[retroflex]] places of articulation as well as large numbers of [[Liquid consonant|liquids]].\n\n===Proto-Dravidian===\n{{main|Proto-Dravidian}}\nProto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: ''*a'', ''*\u0101'', ''*i'', ''*\u012b'', ''*u'', ''*\u016b'', ''*e'', ''*\u0113'', ''*o'', ''*\u014d''. There were no diphthongs; ''ai'' and ''au'' are treated as *''ay'' and *''av'' (or *''aw'').{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=90}}\nThe five-vowel system is largely preserved in the descendent subgroups.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=48}}\n\nThe following consonantal phonemes are reconstructed:{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983|p=40}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=91}}\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! !!

Early Buddhist and Jaina sources used ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- to refer to a people of south India (presumably Tamil); ''{{IAST|damilara\u1e6d\u1e6dha}}''- was a southern non-Aryan country; ''{{IAST|drami\u1e37a}}''-, ''{{IAST|drami\u1e0da}}'', and ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- were used as variants to designate a country in the south (''{{IAST|B\u1e5bhatsamhita-}}'', ''K\u0101dambar\u012b'', ''Da\u015bakum\u0101racarita-'', fourth to seventh centuries CE) (1989: 134\u2013138). It appears that ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- was older than ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- which could be its Sanskritization.}}\n\nBased on what Krishnamurti states (referring to a scholarly paper published in the ''International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics''), the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}'' itself is later than ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'' since the dates for the forms with -r- are centuries later than the dates for the forms without -r- (''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'', ''{{IAST|dame\u1e0da}}''-, ''damela''- etc.).\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe 14th century Sanskrit text ''[[Lilatilakam]]'', which is a grammar of [[Manipravalam]], states that the spoken languages of present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu were similar, terming them as \"Drami\u1e0da\". The author doesn't consider the \"Kar\u1e47\u1e47\u0101\u1e6da\" (Kannada) and the \"Andhra\" (Telugu) languages as \"Drami\u1e0da\", because they were very different from the language of the \"Tamil Veda\" (''[[Tiruvaymoli]]''), but states that some people would include them in the \"Drami\u1e0da\" category.{{sfn|Shulman|2016|p=6}}\n\nIn 1816, [[Alexander D. Campbell]] suggested the existence of a Dravidian language family in his ''Grammar of the Teloogoo Language'',<ref>Alexander Duncan Campbell (1816) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PubopwMmteIC ''A Grammar of the Teloogoo Language''], ''commonly termed the Gentoo, peculiar to the Hindoos inhabiting the north eastern provinces of the Indian peninsula'', College of Fort St. George Press, Madras {{oclc|416559272}}</ref> in which he and [[Francis Whyte Ellis|Francis W. Ellis]] argued that [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] descended from a common, non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ancestor.{{sfnp|Sreekumar|2009}} In 1856 [[Robert Caldwell]] published his ''Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages'',<ref>Robert Caldwell (1856) [https://archive.org/details/cu31924023009966 ''A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages''], Williams and Norgate, London {{oclc|20216805}}</ref> which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established Dravidian as one of the major language groups of the world. Caldwell coined the term \"Dravidian\" for this family of languages, based on the usage of the [[Sanskrit]] word \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e (Dravid\u0101) in the work ''Tantrav\u0101rttika'' by {{IAST|[[Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da]]}}.{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xx}} In his own words, Caldwell says,\n\n{{quote|The word I have chosen is 'Dravidian', from {{IAST|Dr\u0101vi\u1e0da}}, the adjectival form of {{IAST|Dravi\u1e0da}}. This term, it is true, has sometimes been used, and is still sometimes used, in almost as restricted a sense as that of Tamil itself, so that though on the whole it is the best term I can find, I admit it is not perfectly free from ambiguity. It is a term which has already been used more or less distinctively by Sanskrit philologists, as a generic appellation for the South Indian people and their languages, and it is the only single term they ever seem to have used in this manner. I have, therefore, no doubt of the propriety of adopting it.{{sfnp|Caldwell|1856|p=4}}}} The 1961 publication of the ''Dravidian Etymological Dictionary'' by [[T. Burrow]] and [[M. B.

Ratnasabapathy</ref>\n\nThe [[Brahui people|Brahui]] population of Pakistan's [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan province]] has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a [[relict]] population, perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming [[Indo-Aryan languages]].{{sfnp|Mallory|1989|p=44}}{{sfnp|Elst|1999|p=146}}{{sfnp|Trask|2000|p=97|ps=\"It is widely suspected that the extinct and undeciphered Indus Valley language was a Dravidian language, but no confirmation is available. The existence of the isolated northern outlier ''Brahui'' is consistent with the hypothesis that Dravidian formerly occupied much of North India but was displaced by the invading Indo-Aryan languages, and the presence in the Indo-Aryan languages of certain linguistic features, such as retroflex consonants, is often attributed to Dravidian substrate influence.\"}} However, it has been argued that the absence of any Old Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui suggests that the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from central India less than 1,000 years ago. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, [[Balochi language|Balochi]], is a western [[Iranian language]] like [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], and arrived in the area from the west only around 1,000{{nbsp}}AD.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Josef | last = Elfenbein | title = A periplus of the 'Brahui problem' | journal = Studia Iranica | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | year = 1987 | pages = 215\u2013233 | doi=10.2143/SI.16.2.2014604}}</ref> Sound changes shared with Kurukh and Malto also suggest that Brahui was originally spoken near them in central India.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=27, 142}}\n\n===Dravidian influence on Sanskrit===\n{{main|Substratum in Vedic Sanskrit}}\n\nDravidian languages show extensive lexical (vocabulary) borrowing, but only a few traits of structural (either [[phonology|phonological]] or grammatical) borrowing from Indo-Aryan, whereas Indo-Aryan shows more structural than lexical borrowings from the Dravidian languages.<ref name=\"britannicaOnline\">\"[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9109791 Dravidian languages.]\" [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. 2008. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. 30 Jun. 2008</ref> Many of these features are already present in the oldest known [[Indo-Aryan language]], the language of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (c.{{nbsp}}1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=6}}\n\n[[Vedic Sanskrit]] has [[retroflex consonant]]s ({{IAST|\u1e6d}}/{{IAST|\u1e0d}}, {{IAST|\u1e47}}) with about 88 words in the ''Rigveda'' having unconditioned retroflexes.{{sfnp|Kuiper|1991}}{{sfnp|Witzel|1999}} Some sample words are ''{{IAST|I\u1e6danta}}'', ''{{IAST|Ka\u1e47va}}'', ''{{IAST|\u015baka\u1e6d\u012b}}'', ''{{IAST|keva\u1e6da}}'', ''{{IAST|pu\u1e47ya}}'' and ''{{IAST|ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka}}''.\nSince other [[Indo-European languages]], including other [[Indo-Iranian languages]], lack retroflex consonants, their presence in Indo-Aryan is often cited as evidence of substrate influence from close contact of the Vedic speakers with speakers of a foreign language family rich in retroflex consonants.{{sfnp|Kuiper|1991}}{{sfnp|Witzel|1999}} The Dravidian family is a serious candidate since it is rich in retroflex phonemes reconstructible back to the [[Proto-Dravidian language|Proto-Dravidian stage]].{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983|p=40}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=36}}\n\nIn addition, a number of grammatical features of Vedic Sanskrit not found in its sister [[Avestan language]] appear to have been borrowed from Dravidian languages.  These include the [[gerund]], which has the same function as in Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=36\u201337}} Some linguists explain this asymmetrical borrowing by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian [[substratum]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=40\u201341}} These scholars argue that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Indic is [[language shift]], that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages.{{sfnp|Erdosy|1995|p=18}} Although each of the innovative traits in Indic could be accounted for by internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once; moreover, it accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.{{sfnp|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=141\u2013144}}\n\n==Grammar==\nThe most characteristic grammatical features of Dravidian languages are:<ref name=\"britannicaDVD\"/>\n* Dravidian languages are [[Agglutination|agglutinative]].\n* Word order is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] (SOV).\n* Most Dravidian languages have a [[clusivity]] distinction (notably, [[Kannada]] does not).\n* The major word classes are nouns (substantives, numerals, pronouns), adjectives, verbs, and indeclinables (particles, enclitics, adverbs, interjections, onomatopoetic words, echo words).\n* Proto-Dravidian used only suffixes, never prefixes or infixes, in the construction of inflected forms. Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.\n* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the ancestral system probably having \"male:non-male\" in the singular and \"person:non-person\" in the plural.\n* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.\n* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.\n* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.\n* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.\n* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, [[negative verbs]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nDravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages have accepted large numbers of loan words from [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the [[orthography]] shows distinctions in voice and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of [[phonology]] and [[phonotactics]]: aspiration of [[plosives]] is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting. For instance, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the [[Tamil alphabet]] lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[retroflex]] places of articulation as well as large numbers of [[Liquid consonant|liquids]].\n\n===Proto-Dravidian===\n{{main|Proto-Dravidian}}\nProto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: ''*a'', ''*\u0101'', ''*i'', ''*\u012b'', ''*u'', ''*\u016b'', ''*e'', ''*\u0113'', ''*o'', ''*\u014d''. There were no diphthongs; ''ai'' and ''au'' are treated as *''ay'' and *''av'' (or *''aw'').{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=90}}\nThe five-vowel system is largely preserved in the descendent subgroups.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=48}}\n\nThe following consonantal phonemes are reconstructed:{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983|p=40}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=91}}\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! !!
