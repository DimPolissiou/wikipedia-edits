Currently, the breed and Junior Showmanship competitions are hosted at Piers 92 and 94, while the group and Best in Show competitions take place at [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nThe Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is one of a handful of [[Bench show|benched shows]] in the United States. Dogs are required to be on display in their assigned locations (show benches) during the entire show except when shown in the ring, groomed for showtime, or taken outside for elimination. This type of presentation allows spectators and breeders alike to have an opportunity of seeing all the entered dogs. (In the more common unbenched shows, dogs are required to be present only at assigned ring times.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/sports/allan-unleashed-engaging-positively-public/|title=Engaging Positively With the Public at Dog Shows|first=Allan|last=Reznik|website=American Kennel Club|date=March 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:WKC Dog Show Logo 2019.png|alt=A black-and-white stylized drawing of a hunting dog, nose poked out to the left of the image, tail erect and behind the dog, with a group of trees in the background.|thumb|The [[Westminster Kennel Club]] was formed in 1877.]]\nThe first Westminster show took place on May 8, 1877, making it second only to the [[Kentucky Derby]], in terms of continuously held sporting events in the United States. (Both events were held despite the [[Great Depression]] & [[World War]] years.) The show originated as a show for [[gun dog]]s, primarily [[Setter]]s and [[pointer (dog)|Pointers]], initiated by a group of hunters who met regularly at the Westminster Hotel at Irving Place and Sixteenth Street in [[Manhattan]]. They decided to create a [[kennel club]] called the Westminster Kennel Club specifically to hold a dog show. The prizes for these first shows included such items as pearl-handled pistols, which were of use to the hunters and terriermen who worked these dogs in the field.\n\n[[File:(King1893NYC) pg240 WESTMINISTER HOTEL, IRVING PLACE AND 16TH STREET.jpg|thumb|left|WESTMINISTER HOTEL, IRVING PLACE AND 16TH STREET]]\nHeld at Gilmore's Garden ([[Madison Square Garden (1879)|Madison Square Garden]]) the Westminster show drew over 1200 dogs. It proved so popular that it took four days instead of the three days originally scheduled. The club donated proceeds from the fourth day to the [[ASPCA]] for creation of a home for stray and disabled dogs.\n\nThe Westminster Kennel Club predates the formation of the [[American Kennel Club]] by seven years and became the first club admitted to the AKC after AKC's founding in 1884.  Breed parent clubs (e.g., the Collie  Club of America) create the standards for judging their breeds, with the AKC administering the rules about shows and judging.\n\nDogs are judged by how closely they conform to a written description of the ideal specimen of that breed (the breed standard). Many breeds no longer need to perform their original jobs and are bred mostly for companionship. However, they are still judged on their innate ability and physical makeup to perform their original jobs. Standards also include items that seem somewhat arbitrary such as color, eye shape, tail carriage and more.\n\nToday, Westminster takes place over two days and nights every February.  During the day, the dogs compete against other dogs of the same breed at Piers 92 and 94. Each Best of Breed winner (BOB) advances to the Group level. There are seven groups: Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting, and Herding.  Group competition occurs during the evenings at Madison Square Garden. The seven Group winners advance to Best in Show, the final round of the show. During Best in Show, also held at Madison Square Garden, a judge will select one of judging othem as the Best In Show winner. Since 2014, the show allowed mixed-breed dogs to compete in an agility event.<ref>Jennifer Peltz, \"[https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/westminster-dog-show-adds-event-mixed-breeds-21547820 Westminster Dog Show Adds Event With Mixed Breeds],\" Associated Press, January 16, 2014.</ref>\n\nWestminster has held competitions in Junior Showmanship for handlers ages 9\u201318 since 1934. The eight finalists all receive scholarships for post-secondary schooling. The Club, through the Westminster Kennel Foundation also awards veterinary school scholarships for students from six schools yearly.\n\nThe winning dog becomes \"America's Dog\" for the coming year. Their reign begins with a media tour on the day following the show. They make appearances on nearly all television network morning shows, visit to the Observation Deck at the Empire State Building. The New York Stock Exchange also invites the winner to ring the opening bell.\n\nThe event is widely celebrated in New York City every February. The Empire State Building salutes the show by lighting its tower in the Westminster colors of purple and gold for the duration of the show. Saks 5th Avenue features a street window with a Westminster-themed display.\n\n==Controversy==\nAnimal-rights advocates such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] protest the show, arguing that the propagation and celebration of purebreds ultimately add to the millions of dogs who end up at and die in shelters.<ref>Jennifer Peltz, \"[https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/westminster-dog-show-adds-event-mixed-breeds-21547820 Westminster Dog Show Adds Event With Mixed Breeds,\"] Associated Press, 16 January 2014.</ref><ref>\"[http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html Pets By the Numbers],\" Humane Society of the United States, September 27, 2013.</ref>\n\nAlso, during the 2019 broadcast, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] was reprimanded by dog show sponsor [[Ralston Purina|Purina]] after a broadcast voice-over introduction of a dog breed was done by [[NASCAR Cup Series]] champion [[Kyle Busch]], who is sponsored by a rival pet food maker, [[Mars Petcare]].\n\n==Announcers==\nFor many years, [[Roger A.

In 2016, there are 199 breeds and varieties eligible for Westminster. \nBecause of the show's popularity and prestige, starting in 1992 the AKC limited entries by requiring that dogs must have already earned their breed championship before appearing at Westminster. Later, the AKC amended that rule - dogs only need one of the two required \"major wins\" towards their championship titles. However, they don't need to be finished champions to enter.\n\nThe top five dogs in each breed (based on breed points earned in AKC conformation showing through October 31 of the preceding year), as well as the Best of Breed winner from each breed's national specialty show, receive printed invitations by mail and are eligible for early entry. After that entry deadline passes, other dogs with at least one \"major win\" may enter, up to a cut-off entry total of 2800 dogs.\n\nThere is no prohibition against a winner competing again in future Westminster shows. Seven dogs have won multiple Westminster championships: six dogs in consecutive years (including [[Warren Remedy]], the only three-time champion of the event) and one dog in non-consecutive years. Since 1972, however, there have been no repeat winners. (See [[List of Best in Show winners of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]].)\n\nDogs of all breeds, including [[mongrel|mutts]], may participate in the show's agility competition. There is a title for the highest-ranking mutt in the agility round - the \"All American Dog.\"\n\n== Winning breeds ==\n\nThrough the 134th Westminster Show (February 2010), [[Conformation show#Winning|Best in Show]] has been won by the [[Terrier]] group 45 out of the 103 times that the prize has been awarded since 1907,<ref>[http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/history/bisrecords.html WestminsterKennelClub.org - ''Best In Show Awards By Breed (1907-2010)'']</ref> more than twice as many wins as any other group.  The single breed that has won the most is the Wire Fox Terrier, which has won 14 times.

Currently, the breed and Junior Showmanship competitions are hosted at Piers 92 and 94, while the group and Best in Show competitions take place at [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nThe Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is one of a handful of [[Bench show|benched shows]] in the United States. Dogs are required to be on display in their assigned locations (show benches) during the entire show except when shown in the ring, groomed for showtime, or taken outside for elimination. This type of presentation allows spectators and breeders alike to have an opportunity of seeing all the entered dogs. (In the more common unbenched shows, dogs are required to be present only at assigned ring times.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/sports/allan-unleashed-engaging-positively-public/|title=Engaging Positively With the Public at Dog Shows|first=Allan|last=Reznik|website=American Kennel Club|date=March 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:WKC Dog Show Logo 2019.png|alt=A black-and-white stylized drawing of a hunting dog, nose poked out to the left of the image, tail erect and behind the dog, with a group of trees in the background.|thumb|The [[Westminster Kennel Club]] was formed in 1877.]]\nThe first Westminster show took place on May 8, 1877, making it second only to the [[Kentucky Derby]], in terms of continuously held sporting events in the United States. (Both events were held despite the [[Great Depression]] & [[World War]] years.) The show originated as a show for [[gun dog]]s, primarily [[Setter]]s and [[pointer (dog)|Pointers]], initiated by a group of hunters who met regularly at the Westminster Hotel at Irving Place and Sixteenth Street in [[Manhattan]]. They decided to create a [[kennel club]] called the Westminster Kennel Club specifically to hold a dog show. The prizes for these first shows included such items as pearl-handled pistols, which were of use to the hunters and terriermen who worked these dogs in the field.\n\n[[File:(King1893NYC) pg240 WESTMINISTER HOTEL, IRVING PLACE AND 16TH STREET.jpg|thumb|left|WESTMINISTER HOTEL, IRVING PLACE AND 16TH STREET]]\nHeld at Gilmore's Garden ([[Madison Square Garden (1879)|Madison Square Garden]]) the Westminster show drew over 1200 dogs. It proved so popular that it took four days instead of the three days originally scheduled. The club donated proceeds from the fourth day to the [[ASPCA]] for creation of a home for stray and disabled dogs.\n\nThe Westminster Kennel Club predates the formation of the [[American Kennel Club]] by seven years and became the first club admitted to the AKC after AKC's founding in 1884.  Breed parent clubs (e.g., the Collie  Club of America) create the standards for judging their breeds, with the AKC administering the rules about shows and judging.\n\nDogs are judged by how closely they conform to a written description of the ideal specimen of that breed (the breed standard). Many breeds no longer need to perform their original jobs and are bred mostly for companionship. However, they are still judged on their innate ability and physical makeup to perform their original jobs. Standards also include items that seem somewhat arbitrary such as color, eye shape, tail carriage and more.\n\nToday, Westminster takes place over two days and nights every February.  During the day, the dogs compete against other dogs of the same breed at Piers 92 and 94. Each Best of Breed winner (BOB) advances to the Group level. There are seven groups: Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting, and Herding.  Group competition occurs during the evenings at Madison Square Garden. The seven Group winners advance to Best in Show, the final round of the show. During Best in Show, also held at Madison Square Garden, a judge will select one of judging othem as the Best In Show winner. Since 2014, the show allowed mixed-breed dogs to compete in an agility event.<ref>Jennifer Peltz, \"[https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/westminster-dog-show-adds-event-mixed-breeds-21547820 Westminster Dog Show Adds Event With Mixed Breeds],\" Associated Press, January 16, 2014.</ref>\n\nWestminster has held competitions in Junior Showmanship for handlers ages 9\u201318 since 1934. The eight finalists all receive scholarships for post-secondary schooling. The Club, through the Westminster Kennel Foundation also awards veterinary school scholarships for students from six schools yearly.\n\nThe winning dog becomes \"America's Dog\" for the comming year. Their reign begins with a media tour on the day following the show. They make appearances on nearly all television network morning shows, visit to the Observation Deck at the Empire State Building. The New York Stock Exchange also invites the winner to ring the opening bell.\n\nThe event is widely celebrated in New York City every February. The Empire State Building salutes the show by lighting its tower in the Westminster colors of purple and gold for the duration of the show. Saks 5th Avenue features a street window with a Westminster-themed display.\n\n==Controversy==\nAnimal-rights advocates such as [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] protest the show, arguing that the propagation and celebration of purebreds ultimately add to the millions of dogs who end up at and die in shelters.<ref>Jennifer Peltz, \"[https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/westminster-dog-show-adds-event-mixed-breeds-21547820 Westminster Dog Show Adds Event With Mixed Breeds,\"] Associated Press, 16 January 2014.</ref><ref>\"[http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html Pets By the Numbers],\" Humane Society of the United States, September 27, 2013.</ref>\n\nAlso, during the 2019 broadcast, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] was reprimanded by dog show sponsor [[Ralston Purina|Purina]] after a broadcast voice-over introduction of a dog breed was done by [[NASCAR Cup Series]] champion [[Kyle Busch]], who is sponsored by a rival pet food maker, [[Mars Petcare]].\n\n==Announcers==\nFor many years, [[Roger A.

In 2016, there are 199 breeds and varieties eligible for Westminster. \nBecause of the show's popularity and prestige, starting in 1992 the AKC limited entries by requiring that dogs must have already earned their breed championship before appearing at Westminster. Later, the AKC amended that rule - dogs only need one of the two required \"major wins\" towards their championship titles. However, they don't need to be finished champions to enter.\n\nThe top five dogs in each breed (based on breed points earned in AKC conformation showing through October 31 of the preceding year), as well as the Best of Breed winner from each breed's national specialty show, receive printed invitations by mail and are eligible for early entry. After that entry deadline passes, other dogs with at least one \"major win\" may enter, up to a cut-off entry total of 2800 dogs.\n\nThere is no prohibition against a winner competing again in future Westminster shows. Seven dogs have won multiple Westminster championships: six dogs in consecutive years (including [[Warren Remedy]], the only three-time champion of the event) and one dog in non-consecutive years. Since 1972, however, there have been no repeat winners. (See [[List of Best in Show winners of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]].)\n\nDogs of all breeds, including [[mongrel|mutts]], may participate in the show's agility competition.

{"title_page": "Computer forensics", "text_new": "{{ForensicScience|digital|image=Hard disk.jpg}}\n[[File:PersonalStorageDevices.agr.jpg|thumb|Computer forensics analysis is not limited only to computer media]]\n\n'''Computer forensics''' (also known as '''computer forensic science'''<ref name=\"noblett\"/>) is a branch of [[digital forensics|digital forensic science]] pertaining to evidence found in computers and digital [[storage media]]. The goal of computer forensics is to examine digital media in a forensically sound manner with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analyzing and presenting facts and opinions about the digital information.\n\nAlthough it is most often associated  with the investigation of a wide variety of [[computer crime]], computer forensics may also be used in civil proceedings. The discipline involves similar techniques and principles to [[data recovery]], but with additional guidelines and practices designed to create a legal [[audit trail]].\n\nEvidence from computer forensics investigations is usually subjected to the same guidelines and practices of other digital evidence. It has been used in a number of high-profile cases and is becoming widely accepted as reliable within U.S. and European court systems.\n\n==Overview==\nIn the early 1980s personal computers became more accessible to consumers, leading to their increased use in criminal activity (for example, to help commit [[fraud]]). At the same time, several new \"computer crimes\" were recognized (such as [[Software cracking|cracking]]). The discipline of computer forensics emerged during this time as a method to recover and investigate [[digital evidence]] for use in court. Since then computer crime and computer related crime has grown, and has jumped 67% between 2002 and 2003.<ref name=leigland />  Today it is used to investigate a wide variety of crime, including [[child pornography]], fraud, [[espionage]], [[cyberstalking]], murder and rape. The discipline also features in civil proceedings as a form of information gathering (for example, [[Electronic discovery]])\n\nForensic techniques and expert knowledge are used to explain the current state of a ''digital artifact'', such as a computer system, storage medium (e.g. [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] or [[CD-ROM]]), or an [[electronic document]] (e.g. an email message or JPEG image).<ref name=\"cf-education\"/> The scope of a forensic analysis can vary from simple [[information retrieval]] to reconstructing a series of events. In a 2002 book, ''Computer Forensics'', authors Kruse and Heiser define computer forensics as involving \"the preservation, identification, extraction, documentation and interpretation of computer data\".<ref name=\"kruse\" /> They go on to describe the discipline as \"more of an art than a science\", indicating that forensic methodology is backed by flexibility and extensive domain knowledge. However, while several methods can be used to extract evidence from a given computer the strategies used by law enforcement are fairly rigid and lack the flexibility found in the civilian world.<ref name=gunsch />\n\n==Use as evidence==\nIn court, computer forensic evidence is subject to the usual requirements for [[digital evidence]]. This requires that information be authentic, reliably obtained, and admissible.<ref name=\"theadam\" /> Different countries have specific guidelines and practices for evidence recovery. In the [[United Kingdom]], examiners often follow [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] guidelines that help ensure the authenticity and integrity of evidence. While voluntary, the guidelines are widely accepted in British courts.\n\nComputer forensics has been used as evidence in [[criminal law]] since the mid-1980s, some notable examples include:<ref name=\"casey\" />\n* BTK Killer: [[Dennis Rader]] was convicted of a string of serial killings that occurred over a period of sixteen years. Towards the end of this period, Rader sent letters to the police on a floppy disk. [[Metadata]] within the documents implicated an author named \"Dennis\" at \"Christ Lutheran Church\"; this evidence helped lead to Rader's arrest.\n* [[Joseph E. Duncan III]]: A spreadsheet recovered from Duncan's computer contained evidence that showed him planning his crimes. Prosecutors used this to show [[Premeditated murder|premeditation]] and secure the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].<ref name=\"handbook\" />\n* [[Sharon Lopatka]]: Hundreds of emails on Lopatka's computer lead investigators to her killer, Robert Glass.<ref name=\"casey\" />\n* [[Einstein and Boyd v 357 LLC and the Corcoran Group, et al.|Corcoran Group]]: This case confirmed parties' duties to preserve [[digital evidence]] when [[litigation]] has commenced or is reasonably anticipated. Hard drives were analyzed by a computer forensics expert who could not find relevant emails the Defendants should have had.  Though the expert found no evidence of deletion on the hard drives, evidence came out that the defendants were found to have intentionally destroyed emails, and misled and failed to disclose material facts to the plaintiffs and the court.\n* [[Dr. Conrad Murray]]: Dr. Conrad Murray, the doctor of the deceased [[Michael Jackson]], was convicted partially by digital evidence on his computer.  This evidence included medical documentation showing lethal amounts of [[propofol]].\n\n==Forensic process==\n{{Main article|Digital forensic process}}\n[[File:Portable forensic tableau.JPG|thumb|A portable Tableau write blocker attached to a [[Hard Drive]]]]\n\nComputer forensic investigations usually follow the standard digital forensic process or phases which are acquisition, examination, analysis and reporting.

Modern forensic software have their own tools for recovering or carving out deleted data.<ref name=\"exposed\" /> Most [[operating system]]s and [[file system]]s do not always erase physical file data, allowing investigators to reconstruct it from the physical [[disk sector]]s.

If necessary, law enforcement applies techniques to move a live, running desktop computer.  These include a [[mouse jiggler]], which moves the mouse rapidly in small movements and prevents the computer from going to sleep accidentally.  Usually, an [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) provides power during transit.\n\nHowever, one of the easiest ways to capture data is by actually saving the RAM data to disk.

The goal of computer forensics is to examine digital media in a forensically sound manner with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analyzing and presenting facts and opinions about the digital information.\n\nAlthough it is most often associated  with the investigation of a wide variety of [[computer crime]], computer forensics may also be used in civil proceedings. The discipline involves similar techniques and principles to [[data recovery]], but with additional guidelines and practices designed to create a legal [[audit trail]].\n\nEvidence from computer forensics investigations is usually subjected to the same guidelines and practices of other digital evidence. It has been used in a number of high-profile cases and is becoming widely accepted as reliable within U.S. and European court systems.\n\n==Overview==\nIn the early 1980s personal computers became more accessible to consumers, leading to their increased use in criminal activity (for example, to help commit [[fraud]]). At the same time, several new \"computer crimes\" were recognized (such as [[Software cracking|cracking]]). The discipline of computer forensics emerged during this time as a method to recover and investigate [[digital evidence]] for use in court. Since then computer crime and computer related crime has grown, and has jumped 67% between 2002 and 2003.<ref name=leigland />  Today it is used to investigate a wide variety of crime, including [[child pornography]], fraud, [[espionage]], [[cyberstalking]], murder and rape. The discipline also features in civil proceedings as a form of information gathering (for example, [[Electronic discovery]])\n\nForensic techniques and expert knowledge are used to explain the current state of a ''digital artifact'', such as a computer system, storage medium (e.g. [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] or [[CD-ROM]]), or an [[electronic document]] (e.g. an email message or JPEG image).<ref name=\"cf-education\"/> The scope of a forensic analysis can vary from simple [[information retrieval]] to reconstructing a series of events. In a 2002 book, ''Computer Forensics'', authors Kruse and Heiser define computer forensics as involving \"the preservation, identification, extraction, documentation and interpretation of computer data\".<ref name=\"kruse\" /> They go on to describe the discipline as \"more of an art than a science\", indicating that forensic methodology is backed by flexibility and extensive domain knowledge. However, while several methods can be used to extract evidence from a given computer the strategies used by law enforcement are fairly rigid and lack the flexibility found in the civilian world.<ref name=gunsch />\n\n==Use as evidence==\nIn court, computer forensic evidence is subject to the usual requirements for [[digital evidence]]. This requires that information be authentic, reliably obtained, and admissible.<ref name=\"theadam\" /> Different countries have specific guidelines and practices for evidence recovery. In the [[United Kingdom]], examiners often follow [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] guidelines that help ensure the authenticity and integrity of evidence. While voluntary, the guidelines are widely accepted in British courts.\n\nComputer forensics has been used as evidence in [[criminal law]] since the mid-1980s, some notable examples include:<ref name=\"casey\" />\n* BTK Killer: [[Dennis Rader]] was convicted of a string of serial killings that occurred over a period of sixteen years. Towards the end of this period, Rader sent letters to the police on a floppy disk. [[Metadata]] within the documents implicated an author named \"Dennis\" at \"Christ Lutheran Church\"; this evidence helped lead to Rader's arrest.\n* [[Joseph E. Duncan III]]: A spreadsheet recovered from Duncan's computer contained evidence that showed him planning his crimes. Prosecutors used this to show [[Premeditated murder|premeditation]] and secure the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].<ref name=\"handbook\" />\n* [[Sharon Lopatka]]: Hundreds of emails on Lopatka's computer lead investigators to her killer, Robert Glass.<ref name=\"casey\" />\n* [[Einstein and Boyd v 357 LLC and the Corcoran Group, et al.|Corcoran Group]]: This case confirmed parties' duties to preserve [[digital evidence]] when [[litigation]] has commenced or is reasonably anticipated. Hard drives were analyzed by a computer forensics expert who could not find relevant emails the Defendants should have had.  Though the expert found no evidence of deletion on the hard drives, evidence came out that the defendants were found to have intentionally destroyed emails, and misled and failed to disclose material facts to the plaintiffs and the court.\n* [[Dr. Conrad Murray]]: Dr. Conrad Murray, the doctor of the deceased [[Michael Jackson]], was convicted partially by digital evidence on his computer.  This evidence included medical documentation showing lethal amounts of [[propofol]].\n\n==Forensic process==\n{{Main article|Digital forensic process}}\n[[File:Portable forensic tableau.JPG|thumb|A portable Tableau write blocker attached to a [[Hard Drive]]]]\n\nComputer forensic investigations usually follow the standard digital forensic process or phases which are acquisition, examination, analysis and reporting.

Again they would face Italian opposition, Juventus, who had won, unbeaten, the [[1983\u201384 European Cup Winners' Cup|1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup]].

The 55-year-old stadium had not been sufficiently maintained for several years, and large parts of the stadium were literally crumbling.

They were also surprised that Heysel was chosen despite its poor condition, especially since [[Barcelona]]'s [[Camp Nou]] and [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]] in [[Madrid]] were both available. Juventus president [[Giampiero Boniperti]] and Liverpool CEO Peter Robinson urged [[UEFA]] to choose another venue, claiming that Heysel was not in any condition to host a European Final, especially a European Final involving two of the largest and most powerful clubs in Europe.

The two ends behind the goals comprised all-standing terraces, each end split into three zones. The Juventus end was O, N, and M and the Liverpool end was X, Y, and Z as deemed by the Belgian court after the disaster. However, the tickets for the Z section were reserved for neutral Belgian fans in addition to the rest of the stadium. This meant the Juventus fans had more sections than the Liverpool fans with the Z section occupied by neutrals which is thought to have heightened prematch tensions.

Several groups of Liverpool hooligans broke through the boundary between section X and Z, overpowered the police, and charged at the Juventus fans. The fans began to flee toward the perimeter wall of section Z. The wall could not withstand the force of the fleeing Juventus supporters and a lower portion collapsed.\n\nContrary to reports at the time, and what is still assumed by many, the collapse of the wall did not cause the 39 deaths. Instead, the collapse relieved pressure and allowed fans to escape. Most died of suffocation after tripping or being crushed against the wall before the collapse. A further 600 fans were also injured. Bodies were carried out from the stadium on sections of iron fencing and laid outside, covered with giant football flags. As police and medical helicopters flew in, the down-draught blew away the modest coverings.\n\nIn retaliation for the events in section Z, many Juventus fans rioted at their end of the stadium. They advanced down the stadium running track to help other Juventus supporters, but police intervention stopped the advance. A large group of Juventus fans fought the police with rocks, bottles, and stones for two hours.

On 30 May official [[UEFA]] observer Gunter Schneider said, \"Only the Liverpool fans were responsible. Of that there is no doubt.\" UEFA, the organiser of the event, the owners of Heysel Stadium and the Belgian police were investigated for culpability. After an 18-month investigation, the dossier of top Belgian judge Marina Coppieters was finally published. It concluded that blame should rest solely with the Liverpool fans.\n\nThe British police undertook a thorough investigation to bring to justice the perpetrators. Some 17 minutes of film and many still photographs were examined. ''[[This Week (ITV TV series)|TV Eye]]'' produced an hour-long programme featuring the footage and the British press also published the photographs.\n\nA total of 34 people were arrested and questioned with 26 Liverpool fans being charged with manslaughter \u2013 the only [[Extradition|extraditable]] offence applicable to events at Heysel. An extradition hearing in London in February\u2013March 1987 ruled all 26 were to be extradited to stand trial in Belgium for the death of Juventus fan Mario Ronchi. In September 1987 they were extradited and formally charged with manslaughter applying to all 39 deaths and further charges of assault. Initially, all were held at a Belgian prison but over the subsequent months judges permitted their release as the start of the trial was further delayed.\n\nThe trial eventually began in October 1988, with three Belgians also standing trial for their role in the disaster: Albert Roosens, the head of the Belgian Football Association, for allowing tickets for the Liverpool section of the stadium to be sold to Juventus fans; and two police chiefs \u2014 Michel Kensier and Johann Mahieu \u2014 who were in charge of policing at the stadium that night.

On 31 May 1985, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] asked [[the FA]] to withdraw English clubs from European competition before they were banned,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fromthearchive/story/0,,1496054,00.html |title=Thatcher set to demand FA ban on games in Europe |work=The Guardian |accessdate=27 May 2006 | location=London}}</ref> but two days later, UEFA banned English clubs for \"...An indeterminate period of time.\" On 6 June, [[FIFA]] extended this ban to all worldwide matches, but this was modified a week later to allow friendly matches outside of Europe to take place. In December 1985, FIFA announced that English clubs were also free to play friendly games in Europe, though the Belgian government banned any English clubs playing in their country.\n\nThough the English national team was not subjected to any bans, English club sides were banned indefinitely from European club competitions, with Liverpool being provisionally subject to a further three years suspension as well. In April 1990, following years of campaigning from the English football authorities, UEFA confirmed the reintroduction of English clubs (with the exception of Liverpool) into its competitions from the 1990\u201391 season onward; in April 1991 UEFA's Executive Committee voted to allow Liverpool back into European competition from the 1991\u201392 season onward, a year later than their compatriots, but two years earlier than initially foreseen. In the end, all English clubs served a five-year-ban, while Liverpool were excluded for six years.\n\nAccording to former Liverpool striker [[Ian Rush]], who signed with Juventus a year later, he saw pronounced improvement in the institutional relationships between both the clubs and their fans during his career in Italy.<ref name=Repubblica/>\n\n====England's UEFA Coefficient====\nPrior to the introduction of the ban, England were ranked first in the [[UEFA coefficient]] ranking due to the performance of English clubs in European competition in the previous five seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method1/crank1985.html|title=UEFA Country Ranking 1985|work=kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl|accessdate=24 December 2018}}</ref> Throughout the ban, England's points were kept in the ranking until they would have naturally been replaced.\n\nThe places vacated by English clubs in the UEFA Cup were reallocated to the best countries who would usually only have two spots in the competition \u2013 countries ranked between ninth and twenty-first. For the [[1985\u201386 UEFA Cup]], the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands were granted an additional spot each, while in [[1986\u201387 UEFA Cup|1986\u201387]], Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, France, and East Germany were the recipients. The [[1987\u201388 UEFA Cup|1987\u201388]] saw Portugal, Austria, and Sweden gain an additional place, with Sweden and Yugoslavia gaining the places for the [[1988\u201389 UEFA Cup|1988\u201389]] competition. The final year of the English ban, [[1989\u201390 UEFA Cup|1989\u201390]] saw Austria receive a spot, while a play-off round was played between a French and a Yugoslav side for the final space - due to the two countries having the same number of points in the ranking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/files/uefa-ranking-history.html|title=UEFA Ranking History|work=kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl|accessdate=24 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818170916/http://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/files/uefa-ranking-history.html|archive-date=18 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEngland was removed from the rankings in 1990 due to having no points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method1/crank1990.html|title=UEFA Country Ranking 1990|work=kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl|accessdate=24 December 2018}}</ref> England did not return to the top of the coefficient rankings until 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method3/crank2008.html|title=UEFA Country Ranking 2008|work=kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl|accessdate=24 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Banned clubs====\nThe following clubs were denied entry to European competitions during this period:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Due to the weak coefficient, [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] winners [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] also missed out on UEFA Cup places in [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup|1990\u201391]], along with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].\n\nThe teams who missed out on the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup]], for the same reason were, [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].

Rioting at [[UEFA Euro 2000]] saw introduction of new legislation and wider use of police powers \u2013 by  2004, 2,000 banning orders were in place, compared to fewer than 100 before Euro 2000.<ref>[http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/policing13.htm?w46 Crime | Home Office<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329231137/http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/policing13.htm?w46 |date=29 March 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/football-disorder/ [ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; Football disorder | Home Office<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318140521/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/football-disorder/ |date=18 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe main reforms to English stadiums came after the [[Taylor Report]] into the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in which 96 people died in 1989. All-seater stadiums became a requirement for clubs in the top two divisions while pitch-side fencing was removed and [[closed-circuit camera]]s have been installed. Fans who misbehave can have their tickets revoked and be legally barred from attending games at any English stadium.\n\nThe Heysel Stadium itself continued to be used for hosting athletics for almost a decade, but no further football matches took place in the old stadium. In 1994, the stadium was almost completely rebuilt as the [[King Baudouin Stadium]]. On 28 August 1995 the new stadium welcomed the return of football to Heysel in the form of a friendly match between Belgium and Germany. It then hosted a major European final on 8 May 1996 when [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] defeated [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Vienna]] 1\u20130 to win the Cup Winners' Cup.\n\n== Commemorations ==\nIn 1985, a memorial was presented to the victims at the Juventus headquarters in Piazza Crimea, [[Turin]].

Again they would face Italian opposition, Juventus, who had won, unbeaten, the [[1983\u201384 European Cup Winners' Cup|1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup]]. Juventus had a team consisting of many of [[Italy national football team|Italy]]'s [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] winning team \u2014 who played for Juventus for many years \u2014 and their [[playmaker]] [[Michel Platini]] was considered the best footballer in Europe, being named [[Ballon d'Or|Footballer of The Year]] by ''[[France Football]]'' [[magazine]] for the second year in a row in December 1984. Both teams were placed in the two first positions in the [[UEFA coefficient|UEFA club ranking]] at the end of the last season<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method1/tcoef1984.html|title=UEFA Team Coefficients 1983/1984|accessdate=22 March 2014}}</ref> and were regarded by the [[Sports journalism|specialist press]] as the best two sides on the continent at the time.<ref>{{harv|Falkiner|2012}}</ref> Both teams had contested the [[1984 European Super Cup]] four months before, finishing with victory for the Italian side by 2\u20130.\n\nDespite its status as Belgium's [[national stadium]], Heysel was in a poor state of repair by the time of the 1985 European Final. The 55-year-old stadium had not been sufficiently maintained for several years, and large parts of the stadium were literally crumbling.

They were also surprised that Heysel was chosen despite its poor condition, especially since [[Barcelona]]'s [[Camp Nou]] and [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium|Santiago Bernab\u00e9u]] in [[Madrid]] were both available. Juventus president [[Giampiero Boniperti]] and Liverpool CEO Peter Robinson urged [[UEFA]] to choose another venue, claiming that Heysel was not in any condition to host a European Final, especially a European Final involving two of the largest and most powerful clubs in Europe.

The two ends behind the goals comprised all-standing terraces, each end split into three zones. The Juventus end was O, N, and M and the Liverpool end was X, Y, and Z as deemed by the Belgian court after the disaster. However, the tickets for the Z section were reserved for neutral Belgian fans in addition to the rest of the stadium. This meant the Juventus fans had more sections than the Liverpool fans with the Z section occupied by neutrals which is thought to have heightened prematch tensions.

Several groups of Liverpool hooligans broke through the boundary between section X and Z, overpowered the police, and charged at the Juventus fans. The fans began to flee toward the perimeter wall of section Z. The wall could not withstand the force of the fleeing Juventus supporters and a lower portion collapsed.\n\nContrary to reports at the time, and what is still assumed by many, the collapse of the wall did not cause the 39 deaths. Instead, the collapse relieved pressure and allowed fans to escape. Most died of suffocation after tripping or being crushed against the wall before the collapse. A further 600 fans were also injured. Bodies were carried out from the stadium on sections of iron fencing and laid outside, covered with giant football flags. As police and medical helicopters flew in, the down-draught blew away the modest coverings.\n\nIn retaliation for the events in section Z, many Juventus fans rioted at their end of the stadium. They advanced down the stadium running track to help other Juventus supporters, but police intervention stopped the advance. A large group of Juventus fans fought the police with rocks, bottles, and stones for two hours.

On 30 May official [[UEFA]] observer Gunter Schneider said, \"Only the Liverpool fans were responsible. Of that there is no doubt.\" UEFA, the organiser of the event, the owners of Heysel Stadium and the Belgian police were investigated for culpability. After an 18-month investigation, the dossier of top Belgian judge Marina Coppieters was finally published. It concluded that blame should rest solely with the Liverpool fans.\n\nThe British police undertook a thorough investigation to bring to justice the perpetrators. Some 17 minutes of film and many still photographs were examined. ''[[This Week (ITV TV series)|TV Eye]]'' produced an hour-long programme featuring the footage and the British press also published the photographs.\n\nA total of 34 people were arrested and questioned with 26 Liverpool fans being charged with manslaughter \u2013 the only [[Extradition|extraditable]] offence applicable to events at Heysel. An extradition hearing in London in February\u2013March 1987 ruled all 26 were to be extradited to stand trial in Belgium for the death of Juventus fan Mario Ronchi. In September 1987 they were extradited and formally charged with manslaughter applying to all 39 deaths and further charges of assault. Initially, all were held at a Belgian prison but over the subsequent months judges permitted their release as the start of the trial was further delayed.\n\nThe trial eventually began in October 1988, with three Belgians also standing trial for their role in the disaster: Albert Roosens, the head of the Belgian Football Association, for allowing tickets for the Liverpool section of the stadium to be sold to Juventus fans; and two police chiefs \u2014 Michel Kensier and Johann Mahieu \u2014 who were in charge of policing at the stadium that night. Two of the 26 Liverpool fans were in custody in Britain at the time and stood trial later. In April 1989, 14 fans were convicted and given three-year sentences, that were half suspended for five years, allowing them to return to the UK.<ref name=\"witnesses\">{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1448082,00.html |title=The witnesses |work=The Observer |accessdate=27 May 2006 | location=London | first=Jamie | last=Jackson | date=3 April 2005}}</ref> After Belgian prosecutors appealed the sentences as too lenient, an appeal took place in Spring 1990 that increased the sentences of 11 fans (to four or five years), with two having their sentences upheld and one being acquitted.{{Citation needed|reason=appeal info|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Stadium investigation===\nGerry Clarkson, Deputy Chief of the [[London Fire Brigade]], was sent by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] to report on the condition of the stadium.

In December 1985, FIFA announced that English clubs were also free to play friendly games in Europe, though the Belgian government banned any English clubs playing in their country.\n\nThough the English national team was not subjected to any bans, English club sides were banned indefinitely from European club competitions, with Liverpool being provisionally subject to a further three years suspension as well. In April 1990, following years of campaigning from the English football authorities, UEFA confirmed the reintroduction of English clubs (with the exception of Liverpool) into its competitions from the 1990\u201391 season onward; in April 1991 UEFA's Executive Committee voted to allow Liverpool back into European competition from the 1991\u201392 season onward, a year later than their compatriots, but two years earlier than initially foreseen. In the end, all English clubs served a five-year-ban, while Liverpool were excluded for six years.\n\nAccording to former Liverpool striker [[Ian Rush]], who signed with Juventus a year later, he saw pronounced improvement in the institutional relationships between both the clubs and their fans during his career in Italy.<ref name=Repubblica/>\n\n====England's UEFA Coefficient====\nPrior to the introduction of the ban, England were ranked first in the [[UEFA coefficient]] ranking due to the performance of English clubs in European competition in the previous five seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method1/crank1985.html|title=UEFA Country Ranking 1985|work=kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl|accessdate=24 December 2018}}</ref> Throughout the ban, England's points were kept in the ranking until they would have naturally been replaced.\n\nThe places vacated by English clubs in the UEFA Cup were reallocated to the best countries who would usually only have two spots in the competition \u2013 countries ranked between ninth and twenty-first. For the [[1985\u201386 UEFA Cup]], the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and the Netherlands were granted an additional spot each, while in [[1986\u201387 UEFA Cup|1986\u201387]], Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, France, and East Germany were the recipients. The [[1987\u201388 UEFA Cup|1987\u201388]] saw Portugal, Austria, and Sweden gain an additional place, with Sweden and Yugoslavia gaining the places for the [[1988\u201389 UEFA Cup|1988\u201389]] competition. The final year of the English ban, [[1989\u201390 UEFA Cup|1989\u201390]] saw Austria receive a spot, while a play-off round was played between a French and a Yugoslav side for the final space - due to the two countries having the same number of points in the ranking.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/files/uefa-ranking-history.html|title=UEFA Ranking History|work=kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl|accessdate=24 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818170916/http://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/files/uefa-ranking-history.html|archive-date=18 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEngland was removed from the rankings in 1990 due to having no points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method1/crank1990.html|title=UEFA Country Ranking 1990|work=kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl|accessdate=24 December 2018}}</ref> England did not return to the top of the coefficient rankings until 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method3/crank2008.html|title=UEFA Country Ranking 2008|work=kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl|accessdate=24 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Banned clubs====\nThe following clubs were denied entry to European competitions during this period:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Due to the weak coefficient, [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] winners [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] also missed out on UEFA Cup places in [[1990\u201391 UEFA Cup|1990\u201391]], along with [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].\n\nThe teams who missed out on the [[1991\u201392 UEFA Cup]], for the same reason were, [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].

Rioting at [[UEFA Euro 2000]] saw introduction of new legislation and wider use of police powers \u2013 by  2004, 2,000 banning orders were in place, compared to fewer than 100 before Euro 2000.<ref>[http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/policing13.htm?w46 Crime | Home Office<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329231137/http://www.crimereduction.homeoffice.gov.uk/policing13.htm?w46 |date=29 March 2010 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/football-disorder/ [ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; Football disorder | Home Office<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318140521/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime-victims/reducing-crime/football-disorder/ |date=18 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe main reforms to English stadiums came after the [[Taylor Report]] into the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in which 96 people died in 1989. All-seater stadiums became a requirement for clubs in the top two divisions while pitch-side fencing was removed and [[closed-circuit camera]]s have been installed. Fans who misbehave can have their tickets revoked and be legally barred from attending games at any English stadium.\n\nThe Heysel Stadium itself continued to be used for hosting athletics for almost a decade, but no further football matches took place in the old stadium. In 1994, the stadium was almost completely rebuilt as the [[King Baudouin Stadium]]. On 28 August 1995 the new stadium welcomed the return of football to Heysel in the form of a friendly match between Belgium and Germany. It then hosted a major European final on 8 May 1996 when [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] defeated [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Vienna]] 1\u20130 to win the Cup Winners' Cup.\n\n== Commemorations ==\nIn 1985, a memorial was presented to the victims at the Juventus headquarters in Piazza Crimea, [[Turin]]. The monument includes an [[epitaph]] written by Torinese journalist [[Giovanni Arpino]]. Since 2001 it has been situated in front of the current club's headquarters in Corso Galileo Ferraris.<ref>{{cite web|language=Italian |url=http://www.saladellamemoriaheysel.it/Immagini/Lapide.jpg |title=Una foto del monumento a Torino |accessdate=3 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, the band [[Revolting Cocks]], founded in part by [[Al Jourgensen]] of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], released a song by the name of \"38\" on the album ''[[Big Sexy Land]]'', in commemoration of the deaths.\n\nA memorial service for those killed in the disaster was held before Liverpool's match with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] at Anfield on 18 August 1985, their first fixture after the disaster.
