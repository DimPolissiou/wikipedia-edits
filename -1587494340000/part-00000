History |first= |last= |publisher=ozwhitelufc |date=|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> is a former [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].\n\n==Playing career==\n===Leeds United===\nBorn in [[Leeds]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1948, Harvey attended [[Foxwood School (Seacroft)|Foxwood School]] (in the [[Seacroft]] area of the city), and played for Leeds City Boys before leaving school to work in a [[Barratts Shoes|Stylo]] shoe factory. He was signed as a professional footballer by [[Don Revie]] in February 1965, after having played as an apprentice for two years.<ref name=\"LeedsUtdHistoryPlayerdetails\"/>\n\nHarvey was the reserve goalkeeper for Leeds United during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and was on the reserves' bench when Leeds won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and the [[UEFA Cup|Fairs Cup]] in 1968, the [[Football League First Division|League championship]] in 1969, and the Fairs Cup in 1971.\n\nIn the [[1970 FA Cup Final]], an error by first-choice goalkeeper [[Gary Sprake]] allowed opponents [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] to equalise in the first half. Sprake was blameless for the second equaliser, but Harvey replaced him for the replay, which Leeds lost 2\u20131.\n\nIn the 1971\u201372 season, Harvey played only eleven matches, but was selected ahead of Sprake for the [[1972 FA Cup Final]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], as Sprake was suffering from a knee injury. Leeds won 1\u20130 with an [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] goal, and from that point on Harvey was the first-choice goalkeeper.\n\nHarvey played 63 times in the 1972\u201373 season, and played in both the [[1973 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] and the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup Final]] \u2013 ending up on the losing side both times.\n\nLeeds put together a 29-match unbeaten start to the 1973\u201374 season, winning the League championship and earning Harvey the title medal to which he had not been entitled five seasons earlier.\n\nAt the start of the 1974\u201375 season, Harvey took the last penalty during the shoot-out at the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] game against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] but missed, thus allowing Liverpool to carry the trophy home. Later in the season Harvey was injured in a car crash. He missed the rest of the season replaced by his understudy [[David Stewart (footballer, born 1947)|David Stewart]]. Stewart was praised for his bravery and \"inspirational saves\" beating [[Anderlecht]] and [[F.C. Barcelona]] in the [[1974-75 European Cup]]. Leeds were beaten 2\u20130 by [[Bayern Munich]] in the final in [[Paris]].\n\nThe rest of the 1970s saw Leeds decline after the ageing team Revie built broke up. Harvey left in 1980.\n\n===Vancouver Whitecaps===\nHarvey moved to NASL club [[Vancouver Whitecaps (NASL)|Vancouver Whitecaps]] in 1980. He had an unsteady first season with Vancouver, and even though his form improved in the second season in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|NASL]], injuries from another car accident prevented him from regaining his form and place.\n\n===Return to Leeds United===\nHarvey returned to Leeds in 1983, by which time the club had been relegated to the old Second Division. By the time he left in 1985, he had played under three of his old teammates: [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]], [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]] and [[Billy Bremner]].\n\n===Later career===\nHarvey played 6 league games for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in 1985. This was under the management of an ex-Leeds teammate, [[Trevor Cherry]]. He then played 3 league games in Scotland for [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]] in 1986. He next played non-league football with [[Whitby Town F.C.|Whitby Town]] and [[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate Town]] before his retirement from the game aged 37.\n\n===International career===\nHarvey made his debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in a 2\u20130 win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], selected through his Scots father. In his 16 full caps he was part of eight victories, four draws and four defeats. He was selected as Scotland's first-choice keeper for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] in [[West Germany]]. Scotland went out after the group stage unbeaten on goal difference after a 2\u20130 win against Zaire and draws with Brazil (0-0) and Yugoslavia (1-1).<ref>{{FIFA player|50635|David Harvey}}</ref>\n\n==Career after football==\nHe retired from football at the age of 37 years. He managed a public house at [[Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire|Stamford Bridge]], near [[York]].

History |first= |last= |publisher=ozwhitelufc |date=|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref> is a former [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].\n\n==Playing career==\n===Leeds United===\nBorn in [[Leeds]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1948, Harvey attended [[Foxwood School (Seacroft)|Foxwood School]] (in the [[Seacroft]] area of the city), and played for Leeds City Boys before leaving school to work in a [[Barratts Shoes|Stylo]] shoe factory. He was signed as a professional footballer by [[Don Revie]] in February 1965, after having played as an apprentice for two years.<ref name=\"LeedsUtdHistoryPlayerdetails\"/>\n\nHarvey was the reserve goalkeeper for Leeds United during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and was on the reserves' bench when Leeds won the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and the [[UEFA Cup|Fairs Cup]] in 1968, the [[Football League First Division|League championship]] in 1969, and the Fairs Cup in 1971.\n\nIn the [[1970 FA Cup Final]], an error by first-choice goalkeeper [[Gary Sprake]] allowed opponents [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] to equalise in the first half. Sprake was blameless for the second equaliser, but Harvey replaced him for the replay, which Leeds lost 2\u20131.\n\nIn the 1971\u201372 season, Harvey played only eleven matches, but was selected ahead of Sprake for the [[1972 FA Cup Final]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], as Sprake was suffering from a knee injury. Leeds won 1\u20130 with an [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]] goal, and from that point on Harvey was the first-choice goalkeeper.\n\nHarvey played 63 times in the 1972\u201373 season, and played in both the [[1973 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] and the [[Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners Cup Final]] \u2013 ending up on the losing side both times.\n\nLeeds put together a 29-match unbeaten start to the 1973\u201374 season, winning the League championship and earning Harvey the title medal to which he had not been entitled five seasons earlier.\n\nAt the start of the 1974\u201375 season, Harvey took the last penalty during the shoot-out at the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] game against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] but missed, thus allowing Liverpool to carry the trophy home. Later in the season Harvey was injured in a car crash. He missed the rest of the season replaced by his understudy [[David Stewart (footballer, born 1947)|David Stewart]]. Stewart was praised for his bravery and \"inspirational saves\" beating [[Anderlecht]] and [[F.C. Barcelona]] in the [[1974-75 European Cup]]. Leeds were beaten 2\u20130 by [[Bayern Munich]] in the final in [[Paris]].\n\nThe rest of the 1970s saw Leeds decline after the ageing team Revie built broke up. Harvey left in 1980.\n\n===Vancouver Whitecaps===\nHarvey moved to NASL club [[Vancouver Whitecaps (NASL)|Vancouver Whitecaps]] in 1980. He had an unsteady first season with Vancouver, and even though his form improved in the second season in the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984)|NASL]], injuries from another car accident prevented him from regaining his form and place.\n\n===Return to Leeds United===\nHarvey returned to Leeds in 1983, by which time the club had been relegated to the old Second Division. By the time he left in 1985, he had played under three of his old teammates: [[Allan Clarke (footballer)|Allan Clarke]], [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]] and [[Billy Bremner]].\n\n===Later career===\nHarvey played 6 league games for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in 1985. This was under the management of an ex-Leeds teammate, [[Trevor Cherry]]. He then played 3 league games in Scotland for [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]] in 1986. He next played non-league football with [[Whitby Town F.C.|Whitby Town]] and [[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate Town]] before his retirement from the game aged 37.\n\n===International career===\nHarvey made his debut for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in a 2\u20130 win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], selected through his Scots father. In his 16 full caps he was part of eight victories, four draws and four defeats. He was selected as Scotland's first-choice keeper for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] in [[West Germany]]. Scotland went out after the group stage unbeaten on goal difference after a 2-0 win against Zaire and draws with Brazil (0-0) and Yugoslavia (1-1).<ref>{{FIFA player|50635|David Harvey}}</ref>\n\n==Career after football==\nHe retired from football at the age of 37 years. He managed a public house at [[Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire|Stamford Bridge]], near [[York]]. He then became a [[Mail carrier|postman]], saying, \"The sorting office atmosphere was like a dressing room\".<ref name=\"WherearetheynowHarvey\"/>\n\nIn 1994, with his wife, June (and their five children), he bought a 150-year-old stone cottage with 10 acres of farmland on [[Sanday, Orkney|Sanday]] in Scotland's [[Orkney Islands]].

The owner was Wentworth J. Marshall, formerly head of the Marshall Drug Co. chain, and the general manager was David M. Baylor. When it debuted, WJMO was the only Cleveland radio station without a network affiliation. As a result, the station specialized in recorded music. Early staff included Gene Carroll (mornings), Howie Lund (afternoons), and Billy Evans on sports.<ref>[http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=W23 AM 1540's Early Years (Case Western Reserve University)]</ref>\n\nIn 1948, WJMO carried the football games of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve College]] Red Cats, both at home from League Park and on the road. In the first broadcast on September 25 Gil Gibbons called the action as Western Reserve met [[Western Michigan University|Western Michigan]] in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]].\n\nOn June 5, 1952, in an attempt to emphasize music rather than DJs, Baylor issued an orders to play four songs every 15 minutes. As a result, a number of DJs chose to leave the station. Later than year, Wentworth sold the station on August 20 for $100,000 to Maryland-based United Broadcasting, headed by Richard Eaton. Ownership was later put in the name of Eaton's affiliated company Friendly Broadcasting of Ohio. An FM license was granted for the [[WHLK|106.5 MHz facility]] that was to take the WJMO-FM call letters, but it was slated to sign on by 1959.\n\nSome of the Announcers at WJMO in the 1970s included Rudy Green, Wes Dickenson, Billy Black, Bill Taylor, Lynn Tolliver, John O'Day, J.L. Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few.\n\n===WABQ (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Painesville radio station [[WABQ]]}}\nMeanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490&nbsp;kHz licensed to suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], and had an FM complement at 95.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. On January 14, 1959, [[WJMO]] bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format.\n\nDetroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent.\n\nIt was best known for a Top 40/R&B format as \"Tiger Radio\" in the late 1960s (Booth's [[WJLB]] in Detroit used the same \"Tiger Radio\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \"The Lover\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards.  Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \"Ring-A-Ding\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts.  Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset.\n\nIn April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.  The special authority to remain on the air 24 hours a day expired after just a day or two.\n\nWABQ's heyday quietly faded into the 1970s and 1980s, and went through numerous format changes since. Booth Broadcasting sold off WABQ in 1984, and several different ownership changes followed as a result. Eventually, the station assumed a gospel music format and had local ownership for much of those years since.\n\n===ESPN 1540 KNR2===\nIn July 2006, the station was sold by D&E Communications (headed by Dale Edwards) to [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]]-based [[Good Karma Broadcasting]], LLC., headed by [[Craig Karmazin]], for $2.5 million. Just before the sale closed, WABQ switched call letters with [[Painesville, Ohio]] station WBKC 1460-AM - owned by Radio Advantage One, LLC, a sister company to D&E Communications - on October 24, 2006.\n\nFour days later, WABQ's programming officially moved to 1460, and the 1540 facility relaunched as \"ESPN Radio 1540\" with a [[sports talk radio|sports/talk]] format. The station temporarily kept the WBKC call letters before adopting the WWGK callsign that November 7.\n\nWWGK's new format at 1540 first carried the entire [[ESPN Radio]] daytime lineup on its daytime only broadcasts, much like Good Karma-owned Milwaukee station [[WAUK]]. Speculation focused on plans to purchase nighttime clearance on [[WERE]] in order to have a 24-hour network clearance. Moreover, a companion \"1540 Days - 1300 Nights\" logo on WWGK's website had confirmed this, though it was since removed. There was never any official word that such an arrangement was ever attempted.\n\nOn December 4, 2006, ''Crain's Cleveland Business'' reported that Craig Karmazin's Good Karma Broadcasting was to purchase [[WKNR]] for $7 million, eventually combining both stations under one facility at [[The Galleria at Erieview]].\n\nOn February 23, 2007, it was made official that WKNR would regain its former ESPN Radio affiliation, while WWGK would take the branding AM 1540 KNR2, (a play on [[ESPN2]]) in keeping with its sister station.  In April 2010, the station began branding itself as ESPN 1540 KNR2.  Today, WWGK and WKNR are often promoted on-air jointly as ESPN Cleveland.\n\nThe new schedule also made WWGK the [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate in Cleveland, but still retained (at the time) ESPN Radio shows hosted by [[Colin Cowherd]] and [[Dan Patrick]] and the final hour of ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' - all of which WKNR was unable to air otherwise. The station also started a 24-hour streaming audio service on its website.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, [[WKRK-FM]] 92.3 switched from [[alternative rock]] to a [[sports talk]] format, and (at the time) became the new Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cleveland.  AM 1540 then replaced FSR with further ESPN Radio programming.\n\n===Doctor Radio===\nOn April 22, 2020, WWGK dropped all sports programming and switched to a medical news/talk format, airing programming from [[Sirius XM]]'s [[Doctor Radio]] service.  This was done to provide a health-related service during the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]].  Good Karma management has stated sports programming will eventually resume as events warrant.<ref>[http://radioinsight.com/headlines/186287/1540-wwgk-cleveland-to-add-siriusxms-coronavirus-programming/ 1540 WWGK Cleveland to add Sirius XM coronavirus programming - Radio Inisight.com]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|https://goodkarmabrands.com/espn-cleveland}}\n*{{FCC letter|callsign=FCC History Cards for WWGK|letterid=46285}}{{AM station data|WWGK}}\n\n{{Cleveland Radio}}\n{{Daytime-only radio stations in Ohio}}\n{{Good Karma Broadcasting}}\n\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:ESPN Radio stations]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1947]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Cleveland|WGK]]\n[[Category:Daytime-only radio stations]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Sports radio station in Cleveland, Ohio}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name = WWGK\n| image = \n| city = [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]\n| area = [[Greater Cleveland]] (limited)\n| branding = '''Doctor Radio'''\n| frequency = 1540 [[Kilohertz|kHz]]\n| airdate = {{start date and age|1947|6|1}}\n| format = Medical news/talk\n| power = 1,000 [[watt]]s (daytime only)\n| class = D\n| facility_id = 70659\n| coordinates = {{nowrap|{{coord|41|30|10.00|N|81|37|57.00|W|region:US-OH_type:landmark_source:FCC}}}}\n| callsign_meaning = owner Good Karma Brands\n| former_callsigns = WJMO (1947&ndash;58)<br>WABQ (1958&ndash;2006)<br>WBKC (2006)\n| affiliations = [[Doctor Radio]]\n| owner = [[Good Karma Brands]]\n| licensee = {{nowrap|Good Karma Broadcasting, LLC}}\n| sister_stations = [[WKNR]]\n| webcast = [http://espn.go.com/espnradio/affPopup?s=wwgk-am Listen Live]\n| website = {{URL|http://goodkarmabrands.com/espn-cleveland}}<br>{{URL|http://thelandondemand.com}}\n}}\n\n'''WWGK''' (1540 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) is a commercial [[Clear-channel station#Daytimers|daytime-only]] medical news/talk [[radio station]] licensed to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], providing limited coverage to [[Greater Cleveland]].

Wright, Mike Payne, Mary Holt and Ken Hawkins to name a few.\n\n===WABQ (1540 AM)===\n{{distinguish|text=Painesville radio station [[WABQ]]}}\nMeanwhile, WSRS, which was founded by S.R. Sague on December 12, 1947, broadcast 24-hours a day on 1490&nbsp;kHz licensed to suburban [[Cleveland Heights, Ohio|Cleveland Heights]], and had an FM complement at 95.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]. On January 14, 1959, [[WJMO]] bought WSRS (at 1490-AM and 95.3-FM) and exchanged respective callsigns, studios/facilities, and staffs. Both 1540-AM and 106.5-FM were sold off to Tuschman Broadcasting Company with the switch; the 1540 facility immediately became WABQ and the 106.5 facility instead signed on as WABQ-FM before switching to WXEN that next year, carrying an ethnic format.\n\nDetroit-based Booth Broadcasting took ownership of WABQ and WXEN in the mid-1960s. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, both WABQ and WJMO focused on programming aimed at Cleveland's African American community, featuring mostly black on-air talent.\n\nIt was best known for a Top 40/R&B format as \"Tiger Radio\" in the late 1960s (Booth's [[WJLB]] in Detroit used the same \"Tiger Radio\" slogan at the time), featuring personalities like Lynn Tolliver and Ken Hawkins, Michael \"The Lover\" Payne and King Curtis Shaw, Jimmy O'jay, Jimmy Stephens, Jim Raggs and Eddie Edwards.  Mike Dix, Rich Ford, Chuck Denson, Otis Rush and Duane Jones were just a few of the many news announcers the station featured during the late 1960s and early seventies. The station's popular \"Ring-A-Ding\" talk show featured Olympic gold medalist Harrison Dillard who also handled sportscasts.  Gospel programming in the late weekday morning hours was presented by Cleveland's First Lady of Gospel, Mary Holt. Sundays featured wall-to-wall church programming with Denver Wilborn as host.\n\nThroughout the late 1960s and into the early to mid-1970s WABQ and WJMO competed for listeners among Cleveland's African-American community with WJMO often enjoying a slight ratings edge due to its ability to remain on the air after local sunset.\n\nIn April 1968 WABQ received special temporary authority from the FCC to stay on the air overnight in an attempt to help inform and comfort the community following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.  The special authority to remain on the air 24 hours a day expired after just a day or two.\n\nWABQ's heyday quietly faded into the 1970s and 1980s, and went through numerous format changes since. Booth Broadcasting sold off WABQ in 1984, and several different ownership changes followed as a result. Eventually, the station assumed a gospel music format and had local ownership for much of those years since.\n\n===ESPN 1540 KNR2===\nIn July 2006, the station was sold by D&E Communications (headed by Dale Edwards) to [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]]-based [[Good Karma Broadcasting]], LLC., headed by [[Craig Karmazin]], for $2.5 million. Just before the sale closed, WABQ switched call letters with [[Painesville, Ohio]] station WBKC 1460-AM - owned by Radio Advantage One, LLC, a sister company to D&E Communications - on October 24, 2006.\n\nFour days later, WABQ's programming officially moved to 1460, and the 1540 facility relaunched as \"ESPN Radio 1540\" with a [[sports talk radio|sports/talk]] format. The station temporarily kept the WBKC call letters before adopting the WWGK callsign that November 7.\n\nWWGK's new format at 1540 first carried the entire [[ESPN Radio]] daytime lineup on its daytime only broadcasts, much like Good Karma-owned Milwaukee station [[WAUK]]. Speculation focused on plans to purchase nighttime clearance on [[WERE]] in order to have a 24-hour network clearance. Moreover, a companion \"1540 Days - 1300 Nights\" logo on WWGK's website had confirmed this, though it was since removed. There was never any official word that such an arrangement was ever attempted.\n\nOn December 4, 2006, ''Crain's Cleveland Business'' reported that Craig Karmazin's Good Karma Broadcasting was to purchase [[WKNR]] for $7 million, eventually combining both stations under one facility at [[The Galleria at Erieview]].\n\nOn February 23, 2007, it was made official that WKNR would regain its former ESPN Radio affiliation, while WWGK would take the branding AM 1540 KNR2, (a play on [[ESPN2]]) in keeping with its sister station.  In April 2010, the station began branding itself as ESPN 1540 KNR2.  Today, WWGK and WKNR are often promoted on-air jointly as ESPN Cleveland.\n\nThe new schedule also made WWGK the [[Fox Sports Radio]] affiliate in Cleveland, but still retained (at the time) ESPN Radio shows hosted by [[Colin Cowherd]] and [[Dan Patrick]] and the final hour of ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' - all of which WKNR was unable to air otherwise. The station also started a 24-hour streaming audio service on its website.\n\nOn August 29, 2011, [[WKRK-FM]] 92.3 switched from [[alternative rock]] to a [[sports talk]] format, and (at the time) became the new Fox Sports Radio affiliate in Cleveland.  AM 1540 then replaced FSR with further ESPN Radio programming.\n\nOn April 22, 2020, WWGK dropped all sports programming and switched to a medical news/talk format, airing programming from [[Sirius XM]]'s [[Doctor Radio]] service.  This was done to provide a health-related service during the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]].  Good Karma management has stated sports programming will eventually resume as events warrant.<ref>[http://radioinsight.com/headlines/186287/1540-wwgk-cleveland-to-add-siriusxms-coronavirus-programming/ 1540 WWGK Cleveland to add Sirius XM coronavirus programming - Radio Inisight.com]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{Official website|https://goodkarmabrands.com/espn-cleveland}}\n*{{FCC letter|callsign=FCC History Cards for WWGK|letterid=46285}}{{AM station data|WWGK}}\n\n{{Cleveland Radio}}\n{{Daytime-only radio stations in Ohio}}\n{{Good Karma Broadcasting}}\n\n[[Category:1947 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:ESPN Radio stations]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1947]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Cleveland|WGK]]\n[[Category:Daytime-only radio stations]]\n", "name_user": "Vjmlhds", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eESPN 1540 KNR2", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWGK"}

Drummers were originally established in European armies to act as signallers.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\">{{cite web\n  | title = History of the Corps Of Drums Where did it all start?\n  | publisher = The Corps of Drums Society\n  | url = http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-11\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm\n  | archivedate = 17 May 2008\n  | df = dmy-all\n  }}</ref> This is the major historical distinction between a military band and a corps of drums, 'drummers' would not play their instruments to entertain or delight, but rather as a utilitarian battlefield role. This role was fulfilled by trumpeters or buglers and timpanists in the cavalry and the artillery, who did not form into comparative formed bodies in the way that drummers did; therefore, an orthodox corps of drums will exist in the infantry arm and not in other arms (save for the light infantry).\n\n==History==\n\nMost fife and drum traditions trace back to the Swiss mercenaries of the early Renaissance, and it is known that by the early 16th century, each [[Company (military unit)|company]] of infantry soldiers would have a single drummer and a single fife player.<ref>[http://corpsofdrums.com/about/history/ History]</ref> These two musicians would march at the head of the company, and when not providing uplifting marching tunes, they would be used by the company commander to convey orders, on and off the field of battle. The drummers would be more aptly described as signallers than musicians, as shouted orders were very hard to hear over the din of battle. Later, a bugle would become the preferred means of communication on the battlefield, and the drummers adapted, training on bugles and carrying them in battle, but retaining the drum and the title of drummer.\n[[Image:Battle of bunker hill by percy moran.jpg|thumb|Drummers in the centre foreground, in their original battlefield role, close to the officer and wearing the distinctive drummers uniform described below.]]\nAs time went on, the individual drummers and fife players in each company would be organized at battalion level.  They retained their role in each company in battle, but would form one body of men at the head of a battalion on the march. It was necessary to appoint a Drum Major (the equivalent of a Sergeant Major, for the drummers) to be in charge of the drummers and to organize training in the emerging discipline of military drumming while a fife major was to be appointed to be the principal fifer and to train future fife players. The corps of drums would group together when not on duty with each company, and carry out various roles within the battalion, such as administering military justice and ensuring soldier's billets were secured, thus, the corps of drums became attached to the battalion HQ and was organized at battalion level, as opposed to individual company level.\n\n==Current Role==\n\nEventually, as the use of musical instrument on the battlefield diminished, corps of drums looked to fill specialist roles within the battalion while still retaining their original role for ceremonial purposes.\n\nSeveral different strings of logic have seen corps of drums employed in many varied roles. Because the corps would often be employed in support of the battalion, in areas such as delivering mail or designating billets, they are often given the role of assault pioneers, or supporting-fire (machine gun) platoons.\nThe corps of drums role on the battlefield was originally to signal orders, and therefore some units are organised into signals platoons, operating radios.\nCorps of drums were also deployed to march under the parley flag when officers of opposing met to discuss terms of surrender, etc. Therefore, some corps of drums perform a liaison role.\n\nHistorical duties such as uncasing [[Colours, standards and guidons|the colours]] on parade and various other privileges are continued in most units. Due to the specialist duties and ceremonial aspects of a drummers life, a corps of drums may be the unofficial custodian of regimental customs and traditions.\n\nCorps of drums are drawn from the whole battalion, and are attached to the battalion HQ. Above the [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] as its head, the corps is usually answerable to the battalion's [[adjutant]].\n\n==United Kingdom==\n[[File:Drummer Lee Rigby 1.jpg|thumbnail|upright|The late [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby]] was a Drummer in the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]]]\nThe [[British Army]] maintains a corps of drums in each infantry battalion except for [[Royal Regiment of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Irish]], and [[Rifleman|Rifle]] Regiments ([[The Rifles]] and the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]]) which have [[Pipe band|pipes and drums]] and Bugles respectively. Each battalion of a regiment will maintain a corps of drums which may be 'massed' together on certain occasions. All corps-of-drums soldiers are called {{Anchor|drummer}} drummers (shortened to 'Dmr') regardless of the instrument they play, similarly to use of the term \"sapper\" for soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/>\n\nUnlike army musicians who form bands and will usually be limited to auxiliary duties in wartime, drummers in a Corps of Drums are principally fully trained infantry soldiers, with recruitment coming after standard infantry training. A Corps of Drums will deploy with the rest of the battalion, and will often form specialist platoons such as [[assault pioneer]]s, supporting fire or [[force protection]].\n\nHistorically, the drum was used to convey orders during a battle, so the Corps of Drums has always been a fully integrated feature of an infantry battalion. Later on, when the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] was adopted to convey orders, drummers were given bugles in addition, but maintained their drums and flutes, except in rifles regiments where the lighter instrument was more conducive to the skirmishing form of warfare.\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Welsh guards drummers on the mall.jpg|thumbnail|Corps of Drums of the Welsh Guards, showing the fleur-de-lys lace on that body and sleeves of the tunic which features more extensively than that of line regiments.]]\nThe main instrument is the [[Snare drum|Side drum]]. These were originally of a rope-tension design with wide wooden hoops, a wooden shell and an animal-skin head. In the British Army, this model has been continuously upgraded, with the inclusion of snares, more modern metal rod-tension and plastic heads. The current British Army 97s-pattern side drum also has nylon hoops.\n\nThe side drum was increasingly decorated throughout the 19th century, until it bore the fully embellished [[regimental colour]]s of the battalion, including its [[battle honour]]s. As such a regiment's drums are often afforded respect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe second instrument was originally the [[Fife (instrument)|fife]], replaced in the modern British Army by the [[Five-key flute|five key flute]]. A wide variety of flutes and pitches is used. The fife and later the flute have been favoured as a warlike instrument due to shrill pitch and thus the ability to be heard above the noise of battle. Many tunes such as [[The British Grenadiers]] are traditionally played by military flutes. Fifes and keyed flutes were typically pitched in B-flat, but the flute family eventually expanded to include a Piccolo in E-flat, a perfect fourth higher, and a flute pitched in F, a perfect fourth lower than the B-flat flute. There was also a \"B-flat Bass\" which was pitched an octave below the B-flat flute. Occasionally the B-flat flute is known as the \"Treble\" in order to avoid confusion with the B-flat bass flute. The development of this family of flutes facilitated the development of flute band part music which in many ways imitates the style of larger military bands.\n\nThe bugle replaced the drum mid-way through the 19th century as the most common means of communication on the battlefield. These duties were carried out by the battalion's corps of drums, whose drummers now each carry a bugle.\n\nAs the musical role of a corps of drums became more ceremonial in the 19th and 20th centuries, more instruments were added to make their output more musically complete. A modern corps of drums may thus have a range of percussion instruments such as a [[bass drum]], [[tenor drum]]s and [[cymbals]] in addition to the snare drum, flute and bugle.\n\n===Uniform===\n[[Image:DWR Colours, Erquinghem Lys, France (RLH) 2005-11-12.JPG|thumb|left|A corps of drums of the [[Duke of Wellington's regiment]] (since amalgamated into the [[Yorkshire Regiment]]), showing crown lace tunics, a leopard skin on the bass drummer, and rod-tension side drums with metal hoops.]]\nDrummers originally wore distinct uniforms so as to stand out on the battlefield. During the 18th century most British Army drummers were distinguished by wearing their regimental uniforms in \"reversed colours\" \u2013 thus an infantry regiment wearing [[Red coat (British Army)|red coat]]s with yellow [[facings]] would clothe its drummers in yellow coats with red facings. This practice tended to make drummers targets in battle and after 1812 was replaced by less conspicuous distinctions.<ref>page 71, \"Military Uniforms of Britain & the Empire\", Major R.M. Barnes, Sphere Books 1972</ref> These usually consisted of [[lace]], used liberally all over the standard uniform, in varying patterns. Many early patterns consisted of a \"Christmas-tree\" pattern in which the chest was covered in horizontal lace decreasing in width downwards, and chevrons of lace down each sleeve. The modern infantry pattern in the British Army is of \"crown-and-inch\" lace sewn over the seams down the sleeves, around the collar, and over the seams on the back of the tunic. The crown-and-inch lace itself is about {{convert|1/2|in}} thick with a repeating crown pattern. The [[Guards Division]]s drummers have the old-style \"Christmas-tree\" pattern, with [[fleurs-de-lis]] instead of crowns.\n\nWhilst corps of drums in the British Army often parade in [[Army Combat Uniform|combat uniforms]] and other forms of dress, they will usually parade in the [[full dress|full dress uniform]] as above, being one of a few formations which regularly wear full dress.\n\nIn some regiments, it has become custom for the percussion rank to wear leopard skins over their uniform. This has the dual purpose of protecting the uniform (cymbals have to be muffled against the chest, and therefore would leave vertical marks on a bare tunic) and protecting the instruments themselves (the bass drum can be scratched by uniform buttons). Modern \"leopard skins\" are made from synthetic fur. Other regiments opt for a simple leather or cloth apron.\n\nDrummers have traditionally been armed with \"drummers' swords\", a [[shortsword]] with a simple brass hilt bearing the [[Royal Cypher]]. The practice of wearing swords has been discontinued by some regiments, though many still do carry the swords, whilst some use an [[SA80]] [[bayonet]] as a modern alternative.\n\n===Honourable Artillery Company===\n[[File:HAC Corps of Drums at Wellington Barracks.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Corps of Drums]] of the Honourable Artillery Company at [[Wellington Barracks]].]]\nThe [[Honourable Artillery Company]] maintains a corps of drums, and as such is the only such sub-unit in an artillery unit in the British Army.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/units/10738.aspx<HAC Official Website>]</ref> Although the Honourable Artillery Company now fulfils an artillery role, historically it was an infantry regiment, with two battalions fighting during the Great War.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#History<HAC|wiki page, history>]]</ref> The last infantry battalion was disbanded in 1973, but the corps of drums remained. As the regiment still maintains the privilege granted to it by King William IV in 1830, that the H.A.C. should dress as the Grenadier Guards, except wearing silver where the Grenadiers wear gold, the corps of drums of the HAC dresses in a very similar fashion to that of the Grenadier Guards.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#Dress<HAC|wiki page, dress>]]</ref> Just as in other corps of drums of the British Army, its personnel carry out a soldiering role as their main function.\n\nSince the HAC is the oldest unit in existence in the British Army, and as drummers were on the establishment of infantry units at the latest during the 16th century, it may be assumed that the corps of drums of the HAC is the oldest in the British Army, though it has not been in continuous existence.\n\nIn addition, the HAC's veteran unit, the [[Company of Pikemen and Musketeers]] maintains an early form of Corps of Drums known as the 'Musik'. In this capacity, more basic fifes and larger rope-tension drums are used and 17th century uniforms are worn in keeping with the rest of the Company.\n\n===Royal Logistic Corps===\n[[Image:rlc2013-0018.jpg|thumb|RLC Drums with Battle honours.]]\nThe [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC) also maintains a corps of drums in the form of several side drummers, drawn from soldiers who serve a short tour as drummers before returning to a field unit. This is not a conventional corps of drums, as it has no flautists, and comes under the command of regimental headquarters of the RLC, rather than forming a separate entity. It frequently plays with the Band of the RLC, but often performs in isolation. It is famed for its \"black light\" display. These drummers stem from the 12 drummers placed on [[the Royal Waggon Train]] (RWT) in 1803. There are reserve soldiers within the Corps of Drums of 157 Regiment RLC, based at Cardiff in Wales.\n\nAt the time of Waterloo, in the period of deployment to the Low Countries, the RWT introduced drums made of brass. These originated on the Indian sub-continent. The size {{convert|14|by|12|in|mm}}. They weighed {{convert|16|lb}}. They were faced in blue and carried the cypher of King George, with the title below. A few drums of the period survive today. The drumsticks were of Canadian maple, following the campaigns in North America during the Napoleonic era. The drums had drag ropes purchased from unit funds. Whilst drummers carried the bugle, the common instrument for the \"Waggoners\" was the [[fanfare trumpet]] on account of their cavalry traditions, and inclusion in the light cavalry. During that period the corps was then being divided between the foot soldiers, which used drums and fifes, and the mounted soldiers, with cavalry fanfare trumpets as signalling instruments. The drum sling was still that of the hook.\n\n===Royal Marines===\n[[File:USMC-10212009-M-3403K-011.jpg|thumbnail|Royal Marines Corps of Drums]]\n[[Royal Marines Band Service|Royal Marines Bands]] are led by 'buglers', who are trained on both the side drum and the bugle as well as the Herald Fanfare Trumpet (natural trumpet); this section of the band is referred to as \"the Corps of Drums\", which since 1903 is now situated at the front of the band. Whilst similar to Army corps of drums, these are members of the Royal Marines Band Service (RMBS), although they retain their own rank structure.  Members of the RMBS are primarily musicians; however, they also carry out secondary roles (e.g. medics, drivers, force protection etc.) when required to, like their Army counterparts.\n\nRM Buglers have a similar history to Army 'drummers' in that they were used to convey orders on a ship on drums and bugles, and would then mass onshore into corps of drums, though they were still expected to work as individual soldiers,<ref>[http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm Fact Sheet - The Drums of the RM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}</ref> also known in slang by the Royal Navy as drummers.\n\nThese drummer-buglers trace themselves back to the raising of the Royal Marines in 1664 as a maritime foot regiment, with six drummers attached to its battalions.\n\n====History of Maritime Drummers====\nDrums were, in 1664, used for the raising of the [[Royal Marines| Duke of York's and Albany's Maritime Regiment of Foot]], the ''Admiral's Regiment''. The regiment's 1,200 personnel had six snare drummers per company, the ancestors of the corps of drums of the [[Royal Marines Band Service]]. The Holland Regiment soon came after them. They were later to be called ''The Buffs'', the ''Old Buffs'' and ''Howards's Buffs''.\n\nEach time a maritime regiment, or from 1672 onward, a marine regiment, is disbanded and a new one appears in its place, drummers come in, especially the young ones who liked playing drums and wanted to serve playing them. The 1702 formation of the marine and sea-service foot regiments saw the drummers' greatest action at Gibraltar, when they played the drums to support their regiments.\n\nThe [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] saw into action ten British marine regiments and an all-American marine regiment, all units whose drummers and fifers played alongside their units.\n\nEven though part of the [[British Army]] which in the 18th century was led by the War Office, the Board of Ordnance and the Commissariat, marines were naval units. Royal Navy officers were at one point part of the marines. Due to two laws that regulated them and other army and navy units, marine drummers faced a loyalty problem over what drum calls they would have to do, and for what branch and on what occasion they might be required to play drums for orders, commands, etc.\n\nIn 1755, the problem was solved. The Admiralty took over what was then called ''His Majesty's Marine Forces''.  Even though at first Royal Navy officers filled the officer ranks, with lieutenant-colonel being perceived as the highest relevant rank, in 1771 a promotion to colonel occurred for the first time in the H.M.M.F.\n\nAfter their formation, the H.M.M.F's drummers and fifers of the three marine divisions played alongside their fellow soldiers in various landings worldwide on behalf of the Royal Navy. They joined their units in the American War of Independence, and a drummer was at James Cook's service during his sea travels.\n\nAt Adm. John Jervis's insistence, by King George III's order in 1802, the H.M.M.F. was transformed into the ''H.M.M.F.-Royal Marines'', albeit larger than today's establishment. Two years later, bomb vessel crews and gunners became part of the newly created ''Royal Marine Artillery'', in which bugle calls became a regular part of life from then on.\n\nThe Royal Navy in the 19th century was short of manpower in both the H.M.M.F.-R.M. and the R.M.A. For this, Army units joined the H.M.M.F.-R.M. as replacement units, carrying not only their drummers and fifers but also buglers.\n\nIn 1855, during the units' service in the Crimean War, the H.M.M.F.-R.M's foot units became one under the unified title of ''Royal Marines Light Infantry'', later known as the ''Royal Marine Light Infantry''. From then, bugles replaced drums as signallers and order beaters, but the latter would be still useful for drill, being then called ''drummers and buglers'', and from 1867 the R.M.L.I./R.M.A. drummers were called ''buglers'' only, serving individually in ships and the R.N's shore establishments and artillery units and massed into corps of drums for their units on the ground. Fifes fully declined and disappeared in usage. By then, a bugler playing both the drum and his bugle both to sound orders and do drum calls was a common sight in the RMLI and RMA. By the 1890s, even buglers also trained in using herald trumpets or Fanfare trumpets became commonplace in RMLI and RMA bases and facilities.\nA 1902 incident changed the buglers forever. A Coronation Review at [[Aldershot]] was due soon, and the then Sr. Bandmaster of the RMLI, Lt. George Miller, asked his fellow bandmasters to get buglers for his band for the review. The next day at a church parade, he asked 30 RMLI buglers to front the RMLI Massed Bands. They then marched to his own arrangement of Onward Christian Soldiers. Everyone was shocked by this and were amazed that the formation that he used would become a RMLI and RMA military band standard formation setup, and the precision stick drills that he made became a permanent fixture in military events where either or both the RMLI and RMA's presence were needed. Soon later, when the RM began operating the Royal Naval School of Music the next year as a training venue for future bandsmen of the RN, RMLI and RMA, they brought this formation for Royal Navy bands as well, inspiring the formations used by modern military bands of some Commonwealth countries like Australia,  Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n1923 would see the buglers of the R.M.L.I. and R.M.A. now belong to the ''Corps of Royal Marines'', the Royal Marines of today. Seeing action during the Second World War and in the growing crisis of the [[Cold War]] were the R.M.'s brave buglers of the new '''[[Royal Marines Band Service]]''', even through separate from the bands themselves. The R.M.A. and R.M.L.I. buglers' dress uniforms (dark blue trousers and tunic and red collars and trouser wells) became the full dress of the corps bands and buglers, with the addition of a Wolseley [[pith helmet]] as headdress, and yellow shoulder cords and slashed cuffs to indicate their long history, heritage and lineage from 1664.\n\nBy 1950, the R.N.S.o.M. became today's [[Royal Marines Band Service#Royal Marines School of Music|Royal Marines School of Music]], and the Royal Naval bands were dissolved. Beating retreats by both the Royal Marine bands and the R.M. Corps of Drums buglers would begin to occur annually, later triennially and as of today biannually, at [[Horse Guards Parade]], [[Portsmouth]] and other venues, playing for the entire Royal Navy and the Royal Marines. It would be only in 1978 that the R.M.B.S. would have buglers as well in its rosters. By the 1990s, however, only five R.M. corps of drums were left as the Deal Depot closed down in 1996, the Chatham band already dissolved in the 1940s, with three at the R.N. England bases in [[Portsmouth]], [[Plymouth]] and at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] till 2008 (The last is now assigned to {{HMS|Collingwood|establishment|6}}), one in the R.M.S.o.M. (then in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and now in Portsmouth since 1996) and another one in [[Scotland]] at HMS ''Caledonia''. By the 1950s, only the band carried the corps at the lead, as separate corps of drums, which played only bugles alongside the drums, were discontinued altogether (these were adopted in the 1880s when the RM began to transition from fifes to bugles).\n\nToday there are six R.M. Bands (plus the training company, R.M.S.o.M. Junior Musicians and Buglers) located around the UK, in Portsmouth (three in HMS Nelson, which includes the R.M.S.o.M.), Fareham (HMS Collingwood), Plymouth (HMS Raleigh), Lympstone (Commando Training Centre Royal Marines) and Scotland (HMS Caledonia) for a total of seven bands and attached corps of drums.  All members of the R.M.B.S. are trained at the Royal Marines School of Music (HMS Nelson). Buglers' training lasts two years. Basic military skills are taught during four months of initial military training and, if successful, trainee buglers are instructed on the bugle, drum and herald/fanfare trumpets. Musical skills are refined and supported with additional lessons in music theory and aural perception. Parade work forms a large part of the curriculum and considerable time is spent developing personal drill and bearing.\n\nToday's R.M. Corps of Drums contains approximately 60 buglers who carry out duties ranging from repatriation services (''Last Post'' and ''Reveille''), mess beatings (drum displays), beating retreat (marching displays) and concerts on behalf of the Royal Marines and the entire Royal Navy.\n\n====Instruments and leadership====\nLike the British Army, Military snare (side) drums (MSD) are the principal instrument of the corps of drums; however, another core instrument is the bugle. Bass drums are often used during parades and drum displays, while cymbals and single tenor drums are used during parades and ceremonies only. Herald Fanfare trumpets (natural trumpets) are also performed on such occasions where a bugle fanfare would be inappropriate for such. The corps is led by a drum major and a bugle major serves as the principal player for it.\n\n===The Drummer's Colour===\n\n[[File:Drummer's colour 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Corps of Drums|Drummer]] of the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] holds the Drummer's Colour.]]\n\nThe Drummer's Colour, also known as the Wilhelmsthal Colour, is a unique [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colour]] held by 1st Battalion, [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]. A drummer, usually the youngest in the battalion, is detailed to carry it when it is on parade.<ref name=Handbook2019>{{cite web|url=https://thefusiliers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fusiliers-Regimental-Handbook-2019.pdf|title= Regimental Handbook 2019}}</ref>\n\n====History====\nAt the [[battle of Wilhemstahl]] in 1762,The [[5th Foot]] lead the centre column under the command of [[Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]. During this action, they captured the Colour of an opposing French regiment, and took a large number of prisoners.<ref name=www.britishempire.co.uk>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/britishinfantry/northumberlandcolour1910.htm|title=www.britishempire.co.uk}}</ref>\nAfter this date, the regiment carried a small green silk banner in addition to their usual stand of Colours to commemorate the one they captured. This was destroyed along with the Regimental Colour by a fire in the [[Mess| Officer's Mess]] in 1833. Despite Representations made to [[King William IV]] refused a request to replace the Drummer's Colour following the fire. However the regiment continued to parade a replacement, and was granted specific permission to do so by [[King George V]] in 1933.<ref name=Handbook2019>{{cite web|url=https://thefusiliers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fusiliers-Regimental-Handbook-2019.pdf|title= Regimental Handbook 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince then, a drummer has been entrusted with carrying the Colour. This is unique within [[infantry]] [[regiments]] of the [[British Army]], since colours are normally only entrusted to [[commissioned officers]], except when they are in the custody of sergeants to convey them to an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Messenger |first1=Charles |title=For Love of Regiment: A History of British Infantry, Volume One, 1660\u20131914 |date=1994 |publisher=Leo Cooper }}</ref> The Drummer's Colour will typically only be paraded on [[St. George's Day]], unlike the other colours of the regiment which are used more frequently. On this day, it is decorated with red and white roses, in keeping with regimental custom which sees all members of the regiment wear the roses in their headdress on this day. The drums of the Corps of Drums and the [[Drum Major|Drum Major's]] staff are also similarly decorated.\n\nWhen the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]] were amalgamated with other regiments to form the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] in 1968, the tradition of carrying the Drummer's Colour was maintained by the 2nd Battalion. When this battalion was in turn 'deleted' in 2014 as a result of the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]], the Drummer's Colour was passed to the 1st Battalion.\n\n[[File:Drummer's colour.jpg|thumb|A Sergeant Drummer ([[Drum major (military) |Drum Major]]) and Drummer of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] with the Drummer's Colour. The staff, Colour, and headdress of both are decorated with red and white roses for [[St. George's Day]].]]\n====Appearance and Charges====\nThe Drummer\u2019s Colour is of gosling green silk edged with gold. [[St. George and the Dragon]] are embroidered in the centre, with red scrolls edged with gold above and below. The motto of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] \u2018Quo Fata Vocant\u2019(Go where divine providence leads) is displayed on the upper scroll, and the word \u2018Northumberland\u2019 is on the lower. Above the lower scroll is a large 'V' with 'Regt' below, both in gold, indicating that the Northumberland Fusiliers were the 5th Regiment of Foot at the time of the battle. A laurel wreath with red berries surrounds the central elements, and [[tudor rose]]s surmounted by crowns feature in the four corners.<ref name=handbook>{{cite web|url=http://www.regimentsdirect.co.uk/fusiliers/Content/BRS/Fusiliers%20Regimental%20Handbook.pdf|title=Regimental Handbook|publisher=Regiments Direct|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===British civilian and cadet corps of drums===\nIn addition to Army and Navy/Royal Marines Corps of Drums, in the [[United Kingdom]] there are also [[Cadet#United Kingdom|cadet]]- civilian corps who base their music on the military traditions of the country.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/> The [[Army Cadet Force]] corps use the Army-style formations and instrumentation (flutes/bugles, snare, bass and tenor drums, cymbals and [[Glockenspiel]]s), save for those with Scottish and Irish links that have [[Pipe band]]s instead and those affiliated with the light infantry (especially the now only LI regiment [[The Rifles]]) have a corps of drums without the fifes while using only bugles. Those corps of the [[Combined Cadet Force]], [[Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps]] and the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] use the RN/RM naval and ship-style corps (Snare drums/Bugles, Bass and Tenor drums, cymbals and glockenspiels) and are attached to the main band. This formation is also used by the military band of the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]]. Another example of a military style CoD is that of the [[Royal British Legion]], whose bands are modeled on the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Band Service. The Royal Air Force however does not have any such ensembles, and only Corps of Drums under the [[Royal Air Force Air Cadets]] are active, with their formation being similar to those of the RN and RM.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police restarted a Corps of Drums in 2011, when the central youth engagement unit purchased some drums and sent cadets on a \"band camp\". Greenwich borough subsequently took a caretaker role of the drums and established a corps of drums. 2015 saw Kensington and Chelsea and Hillingdon Boroughs expanding and creating more branches. It is the first band in the Metropolitan Police to be composed of members of the Metropolitan Police since 1988. It is also the first band in the name of the Metropolitan Police since 1997, when the civilianised Metropolitan Police Band was disbanded.\n\nCivilian corps of drums are also formatted after their respective services, with corps patterned after those of the Army, Navy and the Royal Marines in instrumentation and marching style becoming commonplace. These are staffed by both veteran and retired military drummers as well as civilian drummers playing the fifes, bugles and percussion. In Northern Ireland, civilian corps are mounted by Loyalist groups, which for the most part use flutes with no bugles at all.\n\n==United States==\nA '''corps of drums''' or '''field music band''' in the United States is a type of [[military band]], which originated in European [[Army|armies]] in the 16th century. The main instruments of a corps of drums are the [[drum]] and the [[flute]] or [[Fife (instrument)|fife]] and [[bugle]]. Unlike 'full' [[Military band|military marching bands]], corps of drums usually exist within an [[infantry]] [[battalion]]. A [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] is the leader of a corps of drums, and in the past a fife major served as the principal fifer or flautist with a bugle major serving the same purpose for the buglers.\n\n[[Valley Forge Military Academy and College]] has a corps of drums that is part of the regimental band. Uniforms and music are modelled on the Royal Marines Corps of Drums. VFMAC does have a similar but separate formation which is part of the Corps of Cadets (VFMAC Field Music) which only uses drums (snares, tenors and basses), cymbals and bugles and from 2011, fifes. Formed in 1956, it also provides the official guard-of-honour for visitors to the Delaware Valley area.\n\nThe [[United States Army]] [[Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps]], raised in 1960 and part of the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]] of the [[United States Army]], formally revived this very part of American military music history and its mission is to relive it for coming generations. This is the only musical unit of the US armed forces in which its drum major, wearing a classic 18th century infantry cap and carrying a [[spontoon]], the honor badge and weapon of 18th century senior non-commissioned officers, salutes using the left hand. Musicians assigned to this unit wear 18th century military uniforms reminiscent of those used in the [[American Revolutionary War]] by the [[Continental Army]] drummers and fifers. Another corps of drums is found as part of the [[West Point Band]] - the West Point Hellcats, which wear regulation uniforms from the 1820s, and since 2016 play using bugles, fifes and traditional rope tension snare and bass drums.  Until the late 19th century the US Army and the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained similar ensembles before switching to bugles.\n\n=== Formation of field music/corps of drums in the US Armed Forces and civilian organizations === \nWhile only the Old Guard FDC is the only field music formation in the US Armed Forces and thus more similar to a European corps of drums, in the past there had been similar formations armed forces-wide. Should such units be reactivated again not just in the Armed Forces but also as civilian, veterans or youth cadet formations, the formation of the ensemble is as follows (the formation is to be expected to be led by a drum major):\n\n* Field snare drums\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Cymbals (optional)\n* Single tenor drums (optional)\n* Glockenspiels (optional)\n* Fifes\n* Piccolos, Flutes\n* Bugles in B and/or G Major\n* Chromatic fanfare Trumpets in B or G Major (optional)\n* Single-valve bugles (Only in the Old Guard FDC)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald Fanfare Bugles (optional)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald fanfare trumpets (optional)\n* Soprano Bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* Flugelhorn Bugles\n* Mellophones\n* Baritone Bugles\n* Marching Baritones\n* Contrabass bugles\n\n==Germany==\nIn Germany, ''Spielmannszug'', ''Tambourkorps'' and  sometimes ''Trommlerkorps'' are the names given to the German corps of drums, whether it is a military formation or a civilian formation. The instrumentation of these are, commonly fifes and snare drums (just like the [[Bundeswehr]] corps of drums that are attached to the unit military bands), [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s, [[Glockenspiel]]s, Bass drums, cymbals and, on some corps, single and multiple tenor drums, and like their British counterparts, bugles (in several corps). [[Timpani]], [[vibraphone]]s and [[marimba]]s are used in concerts. Sometimes even a [[Turkish crescent]] is used to symbolize the band. Whatever the configuration, a drum major always leads the corps during military and civil parades and other events, and in modern corps even majorettes and pom pom dancers are a part of its roster.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong and are attached to the bands of the Bundeswehr [[Military bands of the Bundeswehr|Military Music Center]] under the Bundeswehr [[Streitkr\u00e4ftebasis]] while civilian corps are dedicated civil bands and youth bands assigned in cities and towns all over Germany.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1990, the [[National People's Army]] maintained corps of drums in the same manner as the Bundeswehr. During the Republic Day parades on 7 October in East Berlin from 1959 to 1989, the national corps included single tenor drums at the front.\n\n==Russia/CIS==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e \u0414\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0412\u041e (5).jpg|thumb|Drummers of the [[Minsk Suvorov Military School]] on the avenue during a parade in 2017.]]\nRussian '''{{transl|ru|Barabanshchiki}}''' or drummers are names that are used to refer to Russian military corps of drums ({{lang|ru|\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432}}, {{transl|ru|rota barabanshchikom}}), a practice that is of Imperial origin in the field drummers that marched at the lead of their units in parades and that is a part of the traditions of almost all former Soviet republics (save for the Baltics and Georgia). Russian drum corps are usually made up of snare drummers with one line of [[flute]] or [[fife]] players in the middle and two [[glockenspiel]]s in the front (with the option for a third one or a [[Turkish crescent]], plus chromatic fanfare trumpeters, buglers and trumpeters). Military corps of drums are usually made separate from the massed military bands of the unit or command that it is a part of, and are led by a drum major who is a commissioned officer of minimum junior officer rank.\n\n[[File:Azerbaijan Armed Forces.jpg|thumb|An Azerbaijani corps of drums]]\n\nHistorically, the corps of drums is a military unit that is formally a part of the junior military high schools of these countries. Uniquely, the [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces]] follows the Turkish models by attaching a full bugle formation behind the corps of drums.\n\n===List of Post-Soviet units/institutions with corps of drums===\n*[[Moscow Military Music College]]\n*Kronstadt Sea Cadet Corps \n*Ussuriysk Suvorov Military School\n*Yekaterinburg Suvorov Military School\n*Vladivostok Nakhimov Naval School\n*Baltic Fleet Naval Training Center Sevastopol\n*[[Minsk Suvorov Military School]]\n*[[Ivan Bohun Military High School]]\n*[[Monte Melkonian Military College]]\n*[[Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy]]\n*[[Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School]]\n*[[Mastibek Tashmukhamedov Military Lyceum of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan]]\n*[[Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense of Turkmenistan]]\n*[[Military Music College of Mongolia]]\n*Georgi Atanasov Military Music School (until 2001<ref>https://m.dnevnik.bg/print/arhiv_pari/2001/08/01/1544686_zakrivat_uchilishte_zaradi_lipsa_na_pari/amp</ref>)\n\n== Sweden ==\nOnly the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]] King's Guard Battalion has a corps of drums organized as a platoon - the [[Svea Corps of Drums]] (''F\u00e4ltpipark\u00e5ren/Livgardets trumk\u00e5r'') which is part of the Life Guards Company. Until 2009 the Royal Swedish Army Drum Corps served as the official active field music unit of both the Army and the entire Armed Forces, and thus only the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard Command]] maintains the practice with dedicated ensembles in several areas of the country.\n\n== Canada ==\nThe sole corps of drums that is active within the [[Canadian Army]] today is the Corps of Drums of [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]. Being a musical unit, it replaces the regimental band of the PPCLI, which was dissolved in 1994. Based on the British tradition for these units, it is modeled on the Corps of Drums of the [[Royal Logistics Corps]] of the [[British Army]]. The regimental drum corps is divided into three units which are assigned to different battalions in the PPCLI. These individual drum corps operate as small drum lines that serve during different ceremonies and events. Unlike their British and American counterparts, but more similar to the Corps of Drums of the RLC, the drum corps does not utilize [[flutes]] and bugles. An example of a historical corps of drums can be found through the [[Fort Henry Guard]] and the [[Fort York Guard]], both of which sport corps of drums that include [[fife]]s and are led by a Drum Major and a Drum Sergeant. Although it is not part of the Canadian Forces, it is designed to represent the units of the [[British Army]] in [[Upper Canada]]. During WWII, many regiments maintained small corps of drums that were stationed at all\nmajor bases. While most of them were staffed by active duty troops, others were staffed by volunteer bandsmen, consisting of reservists and professional civilian percussionists.<ref>http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520erum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], corps of drums have been historically attached to military bands at the front-rank following the precedent the [[Royal Marines Band Service|bands]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Corps of Royal Marines]]. After the 1968 [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]], corps of drums in both the RCN, were dismantled and abolished, although notably making a return in the mid-1980s within the naval reserve. In July 2013, a five-person corps of drums was unveiled for the first time by the [[Naden Band of Maritime Forces Pacific]] a [[Victoria Day]] Parade.<ref>http://www.lookoutnewspaper.com/corps-of-drums-return-to-band/</ref>\n\n==Netherlands and in Indonesia==\n''Drum bands'' are the Dutch and Indonesian terms for the corps of drums, but in the [[Netherlands]] they are also called as ''drumfanfares'', ''tamboerkorps'', ''trompetterkorps'' and ''klaroenkorps'' (''drum and lyre bands, [[fanfare band]]s and drum and brass bands'') and in [[Indonesia]] as ''marching bands'' and ''drum corps''.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the basic instrumentation is\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Multiple and single tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Flutes, Fifes\n* Bugles, Natural trumpets, [[fanfare trumpet]]s\n* Natural horns (few bands only)\n* Turkish crescent (optional)\n* [[Brass section]]/[[Marching brass]] (in few bands)\n\nMilitary drum bands in the [[armed forces of the Netherlands]] would have only two to four of these basic instruments.\n\nOptional or permanent instruments in these bands are flutes and piccolos, bugles, natural horns, valved bugles and brass instruments (soprano bugles and trumpets, cornets, horns, mellophones, baritones, sousaphones and contrabass bugles).\n\nThese bands are attached to the main marching band, similar to French bands, but also perform as stand alone bands. They are led by a drum major, and can have [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s and [[colour guard]]s, the latter now more separated from the band.\n\nIn the 1990s however these bands became paramilitary-styled and even adopted the traditions of British military bands of the Guards Division and the Royal Marines, but several of these bands chose the American marching band and drum and bugle corps practice. Some of these bands also adopted woodwind instruments turning them into full-time military marching bands, and almost all drum bands use English voice commands and not Dutch commands and only a few use whistle commands and the mace movements.\n\nIn Indonesia, the corps, a military musical heritage from Dutch colonial times, may be treated as military, civil or school marching and show bands, and in some cases as [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]], and are either attached to the main marching band or as stand-alone bands, with instrumentation drawn from the following:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* [[Melodica]]s (in school marching bands)\n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]s (chromatic and/or herald) (optional)\n* [[Bugle]]s (optional)\n* Flutes, piccolos (in the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]])\n* Fifes (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Clarinet]]s (in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Trumpet]]s, [[cornet]]s and soprano bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* [[Flugelhorn]]s and flugel bugles\n* [[Trombone]]s (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[French horn|Horn]]s, [[mellophone]]s and horn bugles\n* Baritone bugles, [[baritone horn]]s and marching baritones\n* [[Wagner tuba]]s (optional)\n* [[Tuba]]s, [[euphonium]]s, [[saxhorn]]s (optional)\n* [[Contrabass bugle]]s, [[sousaphone]]s\n''If a civilian front ensemble is present'':\n* [[Marimba]]\n* [[Vibraphone]]\n* Xylophone\n* Suspended cymbals\n* Tubular bells\n* Gong\n* Drum kit\n* Timpani\n\nThey are led by from one to six [[Drum major (military)|drum major]]s and can have a separate director of music (in civil and police bands only), majorettes and [[color guard (flag spinning)|Colour guard]]s (optional). The drum majors in these bands have a unique use of the mace in order to coordinate the timing and precision of the band like US marching band drum majors do. The Indonesian corps also has dancing bass drummers either wearing uniforms or costumes (such is the case in the corps of drums of the various Indonesian uniformed organizations, most especially the armed forces and the national police), a unique feature of these corps and are attached to it and are also a nod to Indonesian cultural traditions, plus dancing contrabass buglers and baritone buglers in some bands. The brass instruments are pitched in C, F or B major unlike US military DBCs, most notably that of the [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]] that use G major brasses and civilian corps in the past, and so too are the glockenspiels being used and the flutes and clarinets.\n\nAnother unique characteristic is that in military and police corps of drums, tenor and bass drummers, baritone buglers (optionally) and contrabass buglers wear combat, duty or everyday uniform (and optionally costumes for the tenor drummers) instead of the full dress uniform while playing, whether in performance, field practice or rehearsals, unlike their British counterparts do. They wear [[beret]]s, [[ball cap]]s or [[side cap]]s as head-dress, unlike the rest of the band, who wear [[peaked cap]]s, especially the drum majors and in civil bands, the director of music, the color guards and the pit section during field performances. Bands of the Armed Forces academies tend to have their single tenor drummers wear their specialty uniform and colored berets of the selected service arm or branch, with those of the Navy wearing free diving gear and the Air Force flightsuits.\n\n=== Ancient style corps of drums in Indonesia ===\n\nThe practice was introduced to the Netherlands East Indies in the early 1800s, and today both the [[Yogyakarta Kraton Guards]] and the Royal Guard of [[Pakualaman]] each sport an ancient form of the corps, alongside a recently reconstituted formation from the Royal Guard of the [[Surakarta Sunanate]]. Alongside them, both the southern regencies of Central Java and Yogyakarta have dedicated civilian corps, each serving the ''bregodo rakyat'' (''people's brigade'') companies that conserve the traditions of the armed services of the former sultanates. These corps, when formed up in parade, are composed of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Fifes, flutes, [[suling]] flutes\n* Bugle/s\n* Trumpet/s (in some civil bands)\n* One to three [[Kendang]]s\n* Single tenor drum/s (in civil bands)\n* Cymbals\n* Bass drum (in civil bands and in Surakarta)\n* Gong/s\n\n==South America==\nInspired by the German (and sometimes French) style corps of drums, South American corps differ in instrumentation, size and leadership.\n\n===Chile===\nSimilar to the German corps, the Chilean corps of drums are both military and civil bands, the ''Bandas de Guerra'' (War Bands) that the Chileans call them formally.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong to the Chilean Armed Forces' three services, the [[Carabineros de Chile]] and the [[Chilean Gendarmerie]] and differ in instrumentation and officers in charge (only in the Chilean Navy).\n\n*[[Chilean Army]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*[[Chilean Navy]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major)\n*[[Chilean Air Force]]: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Carabiners: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Gendarmerie: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n\nThe military style corps also inherit the British corps' tradition of carrying drummers' swords attached to belts in all their dress uniforms.\n\nCivilian corps are usually school based bands with the addition of a percussion section (Snare drums, bass drums and cymbals) and glockenspiels and are either part of a school marching band or as a standalone band in itself. In these separate bands, a fife major leads the band's fifers/flautists while on duty, and also assist the drum major and the bugle major. These positions also exists on corps which are now part of school bands, as well as in a few volunteer community fire departments. These civil corps perform on occasions when requested and participate in competitions.\n\n===Ecuador===\nCorps of drums in Ecuador are both military and civil bands. These corps are very similar to the German corps, but with the addition of bugles and the single tenor drum.\n\nLike the Chilean corps, these bands have differences in configuration and instrumentation in the Ecuadorian armed forces. But the corps snare and tenor (sometimes bass) drummers often play on drums that are painted in the service or unit colours (sometimes in the colours of Guayaquil, which are blue and white for the corps of the [[Ecuadorian Navy]]) and in the case of the Military Academy \"Eloy Alfaro\" and the Air Force Academy \"Cosme Rendella\", have the unit/school insignia attached to the bugles' and fifes' tabards.\n\nThe typical Ecuadorian corps, called as the ''Peloton Comando'' (Commando Platoon) but are also called as the ''Banda de Guerra'' (War Band), just like in Chile in several schools and colleges (many bands now fall under the ''Banda Escolar'' or ''Banda de Paz'' title due to recent state reforms), is led by a drum major (in several cases there would be 1 to 4 drum majors) and is composed of:\n\n*Snare drums\n*Fifes (common only in the Ecuadorian Army and Ecuadorian Air Force and school bands)\n*Bugles and natural trumpets (common in all three services, principal instrument in the Ecuadorian Navy)\n*Single tenor drums\n*Bass drums (optional and common in some corps)\n*Cymbals (optional and in some corps)\n*Glockenspiels\n*Multiple tenor drums (only in school bands)\n\nEcuadorian Civil corps of drums are similar only to the Army and Air Force corps but are based as youth bands stationed in schools across the nation. Notable exceptions include the Corps of Drums of the Ecuadorian National Police. Like military corps, they are led by a drum major in all their activities but there are cases of multiple drum majors leading, from a minimum of two to a maximum of four or five. But in some corps, there are some majorettes and tambourine players. Those that are based on the Navy's corps of drums (especially [[Guayaquil]]-based corps) use the same instrumentation as its corps have.\n\n===Venezuela===\nSimilar to Germany and Colombia's, the Venezuelan corps of drums are both military and civil bands, and like Colombia's, Peru's and Ecuador's contain the same instrumentation of :\n\n*Snare drums\n*Bass drums\n*Cymbals\n*Single tenor drums\n*Glockenspiels\n*Bugles (and optionally trumpets)\n\nThe corps is led by a single drum major. In some corps, especially in civil-based ones, other brass instruments may be added into the bugle section.\n\nMilitary corps have tabards applied on the bass drums, snare drums, glockenspiels and bugles on every occasion that it is performing. One such formation is the Military Academy of Venezuela Corps of Drums. Recently there's an effort to build up full-time military marching bands in the national armed forces with the percussion of the corps combined with brass and woodwind instruments.\n\n===Bolivia===\nCorps of drums in Bolivia, both military and civil, are inspired by German and French band practices and are part of the main band. The instruments used by them are snare drums, tenor drums (single and multiple), bass drums, cymbals and sometime glockenspiels. Turkish crescents are used as standards and are paraded as part of them. In military corps attached to bands there would be one to two drum majors and in some cases standards or vertical banners are used to distinguish the corps when on parade. Civil corps attached to [[marching band]]s would have one to eight drum majors (in some cases ten) and would also have a military-styled colour guard marching with the Turkish crescents and optionally the standards.\n\n===Peru===\nPeruvian corps of drums are both military (''Banda de guerra'') and civil bands (''Banda ritmica''), with differences in instrumentation. In whatever combination, it's a main part of the main school or military marching band led by the Director of Music, with the drum major or majorette or standard bearer leading led by the conductor or as a separate band led by the drum major or standard bearer at the front of the ensemble. These follow the Spanish and French influence.\n\nCorps of drums in the [[Peruvian Armed Forces]] and the [[National Police of Peru]] (formerly the Civil Guard of Peru, Peruvian Investigations Police and Peruvian Republican Guard), plus school or college based bands and corps attached to them or as separate bands are composed of snare and or field drums, single tenor drums, multiple tenor drum (in school corps), bugles and glockenspiels in addition to the regular snare and bass drums and cymbals. [[Tambourine]]s are common within the school-based corps, with female [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s assisting the conductor or the school band drum major or music director. Tabards are applied only on the bugles and glockenspiels, as well as in the snare and tenor drums if applicable.\n\n===Colombia===\nColombian corps of drums ar similar to those of Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Venezuela but are different in leadership, being led by a minimum of 3-7 drum majors or majorettes, and are composed instrumentally of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Field/precision snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums (civil corps)\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Bugles and trumpets\n* Natural trumpets (military corps only and in several civil corps)\n* [[Trombones]] (optional, only in select military corps)\n* [[Saxhorns]] (only in select military corps)\n* [[Bagpipes]] (in the corps of drums of the [[Colombian Naval Academy]] and the Basic School of the [[Colombian Naval Infantry]])\n* Tambourines (civil corps)\n* Conga drums (civil Corps)\n* Timbales (civil corps)\n* Cowbells (civil corps)\n* Suspended cymbals (civil corps)\n\nCivil corps would also have a separate conductor, occasionally standard bearers and [[colour guard]]s marching along.\n\nEven through separate from the main marching band, a part of the band itself or as a band of its own, they are both useful as military-based and civil-based marching bands. The drums are either covered with cloth tabards of the unit or band to which the corps belongs, or painted in various colours to suit its needs.  The bugles, trumpets and glockenspiels (and in military units and several civil bands, natural trumpets) are attached with small tabards with the military service, police, school or college insignia, name or emblem shown in them.\n\n== Central America ==\nKnown as ''Bandas de Guerra'' or ''banda tradicional'' in Spanish, the Corps of drums tradition is also active in the following Central American countries:\n\n* [[Guatemala]]\n* [[El Salvador]]\n* [[Honduras]]\n* [[Panama]]\n\nThe Guatemalan corps tradition is mostly active in school-based corps, which mirror drum and bugle corps of the US and Mexico. In Nicaragua, only the Nicaraguan Armed Forces sports a small corps manned by officer cadets. School based bands are known as ''bandas ritmicas'' following the Peruvian pattern and are percussion only.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200141/http://www.coldstreamguards.org.nz/ Coldstream Guards Corps of Drums website]\n*[http://www.royalwelshband.com/drums/drums.shtml Regimental Band of The Royal Welsh Guards Corps of Drums website]\n*[http://www.corpsofdrums.com/ Corps of Drums Society]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080325110007/http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc_band/corps_of_drums.htm Corps of Drums of The Royal Logistic Corps]\n*[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XgwuPK4jEA0 Kirab Drum Corps Akpol]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military band]]\n* [[Marching band]]\n* [[Pipe band]]\n* [[Fife and drum corps]] for the US variant \n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]\n* [[Fanfare band]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Corps Of Drums}}\n[[Category:Types of musical groups]]\n[[Category:Marching bands]]\n[[Category:Military bands]]\n[[Category:Combat occupations]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Drum and bugle corps (disambiguation){{!}}Drum and bugle corps}}\n\n[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-24.jpeg|thumb|right|Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Conservatoire at the Victory Parade on Red Square, 2010.

Drummers were originally established in European armies to act as signallers.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\">{{cite web\n  | title = History of the Corps Of Drums Where did it all start?\n  | publisher = The Corps of Drums Society\n  | url = http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm\n  | accessdate = 2008-06-11\n  | url-status = dead\n  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm\n  | archivedate = 17 May 2008\n  | df = dmy-all\n  }}</ref> This is the major historical distinction between a military band and a corps of drums, 'drummers' would not play their instruments to entertain or delight, but rather as a utilitarian battlefield role. This role was fulfilled by trumpeters or buglers and timpanists in the cavalry and the artillery, who did not form into comparative formed bodies in the way that drummers did; therefore, an orthodox corps of drums will exist in the infantry arm and not in other arms (save for the light infantry).\n\n==History==\n\nMost fife and drum traditions trace back to the Swiss mercenaries of the early Renaissance, and it is known that by the early 16th century, each [[Company (military unit)|company]] of infantry soldiers would have a single drummer and a single fife player.<ref>[http://corpsofdrums.com/about/history/ History]</ref> These two musicians would march at the head of the company, and when not providing uplifting marching tunes, they would be used by the company commander to convey orders, on and off the field of battle. The drummers would be more aptly described as signallers than musicians, as shouted orders were very hard to hear over the din of battle. Later, a bugle would become the preferred means of communication on the battlefield, and the drummers adapted, training on bugles and carrying them in battle, but retaining the drum and the title of drummer.\n[[Image:Battle of bunker hill by percy moran.jpg|thumb|Drummers in the centre foreground, in their original battlefield role, close to the officer and wearing the distinctive drummers uniform described below.]]\nAs time went on, the individual drummers and fife players in each company would be organized at battalion level.  They retained their role in each company in battle, but would form one body of men at the head of a battalion on the march. It was necessary to appoint a Drum Major (the equivalent of a Sergeant Major, for the drummers) to be in charge of the drummers and to organize training in the emerging discipline of military drumming while a fife major was to be appointed to be the principal fifer and to train future fife players. The corps of drums would group together when not on duty with each company, and carry out various roles within the battalion, such as administering military justice and ensuring soldier's billets were secured, thus, the corps of drums became attached to the battalion HQ and was organized at battalion level, as opposed to individual company level.\n\n==Current Role==\n\nEventually, as the use of musical instrument on the battlefield diminished, corps of drums looked to fill specialist roles within the battalion while still retaining their original role for ceremonial purposes.\n\nSeveral different strings of logic have seen corps of drums employed in many varied roles. Because the corps would often be employed in support of the battalion, in areas such as delivering mail or designating billets, they are often given the role of assault pioneers, or supporting-fire (machine gun) platoons.\nThe corps of drums role on the battlefield was originally to signal orders, and therefore some units are organised into signals platoons, operating radios.\nCorps of drums were also deployed to march under the parley flag when officers of opposing met to discuss terms of surrender, etc. Therefore, some corps of drums perform a liaison role.\n\nHistorical duties such as uncasing [[Colours, standards and guidons|the colours]] on parade and various other privileges are continued in most units. Due to the specialist duties and ceremonial aspects of a drummers life, a corps of drums may be the unofficial custodian of regimental customs and traditions.\n\nCorps of drums are drawn from the whole battalion, and are attached to the battalion HQ. Above the [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] as its head, the corps is usually answerable to the battalion's [[adjutant]].\n\n==United Kingdom==\n[[File:Drummer Lee Rigby 1.jpg|thumbnail|upright|The late [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby]] was a Drummer in the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]]]\nThe [[British Army]] maintains a corps of drums in each infantry battalion except for [[Royal Regiment of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Irish]], and [[Rifleman|Rifle]] Regiments ([[The Rifles]] and the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]]) which have [[Pipe band|pipes and drums]] and Bugles respectively. Each battalion of a regiment will maintain a corps of drums which may be 'massed' together on certain occasions. All corps-of-drums soldiers are called {{Anchor|drummer}} drummers (shortened to 'Dmr') regardless of the instrument they play, similarly to use of the term \"sapper\" for soldiers of the [[Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/>\n\nUnlike army musicians who form bands and will usually be limited to auxiliary duties in wartime, drummers in a Corps of Drums are principally fully trained infantry soldiers, with recruitment coming after standard infantry training. A Corps of Drums will deploy with the rest of the battalion, and will often form specialist platoons such as [[assault pioneer]]s, supporting fire or [[force protection]].\n\nHistorically, the drum was used to convey orders during a battle, so the Corps of Drums has always been a fully integrated feature of an infantry battalion. Later on, when the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] was adopted to convey orders, drummers were given bugles in addition, but maintained their drums and flutes, except in rifles regiments where the lighter instrument was more conducive to the skirmishing form of warfare.\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Welsh guards drummers on the mall.jpg|thumbnail|Corps of Drums of the Welsh Guards, showing the fleur-de-lys lace on that body and sleeves of the tunic which features more extensively than that of line regiments.]]\nThe main instrument is the [[Snare drum|Side drum]]. These were originally of a rope-tension design with wide wooden hoops, a wooden shell and an animal-skin head. In the British Army, this model has been continuously upgraded, with the inclusion of snares, more modern metal rod-tension and plastic heads. The current British Army 97s-pattern side drum also has nylon hoops.\n\nThe side drum was increasingly decorated throughout the 19th century, until it bore the fully embellished [[regimental colour]]s of the battalion, including its [[battle honour]]s. As such a regiment's drums are often afforded respect.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nThe second instrument was originally the [[Fife (instrument)|fife]], replaced in the modern British Army by the [[Five-key flute|five key flute]]. A wide variety of flutes and pitches is used. The fife and later the flute have been favoured as a warlike instrument due to shrill pitch and thus the ability to be heard above the noise of battle. Many tunes such as [[The British Grenadiers]] are traditionally played by military flutes. Fifes and keyed flutes were typically pitched in B-flat, but the flute family eventually expanded to include a Piccolo in E-flat, a perfect fourth higher, and a flute pitched in F, a perfect fourth lower than the B-flat flute. There was also a \"B-flat Bass\" which was pitched an octave below the B-flat flute. Occasionally the B-flat flute is known as the \"Treble\" in order to avoid confusion with the B-flat bass flute. The development of this family of flutes facilitated the development of flute band part music which in many ways imitates the style of larger military bands.\n\nThe bugle replaced the drum mid-way through the 19th century as the most common means of communication on the battlefield. These duties were carried out by the battalion's corps of drums, whose drummers now each carry a bugle.\n\nAs the musical role of a corps of drums became more ceremonial in the 19th and 20th centuries, more instruments were added to make their output more musically complete. A modern corps of drums may thus have a range of percussion instruments such as a [[bass drum]], [[tenor drum]]s and [[cymbals]] in addition to the snare drum, flute and bugle.\n\n===Uniform===\n[[Image:DWR Colours, Erquinghem Lys, France (RLH) 2005-11-12.JPG|thumb|left|A corps of drums of the [[Duke of Wellington's regiment]] (since amalgamated into the [[Yorkshire Regiment]]), showing crown lace tunics, a leopard skin on the bass drummer, and rod-tension side drums with metal hoops.]]\nDrummers originally wore distinct uniforms so as to stand out on the battlefield. During the 18th century most British Army drummers were distinguished by wearing their regimental uniforms in \"reversed colours\" \u2013 thus an infantry regiment wearing [[Red coat (British Army)|red coat]]s with yellow [[facings]] would clothe its drummers in yellow coats with red facings. This practice tended to make drummers targets in battle and after 1812 was replaced by less conspicuous distinctions.<ref>page 71, \"Military Uniforms of Britain & the Empire\", Major R.M. Barnes, Sphere Books 1972</ref> These usually consisted of [[lace]], used liberally all over the standard uniform, in varying patterns. Many early patterns consisted of a \"Christmas-tree\" pattern in which the chest was covered in horizontal lace decreasing in width downwards, and chevrons of lace down each sleeve. The modern infantry pattern in the British Army is of \"crown-and-inch\" lace sewn over the seams down the sleeves, around the collar, and over the seams on the back of the tunic. The crown-and-inch lace itself is about {{convert|1/2|in}} thick with a repeating crown pattern. The [[Guards Division]]s drummers have the old-style \"Christmas-tree\" pattern, with [[fleurs-de-lis]] instead of crowns.\n\nWhilst corps of drums in the British Army often parade in [[Army Combat Uniform|combat uniforms]] and other forms of dress, they will usually parade in the [[full dress|full dress uniform]] as above, being one of a few formations which regularly wear full dress.\n\nIn some regiments, it has become custom for the percussion rank to wear leopard skins over their uniform. This has the dual purpose of protecting the uniform (cymbals have to be muffled against the chest, and therefore would leave vertical marks on a bare tunic) and protecting the instruments themselves (the bass drum can be scratched by uniform buttons). Modern \"leopard skins\" are made from synthetic fur. Other regiments opt for a simple leather or cloth apron.\n\nDrummers have traditionally been armed with \"drummers' swords\", a [[shortsword]] with a simple brass hilt bearing the [[Royal Cypher]]. The practice of wearing swords has been discontinued by some regiments, though many still do carry the swords, whilst some use an [[SA80]] [[bayonet]] as a modern alternative.\n\n===Honourable Artillery Company===\n[[File:HAC Corps of Drums at Wellington Barracks.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Corps of Drums]] of the Honourable Artillery Company at [[Wellington Barracks]].]]\nThe [[Honourable Artillery Company]] maintains a corps of drums, and as such is the only such sub-unit in an artillery unit in the British Army.<ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/units/10738.aspx<HAC Official Website>]</ref> Although the Honourable Artillery Company now fulfils an artillery role, historically it was an infantry regiment, with two battalions fighting during the Great War.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#History<HAC|wiki page, history>]]</ref> The last infantry battalion was disbanded in 1973, but the corps of drums remained. As the regiment still maintains the privilege granted to it by King William IV in 1830, that the H.A.C. should dress as the Grenadier Guards, except wearing silver where the Grenadiers wear gold, the corps of drums of the HAC dresses in a very similar fashion to that of the Grenadier Guards.<ref>[[Honourable Artillery Company#Dress<HAC|wiki page, dress>]]</ref> Just as in other corps of drums of the British Army, its personnel carry out a soldiering role as their main function.\n\nSince the HAC is the oldest unit in existence in the British Army, and as drummers were on the establishment of infantry units at the latest during the 16th century, it may be assumed that the corps of drums of the HAC is the oldest in the British Army, though it has not been in continuous existence.\n\nIn addition, the HAC's veteran unit, the [[Company of Pikemen and Musketeers]] maintains an early form of Corps of Drums known as the 'Musik'. In this capacity, more basic fifes and larger rope-tension drums are used and 17th century uniforms are worn in keeping with the rest of the Company.\n\n===Royal Logistic Corps===\n[[Image:rlc2013-0018.jpg|thumb|RLC Drums with Battle honours.]]\nThe [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC) also maintains a corps of drums in the form of several side drummers, drawn from soldiers who serve a short tour as drummers before returning to a field unit. This is not a conventional corps of drums, as it has no flautists, and comes under the command of regimental headquarters of the RLC, rather than forming a separate entity. It frequently plays with the Band of the RLC, but often performs in isolation. It is famed for its \"black light\" display. These drummers stem from the 12 drummers placed on [[the Royal Waggon Train]] (RWT) in 1803. There are reserve soldiers within the Corps of Drums of 157 Regiment RLC, based at Cardiff in Wales.\n\nAt the time of Waterloo, in the period of deployment to the Low Countries, the RWT introduced drums made of brass. These originated on the Indian sub-continent. The size {{convert|14|by|12|in|mm}}. They weighed {{convert|16|lb}}. They were faced in blue and carried the cypher of King George, with the title below. A few drums of the period survive today. The drumsticks were of Canadian maple, following the campaigns in North America during the Napoleonic era. The drums had drag ropes purchased from unit funds. Whilst drummers carried the bugle, the common instrument for the \"Waggoners\" was the [[fanfare trumpet]] on account of their cavalry traditions, and inclusion in the light cavalry. During that period the corps was then being divided between the foot soldiers, which used drums and fifes, and the mounted soldiers, with cavalry fanfare trumpets as signalling instruments. The drum sling was still that of the hook.\n\n===Royal Marines===\n[[File:USMC-10212009-M-3403K-011.jpg|thumbnail|Royal Marines Corps of Drums]]\n[[Royal Marines Band Service|Royal Marines Bands]] are led by 'buglers', who are trained on both the side drum and the bugle as well as the Herald Fanfare Trumpet (natural trumpet); this section of the band is referred to as \"the Corps of Drums\", which since 1903 is now situated at the front of the band. Whilst similar to Army corps of drums, these are members of the Royal Marines Band Service (RMBS), although they retain their own rank structure.  Members of the RMBS are primarily musicians; however, they also carry out secondary roles (e.g. medics, drivers, force protection etc.) when required to, like their Army counterparts.\n\nRM Buglers have a similar history to Army 'drummers' in that they were used to convey orders on a ship on drums and bugles, and would then mass onshore into corps of drums, though they were still expected to work as individual soldiers,<ref>[http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm Fact Sheet - The Drums of the RM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517130700/http://www.royalmarinesbands.co.uk/reference/FS_drums_hist.htm |date=17 May 2008 }}</ref> also known in slang by the Royal Navy as drummers.\n\nThese drummer-buglers trace themselves back to the raising of the Royal Marines in 1664 as a maritime foot regiment, with six drummers attached to its battalions.\n\n====History of Maritime Drummers====\nDrums were, in 1664, used for the raising of the [[Royal Marines| Duke of York's and Albany's Maritime Regiment of Foot]], the ''Admiral's Regiment''. The regiment's 1,200 personnel had six snare drummers per company, the ancestors of the corps of drums of the [[Royal Marines Band Service]]. The Holland Regiment soon came after them. They were later to be called ''The Buffs'', the ''Old Buffs'' and ''Howards's Buffs''.\n\nEach time a maritime regiment, or from 1672 onward, a marine regiment, is disbanded and a new one appears in its place, drummers come in, especially the young ones who liked playing drums and wanted to serve playing them. The 1702 formation of the marine and sea-service foot regiments saw the drummers' greatest action at Gibraltar, when they played the drums to support their regiments.\n\nThe [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] saw into action ten British marine regiments and an all-American marine regiment, all units whose drummers and fifers played alongside their units.\n\nEven though part of the [[British Army]] which in the 18th century was led by the War Office, the Board of Ordnance and the Commissariat, marines were naval units. Royal Navy officers were at one point part of the marines. Due to two laws that regulated them and other army and navy units, marine drummers faced a loyalty problem over what drum calls they would have to do, and for what branch and on what occasion they might be required to play drums for orders, commands, etc.\n\nIn 1755, the problem was solved. The Admiralty took over what was then called ''His Majesty's Marine Forces''.  Even though at first Royal Navy officers filled the officer ranks, with lieutenant-colonel being perceived as the highest relevant rank, in 1771 a promotion to colonel occurred for the first time in the H.M.M.F.\n\nAfter their formation, the H.M.M.F's drummers and fifers of the three marine divisions played alongside their fellow soldiers in various landings worldwide on behalf of the Royal Navy. They joined their units in the American War of Independence, and a drummer was at James Cook's service during his sea travels.\n\nAt Adm. John Jervis's insistence, by King George III's order in 1802, the H.M.M.F. was transformed into the ''H.M.M.F.-Royal Marines'', albeit larger than today's establishment. Two years later, bomb vessel crews and gunners became part of the newly created ''Royal Marine Artillery'', in which bugle calls became a regular part of life from then on.\n\nThe Royal Navy in the 19th century was short of manpower in both the H.M.M.F.-R.M. and the R.M.A. For this, Army units joined the H.M.M.F.-R.M. as replacement units, carrying not only their drummers and fifers but also buglers.\n\nIn 1855, during the units' service in the Crimean War, the H.M.M.F.-R.M's foot units became one under the unified title of ''Royal Marines Light Infantry'', later known as the ''Royal Marine Light Infantry''. From then, bugles replaced drums as signallers and order beaters, but the latter would be still useful for drill, being then called ''drummers and buglers'', and from 1867 the R.M.L.I./R.M.A. drummers were called ''buglers'' only, serving individually in ships and the R.N's shore establishments and artillery units and massed into corps of drums for their units on the ground. Fifes fully declined and disappeared in usage. By then, a bugler playing both the drum and his bugle both to sound orders and do drum calls was a common sight in the RMLI and RMA. By the 1890s, even buglers also trained in using herald trumpets or Fanfare trumpets became commonplace in RMLI and RMA bases and facilities.\nA 1902 incident changed the buglers forever. A Coronation Review at [[Aldershot]] was due soon, and the then Sr. Bandmaster of the RMLI, Lt. George Miller, asked his fellow bandmasters to get buglers for his band for the review. The next day at a church parade, he asked 30 RMLI buglers to front the RMLI Massed Bands. They then marched to his own arrangement of Onward Christian Soldiers. Everyone was shocked by this and were amazed that the formation that he used would become a RMLI and RMA military band standard formation setup, and the precision stick drills that he made became a permanent fixture in military events where either or both the RMLI and RMA's presence were needed. Soon later, when the RM began operating the Royal Naval School of Music the next year as a training venue for future bandsmen of the RN, RMLI and RMA, they brought this formation for Royal Navy bands as well, inspiring the formations used by modern military bands of some Commonwealth countries like Australia,  Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\n1923 would see the buglers of the R.M.L.I. and R.M.A. now belong to the ''Corps of Royal Marines'', the Royal Marines of today. Seeing action during the Second World War and in the growing crisis of the [[Cold War]] were the R.M.'s brave buglers of the new '''[[Royal Marines Band Service]]''', even through separate from the bands themselves. The R.M.A. and R.M.L.I. buglers' dress uniforms (dark blue trousers and tunic and red collars and trouser wells) became the full dress of the corps bands and buglers, with the addition of a Wolseley [[pith helmet]] as headdress, and yellow shoulder cords and slashed cuffs to indicate their long history, heritage and lineage from 1664.\n\nBy 1950, the R.N.S.o.M. became today's [[Royal Marines Band Service#Royal Marines School of Music|Royal Marines School of Music]], and the Royal Naval bands were dissolved. Beating retreats by both the Royal Marine bands and the R.M. Corps of Drums buglers would begin to occur annually, later triennially and as of today biannually, at [[Horse Guards Parade]], [[Portsmouth]] and other venues, playing for the entire Royal Navy and the Royal Marines. It would be only in 1978 that the R.M.B.S. would have buglers as well in its rosters. By the 1990s, however, only five R.M. corps of drums were left as the Deal Depot closed down in 1996, the Chatham band already dissolved in the 1940s, with three at the R.N. England bases in [[Portsmouth]], [[Plymouth]] and at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] till 2008 (The last is now assigned to {{HMS|Collingwood|establishment|6}}), one in the R.M.S.o.M. (then in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and now in Portsmouth since 1996) and another one in [[Scotland]] at HMS ''Caledonia''. By the 1950s, only the band carried the corps at the lead, as separate corps of drums, which played only bugles alongside the drums, were discontinued altogether (these were adopted in the 1880s when the RM began to transition from fifes to bugles).\n\nToday there are six R.M. Bands (plus the training company, R.M.S.o.M. Junior Musicians and Buglers) located around the UK, in Portsmouth (three in HMS Nelson, which includes the R.M.S.o.M.), Fareham (HMS Collingwood), Plymouth (HMS Raleigh), Lympstone (Commando Training Centre Royal Marines) and Scotland (HMS Caledonia) for a total of seven bands and attached corps of drums.  All members of the R.M.B.S. are trained at the Royal Marines School of Music (HMS Nelson). Buglers' training lasts two years. Basic military skills are taught during four months of initial military training and, if successful, trainee buglers are instructed on the bugle, drum and herald/fanfare trumpets. Musical skills are refined and supported with additional lessons in music theory and aural perception. Parade work forms a large part of the curriculum and considerable time is spent developing personal drill and bearing.\n\nToday's R.M. Corps of Drums contains approximately 60 buglers who carry out duties ranging from repatriation services (''Last Post'' and ''Reveille''), mess beatings (drum displays), beating retreat (marching displays) and concerts on behalf of the Royal Marines and the entire Royal Navy.\n\n====Instruments and leadership====\nLike the British Army, Military snare (side) drums (MSD) are the principal instrument of the corps of drums; however, another core instrument is the bugle. Bass drums are often used during parades and drum displays, while cymbals and single tenor drums are used during parades and ceremonies only. Herald Fanfare trumpets (natural trumpets) are also performed on such occasions where a bugle fanfare would be inappropriate for such. The corps is led by a drum major and a bugle major serves as the principal player for it.\n\n===The Drummer's Colour===\n\n[[File:Drummer's colour 2.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Corps of Drums|Drummer]] of the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] holds the Drummer's Colour.]]\n\nThe Drummer's Colour, also known as the Wilhelmsthal Colour, is a unique [[Military colours, standards and guidons|Colour]] held by 1st Battalion, [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]. A drummer, usually the youngest in the battalion, is detailed to carry it when it is on parade.<ref name=Handbook2019>{{cite web|url=https://thefusiliers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fusiliers-Regimental-Handbook-2019.pdf|title= Regimental Handbook 2019}}</ref>\n\n====History====\nAt the [[battle of Wilhemstahl]] in 1762,The [[5th Foot]] lead the centre column under the command of [[Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]. During this action, they captured the Colour of an opposing French regiment, and took a large number of prisoners.<ref name=www.britishempire.co.uk>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armyunits/britishinfantry/northumberlandcolour1910.htm|title=www.britishempire.co.uk}}</ref>\nAfter this date, the regiment carried a small green silk banner in addition to their usual stand of Colours to commemorate the one they captured. This was destroyed along with the Regimental Colour by a fire in the [[Mess| Officer's Mess]] in 1833. Despite Representations made to [[King William IV]] refused a request to replace the Drummer's Colour following the fire. However the regiment continued to parade a replacement, and was granted specific permission to do so by [[King George V]] in 1933.<ref name=Handbook2019>{{cite web|url=https://thefusiliers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fusiliers-Regimental-Handbook-2019.pdf|title= Regimental Handbook 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince then, a drummer has been entrusted with carrying the Colour. This is unique within [[infantry]] [[regiments]] of the [[British Army]], since colours are normally only entrusted to [[commissioned officers]], except when they are in the custody of sergeants to convey them to an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Messenger |first1=Charles |title=For Love of Regiment: A History of British Infantry, Volume One, 1660\u20131914 |date=1994 |publisher=Leo Cooper }}</ref> The Drummer's Colour will typically only be paraded on [[St. George's Day]], unlike the other colours of the regiment which are used more frequently. On this day, it is decorated with red and white roses, in keeping with regimental custom which sees all members of the regiment wear the roses in their headdress on this day. The drums of the Corps of Drums and the [[Drum Major|Drum Major's]] staff are also similarly decorated.\n\nWhen the [[Royal Northumberland Fusiliers]] were amalgamated with other regiments to form the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]] in 1968, the tradition of carrying the Drummer's Colour was maintained by the 2nd Battalion. When this battalion was in turn 'deleted' in 2014 as a result of the [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010]], the Drummer's Colour was passed to the 1st Battalion.\n\n[[File:Drummer's colour.jpg|thumb|A Sergeant Drummer ([[Drum major (military) |Drum Major]]) and Drummer of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] with the Drummer's Colour. The staff, Colour, and headdress of both are decorated with red and white roses for [[St. George's Day]].]]\n====Appearance and Charges====\nThe Drummer\u2019s Colour is of gosling green silk edged with gold. [[St. George and the Dragon]] are embroidered in the centre, with red scrolls edged with gold above and below. The motto of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]] \u2018Quo Fata Vocant\u2019(Go where divine providence leads) is displayed on the upper scroll, and the word \u2018Northumberland\u2019 is on the lower. Above the lower scroll is a large 'V' with 'Regt' below, both in gold, indicating that the Northumberland Fusiliers were the 5th Regiment of Foot at the time of the battle. A laurel wreath with red berries surrounds the central elements, and [[tudor rose]]s surmounted by crowns feature in the four corners.<ref name=handbook>{{cite web|url=http://www.regimentsdirect.co.uk/fusiliers/Content/BRS/Fusiliers%20Regimental%20Handbook.pdf|title=Regimental Handbook|publisher=Regiments Direct|accessdate=3 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===British civilian and cadet corps of drums===\nIn addition to Army and Navy/Royal Marines Corps of Drums, in the [[United Kingdom]] there are also [[Cadet#United Kingdom|cadet]]- civilian corps who base their music on the military traditions of the country.<ref name=\"CoDS-history\"/> The [[Army Cadet Force]] corps use the Army-style formations and instrumentation (flutes/bugles, snare, bass and tenor drums, cymbals and [[Glockenspiel]]s), save for those with Scottish and Irish links that have [[Pipe band]]s instead and those affiliated with the light infantry (especially the now only LI regiment [[The Rifles]]) have a corps of drums without the fifes while using only bugles. Those corps of the [[Combined Cadet Force]], [[Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps]] and the [[Sea Cadet Corps (United Kingdom)|Sea Cadet Corps]] use the RN/RM naval and ship-style corps (Snare drums/Bugles, Bass and Tenor drums, cymbals and glockenspiels) and are attached to the main band. This formation is also used by the military band of the [[Duke of York's Royal Military School]]. Another example of a military style CoD is that of the [[Royal British Legion]], whose bands are modeled on the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Band Service. The Royal Air Force however does not have any such ensembles, and only Corps of Drums under the [[Royal Air Force Air Cadets]] are active, with their formation being similar to those of the RN and RM.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police restarted a Corps of Drums in 2011, when the central youth engagement unit purchased some drums and sent cadets on a \"band camp\". Greenwich borough subsequently took a caretaker role of the drums and established a corps of drums. 2015 saw Kensington and Chelsea and Hillingdon Boroughs expanding and creating more branches. It is the first band in the Metropolitan Police to be composed of members of the Metropolitan Police since 1988. It is also the first band in the name of the Metropolitan Police since 1997, when the civilianised Metropolitan Police Band was disbanded.\n\nCivilian corps of drums are also formatted after their respective services, with corps patterned after those of the Army, Navy and the Royal Marines in instrumentation and marching style becoming commonplace. These are staffed by both veteran and retired military drummers as well as civilian drummers playing the fifes, bugles and percussion. In Northern Ireland, civilian corps are mounted by Loyalist groups, which for the most part use flutes with no bugles at all.\n\n==United States==\nA '''corps of drums''' or '''field music band''' in the United States is a type of [[military band]], which originated in European [[Army|armies]] in the 16th century. The main instruments of a corps of drums are the [[drum]] and the [[flute]] or [[Fife (instrument)|fife]] and [[bugle]]. Unlike 'full' [[Military band|military marching bands]], corps of drums usually exist within an [[infantry]] [[battalion]]. A [[Drum major (military)|drum major]] is the leader of a corps of drums, and in the past a fife major served as the principal fifer or flautist with a bugle major serving the same purpose for the buglers.\n\n[[Valley Forge Military Academy and College]] has a corps of drums that is part of the regimental band. Uniforms and music are modelled on the Royal Marines Corps of Drums. VFMAC does have a similar but separate formation which is part of the Corps of Cadets (VFMAC Field Music) which only uses drums (snares, tenors and basses), cymbals and bugles and from 2011, fifes. Formed in 1956, it also provides the official guard-of-honour for visitors to the Delaware Valley area.\n\nThe [[United States Army]] [[Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps]], raised in 1960 and part of the [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)]] of the [[United States Army]], formally revived this very part of American military music history and its mission is to relive it for coming generations. This is the only musical unit of the US armed forces in which its drum major, wearing a classic 18th century infantry cap and carrying a [[spontoon]], the honor badge and weapon of 18th century senior non-commissioned officers, salutes using the left hand. Musicians assigned to this unit wear 18th century military uniforms reminiscent of those used in the [[American Revolutionary War]] by the [[Continental Army]] drummers and fifers. Another corps of drums is found as part of the [[West Point Band]] - the West Point Hellcats, which wear regulation uniforms from the 1820s, and since 2016 play using bugles, fifes and traditional rope tension snare and bass drums.  Until the late 19th century the US Army and the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained similar ensembles before switching to bugles.\n\n=== Formation of field music/corps of drums in the US Armed Forces and civilian organizations === \nWhile only the Old Guard FDC is the only field music formation in the US Armed Forces and thus more similar to a European corps of drums, in the past there had been similar formations armed forces-wide. Should such units be reactivated again not just in the Armed Forces but also as civilian, veterans or youth cadet formations, the formation of the ensemble is as follows (the formation is to be expected to be led by a drum major):\n\n* Field snare drums\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Cymbals (optional)\n* Single tenor drums (optional)\n* Glockenspiels (optional)\n* Fifes\n* Piccolos, Flutes\n* Bugles in B and/or G Major\n* Chromatic fanfare Trumpets in B or G Major (optional)\n* Single-valve bugles (Only in the Old Guard FDC)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald Fanfare Bugles (optional)\n* Soprano and Baritone Herald fanfare trumpets (optional)\n* Soprano Bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* Flugelhorn Bugles\n* Mellophones\n* Baritone Bugles\n* Marching Baritones\n* Contrabass bugles\n\n==Germany==\nIn Germany, ''Spielmannszug'', ''Tambourkorps'' and  sometimes ''Trommlerkorps'' are the names given to the German corps of drums, whether it is a military formation or a civilian formation. The instrumentation of these are, commonly fifes and snare drums (just like the [[Bundeswehr]] corps of drums that are attached to the unit military bands), [[flute]]s and [[piccolo]]s, [[Glockenspiel]]s, Bass drums, cymbals and, on some corps, single and multiple tenor drums, and like their British counterparts, bugles (in several corps). [[Timpani]], [[vibraphone]]s and [[marimba]]s are used in concerts. Sometimes even a [[Turkish crescent]] is used to symbolize the band. Whatever the configuration, a drum major always leads the corps during military and civil parades and other events, and in modern corps even majorettes and pom pom dancers are a part of its roster.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong and are attached to the bands of the Bundeswehr [[Military bands of the Bundeswehr|Military Music Center]] under the Bundeswehr [[Streitkr\u00e4ftebasis]] while civilian corps are dedicated civil bands and youth bands assigned in cities and towns all over Germany.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1990, the [[National People's Army]] maintained corps of drums in the same manner as the Bundeswehr. During the Republic Day parades on 7 October in East Berlin from 1959 to 1989, the national corps included single tenor drums at the front.\n\n==Russia/CIS==\n[[File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e \u0414\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0417\u0412\u041e (5).jpg|thumb|Drummers of the [[Minsk Suvorov Military School]] on the avenue during a parade in 2017.]]\nRussian '''{{transl|ru|Barabanshchiki}}''' or drummers are names that are used to refer to Russian military corps of drums ({{lang|ru|\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432}}, {{transl|ru|rota barabanshchikom}}), a practice that is of Imperial origin in the field drummers that marched at the lead of their units in parades and that is a part of the traditions of almost all former Soviet republics (save for the Baltics and Georgia). Russian drum corps are usually made up of snare drummers with one line of [[flute]] or [[fife]] players in the middle and two [[glockenspiel]]s in the front (with the option for a third one or a [[Turkish crescent]], plus chromatic fanfare trumpeters, buglers and trumpeters). Military corps of drums are usually made separate from the massed military bands of the unit or command that it is a part of, and are led by a drum major who is a commissioned officer of minimum junior officer rank.\n\n[[File:Azerbaijan Armed Forces.jpg|thumb|An Azerbaijani corps of drums]]\n\nHistorically, the corps of drums is a military unit that is formally a part of the junior military high schools of these countries. Uniquely, the [[Azerbaijani Armed Forces]] follows the Turkish models by attaching a full bugle formation behind the corps of drums.\n\n===List of Post-Soviet units/institutions with corps of drums===\n*[[Moscow Military Music College]]\n*Kronstadt Sea Cadet Corps \n*Ussuriysk Suvorov Military School\n*Yekaterinburg Suvorov Military School\n*Vladivostok Nakhimov Naval School\n*Baltic Fleet Naval Training Center Sevastopol\n*[[Minsk Suvorov Military School]]\n*[[Ivan Bohun Military High School]]\n*[[Monte Melkonian Military College]]\n*[[Azerbaijan Higher Military Academy]]\n*[[Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School]]\n*[[Mastibek Tashmukhamedov Military Lyceum of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan]]\n*[[Military Institute of the Ministry of Defense of Turkmenistan]]\n*[[Military Music College of Mongolia]]\n*Georgi Atanasov Military Music School (until 2001<ref>https://m.dnevnik.bg/print/arhiv_pari/2001/08/01/1544686_zakrivat_uchilishte_zaradi_lipsa_na_pari/amp</ref>)\n\n== Sweden ==\nOnly the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]] King's Guard Battalion has a corps of drums organized as a platoon - the [[Svea Corps of Drums]] (''F\u00e4ltpipark\u00e5ren/Livgardets trumk\u00e5r'') which is part of the Life Guards Company. Until 2009 the Royal Swedish Army Drum Corps served as the official active field music unit of both the Army and the entire Armed Forces, and thus only the [[Home Guard (Sweden)|Home Guard Command]] maintains the practice with dedicated ensembles in several areas of the country.\n\n== Canada ==\nThe sole corps of drums that is active within the [[Canadian Army]] today is the Corps of Drums of [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]. Being a musical unit, it replaces the regimental band of the PPCLI, which was dissolved in 1994. Based on the British tradition for these units, it is modeled on the Corps of Drums of the [[Royal Logistics Corps]] of the [[British Army]]. The regimental drum corps is divided into three units which are assigned to different battalions in the PPCLI. These individual drum corps operate as small drum lines that serve during different ceremonies and events. Unlike their British and American counterparts, but more similar to the Corps of Drums of the RLC, the drum corps does not utilize [[flutes]] and bugles. An example of a historical corps of drums can be found through the [[Fort Henry Guard]] and the [[Fort York Guard]], both of which sport corps of drums that include [[fife]]s and are led by a Drum Major and a Drum Sergeant. Although it is not part of the Canadian Forces, it is designed to represent the units of the [[British Army]] in [[Upper Canada]]. During WWII, many regiments maintained small corps of drums that were stationed at all\nmajor bases. While most of them were staffed by active duty troops, others were staffed by volunteer bandsmen, consisting of reservists and professional civilian percussionists.<ref>http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520erum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], corps of drums have been historically attached to military bands at the front-rank following the precedent the [[Royal Marines Band Service|bands]] of the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Corps of Royal Marines]]. After the 1968 [[Unification of the Canadian Armed Forces]], corps of drums in both the RCN, were dismantled and abolished, although notably making a return in the mid-1980s within the naval reserve. In July 2013, a five-person corps of drums was unveiled for the first time by the [[Naden Band of Maritime Forces Pacific]] a [[Victoria Day]] Parade.<ref>http://www.lookoutnewspaper.com/corps-of-drums-return-to-band/</ref>\n\n==Netherlands and in Indonesia==\n''Drum bands'' are the Dutch and Indonesian terms for the corps of drums, but in the [[Netherlands]] they are also called as ''drumfanfares'', ''tamboerkorps'', ''trompetterkorps'' and ''klaroenkorps'' (''drum and lyre bands, [[fanfare band]]s and drum and brass bands'') and in [[Indonesia]] as ''marching bands'' and ''drum corps''.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the basic instrumentation is\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Multiple and single tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Flutes, Fifes\n* Bugles, Natural trumpets, [[fanfare trumpet]]s\n* Natural horns (few bands only)\n* Turkish crescent (optional)\n* [[Brass section]]/[[Marching brass]] (in few bands)\n\nMilitary drum bands in the [[armed forces of the Netherlands]] would have only two to four of these basic instruments.\n\nOptional or permanent instruments in these bands are flutes and piccolos, bugles, natural horns, valved bugles and brass instruments (soprano bugles and trumpets, cornets, horns, mellophones, baritones, sousaphones and contrabass bugles).\n\nThese bands are attached to the main marching band, similar to French bands, but also perform as stand alone bands. They are led by a drum major, and can have [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s and [[colour guard]]s, the latter now more separated from the band.\n\nIn the 1990s however these bands became paramilitary-styled and even adopted the traditions of British military bands of the Guards Division and the Royal Marines, but several of these bands chose the American marching band and drum and bugle corps practice. Some of these bands also adopted woodwind instruments turning them into full-time military marching bands, and almost all drum bands use English voice commands and not Dutch commands and only a few use whistle commands and the mace movements.\n\nIn Indonesia, the corps, a military musical heritage from Dutch colonial times, may be treated as military, civil or school marching and show bands, and in some cases as [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]], and are either attached to the main marching band or as stand-alone bands, with instrumentation drawn from the following:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* [[Melodica]]s (in school marching bands)\n* [[Fanfare trumpet]]s (chromatic and/or herald) (optional)\n* [[Bugle]]s (optional)\n* Flutes, piccolos (in the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]])\n* Fifes (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Clarinet]]s (in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[Trumpet]]s, [[cornet]]s and soprano bugles\n* Alto bugles\n* [[Flugelhorn]]s and flugel bugles\n* [[Trombone]]s (optional in the Indonesian National Armed Forces)\n* [[French horn|Horn]]s, [[mellophone]]s and horn bugles\n* Baritone bugles, [[baritone horn]]s and marching baritones\n* [[Wagner tuba]]s (optional)\n* [[Tuba]]s, [[euphonium]]s, [[saxhorn]]s (optional)\n* [[Contrabass bugle]]s, [[sousaphone]]s\n''If a civilian front ensemble is present'':\n* [[Marimba]]\n* [[Vibraphone]]\n* Xylophone\n* Suspended cymbals\n* Tubular bells\n* Gong\n* Drum kit\n* Timpani\n\nThey are led by from one to six [[Drum major (military)|drum major]]s and can have a separate director of music (in civil and police bands only), majorettes and [[color guard (flag spinning)|Colour guard]]s (optional). The drum majors in these bands have a unique use of the mace in order to coordinate the timing and precision of the band like US marching band drum majors do. The Indonesian corps also has dancing bass drummers either wearing uniforms or costumes (such is the case in the corps of drums of the various Indonesian uniformed organizations, most especially the armed forces and the national police), a unique feature of these corps and are attached to it and are also a nod to Indonesian cultural traditions, plus dancing contrabass buglers and baritone buglers in some bands. The brass instruments are pitched in C, F or B major unlike US military DBCs, most notably that of the [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]] that use G major brasses and civilian corps in the past, and so too are the glockenspiels being used and the flutes and clarinets.\n\nAnother unique characteristic is that in military and police corps of drums, tenor and bass drummers, baritone buglers (optionally) and contrabass buglers wear combat, duty or everyday uniform (and optionally costumes for the tenor drummers) instead of the full dress uniform while playing, whether in performance, field practice or rehearsals, unlike their British counterparts do. They wear [[beret]]s, [[ball cap]]s or [[side cap]]s as head-dress, unlike the rest of the band, who wear [[peaked cap]]s, especially the drum majors and in civil bands, the director of music, the color guards and the pit section during field performances. Bands of the Armed Forces academies tend to have their single tenor drummers wear their specialty uniform and colored berets of the selected service arm or branch, with those of the Navy wearing free diving gear and the Air Force flightsuits.\n\n=== Ancient style corps of drums in Indonesia ===\n\nThe practice was introduced to the Netherlands East Indies in the early 1800s, and today both the [[Yogyakarta Kraton Guards]] and the Royal Guard of [[Pakualaman]] each sport an ancient form of the corps, alongside a recently reconstituted formation from the Royal Guard of the [[Surakarta Sunanate]]. Alongside them, both the southern regencies of Central Java and Yogyakarta have dedicated civilian corps, each serving the ''bregodo rakyat'' (''people's brigade'') companies that conserve the traditions of the armed services of the former sultanates. These corps, when formed up in parade, are composed of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Fifes, flutes, [[suling]] flutes\n* Bugle/s\n* Trumpet/s (in some civil bands)\n* One to three [[Kendang]]s\n* Single tenor drum/s (in civil bands)\n* Cymbals\n* Bass drum (in civil bands and in Surakarta)\n* Gong/s\n\n==South America==\nInspired by the German (and sometimes French) style corps of drums, South American corps differ in instrumentation, size and leadership.\n\n===Chile===\nSimilar to the German corps, the Chilean corps of drums are both military and civil bands, the ''Bandas de Guerra'' (War Bands) that the Chileans call them formally.\n\nMilitary corps of drums belong to the Chilean Armed Forces' three services, the [[Carabineros de Chile]] and the [[Chilean Gendarmerie]] and differ in instrumentation and officers in charge (only in the Chilean Navy).\n\n*[[Chilean Army]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*[[Chilean Navy]]: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major)\n*[[Chilean Air Force]]: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Carabiners: Snare drums, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n*Chilean Gendarmerie: Snare drums, fifes, bugles (led by a drum major and a bugle major)\n\nThe military style corps also inherit the British corps' tradition of carrying drummers' swords attached to belts in all their dress uniforms.\n\nCivilian corps are usually school based bands with the addition of a percussion section (Snare drums, bass drums and cymbals) and glockenspiels and are either part of a school marching band or as a standalone band in itself. In these separate bands, a fife major leads the band's fifers/flautists while on duty, and also assist the drum major and the bugle major. These positions also exists on corps which are now part of school bands, as well as in a few volunteer community fire departments. These civil corps perform on occasions when requested and participate in competitions.\n\n===Ecuador===\nCorps of drums in Ecuador are both military and civil bands. These corps are very similar to the German corps, but with the addition of bugles and the single tenor drum.\n\nLike the Chilean corps, these bands have differences in configuration and instrumentation in the Ecuadorian armed forces. But the corps snare and tenor (sometimes bass) drummers often play on drums that are painted in the service or unit colours (sometimes in the colours of Guayaquil, which are blue and white for the corps of the [[Ecuadorian Navy]]) and in the case of the Military Academy \"Eloy Alfaro\" and the Air Force Academy \"Cosme Rendella\", have the unit/school insignia attached to the bugles' and fifes' tabards.\n\nThe typical Ecuadorian corps, called as the ''Peloton Comando'' (Commando Platoon) but are also called as the ''Banda de Guerra'' (War Band), just like in Chile in several schools and colleges (many bands now fall under the ''Banda Escolar'' or ''Banda de Paz'' title due to recent state reforms), is led by a drum major (in several cases there would be 1 to 4 drum majors) and is composed of:\n\n*Snare drums\n*Fifes (common only in the Ecuadorian Army and Ecuadorian Air Force and school bands)\n*Bugles and natural trumpets (common in all three services, principal instrument in the Ecuadorian Navy)\n*Single tenor drums\n*Bass drums (optional and common in some corps)\n*Cymbals (optional and in some corps)\n*Glockenspiels\n*Multiple tenor drums (only in school bands)\n\nEcuadorian Civil corps of drums are similar only to the Army and Air Force corps but are based as youth bands stationed in schools across the nation. Notable exceptions include the Corps of Drums of the Ecuadorian National Police. Like military corps, they are led by a drum major in all their activities but there are cases of multiple drum majors leading, from a minimum of two to a maximum of four or five. But in some corps, there are some majorettes and tambourine players. Those that are based on the Navy's corps of drums (especially [[Guayaquil]]-based corps) use the same instrumentation as its corps have.\n\n===Venezuela===\nSimilar to Germany and Colombia's, the Venezuelan corps of drums are both military and civil bands, and like Colombia's, Peru's and Ecuador's contain the same instrumentation of :\n\n*Snare drums\n*Bass drums\n*Cymbals\n*Single tenor drums\n*Glockenspiels\n*Bugles (and optionally trumpets)\n\nThe corps is led by a single drum major. In some corps, especially in civil-based ones, other brass instruments may be added into the bugle section.\n\nMilitary corps have tabards applied on the bass drums, snare drums, glockenspiels and bugles on every occasion that it is performing. One such formation is the Military Academy of Venezuela Corps of Drums. Recently there's an effort to build up full-time military marching bands in the national armed forces with the percussion of the corps combined with brass and woodwind instruments.\n\n===Bolivia===\nCorps of drums in Bolivia, both military and civil, are inspired by German and French band practices and are part of the main band. The instruments used by them are snare drums, tenor drums (single and multiple), bass drums, cymbals and sometime glockenspiels. Turkish crescents are used as standards and are paraded as part of them. In military corps attached to bands there would be one to two drum majors and in some cases standards or vertical banners are used to distinguish the corps when on parade. Civil corps attached to [[marching band]]s would have one to eight drum majors (in some cases ten) and would also have a military-styled colour guard marching with the Turkish crescents and optionally the standards.\n\n===Peru===\nPeruvian corps of drums are both military (''Banda de guerra'') and civil bands (''Banda ritmica''), with differences in instrumentation. In whatever combination, it's a main part of the main school or military marching band led by the Director of Music, with the drum major or majorette or standard bearer leading led by the conductor or as a separate band led by the drum major or standard bearer at the front of the ensemble. These follow the Spanish and French influence.\n\nCorps of drums in the [[Peruvian Armed Forces]] and the [[National Police of Peru]] (formerly the Civil Guard of Peru, Peruvian Investigations Police and Peruvian Republican Guard), plus school or college based bands and corps attached to them or as separate bands are composed of snare and or field drums, single tenor drums, multiple tenor drum (in school corps), bugles and glockenspiels in addition to the regular snare and bass drums and cymbals. [[Tambourine]]s are common within the school-based corps, with female [[majorette (dancer)|majorette]]s assisting the conductor or the school band drum major or music director. Tabards are applied only on the bugles and glockenspiels, as well as in the snare and tenor drums if applicable.\n\n===Colombia===\nColombian corps of drums ar similar to those of Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Venezuela but are different in leadership, being led by a minimum of 3-7 drum majors or majorettes, and are composed instrumentally of:\n\n* Snare drums\n* Field/precision snare drums\n* Bass drums\n* Single tenor drums\n* Multiple tenor drums (civil corps)\n* Cymbals\n* Glockenspiels\n* Bugles and trumpets\n* Natural trumpets (military corps only and in several civil corps)\n* [[Trombones]] (optional, only in select military corps)\n* [[Saxhorns]] (only in select military corps)\n* [[Bagpipes]] (in the corps of drums of the [[Colombian Naval Academy]] and the Basic School of the [[Colombian Naval Infantry]])\n* Tambourines (civil corps)\n* Conga drums (civil Corps)\n* Timbales (civil corps)\n* Cowbells (civil corps)\n* Suspended cymbals (civil corps)\n\nCivil corps would also have a separate conductor, occasionally standard bearers and [[colour guard]]s marching along.\n\nEven through separate from the main marching band, a part of the band itself or as a band of its own, they are both useful as military-based and civil-based marching bands. The drums are either covered with cloth tabards of the unit or band to which the corps belongs, or painted in various colours to suit its needs.  The bugles, trumpets and glockenspiels (and in military units and several civil bands, natural trumpets) are attached with small tabards with the military service, police, school or college insignia, name or emblem shown in them.\n\n== Central America ==\nKnown as ''Bandas de Guerra'' or ''banda tradicional'' in Spanish, the Corps of drums tradition is also active in the following Central American countries:\n\n* [[Guatemala]]\n* [[El Salvador]]\n* [[Honduras]]\n* [[Panama]]\n\nThe Guatemalan corps tradition is mostly active in school-based corps, which mirror drum and bugle corps of the US and Mexico.

Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called [[organic architecture]]. This philosophy was best exemplified by [[Fallingwater]] (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> As a founder of organic architecture, Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=777}}</ref> \n\nWright was the pioneer of what came to be called the [[Prairie School]] movement of architecture, and he also developed the concept of the [[Usonia]]n home in [[Broadacre City]], his unique vision for urban planning in the United States. In addition to his houses, Wright designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and  other structures. He often designed interior elements for these buildings, as well, including furniture and [[stained glass]]. Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the [[American Institute of Architects]] as \"the greatest American architect of all time.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed [[World Heritage Site]] as ''[[The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright]].''\n\nRaised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and then apprenticed in Chicago with noted architects [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]] and [[Louis Sullivan]].  He opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893, and developed an influential home and studio in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], in 1898. His colorful personal life made headlines: leaving his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin, and their children for [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] in 1909, the murders at [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin estate]] in 1914, his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel in 1923, and his relationship with [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]], who became his third wife in 1928.\n\n==Early years==\n===Ancestry===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born in the farming town of [[Richland Center, Wisconsin]]. Family records show that he was christened as \"Frank Lincoln Wright\" (possibly in honor of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) when born on June 8, 1867. Writer [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote that the family name \"Lloyd\" was used shortly thereafter,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-fhnSK26vMC&pg=PT12&dq=frank+lincoln+wright&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCweLMnuPmAhVMZc0KHahfDfUQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=frank%20lincoln%20wright&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Life|last=Huxtable|first=Ada Louise|date=2008-04-29|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4406-3173-3|language=en}}</ref> but biographer [[Meryle Secrest]] claims that Wright himself adopted \"Lloyd\" at 18, after his parents' divorce in 1884.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7ZB90XmTdcC&pg=PA79&dq=frank+lloyd+wright+name+change&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGhsftruPmAhVKXc0KHQdZD7QQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=frank%20lloyd%20wright%20name%20change&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-74414-8|language=en}}</ref> \n\nWright's father, William Cary Wright (1825\u20131904), was an orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister.<ref name=\":1\" />  He was also a published composer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kimber|first=Marian Wilson|date=2014|title=Various Artists.

Anna was a member of the well-known Lloyd Jones clan who had emigrated from [[Wales]] to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]. One of Anna's brothers was [[Jenkin Lloyd Jones]], an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Both of Wright's parents were strong-willed individuals with artistic interests that they passed on to him.\n\n===Childhood===\nAccording to Wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|page=58}}</ref> In 1870, the family moved to [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], where William ministered to a small congregation.\n\nIn 1876, Anna visited the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], where she saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]]. The blocks, known as [[Froebel Gifts]], were the foundation of his innovative [[kindergarten]] curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: \"For several years, I sat at the little kindergarten table-top\u2026 and played\u2026 with the cube, the sphere and the triangle\u2014these smooth wooden maple blocks\u2026 All are in my fingers to this day\u2026 \"<ref>Alofsin, Anthony (1993).

They settled in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], where William taught music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed Unitarian society. Although William was a distant parent, he shared his love of music, especially the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with his children.\n\nSoon after Wright turned 14, his parents separated. In 1884 William sued for a divorce from Anna on the grounds of \"\u2026 emotional cruelty and physical violence and spousal abandonment.\"<ref> Hendrickson, Paul, ''Plagued By Fire'', Alfred A Knopf, New York, 2019, p. 399</ref> William left Wisconsin after the divorce was granted in 1885.

University of Wisconsin-Madison.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n===Silsbee and other early work experience (1887\u20131888)===\nIn 1887, Wright arrived in Chicago in search of employment. As a result of the devastating [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]] and a population boom, new development was plentiful. Wright later recalled that while his first impressions of Chicago were that of grimy neighborhoods, crowded streets, and disappointing architecture, he was determined to find work. Within days, and after interviews with several prominent firms, he was hired as a [[Drafter|draftsman]] with the architectural firm of Joseph Lyman Silsbee.<ref name=Wright /> Wright previously collaborated with Silsbee\u2014accredited as the draftsman and the construction supervisor\u2014on the 1886 [[Unity Chapel]] for Wright's family in Spring Green.<ref name=FLWF /> While with the firm, he also worked on two other family projects: All Souls Church in Chicago for his uncle, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, and the [[Hillside Home School I]] in Spring Green for two of his aunts.<ref name=OGorman /> Other draftsmen who worked for Silsbee in 1887 included future architects Cecil Corwin, [[George W. Maher]], and [[George Grant Elmslie|George G. Elmslie]]. Wright soon befriended Corwin, with whom he lived until he found a permanent home.\n\nFeeling that he was underpaid for the quality of his work for Silsbee (at $8 a week), the young draftsman quit and found work as a [[Architectural designer|designer]] at the firm of Beers, Clay, and Dutton. However, Wright soon realized that he was not ready to handle building design by himself; he left his new job to return to Joseph Silsbee\u2014this time with a raise in salary.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=69}}</ref> Although Silsbee adhered mainly to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] architecture, Wright found his work to be more \"gracefully picturesque\" than the other \"brutalities\" of the period.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=66}}</ref> Wright aspired for more progressive work.\n\n===Adler & Sullivan (1888\u20131893)===\n\nWright learned that the Chicago firm of [[Adler & Sullivan]] was \"looking for someone to make the finished  drawings for the interior of the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=83}}</ref> Wright demonstrated that he was a competent impressionist of Louis Sullivan's ornamental designs and two short interviews later, was an official [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] in the firm.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=86}}</ref> Wright did not get along well with Sullivan's other draftsmen; he wrote that several violent altercations occurred between them during the first years of his apprenticeship. For that matter, Sullivan showed very little respect for his own employees, as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=89\u201394}}</ref> In spite of this, \"Sullivan took [Wright] under his wing and gave him great design responsibility.\" As an act of respect, Wright would later refer to Sullivan as ''Lieber Meister'' (German for \"Dear Master\").<ref name=Tafel /> He also formed a bond with office foreman Paul Mueller. Wright later engaged Mueller in the construction of several of his public and commercial buildings between 1903 and 1923.<ref name=Saint />\n\n[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio (west side zoom).JPG|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] (1889)]]\n\nOn June 1, 1889, Wright married his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin (1871\u20131959). The two had met around a year earlier during activities at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: \"Mr. Sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?\"<ref name=\"Wright 2005, p. 97\">{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=97}}</ref> With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]. The existing [[Gothic Revival]] house was given to his mother, while a compact [[shingle style]] house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.<ref name=Weil />\n\nBy 1890, Wright had an office next to Sullivan's that he shared with friend and draftsman [[George Elmslie]], who had been hired by Sullivan at Wright's request.<ref name=Saint/><ref name=Gebhard /> Wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office. As a general rule, the firm of Adler & Sullivan did not design or build houses, but would oblige when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects. Wright was occupied by the firm's major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio. He later claimed total responsibility for the design of these houses, but a careful inspection of their architectural style (and accounts from historian Robert Twombly) suggests that Sullivan dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; Wright's design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from Sullivan's sketches.<ref name=Gebhard/> During this time, Wright worked on [[Louis Sullivan Bungalow|Sullivan's bungalow]] (1890) and the James A. Charnley bungalow (1890) in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], the Berry-MacHarg House, [[James A. Charnley House]] (both 1891), and the Louis Sullivan House (1892), all in Chicago.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=100}}</ref><ref name=Lind />\n\n[[File:Oak Park Il Walter Gale House4.jpg|thumb|The [[Walter Gale House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1893). While a [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] in style, it features window bands and a cantilevered porch roof which hint at Wright's developing aesthetics]]\n\nDespite Sullivan's loan and overtime salary, Wright was constantly short on funds. Wright admitted that his poor finances were likely due to his expensive tastes in wardrobe and vehicles, and the extra luxuries he designed into his house. To supplement his income and repay his debts, Wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses. These \"bootlegged\" houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles. Nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional [[cantilever]]s, and open floor plans, which would become hallmarks of his later work. Eight of these early houses remain today, including the [[Thomas H. Gale House|Thomas Gale]], [[Robert P. Parker House|Robert Parker]], George Blossom, and [[Walter Gale House|Walter Gale]] houses.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=38\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAs with the residential projects for Adler & Sullivan, he designed his bootleg houses on his own time. Sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a Frank Lloyd Wright design. This particular house, built for Allison Harlan, was only blocks away from Sullivan's townhouse in the Chicago community of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]]. Aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony [[tracery]] in the same style as the Charnley House likely gave away Wright's involvement. Since Wright's five-year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from Sullivan's firm.<ref name=Lind/> Several stories recount the break in the relationship between Sullivan and Wright; even Wright later told two different versions of the occurrence. In ''An Autobiography'', Wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract. When Sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue Wright the [[deed]] to his Oak Park house until after he completed his five years. Wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust. He \"threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the Adler & Sullivan office never to return.\" Dankmar Adler, who was more sympathetic to Wright's actions, later sent him the deed.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=101}}</ref> However, Wright told his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] apprentices (as recorded by Edgar Tafel) that Sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the Harlan House. Tafel also recounted that Wright had Cecil Corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that Wright was aware of their illegal nature.<ref name=Lind/><ref>{{harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=41}}</ref> Regardless of the correct series of events, Wright and Sullivan did not meet or speak for 12 years.\n\n===Transition and experimentation (1893\u20131900)===\nAfter leaving Louis Sullivan's firm, Wright established his own practice on the top floor of the Sullivan-designed [[Schiller Building]] on [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] in Chicago. Wright chose to locate his office in the building because the tower location reminded him of the office of Adler & Sullivan. Although Cecil Corwin followed Wright and set up his architecture practice in the same office, the two worked independently and did not consider themselves partners.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Wright moved out of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly completed [[Steinway Hall (Chicago)|Steinway Hall]] building. The loft space was shared with Robert C. Spencer, Jr., [[Myron Hunt]], and [[Dwight H. Perkins (architect)|Dwight H. Perkins]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=119}}</ref> These young architects, inspired by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what  became known as the Prairie School.<ref name=Brooks /> They were joined by Perkins' apprentice, [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his [[Architectural drawing#Presentation drawings|presentation drawings]] and watercolor [[Architectural rendering|renderings]]. Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois and one of the first licensed female architects in the U.S., also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses. Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall.<ref name=Cassidy /><ref name=MIT />\n\n[[File:William H. Winslow House Front Facade.jpg|thumb|[[William H. Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]] (1893)]]\n\nWright's projects during this period followed two basic models. His first independent commission, the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]], combined Sullivanesque ornamentation with the emphasis on simple geometry and horizontal lines. The Francis Apartments (1895, demolished 1971), [[Heller House]] (1896), [[Rollin Furbeck House]] (1897) and Husser House (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. For his more conservative clients, Wright designed more traditional dwellings. These included the [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] style Bagley House (1894), [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style [[Nathan G. Moore House|Moore House I]] (1895), and [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] style [[Charles E. Roberts]] House (1896).<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=56\u2013109}}</ref> While Wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan-inspired details.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nathan G. Moore house (1895), Oak Park, IL, rear.JPG|thumb|[[Nathan G. Moore House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1895)]]\n\nSoon after the completion of the Winslow House in 1894, Edward Waller, a friend and former client, invited Wright to meet Chicago architect and planner [[Daniel Burnham]]. Burnham had been impressed by the Winslow House and other examples of Wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts|\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and two years in Rome. To top it off, Wright would have a position in Burnham's firm upon his return. In spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, Wright declined the offer. Burnham, who had directed the classical design of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] and was a major proponent of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]], thought that Wright was making a foolish mistake. Yet for Wright, the classical education of the \u00c9cole lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern American architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=114\u2013116}}</ref><ref name=Goldberger />\n\n[[File:Frank LLoyd Wright Studio Chicago Frontage.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's studio]] viewed from [[Chicago Avenue]] (1898)]]\n\nWright relocated his practice to his home in 1898  to bring his work and family lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|studio addition]] to the north of the main house. The space, which included a hanging [[balcony]] within the two-story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio embodied Wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which his next 10 years of architectural creations would emerge.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust 2001, pp. 6\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Prairie style houses (1900\u20131914)===\nBy 1901, Wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in Oak Park. As his son John Lloyd Wright wrote: <blockquote> \"[[William Eugene Drummond]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Walter Burley Griffin]], [[Albert Chase McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], [[Isabel Roberts]], and [[George Willis (architect)|George Willis]] were the draftsmen. Five men, two women. They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn't have enough hair. They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them! I know that each one of them was then making valuable contributions to the pioneering of the modern American architecture for which my father gets the full glory, headaches, and recognition today!\"<ref>''My Father: Frank Lloyd Wright,'' by John Lloyd Wright; 1992; page 35</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Arthur Heurtley House (1902), Oak Park, IL.JPG|thumb|[[Arthur Heurtley House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1902)]]\n[[File:Darwin D.

Martin House]], [[Buffalo, New York]] (1904)]]\n[[File:Taliesin600.jpg|thumb|Hillside Home School, [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]], Spring Green, Wisconsin (1902)]]\n\nBetween 1900 and 1901, Frank Lloyd Wright completed four houses which have since been identified as the onset of the \"[[Prairie style]]\". Two, the [[Warren Hickox House|Hickox]] and [[B. Harley Bradley House|Bradley Houses]], were the last transitional step between Wright's early designs and the Prairie creations.<ref name=Clayton /> Meanwhile, the [[Frank Thomas House|Thomas House]] and [[Willits House]] received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style.<ref name=Sommer /><ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|p=134}}</ref> At the same time, Wright gave his new ideas for the American house widespread awareness through two publications in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The articles were in response to an invitation from the president of [[Curtis Publishing Company]], [[Edward Bok]], as part of a project to improve modern house design. \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" and \"A Small House with Lots of Room in it\" appeared respectively in the February and July 1901 issues of the journal. Although neither of the affordable house plans was ever constructed, Wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years.<ref name=Clayton/> Wright came to Buffalo and designed homes for three of the company's executives, including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]] in 1904. Other Wright houses considered to be masterpieces of the Prairie Style are the Frederick [[Robie House]] in Chicago and the Avery and Queene [[Coonley House]] in [[Riverside, Illinois]]. The Robie House, with its soaring, [[cantilever]]ed roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34-m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. Its living and dining areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. With this and other buildings, included in the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]] (1910), Wright's work became known to European architects and had a profound influence on them after World War I. It is sometimes called the \"cornerstone of modernism\".\n\nWright's residential designs of this era were known as \"prairie houses\" because the designs complemented the land around Chicago.  Prairie-style houses often have a combination of these features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad, overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials\u2014especially stone and wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquehome.org/Architectural-Style/prairie.htm|title=Prairie School Architecture|website=www.antiquehome.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 1909, Wright had begun to reject the upper-middle-class Prairie Style [[single-family house]] model, shifting his focus to a more democratic architecture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Storrer |first1=William Allin |title=The architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright : a complete catalog |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0226776200 |page=xvii |edition=Updated 3rd }}</ref> Wright went to Europe in 1909 with a portfolio of his work and presented it to Berlin publisher [[Ernst Wasmuth]].<ref>Secrest, p. 202</ref>  ''Studies and Executed Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright'', published in 1911, was the first major exposure of Wright's work in Europe.

Wright later said that Unity Temple was the edifice in which he ceased to be an architect of structure, and became an architect of space. [[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wright in 1926]]\n\nOther early notable public buildings included the [[Larkin Administration Building]] (1905) as well as the Geneva Inn ([[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]], 1911), the [[Midway Gardens]] (Chicago, Illinois, 1913), the [[Banff National Park Pavilion]] ([[Alberta]], Canada, 1914), and the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (Tokyo, 1922).\n\n===Textile concrete block system===\nIn the early 1920s, Wright designed a \"[[Textile block house|textile]]\" concrete block system.

As he explained in ''The Natural House'' (1954), \"The original blocks are made on the site by ramming concrete into wood or metal wrap-around forms, with one outside face (which may be pattered), and one rear or inside face, generally coffered, for lightness.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Midlife problems==\n\n===Family abandonment{{anchor | Europe and personal troubles}}===\n[[File:Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of Taliesin, Spring Green, Wisconsin]]\nIn 1903, while Wright was designing a house for Edwin Cheney (a neighbor in Oak Park), he became enamored with Cheney's wife, Mamah. [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist, and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. Their relationship became the talk of the town; they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. In 1909, Wright and Mamah Cheney met up in Europe, leaving their spouses and children behind. Wright remained in Europe for almost a year, first in [[Florence, Italy]] (where he lived with his eldest son Lloyd) and, later, in [[Fiesole, Italy]], where he lived with Mamah. During this time, Edwin Cheney granted Mamah a divorce, though Kitty still refused to grant one to her husband. After Wright returned to the United States in October 1910, he persuaded his mother to buy land for him in Spring Green, Wisconsin. The land, bought on April 10, 1911, was adjacent to land held by his mother's family, the Lloyd-Joneses. Wright began to build himself a new home, which he called {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]}}, by May 1911. The recurring theme of {{lang|cy|Taliesin}} also came from his mother's side: {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin]]}} in [[Welsh mythology]] was a poet, magician, and priest. The family motto, \"''{{lang|cy|Y Gwir yn Erbyn y Byd}}''\" (\"The Truth Against the World\"), was taken from the Welsh poet {{lang|cy|[[Iolo Morganwg]]}}, who also had a son named Taliesin. The motto is still used today as the cry of the druids and chief bard of the {{lang|cy|[[Eisteddfod]]}} in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228212826/http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 28, 2005 |title=Home Country |publisher=Unitychapel.org |date=July 1, 2005 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Catastrophe at Taliesin studio===\nOn August 15, 1914, while Wright was working in Chicago, Julian Carlton, a male servant who had been hired several months earlier, set fire to the living quarters of Taliesin and murdered seven people with an axe as the fire burned.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /><ref>https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/famous-murders/taliesin-massacre-frank-lloyd-wright/</ref> The dead included Mamah; her two children, John and Martha Cheney; a gardener (David Lindblom); a draftsman (Emil Brodelle); a workman (Thomas Brunker); and another workman's son (Ernest Weston). Two people survived the mayhem, one of whom, William Weston, helped to put out the fire that almost completely consumed the residential wing of the house. Carlton swallowed [[hydrochloric acid]] immediately following the attack in an attempt to [[suicide|kill himself]].<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> He was nearly [[Lynching|lynched]] on the spot, but was taken to the [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]] jail.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> Carlton died from [[starvation]] seven weeks after the attack, despite medical attention.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" />\n\n===Divorce and further troubles===\nIn 1922, Kitty Wright finally granted Wright a divorce. Under the terms of the divorce, Wright was required to wait one year before he could marry his then-mistress, Maude \"Miriam\" Noel. In 1923, Wright's mother, Anna (Lloyd Jones) Wright, died. Wright wed Miriam Noel in November 1923, but her addiction to [[morphine]] led to the failure of the marriage in less than one year. In 1924, after the separation, but while still married, Wright met [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]] at a Petrograd Ballet performance in Chicago. They moved in together at Taliesin in 1925, and soon Olgivanna was pregnant with their daughter, Iovanna, born on December 2, 1925.\n\nOn April 20, 1925, another fire destroyed the bungalow at Taliesin. Crossed wires from a newly installed telephone system were deemed to be responsible for the blaze, which destroyed a collection of Japanese prints that Wright estimated to be worth $250,000 to $500,000.<ref>Secrest, p. 315\u2013317.</ref> Wright rebuilt the living quarters, naming the home \"Taliesin III\".\n\nIn 1926, Olga's ex-husband, Vlademar Hinzenburg, sought custody of his daughter, Svetlana. In October 1926, Wright and Olgivanna were accused of violating the [[Mann Act]] and arrested in [[Tonka Bay, Minnesota]].<ref>Minnesota Historical Society, Collections Up Close, \"[http://discussions.mnhs.org/collections/2011/01/frank-lloyd-wright-arrested-in-minnesota/ Frank Lloyd Wright Arrested in Minnesota]\"</ref> The charges were later dropped.\n\nWright and Miriam Noel's divorce was finalized in 1927.

He proposed the idea in his book ''The Disappearing City'' in 1932, and unveiled a {{convert|12|ft2|m2|adj=on}} model of this community of the future, showing it in several venues in the following years. Concurrent with the development of Broadacre City, also referred to as Usonia, Wright conceived a new type of dwelling that came to be known as the [[Usonia]]n House. Although an early version of the form can be seen in the [[Malcolm Willey House]] (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House]] (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including walls composed of a \"sandwich\" of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper\u2014a significant change from typically framed walls.<ref>Twombly, p.242</ref> Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.\n\nUsonian houses were Wright's response to the transformation of domestic life that occurred in the early 20th century when servants had become less prominent or completely absent from most American households. By developing homes with progressively more open plans, Wright allotted the woman of the house a 'workspace', as he often called the kitchen, where she could keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room.<ref>Twombly, p.257</ref> As in the Prairie Houses, Usonian living areas had a fireplace as a point of focus. Bedrooms, typically isolated and relatively small, encouraged the family to gather in the main living areas. The conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the Prairie ideal. The built-in furnishings related to the Arts and Crafts movement's principles which influenced Wright's early work. Spatially and in terms of their construction, the Usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a Wright-designed house at relatively low cost. His Usonian homes set a new style for suburban design that influenced countless postwar developers.<ref>Twombly, p.244</ref> Many features of modern American homes date back to Wright: open plans, slab-on-grade foundations, and simplified construction techniques that allowed more mechanization and efficiency in building.\n\n===Significant later works===\n[[File:Guggenheim museum exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York City (1959)]]\n\n[[File:Wrightfallingwater.jpg|thumb|[[Fallingwater]], [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]] (1937)]] ''[[Fallingwater]]'', one of Wright's most famous private residences (completed 1937), was built for Mr. and Mrs. [[Edgar J. Kaufmann|Edgar J. Kaufmann, Sr.]], at [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]]. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was designed according to Wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. The house was intended to be more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using [[limestone]] for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright's most expensive pieces.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> Kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. In March 2002, [[post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioning]] of the lowest terrace was completed.\n\n[[Taliesin West]], Wright's winter home and studio complex in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], was a laboratory for Wright from 1937 to his death in 1959. Now the home of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and archives, it continues today as the site of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture.\nWright turned 80 shortly after World War II ended, yet remained busy. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City occupied Wright for 16&nbsp;years (1943\u20131959)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/about/frank-lloyd-wright-building|title=The Frank Lloyd Wright Building|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. The building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on [[Fifth Avenue]]; its interior is similar to the inside of a [[seashell]]. Its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience Guggenheim's collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an elevator to the top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. However, when the museum was completed, a number of details of Wright's design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white.\n\n[[File:Price tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] (1956)]]\nThe only realized skyscraper designed by Wright is the [[Price Tower]], a 19-story tower in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]]. It is also one of the two existing vertically oriented Wright structures (the other is the [[S.C. Johnson Wax Research Tower]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]]). The Price Tower was commissioned by Harold C. Price of the H. C. Price Company, a local [[oil pipeline]] and chemical firm. On March 29, 2007, Price Tower was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]], one of only 20 such properties in Oklahoma.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20070413.HTM National Park Service] \u2014 ''National Historic Landmarks Designated'', April 13, 2007</ref>\n\n[[Monona Terrace]], originally designed in 1937 as municipal offices for Madison, Wisconsin, was completed in 1997 on the original site, using a variation of Wright's final design for the exterior, with the interior design altered by its new purpose as a convention center. The \"as-built\" design was carried out by Wright's apprentice Tony Puttnam. Monona Terrace was accompanied by controversy throughout the 60 years between the original design and the completion of the structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|title=Monona Terrace Convention Center, history web page|accessdate=May 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215652/http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Florida Southern College]], located in [[Lakeland, Florida]], constructed 12 (out of 18 planned) Frank Lloyd Wright buildings between 1941 and 1958 as part of the [[Child of the Sun]] project.

He made innovative use of new building materials such as [[precast concrete]] blocks, glass bricks, and zinc [[came]]s (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used [[Pyrex]] glass tubing as a major element in the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]]. Wright was also one of the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting). In 1897, Wright received a patent for \"Prism Glass Tiles\" that were used in storefronts to direct light toward the interior.<ref>http://www.dailyartdaily.com/prismatic-tiles-frank-lloyd-wright-glass/</ref> Wright fully embraced glass in his designs and found that it fit well into his philosophy of organic architecture. According to Wright's organic theory, all components of the building should appear unified, as though they belong together. Nothing should be attached to it without considering the effect on the whole. To unify the house to its site, Wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors.<ref name=\"TMCnet\">{{cite web|author=Lync Voice UC Industry News|title=The Textile Block System [Concrete International]|url=http://www.lyncvoiceuc.com/news/2012/04/14/6258593.htm|publisher=TMCnet|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright. \"In the Cause of Architecture, VI: The Meaning of Materials\u2014Glass\". ''The Architectural Record'', 64(July 1928), 10-16.</ref> One of Wright's earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls. By using this large amount of glass, Wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls. Arguably, Wright's best-known art glass is that of the Prairie style. The simple geometric shapes that yield to very ornate and intricate windows represent some of the most integral ornamentation of his career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lind|first=Carla|title=Frank Lloyd Wright's glass designs|date=1995|publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780876544686|pages=57}}</ref>\n\nWright also designed some of his own clothing. His fashion sense was unique and he usually wore expensive suits, flowing neckties, and capes. He had a fascination with automobiles, purchasing his first car in 1909, a Stoddard-Dayton roadster, and owned many exotic vehicles over the years. During the cash-strapped Depression, Wright drove cheaper vehicles. Some of his last cars in the 1950s included four Volkswagens and a Chevrolet Nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a Jaguar Mark VII. He owned some 50 cars between 1909 and his death, of which 10 are known to survive.\n\n===Influences and collaborations===\n[[File:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb|Wright-designed window in [[Robie House]], Chicago (1906)]]\nWright strongly believed in individualism and did not affiliate with the [[American Institute of Architects]] during his career, going so far as to call the organization \"a harbor of refuge for the incompetent,\" and \"a form of refined gangsterism.\" When an associate referred to him as \"an old amateur\" Wright confirmed, \"I am the oldest.\"<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite web|title=Biography in Sound: Frank Lloyd Wright|url=https://archive.org/details/Biography_in_Sound|work=Old Time Radio|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Wright rarely credited any influences on his designs, but most architects, historians and scholars agree he had five major influences:\n# [[Louis Sullivan]], whom he considered to be his ''Lieber Meister'' (dear master)\n# Nature, particularly shapes/forms and colors/patterns of plant life\n# Music (his favorite composer was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]])\n# Japanese art, prints and buildings\n# [[Froebel Gifts]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Jeanne S.|date=March 1, 1989|title=The Froebel-Wright Kindergarten Connection: A New Perspective|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=48|issue=1|pages=24\u201337|doi=10.2307/990404|issn=0037-9808|jstor=990404}}</ref>\n\nHe also routinely claimed the work of architects and architectural designers who were his employees as his own designs, and also claimed that the rest of the Prairie School architects were merely his followers, imitators, and subordinates.<ref>Griffin, Marion Mahony, ''The Magic of America'', typescript, 1947</ref> As with any architect, though, Wright worked in a collaborative process and drew his ideas from the work of others. In his earlier days, Wright worked with some of the top architects of the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]], including Sullivan. In his Prairie School days, Wright's office was populated by many talented architects, including [[William Eugene Drummond]], [[John Van Bergen]], [[Isabel Roberts]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Albert Chase McArthur|Albert McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin]], and [[Walter Burley Griffin]].\n\nThe Czech-born architect [[Antonin Raymond]], recognized as the father of modern architecture in Japan, worked for Wright at Taliesin and led the construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. He subsequently stayed in Japan and opened his own practice. [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolf Schindler]] also worked for Wright on the Imperial Hotel. His own work is often credited as influencing Wright's Usonian houses. Schindler's friend [[Richard Neutra]] also worked briefly for Wright and became an internationally successful architect.\n\nLater, in the [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] days, Wright employed many architects and artists who later become notable, such as [[Aaron Green (architect)|Aaron Green]], [[John Lautner]], [[E. Fay Jones]], [[Henry Klumb]], [[William Bernoudy]], and [[Paolo Soleri]].\n\n\n\n                 lilPennis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more ambitious designs of entire communities were exemplified by his entry into the City Club of Chicago Land Development Competition in 1913. The contest was for the development of a suburban quarter section. This design expanded on the Quadruple Block Plan and included several social levels. The design shows the placement of the upscale homes in the most desirable areas and the [[blue collar]] homes and apartments separated by parks and common spaces. The design also included all the amenities of a small city: schools, museums, markets, etc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Undoing the City: Frank Lloyd Wright's Planned Communities|journal=American Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|date=October 1972|page=544}}</ref> This view of decentralization was later reinforced by theoretical [[Broadacre City]] design.

He received a Gold Medal award from The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]  in 1941. The [[American Institute of Architects]] awarded him the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1949. That medal was a symbolic \"burying the hatchet\" between Wright and the AIA. In a radio interview, he commented, \"Well, the AIA I never joined, and they know why. When they gave me the gold medal in Houston, I told them frankly why. Feeling that the architecture profession is all that's the matter with architecture, why should I join them?\"<ref name=\"archive\" /> He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] in 1953. He received honorary degrees from several universities (including his ''alma mater'', the University of Wisconsin), and several nations named him as an honorary board member to their national academies of art and/or architecture. In 2000, Fallingwater was named \"The Building of the 20th century\" in an unscientific \"Top-Ten\" poll taken by members attending the AIA annual convention in Philadelphia. On that list, Wright was listed along with many of the USA's other greatest architects including [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]; he was the only architect who had more than one building on the list. The other three buildings were the Guggenheim Museum, the Frederick C.

The work has since received numerous revivals, including a June 2013 revival at Fallingwater, in Bull Run, Pennsylvania, by Opera Theater of Pittsburgh. In 2000, ''[[Work Song: Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright]]'', a play based on the relationship between the personal and working aspects of Wright's life, debuted at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]].\n\nIn 1966, the [[United States Postal Service]] honored Wright with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 2\u00a2 postage stamp.\n\n\"[[So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright]]\" is a song written by [[Paul Simon]].

Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called [[organic architecture]]. This philosophy was best exemplified by [[Fallingwater]] (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> As a founder of organic architecture, Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing three generations of architects worldwide through his works.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=777}}</ref> \n\nWright was the pioneer of what came to be called the [[Prairie School]] movement of architecture, and he also developed the concept of the [[Usonia]]n home in [[Broadacre City]], his unique vision for urban planning in the United States. In addition to his houses, Wright designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and  other structures. He often designed interior elements for these buildings, as well, including furniture and [[stained glass]]. Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the [[American Institute of Architects]] as \"the greatest American architect of all time.\"<ref name=\"Brewster\" /> In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed [[World Heritage Site]] as ''[[The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright]].''\n\nRaised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and then apprenticed in Chicago with noted architects [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]] and [[Louis Sullivan]].  He opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893, and developed an influential home and studio in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], in 1898. His colorful personal life made headlines: leaving his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin, and their children for [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] in 1909, the murders at [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin estate]] in 1914, his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel in 1923, and his relationship with [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]], who became his third wife in 1928.\n\n==Early years==\n===Ancestry===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was born in the farming town of [[Richland Center, Wisconsin]]. Family records show that he was christened as \"Frank Lincoln Wright\" (possibly in honor of [[Abraham Lincoln]]) when born on June 8, 1867. Writer [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote that the family name \"Lloyd\" was used shortly thereafter,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C-fhnSK26vMC&pg=PT12&dq=frank+lincoln+wright&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCweLMnuPmAhVMZc0KHahfDfUQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=frank%20lincoln%20wright&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Life|last=Huxtable|first=Ada Louise|date=2008-04-29|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4406-3173-3|language=en}}</ref> but biographer [[Meryle Secrest]] claims that Wright himself adopted \"Lloyd\" at 18, after his parents' divorce in 1884.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7ZB90XmTdcC&pg=PA79&dq=frank+lloyd+wright+name+change&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGhsftruPmAhVKXc0KHQdZD7QQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=frank%20lloyd%20wright%20name%20change&f=false|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|date=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-74414-8|language=en}}</ref> \n\nWright's father, William Cary Wright (1825\u20131904), was an orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister.<ref name=\":1\" />  He was also a published composer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kimber|first=Marian Wilson|date=2014|title=Various Artists.

Anna was a member of the well-known Lloyd Jones clan who had emigrated from [[Wales]] to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]]. One of Anna's brothers was [[Jenkin Lloyd Jones]], an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Both of Wright's parents were strong-willed individuals with artistic interests that they passed on to him.\n\n===Childhood===\nAccording to Wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|page=58}}</ref> In 1870, the family moved to [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], where William ministered to a small congregation.\n\nIn 1876, Anna visited the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], where she saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]]. The blocks, known as [[Froebel Gifts]], were the foundation of his innovative [[kindergarten]] curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: \"For several years, I sat at the little kindergarten table-top\u2026 and played\u2026 with the cube, the sphere and the triangle\u2014these smooth wooden maple blocks\u2026 All are in my fingers to this day\u2026 \"<ref>Alofsin, Anthony (1993).

They settled in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], where William taught music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed Unitarian society. Although William was a distant parent, he shared his love of music, especially the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with his children.\n\nSoon after Wright turned 14, his parents separated. In 1884 William sued for a divorce from Anna on the grounds of \"\u2026 emotional cruelty and physical violence and spousal abandonment.\"<ref> Hendrickson, Paul, ''Plagued By Fire'', Alfred A Knopf, New York, 2019, p. 399</ref> William left Wisconsin after the divorce was granted in 1885.

University of Wisconsin-Madison.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n===Silsbee and other early work experience (1887\u20131888)===\nIn 1887, Wright arrived in Chicago in search of employment. As a result of the devastating [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]] and a population boom, new development was plentiful. Wright later recalled that while his first impressions of Chicago were that of grimy neighborhoods, crowded streets, and disappointing architecture, he was determined to find work. Within days, and after interviews with several prominent firms, he was hired as a [[Drafter|draftsman]] with the architectural firm of Joseph Lyman Silsbee.<ref name=Wright /> Wright previously collaborated with Silsbee\u2014accredited as the draftsman and the construction supervisor\u2014on the 1886 [[Unity Chapel]] for Wright's family in Spring Green.<ref name=FLWF /> While with the firm, he also worked on two other family projects: All Souls Church in Chicago for his uncle, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, and the [[Hillside Home School I]] in Spring Green for two of his aunts.<ref name=OGorman /> Other draftsmen who worked for Silsbee in 1887 included future architects Cecil Corwin, [[George W. Maher]], and [[George Grant Elmslie|George G. Elmslie]]. Wright soon befriended Corwin, with whom he lived until he found a permanent home.\n\nFeeling that he was underpaid for the quality of his work for Silsbee (at $8 a week), the young draftsman quit and found work as a [[Architectural designer|designer]] at the firm of Beers, Clay, and Dutton. However, Wright soon realized that he was not ready to handle building design by himself; he left his new job to return to Joseph Silsbee\u2014this time with a raise in salary.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=69}}</ref> Although Silsbee adhered mainly to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] architecture, Wright found his work to be more \"gracefully picturesque\" than the other \"brutalities\" of the period.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=66}}</ref> Wright aspired for more progressive work.\n\n===Adler & Sullivan (1888\u20131893)===\n\nWright learned that the Chicago firm of [[Adler & Sullivan]] was \"looking for someone to make the finished  drawings for the interior of the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=83}}</ref> Wright demonstrated that he was a competent impressionist of Louis Sullivan's ornamental designs and two short interviews later, was an official [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] in the firm.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=86}}</ref> Wright did not get along well with Sullivan's other draftsmen; he wrote that several violent altercations occurred between them during the first years of his apprenticeship. For that matter, Sullivan showed very little respect for his own employees, as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=89\u201394}}</ref> In spite of this, \"Sullivan took [Wright] under his wing and gave him great design responsibility.\" As an act of respect, Wright would later refer to Sullivan as ''Lieber Meister'' (German for \"Dear Master\").<ref name=Tafel /> He also formed a bond with office foreman Paul Mueller. Wright later engaged Mueller in the construction of several of his public and commercial buildings between 1903 and 1923.<ref name=Saint />\n\n[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio (west side zoom).JPG|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] (1889)]]\n\nOn June 1, 1889, Wright married his first wife, Catherine Lee \"Kitty\" Tobin (1871\u20131959). The two had met around a year earlier during activities at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: \"Mr. Sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?\"<ref name=\"Wright 2005, p. 97\">{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=97}}</ref> With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]. The existing [[Gothic Revival]] house was given to his mother, while a compact [[shingle style]] house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.<ref name=Weil />\n\nBy 1890, Wright had an office next to Sullivan's that he shared with friend and draftsman [[George Elmslie]], who had been hired by Sullivan at Wright's request.<ref name=Saint/><ref name=Gebhard /> Wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office. As a general rule, the firm of Adler & Sullivan did not design or build houses, but would oblige when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects. Wright was occupied by the firm's major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio. He later claimed total responsibility for the design of these houses, but a careful inspection of their architectural style (and accounts from historian Robert Twombly) suggests that Sullivan dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; Wright's design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from Sullivan's sketches.<ref name=Gebhard/> During this time, Wright worked on [[Louis Sullivan Bungalow|Sullivan's bungalow]] (1890) and the James A. Charnley bungalow (1890) in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], the Berry-MacHarg House, [[James A. Charnley House]] (both 1891), and the Louis Sullivan House (1892), all in Chicago.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=100}}</ref><ref name=Lind />\n\n[[File:Oak Park Il Walter Gale House4.jpg|thumb|The [[Walter Gale House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1893). While a [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] in style, it features window bands and a cantilevered porch roof which hint at Wright's developing aesthetics]]\n\nDespite Sullivan's loan and overtime salary, Wright was constantly short on funds. Wright admitted that his poor finances were likely due to his expensive tastes in wardrobe and vehicles, and the extra luxuries he designed into his house. To supplement his income and repay his debts, Wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses. These \"bootlegged\" houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles. Nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional [[cantilever]]s, and open floor plans, which would become hallmarks of his later work. Eight of these early houses remain today, including the [[Thomas H. Gale House|Thomas Gale]], [[Robert P. Parker House|Robert Parker]], George Blossom, and [[Walter Gale House|Walter Gale]] houses.<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=38\u201354}}</ref>\n\nAs with the residential projects for Adler & Sullivan, he designed his bootleg houses on his own time. Sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a Frank Lloyd Wright design. This particular house, built for Allison Harlan, was only blocks away from Sullivan's townhouse in the Chicago community of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]]. Aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony [[tracery]] in the same style as the Charnley House likely gave away Wright's involvement. Since Wright's five-year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from Sullivan's firm.<ref name=Lind/> Several stories recount the break in the relationship between Sullivan and Wright; even Wright later told two different versions of the occurrence. In ''An Autobiography'', Wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract. When Sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue Wright the [[deed]] to his Oak Park house until after he completed his five years. Wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust. He \"threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the Adler & Sullivan office never to return.\" Dankmar Adler, who was more sympathetic to Wright's actions, later sent him the deed.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=101}}</ref> However, Wright told his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] apprentices (as recorded by Edgar Tafel) that Sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the Harlan House. Tafel also recounted that Wright had Cecil Corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that Wright was aware of their illegal nature.<ref name=Lind/><ref>{{harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=41}}</ref> Regardless of the correct series of events, Wright and Sullivan did not meet or speak for 12 years.\n\n===Transition and experimentation (1893\u20131900)===\nAfter leaving Louis Sullivan's firm, Wright established his own practice on the top floor of the Sullivan-designed [[Schiller Building]] on [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] in Chicago. Wright chose to locate his office in the building because the tower location reminded him of the office of Adler & Sullivan. Although Cecil Corwin followed Wright and set up his architecture practice in the same office, the two worked independently and did not consider themselves partners.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=112}}</ref>\n\nIn 1896, Wright moved out of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly completed [[Steinway Hall (Chicago)|Steinway Hall]] building. The loft space was shared with Robert C. Spencer, Jr., [[Myron Hunt]], and [[Dwight H. Perkins (architect)|Dwight H. Perkins]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=119}}</ref> These young architects, inspired by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what  became known as the Prairie School.<ref name=Brooks /> They were joined by Perkins' apprentice, [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his [[Architectural drawing#Presentation drawings|presentation drawings]] and watercolor [[Architectural rendering|renderings]]. Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois and one of the first licensed female architects in the U.S., also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses. Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall.<ref name=Cassidy /><ref name=MIT />\n\n[[File:William H. Winslow House Front Facade.jpg|thumb|[[William H. Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]] (1893)]]\n\nWright's projects during this period followed two basic models. His first independent commission, the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]], combined Sullivanesque ornamentation with the emphasis on simple geometry and horizontal lines. The Francis Apartments (1895, demolished 1971), [[Heller House]] (1896), [[Rollin Furbeck House]] (1897) and Husser House (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. For his more conservative clients, Wright designed more traditional dwellings. These included the [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] style Bagley House (1894), [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style [[Nathan G. Moore House|Moore House I]] (1895), and [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] style [[Charles E. Roberts]] House (1896).<ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=56\u2013109}}</ref> While Wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan-inspired details.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nathan G. Moore house (1895), Oak Park, IL, rear.JPG|thumb|[[Nathan G. Moore House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1895)]]\n\nSoon after the completion of the Winslow House in 1894, Edward Waller, a friend and former client, invited Wright to meet Chicago architect and planner [[Daniel Burnham]]. Burnham had been impressed by the Winslow House and other examples of Wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts|\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] and two years in Rome. To top it off, Wright would have a position in Burnham's firm upon his return. In spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, Wright declined the offer. Burnham, who had directed the classical design of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] and was a major proponent of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]], thought that Wright was making a foolish mistake. Yet for Wright, the classical education of the \u00c9cole lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern American architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=114\u2013116}}</ref><ref name=Goldberger />\n\n[[File:Frank LLoyd Wright Studio Chicago Frontage.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's studio]] viewed from [[Chicago Avenue]] (1898)]]\n\nWright relocated his practice to his home in 1898  to bring his work and family lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|studio addition]] to the north of the main house. The space, which included a hanging [[balcony]] within the two-story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio embodied Wright's developing aesthetics and would become the laboratory from which his next 10 years of architectural creations would emerge.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust 2001, pp. 6\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Prairie style houses (1900\u20131914)===\nBy 1901, Wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in Oak Park. As his son John Lloyd Wright wrote: <blockquote> \"[[William Eugene Drummond]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Walter Burley Griffin]], [[Albert Chase McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], [[Isabel Roberts]], and [[George Willis (architect)|George Willis]] were the draftsmen. Five men, two women. They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn't have enough hair. They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them!

Martin House]], [[Buffalo, New York]] (1904)]]\n[[File:Taliesin600.jpg|thumb|Hillside Home School, [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]], Spring Green, Wisconsin (1902)]]\n\nBetween 1900 and 1901, Frank Lloyd Wright completed four houses which have since been identified as the onset of the \"[[Prairie style]]\". Two, the [[Warren Hickox House|Hickox]] and [[B. Harley Bradley House|Bradley Houses]], were the last transitional step between Wright's early designs and the Prairie creations.<ref name=Clayton /> Meanwhile, the [[Frank Thomas House|Thomas House]] and [[Willits House]] received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style.<ref name=Sommer /><ref>{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|p=134}}</ref> At the same time, Wright gave his new ideas for the American house widespread awareness through two publications in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The articles were in response to an invitation from the president of [[Curtis Publishing Company]], [[Edward Bok]], as part of a project to improve modern house design. \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" and \"A Small House with Lots of Room in it\" appeared respectively in the February and July 1901 issues of the journal. Although neither of the affordable house plans was ever constructed, Wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years.<ref name=Clayton/> Wright came to Buffalo and designed homes for three of the company's executives, including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]] in 1904. Other Wright houses considered to be masterpieces of the Prairie Style are the Frederick [[Robie House]] in Chicago and the Avery and Queene [[Coonley House]] in [[Riverside, Illinois]]. The Robie House, with its soaring, [[cantilever]]ed roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34-m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. Its living and dining areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. With this and other buildings, included in the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]] (1910), Wright's work became known to European architects and had a profound influence on them after World War I. It is sometimes called the \"cornerstone of modernism\".\n\nWright's residential designs of this era were known as \"prairie houses\" because the designs complemented the land around Chicago.  Prairie-style houses often have a combination of these features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad, overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials\u2014especially stone and wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquehome.org/Architectural-Style/prairie.htm|title=Prairie School Architecture|website=www.antiquehome.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 1909, Wright had begun to reject the upper-middle-class Prairie Style [[single-family house]] model, shifting his focus to a more democratic architecture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Storrer |first1=William Allin |title=The architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright : a complete catalog |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0226776200 |page=xvii |edition=Updated 3rd }}</ref> Wright went to Europe in 1909 with a portfolio of his work and presented it to Berlin publisher [[Ernst Wasmuth]].<ref>Secrest, p. 202</ref>  ''Studies and Executed Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright'', published in 1911, was the first major exposure of Wright's work in Europe.

Wright later said that Unity Temple was the edifice in which he ceased to be an architect of structure, and became an architect of space. [[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wright in 1926]]\n\nOther early notable public buildings included the [[Larkin Administration Building]] (1905) as well as the Geneva Inn ([[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]], 1911), the [[Midway Gardens]] (Chicago, Illinois, 1913), the [[Banff National Park Pavilion]] ([[Alberta]], Canada, 1914), and the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (Tokyo, 1922).\n\n===Textile concrete block system===\nIn the early 1920s, Wright designed a \"[[Textile block house|textile]]\" concrete block system.

As he explained in ''The Natural House'' (1954), \"The original blocks are made on the site by ramming concrete into wood or metal wrap-around forms, with one outside face (which may be pattered), and one rear or inside face, generally coffered, for lightness.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Midlife problems==\n\n===Family abandonment{{anchor | Europe and personal troubles}}===\n[[File:Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of Taliesin, Spring Green, Wisconsin]]\nIn 1903, while Wright was designing a house for Edwin Cheney (a neighbor in Oak Park), he became enamored with Cheney's wife, Mamah. [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist, and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. Their relationship became the talk of the town; they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. In 1909, Wright and Mamah Cheney met up in Europe, leaving their spouses and children behind. Wright remained in Europe for almost a year, first in [[Florence, Italy]] (where he lived with his eldest son Lloyd) and, later, in [[Fiesole, Italy]], where he lived with Mamah. During this time, Edwin Cheney granted Mamah a divorce, though Kitty still refused to grant one to her husband. After Wright returned to the United States in October 1910, he persuaded his mother to buy land for him in Spring Green, Wisconsin. The land, bought on April 10, 1911, was adjacent to land held by his mother's family, the Lloyd-Joneses. Wright began to build himself a new home, which he called {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]}}, by May 1911. The recurring theme of {{lang|cy|Taliesin}} also came from his mother's side: {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin]]}} in [[Welsh mythology]] was a poet, magician, and priest. The family motto, \"''{{lang|cy|Y Gwir yn Erbyn y Byd}}''\" (\"The Truth Against the World\"), was taken from the Welsh poet {{lang|cy|[[Iolo Morganwg]]}}, who also had a son named Taliesin. The motto is still used today as the cry of the druids and chief bard of the {{lang|cy|[[Eisteddfod]]}} in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228212826/http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 28, 2005 |title=Home Country |publisher=Unitychapel.org |date=July 1, 2005 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Catastrophe at Taliesin studio===\nOn August 15, 1914, while Wright was working in Chicago, Julian Carlton, a male servant who had been hired several months earlier, set fire to the living quarters of Taliesin and murdered seven people with an axe as the fire burned.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /><ref>https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/famous-murders/taliesin-massacre-frank-lloyd-wright/</ref> The dead included Mamah; her two children, John and Martha Cheney; a gardener (David Lindblom); a draftsman (Emil Brodelle); a workman (Thomas Brunker); and another workman's son (Ernest Weston). Two people survived the mayhem, one of whom, William Weston, helped to put out the fire that almost completely consumed the residential wing of the house. Carlton swallowed [[hydrochloric acid]] immediately following the attack in an attempt to [[suicide|kill himself]].<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> He was nearly [[Lynching|lynched]] on the spot, but was taken to the [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]] jail.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" /> Carlton died from [[starvation]] seven weeks after the attack, despite medical attention.<ref name=\"bbccarlton\" />\n\n===Divorce and further troubles===\nIn 1922, Kitty Wright finally granted Wright a divorce. Under the terms of the divorce, Wright was required to wait one year before he could marry his then-mistress, Maude \"Miriam\" Noel. In 1923, Wright's mother, Anna (Lloyd Jones) Wright, died. Wright wed Miriam Noel in November 1923, but her addiction to [[morphine]] led to the failure of the marriage in less than one year. In 1924, after the separation, but while still married, Wright met [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]] at a Petrograd Ballet performance in Chicago. They moved in together at Taliesin in 1925, and soon Olgivanna was pregnant with their daughter, Iovanna, born on December 2, 1925.\n\nOn April 20, 1925, another fire destroyed the bungalow at Taliesin. Crossed wires from a newly installed telephone system were deemed to be responsible for the blaze, which destroyed a collection of Japanese prints that Wright estimated to be worth $250,000 to $500,000.<ref>Secrest, p. 315\u2013317.</ref> Wright rebuilt the living quarters, naming the home \"Taliesin III\".\n\nIn 1926, Olga's ex-husband, Vlademar Hinzenburg, sought custody of his daughter, Svetlana. In October 1926, Wright and Olgivanna were accused of violating the [[Mann Act]] and arrested in [[Tonka Bay, Minnesota]].<ref>Minnesota Historical Society, Collections Up Close, \"[http://discussions.mnhs.org/collections/2011/01/frank-lloyd-wright-arrested-in-minnesota/ Frank Lloyd Wright Arrested in Minnesota]\"</ref> The charges were later dropped.\n\nWright and Miriam Noel's divorce was finalized in 1927. Wright was again required to wait for one year before remarrying.

Twenty-three came to live and work that year, as did many more in the years that followed. \nConsiderable controversy existed over the living conditions and education of the fellows; recent books and articles have given conflicting and often unflattering pictures of their treatment.<ref>Friedland, Roger, and Zellman, Harold.

He proposed the idea in his book ''The Disappearing City'' in 1932, and unveiled a {{convert|12|ft2|m2|adj=on}} model of this community of the future, showing it in several venues in the following years. Concurrent with the development of Broadacre City, also referred to as Usonia, Wright conceived a new type of dwelling that came to be known as the [[Usonia]]n House. Although an early version of the form can be seen in the [[Malcolm Willey House]] (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House]] (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including walls composed of a \"sandwich\" of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper\u2014a significant change from typically framed walls.<ref>Twombly, p.242</ref> Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.\n\nUsonian houses were Wright's response to the transformation of domestic life that occurred in the early 20th century when servants had become less prominent or completely absent from most American households. By developing homes with progressively more open plans, Wright allotted the woman of the house a 'workspace', as he often called the kitchen, where she could keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room.<ref>Twombly, p.257</ref> As in the Prairie Houses, Usonian living areas had a fireplace as a point of focus. Bedrooms, typically isolated and relatively small, encouraged the family to gather in the main living areas. The conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the Prairie ideal. The built-in furnishings related to the Arts and Crafts movement's principles which influenced Wright's early work. Spatially and in terms of their construction, the Usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a Wright-designed house at relatively low cost. His Usonian homes set a new style for suburban design that influenced countless postwar developers.<ref>Twombly, p.244</ref> Many features of modern American homes date back to Wright: open plans, slab-on-grade foundations, and simplified construction techniques that allowed more mechanization and efficiency in building.\n\n===Significant later works===\n[[File:Guggenheim museum exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York City (1959)]]\n\n[[File:Wrightfallingwater.jpg|thumb|[[Fallingwater]], [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]] (1937)]] ''[[Fallingwater]]'', one of Wright's most famous private residences (completed 1937), was built for Mr. and Mrs. [[Edgar J. Kaufmann|Edgar J. Kaufmann, Sr.]], at [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]]. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was designed according to Wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. The house was intended to be more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using [[limestone]] for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright's most expensive pieces.<ref name=\"Twombly1979\" /> Kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. In March 2002, [[post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioning]] of the lowest terrace was completed.\n\n[[Taliesin West]], Wright's winter home and studio complex in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], was a laboratory for Wright from 1937 to his death in 1959. Now the home of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and archives, it continues today as the site of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture.\nWright turned 80 shortly after World War II ended, yet remained busy. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City occupied Wright for 16&nbsp;years (1943\u20131959)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/about/frank-lloyd-wright-building|title=The Frank Lloyd Wright Building|date=November 10, 2015|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. The building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on [[Fifth Avenue]]; its interior is similar to the inside of a [[seashell]]. Its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience Guggenheim's collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an elevator to the top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. However, when the museum was completed, a number of details of Wright's design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white.\n\n[[File:Price tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] (1956)]]\nThe only realized skyscraper designed by Wright is the [[Price Tower]], a 19-story tower in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]]. It is also one of the two existing vertically oriented Wright structures (the other is the [[S.C. Johnson Wax Research Tower]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]]). The Price Tower was commissioned by Harold C. Price of the H. C. Price Company, a local [[oil pipeline]] and chemical firm. On March 29, 2007, Price Tower was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]], one of only 20 such properties in Oklahoma.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20070413.HTM National Park Service] \u2014 ''National Historic Landmarks Designated'', April 13, 2007</ref>\n\n[[Monona Terrace]], originally designed in 1937 as municipal offices for Madison, Wisconsin, was completed in 1997 on the original site, using a variation of Wright's final design for the exterior, with the interior design altered by its new purpose as a convention center. The \"as-built\" design was carried out by Wright's apprentice Tony Puttnam. Monona Terrace was accompanied by controversy throughout the 60 years between the original design and the completion of the structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|title=Monona Terrace Convention Center, history web page|accessdate=May 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215652/http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Florida Southern College]], located in [[Lakeland, Florida]], constructed 12 (out of 18 planned) Frank Lloyd Wright buildings between 1941 and 1958 as part of the [[Child of the Sun]] project.

He made innovative use of new building materials such as [[precast concrete]] blocks, glass bricks, and zinc [[came]]s (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used [[Pyrex]] glass tubing as a major element in the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]]. Wright was also one of the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting). In 1897, Wright received a patent for \"Prism Glass Tiles\" that were used in storefronts to direct light toward the interior.<ref>http://www.dailyartdaily.com/prismatic-tiles-frank-lloyd-wright-glass/</ref> Wright fully embraced glass in his designs and found that it fit well into his philosophy of organic architecture. According to Wright's organic theory, all components of the building should appear unified, as though they belong together. Nothing should be attached to it without considering the effect on the whole. To unify the house to its site, Wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors.<ref name=\"TMCnet\">{{cite web|author=Lync Voice UC Industry News|title=The Textile Block System [Concrete International]|url=http://www.lyncvoiceuc.com/news/2012/04/14/6258593.htm|publisher=TMCnet|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}</ref> Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds.<ref>Frank Lloyd Wright. \"In the Cause of Architecture, VI: The Meaning of Materials\u2014Glass\". ''The Architectural Record'', 64(July 1928), 10-16.</ref> One of Wright's earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls. By using this large amount of glass, Wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls. Arguably, Wright's best-known art glass is that of the Prairie style. The simple geometric shapes that yield to very ornate and intricate windows represent some of the most integral ornamentation of his career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lind|first=Carla|title=Frank Lloyd Wright's glass designs|date=1995|publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780876544686|pages=57}}</ref>\n\nWright also designed some of his own clothing. His fashion sense was unique and he usually wore expensive suits, flowing neckties, and capes. He had a fascination with automobiles, purchasing his first car in 1909, a Stoddard-Dayton roadster, and owned many exotic vehicles over the years. During the cash-strapped Depression, Wright drove cheaper vehicles. Some of his last cars in the 1950s included four Volkswagens and a Chevrolet Nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a Jaguar Mark VII. He owned some 50 cars between 1909 and his death, of which 10 are known to survive.\n\n===Influences and collaborations===\n[[File:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb|Wright-designed window in [[Robie House]], Chicago (1906)]]\nWright strongly believed in individualism and did not affiliate with the [[American Institute of Architects]] during his career, going so far as to call the organization \"a harbor of refuge for the incompetent,\" and \"a form of refined gangsterism.\" When an associate referred to him as \"an old amateur\" Wright confirmed, \"I am the oldest.\"<ref name=\"archive\">{{cite web|title=Biography in Sound: Frank Lloyd Wright|url=https://archive.org/details/Biography_in_Sound|work=Old Time Radio|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Wright rarely credited any influences on his designs, but most architects, historians and scholars agree he had five major influences:\n# [[Louis Sullivan]], whom he considered to be his ''Lieber Meister'' (dear master)\n# Nature, particularly shapes/forms and colors/patterns of plant life\n# Music (his favorite composer was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]])\n# Japanese art, prints and buildings\n# [[Froebel Gifts]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Jeanne S.|date=March 1, 1989|title=The Froebel-Wright Kindergarten Connection: A New Perspective|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=48|issue=1|pages=24\u201337|doi=10.2307/990404|issn=0037-9808|jstor=990404}}</ref>\n\nHe also routinely claimed the work of architects and architectural designers who were his employees as his own designs, and also claimed that the rest of the Prairie School architects were merely his followers, imitators, and subordinates.<ref>Griffin, Marion Mahony, ''The Magic of America'', typescript, 1947</ref> As with any architect, though, Wright worked in a collaborative process and drew his ideas from the work of others. In his earlier days, Wright worked with some of the top architects of the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]], including Sullivan. In his Prairie School days, Wright's office was populated by many talented architects, including [[William Eugene Drummond]], [[John Van Bergen]], [[Isabel Roberts]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Albert Chase McArthur|Albert McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin]], and [[Walter Burley Griffin]].\n\nThe Czech-born architect [[Antonin Raymond]], recognized as the father of modern architecture in Japan, worked for Wright at Taliesin and led the construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. He subsequently stayed in Japan and opened his own practice. [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolf Schindler]] also worked for Wright on the Imperial Hotel. His own work is often credited as influencing Wright's Usonian houses. Schindler's friend [[Richard Neutra]] also worked briefly for Wright and became an internationally successful architect.\n\nLater, in the [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] days, Wright employed many architects and artists who later become notable, such as [[Aaron Green (architect)|Aaron Green]], [[John Lautner]], [[E. Fay Jones]], [[Henry Klumb]], [[William Bernoudy]], and [[Paolo Soleri]].\n\n===Community planning===\nFrank Lloyd Wright was interested in site and community planning throughout his career. His commissions and theories on urban design began as early as 1900 and continued until his death. He had 41 commissions on the scale of community planning or urban design.<ref>''Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs'', Charles E. and Berdeana Aguar, McGraw-Hill, 2002, p.344</ref>\n\nHis thoughts on suburban design started in 1900 with a proposed subdivision layout for [[Charles E. Roberts]] entitled the \"Quadruple Block Plan.\" This design strayed from traditional suburban lot layouts and set houses on small square blocks of four equal-sized lots surrounded on all sides by roads instead of straight rows of houses on parallel streets. The houses, which used the same design as published in \"A Home in a Prairie Town\" from the ''Ladies' Home Journal'', were set toward the center of the block to maximize the yard space and included private space in the center. This also allowed for far more interesting views from each house. Although this plan was never realized, Wright published the design in the ''Wasmuth Portfolio'' in 1910.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs|first1=Charles E.|last1=Aguar|first2=Berdeana|last2=Aguar|publisher=McGraw-Hill|date=2002|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nThe more ambitious designs of entire communities were exemplified by his entry into the City Club of Chicago Land Development Competition in 1913. The contest was for the development of a suburban quarter section. This design expanded on the Quadruple Block Plan and included several social levels. The design shows the placement of the upscale homes in the most desirable areas and the [[blue collar]] homes and apartments separated by parks and common spaces. The design also included all the amenities of a small city: schools, museums, markets, etc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Undoing the City: Frank Lloyd Wright's Planned Communities|journal=American Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|date=October 1972|page=544}}</ref> This view of decentralization was later reinforced by theoretical [[Broadacre City]] design. The philosophy behind his community planning was decentralization. The new development must be away from the cities. In this decentralized America, all services and facilities could coexist \"factories side by side with farm and home.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Undoing the City: Frank Lloyd Wright's Planned Communities|journal=American Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|date=October 1972|page=542}}</ref>\n\nNotable community planning designs:\n\n*1900\u201303 \u2013 Quadruple Block Plan, 24 homes in Oak Park, Illinois (unbuilt)\n*1909 \u2013 [[Como Orchard Summer Colony]], town site development for new town in the [[Bitterroot Valley]], Montana\n*1913 \u2013 Chicago Land Development competition, suburban Chicago quarter section\n*1934\u201359 \u2013 [[Broadacre City]], theoretical decentralized city plan, exhibits of large-scale model\n*1938 \u2013 [[Suntop Homes]], also known as Cloverleaf Quadruple Housing Project \u2013 commission from [[Federal Works Agency]], Division of Defense Housing, a low-cost multifamily housing alternative to suburban development\n*1942 \u2013 Cooperative Homesteads, commissioned by a group of auto workers, teachers and other professionals, 160-acre farm co-op was to be the pioneer of [[rammed earth]] and earth berm construction<ref>''Treasures of Taliesin: Seventy Seven Unbuilt Designs,'' Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer, Director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Archive</ref> (unbuilt)\n*1945 \u2013 [[Usonia Homes]], 47 homes (three designed by Wright) in [[Pleasantville, New York]]\n*1949 \u2013 [[The Acres]], also known as Galesburg Country Homes, five homes (four designed by Wright) in [[Charleston Township, Michigan]]\n*1949 \u2013 Parkwyn neighborhood, a [[plat]] in Kalamazoo, Michigan, developed by Wright containing mostly Usonian homes on circular lots with common spaces in between (since replatted)\n\n===Japanese art===\nThough most famous as an architect, Wright was an active dealer in Japanese art, primarily ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]].

New York: Abrams, 2000.</ref>\n\nWright first traveled to Japan in 1905, where he bought hundreds of prints. The following year, he helped organize the world's first retrospective exhibition of works by [[Hiroshige]], held at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].<ref name=cotter/> For many years, he was a major presence in the Japanese art world, selling a great number of works to prominent collectors such as John Spaulding of Boston,<ref name=cotter/> and to prominent museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.<ref name=reif/> He penned a book on Japanese art in 1912.<ref name=reif/>\n\nIn 1920, however, rival art dealers began to spread rumors that Wright was selling retouched prints; this, combined with Wright's tendency to live beyond his means, and other factors, led to great financial troubles for the architect. Though he provided his clients with genuine prints as replacements for those he was accused of retouching, this marked the end of the high point of his career as an art dealer.<ref name=reif/> He was forced to sell off much of his art collection in 1927 to pay off outstanding debts; the Bank of Wisconsin claimed his Taliesin home the following year, and sold thousands of his prints, for only one dollar a piece, to collector [[Edward Burr Van Vleck]].<ref name=cotter/>\n\nWright continued to collect and deal in prints until his death in 1959, using prints as collateral for loans, often relying upon his art business to remain financially solvent.<ref name=reif>{{cite news |last=Reif |first=Rita |title=Frank Lloyd Wright's Love of Japanese Prints Helped Pay the Bills |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 18, 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/18/arts/art-architecture-the-master-builder-whose-other-love-helped-pay-the-bills.html }}</ref>\n\nThe extent of his dealings in Japanese art went largely unknown, or underestimated, among art historians for decades until, in 1980, Julia Meech, then associate curator of Japanese art at the Metropolitan Museum, began researching the history of the museum's collection of Japanese prints. She discovered \"a three-inch-deep 'clump of 400 cards' from 1918, each listing a print bought from the same seller\u2014'F. L. Wright'\" and a number of letters exchanged between Wright and the museum's first curator of Far Eastern Art, Sigisbert C.

Although Olgivanna had taken no legal steps to move Wright's remains and against the wishes of other family members, as well as the Wisconsin legislature, in 1985, Wright's remains were removed from his grave by members of the Taliesin Fellowship, cremated, and sent to Scottsdale, where they were later interred in the memorial garden.

He received a Gold Medal award from The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]  in 1941. The [[American Institute of Architects]] awarded him the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1949. That medal was a symbolic \"burying the hatchet\" between Wright and the AIA. In a radio interview, he commented, \"Well, the AIA I never joined, and they know why. When they gave me the gold medal in Houston, I told them frankly why. Feeling that the architecture profession is all that's the matter with architecture, why should I join them?\"<ref name=\"archive\" /> He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] in 1953. He received honorary degrees from several universities (including his ''alma mater'', the University of Wisconsin), and several nations named him as an honorary board member to their national academies of art and/or architecture. In 2000, Fallingwater was named \"The Building of the 20th century\" in an unscientific \"Top-Ten\" poll taken by members attending the AIA annual convention in Philadelphia. On that list, Wright was listed along with many of the USA's other greatest architects including [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]; he was the only architect who had more than one building on the list. The other three buildings were the Guggenheim Museum, the Frederick C. Robie House, and the Johnson Wax Building.\n\nIn 1992, the [[Madison Opera]] in Madison, Wisconsin, commissioned and premiered the opera ''[[Shining Brow]]'', by composer [[Daron Hagen]] and [[libretto|librettist]] [[Paul Muldoon]] based on events early in Wright's life. The work has since received numerous revivals, including a June 2013 revival at Fallingwater, in Bull Run, Pennsylvania, by Opera Theater of Pittsburgh. In 2000, ''[[Work Song: Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright]]'', a play based on the relationship between the personal and working aspects of Wright's life, debuted at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]].\n\nIn 1966, the [[United States Postal Service]] honored Wright with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 2\u00a2 postage stamp.\n\n\"[[So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright]]\" is a song written by [[Paul Simon]].

{"title_page": "Data logger", "text_new": "{{for|path tracking devices|GPS tracking unit#Data loggers}}\n[[Image:Datalogger.jpg|thumb|Data logger Cube storing technical and sensor data]]\nA '''data logger''' (also '''datalogger''' or '''data recorder''') is an electronic device that records data over time or in relation to location either with a built in [[scientific instrument|instrument]] or [[sensor]] or via external instruments and sensors. Increasingly, but not entirely, they are based on a digital processor (or computer). They generally are small, battery powered, portable, and equipped with a microprocessor, internal memory for data storage, and sensors. Some data loggers interface with a personal computer, and use software to activate the data logger and view and analyze the collected data, while others have a local interface device (keypad, LCD) and can be used as a stand-alone device.\n\nData loggers vary between general purpose types for a range of measurement applications to very specific devices for measuring in one environment or application type only.  It is common for general purpose types to be [[Computer program|programmable]]; however, many remain as static machines with only a limited number or no changeable parameters.  Electronic data loggers have replaced [[chart recorder]]s in many applications.\n\nOne of the primary benefits of using data loggers is the ability to automatically collect data on a 24-hour basis. Upon activation, data loggers are typically deployed and left unattended to measure and record information for the duration of the monitoring period. This allows for a comprehensive, accurate picture of the environmental conditions being monitored, such as air temperature and relative humidity.\n\nThe cost of data loggers has been declining over the years as technology improves and costs are reduced.  Simple single channel data loggers cost as little as $25. More complicated loggers may costs hundreds or thousands of dollars.\n[[File:Temperature Data Logger.png|alt=|thumb|Portable Temperature Data Logger with Integrated USB for data transfer to computer as PDF and CSV format at most convenient way. ]]\n\n== Data formats ==\nStandardisation of protocols and data formats has been a problem but is now growing in the industry and [[XML]], [[JSON]], and [[YAML]]  are increasingly being adopted for data exchange. The development of the [[Semantic Web]] and the [[Internet of Things]] is likely to accelerate this present trend.\n\n== Instrumentation protocols ==\nSeveral protocols have been standardised including a smart protocol, [[SDI-12]], that allows some instrumentation to be connected to a variety of data loggers. The use of this standard has not gained much acceptance outside the environmental industry. SDI-12 also supports multi drop instruments. Some datalogging companies are also now supporting the [[Modbus|MODBUS]] standard. This has been used traditionally in the industrial control area, and there are many industrial instruments which support this communication standard. Another multi drop protocol which is now starting to become more widely used is based upon [[CAN Bus]] (ISO 11898). Some data loggers use a flexible scripting environment to adapt themselves to various non-standard protocols.\n\n==Data logging versus data acquisition==\nThe terms data logging and [[data acquisition]] are often used interchangeably. However, in a historical context they are quite different. A data logger is a data acquisition system, but a data acquisition system is not necessarily a data logger.\n\n*Data loggers typically have slower [[sample rate]]s. A maximum sample rate of 1 [[Hertz|Hz]] may be considered to be very fast for a data logger, yet very slow for a typical data acquisition system.\n*Data loggers are implicitly stand-alone devices, while typical data acquisition system must remain tethered to a computer to acquire data. This stand-alone aspect of data loggers implies on-board memory that is used to store acquired data. Sometimes this memory is very large to accommodate many days, or even months, of unattended recording.  This memory may be battery-backed [[static random access memory]], [[flash memory]] or [[EEPROM]].  Earlier data loggers used [[magnetic tape]], punched paper tape, or directly viewable records such as \"strip [[chart recorder]]s\".\n*Given the extended recording times of data loggers, they typically feature a mechanism to record the date and time in a [[timestamp]] to ensure that each recorded data value is associated with a date and time of acquisition in order to produce a [[sequence of events]]. As such, data loggers typically employ built-in [[real-time clock]]s whose published drift can be an important consideration when choosing between data loggers.\n*Data loggers range from simple single-channel input to complex multi-channel instruments. Typically, the simpler the device the less programming flexibility.  Some more sophisticated instruments allow for cross-channel computations and alarms based on predetermined conditions. The newest of data loggers can serve web pages, allowing numerous people to monitor a system remotely.\n*The unattended and remote nature of many data logger applications implies the need in some applications to operate from a [[direct current|DC]] power source, such as a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]].  Solar power may be used to supplement these power sources.  These constraints have generally led to ensure that the devices they market are extremely power efficient relative to computers.  In many cases they are required to operate in harsh environmental conditions where computers will not function reliably.\n*[[File:GL240.png|thumb|Portable Dataloggers may reach up to 20 channels with maximum 10 ms (100 Hz) sampling rate.]]This unattended nature also dictates that data loggers must be extremely reliable. Since they may operate for long periods nonstop with little or no human supervision, and may be installed in harsh or remote locations, it is imperative that so long as they have power, they will not fail to log data for any reason. Manufacturers go to great length to ensure that the devices can be depended on in these applications.  As such dataloggers are almost completely immune to the problems that might affect a general-purpose computer in the same application, such as program crashes and the instability of some operating systems.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Data logger application for weather station.jpg|thumb|Data logger application for weather station at P2I [[Indonesian Institute of Sciences|LIPI]] ]]\nApplications of data logging include:\n* Unattended [[weather station]] recording (such as [[wind speed]] / direction, [[temperature]], [[relative humidity]], [[solar radiation]]).\n* Unattended hydrographic recording (such as water level, water depth, water flow, water pH, water conductivity).\n* Unattended soil moisture level recording.\n* Unattended gas pressure recording.\n* Offshore buoys for recording a variety of environmental conditions.\n* Road traffic counting.\n* Measure [[temperature]]s (humidity, etc.) of perishables during shipments: [[Cold chain]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Riva \n  | first = Marco\n  | last2 = Piergiovanni, Schiraldi\n  | title =Performances of time-temperature indicators in the study of temperature exposure of packaged fresh foods \n  | journal = Packaging Technology and Science\n  | volume = 14\n  | issue = 1\n  | pages = 1\u201339\n  | date = January 2001\n  | doi = 10.1002/pts.521\n  | first2 = Luciano\n  | last3 = Schiraldi\n  | first3 = Alberto }}\n</ref>\n* Measure variations in light intensity.\n* Measuring Temperature of Pharmaceutical products, Medicines and Vaccines during storage\n* Measuring Temperature and Humidity of Perishable products during transportation to ensure cold chain is maintained \n* Process monitoring for maintenance and troubleshooting applications.\n* Process monitoring to verify warranty conditions\n* [[Pop-up satellite archival tag|Wildlife research with pop-up archival tags]]\n* Measure [[vibration]] and handling [[Shock (mechanics)|shock]] (drop height) environment of distribution [[packaging]].<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Singh \n  | first = J\n   | last2 = Singh, Burgess\n  | title =Measurement, Analysis, and Comparison of the Parcel Shipping Shock and Drop Environment of the United States Postal Service with Commercial Carriers \n  | journal =  Journal of Testing and Evaluation\n  | volume = 35\n  | issue = 3\n  | pages = 100787\n | year = 2007\n  | doi = 10.1520/JTE100787| url = https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&context=it_fac\n  }}\n</ref>\n* Tank level monitoring.\n* [[Deformation Monitoring|Deformation monitoring]] of any object with geodetic or geotechnical sensors controlled by an [[Automatic Deformation Monitoring System|automatic deformation monitoring system]].\n* [[Environmental monitoring]].\n* Vehicle Testing (including crash testing)\n* Motor Racing\n* Monitoring of relay status in railway signalling.\n* For science education enabling 'measurement', 'scientific investigation' and an appreciation of 'change'\n* Record trend data at regular intervals in veterinary vital signs monitoring.\n* [[Load profile]] recording for energy consumption management.\n* Temperature, humidity and power use for heating and air conditioning efficiency studies.\n* Water level monitoring for groundwater studies.\n* Digital electronic bus sniffer for debug and validation\n\n===Examples===\n* [[Black box|Black-box (stimulus/response)]] loggers: \n** A [[flight data recorder]] (FDR) is a piece of recording equipment used to collect specific aircraft performance data.  The term may also be used, albeit less accurately, to describe the [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR), another type of data recording device found on board aircraft.\n** An [[event data recorder]] (EDR) is a device installed by the manufacturer in some [[automobile]]s which collects and stores various data during the time-frame immediately before and after a crash.\n** A [[Voyage Data Recorder|voyage data recorder]] (VDR) is a data recording system designed to collect data from various sensors on board a ship.\n** A [[train event recorder]] is a device that records data about the operation of train controls and performance in response to those controls and other train control systems.\n** An [[accident data recorder]] (ADR) is a device for triggering accidents or incidents in most kind of land vehicles and recording the relevant data. In automobiles, all [[Diagnostic Trouble Code|diagnostic trouble codes]] (DTCs) are logged in [[engine control unit]]s (ECUs) so that at the time of service of a vehicle, a service engineer will read all the DTCs using [[Tech-2]] or similar tools connected to the [[on-board diagnostics]] port, and will come to know problems occurred in the vehicle. Sometimes a small [[on-board diagnostics#Data Loggers|OBD data logger]] is plugged into the same port to continuously record vehicle data.\n** In [[embedded system]] and digital electronics design, specialized high-speed digital data logger help overcome the limitations of more traditional instruments such as the [[oscilloscope]] and the [[logic analyzer]]. The main advantage of a data logger is its ability to record very long traces, which proves very useful when trying to correct functional bugs that happen once in while.\n** In the racing industry, Data Loggers are used to record data such as braking points, lap/sector timing, and track maps, as well as any on-board vehicle sensors.\n* [[Health|Health data]] loggers:\n** The growing, preparation, storage and transportation of food.

The original model of a stand-alone data logger is changing to one of a device that collects data but also has access to wireless communications for alarming of events, automatic reporting of data and remote control. Data loggers are beginning to serve web pages for current readings, [[e-mail]] their alarms and [[File transfer protocol|FTP]] their daily results into databases or direct to the users. Very recently, there is a trend to move away from proprietary products with commercial software to open source software and hardware devices. The [[Raspberry Pi]] [[single-board computer]] is among others a popular platform hosting real-time Linux or preemptive-kernel Linux operating systems with many \n* digital interfaces like [[I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface|SPI]] or [[UART]] enabling the direct interconnection of a digital [[sensor]] and a computer,\n* and unlimited number of configurations to show measurements in real-time over the [[internet]], process data, plot charts and diagrams... \nThere are more and more community-developed ([[Open-source model|open source]]) projects for data acquisition / data logging.<ref name=\"rpilogger\" /><ref>http://real.mtak.hu/25714/1/28.pdf</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black box]]\n* [[Bus analyzer]]\n* [[Computer data logging]]: logging APIs, server logs & syslog, web logging & web counters\n* [[Continuous emissions monitoring system]]\n* [[Runtime intelligence]]\n* [[Sequence of events recorder]]\n* [[SensorML]]\n* [[Shock and vibration data logger]]\n* [[Temperature data logger]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Recording devices]]\n[[Category:Onboard computers]]\n[[Category:Measuring instruments]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|path tracking devices|GPS tracking unit#Data loggers}}\n[[Image:Datalogger.jpg|thumb|Data logger Cube storing technical and sensor data]]\nA '''data logger''' (also '''datalogger''' or '''data recorder''') is an electronic device that records data over time or in relation to location either with a built in [[scientific instrument|instrument]] or [[sensor]] or via external instruments and sensors.

Data logger is generally used for data storage and these are small in size.\n** A [[Holter monitor]] is a portable device for continuously monitoring various electrical activity of the cardiovascular system for at least 24 hours.\n** [[Electronic health record]] loggers.\n* Other general [[data acquisition]] loggers:\n** An (scientific) experimental testing data acquisition tool.\n** Ultra Wideband Data Recorder, high-speed data recording up to 2 GigaSamples per second.\n** An open source data logger based on the [[Raspberry Pi]] computer <ref name=\"rpilogger\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/deguss/rpilogger|title=deguss/rpilogger|author=|date=|website=GitHub}}</ref>\n\n==Future directions==\nData Loggers are changing more rapidly now than ever before.  The original model of a stand-alone data logger is changing to one of a device that collects data but also has access to wireless communications for alarming of events, automatic reporting of data and remote control. Data loggers are beginning to serve web pages for current readings, [[e-mail]] their alarms and [[File transfer protocol|FTP]] their daily results into databases or direct to the users. Very recently, there is a trend to move away from proprietary products with commercial software to open source software and hardware devices. The [[Raspberry Pi]] [[single-board computer]] is among others a popular platform hosting real-time Linux or preemptive-kernel Linux operating systems with many \n* digital interfaces like [[I2C]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface|SPI]] or [[UART]] enabling the direct interconnection of a digital [[sensor]] and a computer,\n* and unlimited number of configurations to show measurements in real-time over the [[internet]], process data, plot charts and diagrams... \nThere are more and more community-developed ([[Open-source model|open source]]) projects for data acquisition / data logging.<ref name=\"rpilogger\" /><ref>http://real.mtak.hu/25714/1/28.pdf</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black box]]\n* [[Bus analyzer]]\n* [[Computer data logging]]: logging APIs, server logs & syslog, web logging & web counters\n* [[Continuous emissions monitoring system]]\n* [[Runtime intelligence]]\n* [[Sequence of events recorder]]\n* [[SensorML]]\n* [[Shock and vibration data logger]]\n* [[Temperature data logger]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Recording devices]]\n[[Category:Onboard computers]]\n[[Category:Measuring instruments]]\n", "name_user": "Pal7306", "label": "safe", "comment": "Data Logger with integrated USB type picture", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_logger"}
