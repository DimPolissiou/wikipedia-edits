Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education == \nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> In addition to Hope, Davis was influenced by Morehouse professors [[Samuel Archer]] and [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]].<ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\"/> Davis attended Morehouse during the ongoing [[Atlanta compromise]] debate between [[Booker T.

As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to ''Second Life''. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker{{Vague|date=May 2015}}, ''Second Life'' contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses.

A Premium membership (US$11.99 monthly, US$32.97 quarterly, or US$99 annually) extends access to an increased level of technical support, and also pays an automatic stipend of L$300/week into the member's avatar account, and after 45 days that resident will receive a L$700 bonus, making it L$1,000 for that week.  This amount has decreased since the original stipend of L$500, which is still paid to older accounts.  Certain accounts created during an earlier period may receive L$400. This stipend, if changed into USD, means that the actual cost for the benefit of extended tech support for an annual payment of US$72 is only about US$14, depending on the currency exchange rates. However, the vast majority of casual users of ''Second Life'' do not upgrade beyond the free \"basic\" account.\n\nAvatars may take any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a combination thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves as they are in real life.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.weburbanist.com/2007/06/17/top-3-look-alike-avatars-and-people-from-second-life-to-real-life/\n|title=Second Life Avatars and their Real Life |publisher=Web Urbanist\n|accessdate = June 18, 2007\n|date=2007-06-17 }}</ref> They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. [[Second Life Culture|''Second Life'' Culture]] consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as ''[[Alternate character|alts]]'').\n\nAvatars can travel via walking, running, vehicular access, flying, or teleportation. Because ''Second Life'' is such a vast virtual world, teleportation is used when avatars wish to travel instantly and efficiently. Once they reach their destination, they may travel in more conventional means at various speeds.\n\nAvatars can communicate via local chat, group chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting is used for localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or among the members of a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other. As of version 1.18.1.2 (2007-Aug-02), voice chat, both local and IM, was also available.\nInstant messages may optionally be sent to a Resident's email when the Resident is logged off, although message length is limited to 4096 bytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlEmail |title=LlEmail \u2013 Second Life Wiki |publisher=Wiki.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIdentities in ''Second Life'' can relate to the users' personality or creating their own character.

At the time of this writing, media on a prim(MOAP) is not a reliable enough way of displaying media and such, sites listed work best with Parcel Media or Parcel Audio.\n\n=== Work solutions ===\n''Second Life'' gives companies the option to create virtual workplaces to allow employees to virtually meet, hold events, practice any kind of corporate communications, conduct training sessions in 3D immersive [[virtual learning environment]], simulate business processes, and prototype new products.\n\n== Criticism and controversy ==\n''Second Life'' has seen a number of controversies, as well. Issues range from the technical ([[Real estate (Second Life)#Budgeting of server resources|budgeting of server resources]]), to moral ([[Second Life issues and criticisms#Pornography|pornography]]), to legal ([[Economy of Second Life#Legal position of the Linden Dollar|legal position of the Linden Dollar]], ''[[Bragg v.

Changes to ''Second Life''{{'}}s Terms of Service in this regard have largely had the purpose of bringing activity within ''Second Life'' into compliance with various international laws, even though the person running the business may be in full compliance with the law in their own country.\n\nOn July 26, 2007, Linden Lab announced a ban on in-world gambling due to federal and state regulations on Internet gambling that could affect Linden Lab if it was permitted to continue.

These include increased system latency, and intermittent client crashes. However, some faults are caused by the system's use of an \"asset server\" cluster, on which the actual data governing objects is stored separately from the areas of the world and the avatars that use those objects. The communication between the main servers and the asset cluster appears to constitute a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] which frequently causes problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massively.com/2008/01/06/second-life-grid-closed-due-to-asset-problems/ |title=Second Life grid closed due to asset problems \u2013 Massively |publisher=Massively.com |author=Tateru Nino |date= January 6, 2008 <!-- at 10:30 am --> |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/features/blog/2008/03/28/resolved-asset-server-issues |title=RESOLVED&#93; Asset Server Issues \u00ab Official Second Life Blog |publisher=Blog.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondlifeinsider.com/2007/06/12/asset-server-issues/ |title=Asset server issues \u2013 Second Life Insider |publisher=Secondlifeinsider.com |author=Eloise PasteurFiled under: LSL, Gridbugs |date= June 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref> Typically, when asset server downtime is announced, users are advised not to build, manipulate objects, or engage in business, leaving them with little to do but chat and generally reducing confidence in all businesses on the grid.\n\nAnother problem is inventory loss,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/UPDATED-Experiencing-inventory-loss-Read-on/ba-p/573214 |title=UPDATED&#93; Experiencing inventory loss?

Linden Lab offers no compensation for items that are lost in this way, although a policy change instituted in 2008 allows accounts to file support tickets when inventory loss occurs. Many in-world businesses will attempt to compensate for this or restore items, although they are under no obligation to do so and not all are able to do so. A recent change in how the company handles items which have \"lost their parent directory\" means that inventory loss is much less of a problem and resolves faster than in recent years. \"Loss to recovery times\" have gone from months (or never) to hours or a day or two for the majority of users, but inventory loss does still exist.\n\n''Second Life'' functions by streaming all data to the user live over the Internet with minimal local caching of frequently used data. The user is expected to have a minimum of 300kbit/s of Internet bandwidth for basic functionality. Due to the proprietary communications protocols, it is not possible to use a network proxy service to reduce network load when many people are all using the same location, such as when used for group activities in a school or business.\n\n=== Quality assurance ===\nCriticism of [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of [[Second Life]] states that [[Linden Lab]] focuses too much on bringing new features to the production environment instead of fixing long-standing bugs that, in the worst case, cause financial loss for the users.

The problem is especially prevalent when large numbers of avatars congregate in one area. The problem is largely due to the fact that the world is entirely user created, and the majority of content created by users is made without any sort of basic graphical optimization. As a result, objects with both unnecessarily high polygon counts, and unnecessarily high resolution textures are prevalent. It is not uncommon for users to have to download and use, upwards of dozens of times, the amount of resources than would actually be required for the equivalent visual result. Certain areas have guidelines for script usage, which helps reduce lag by reducing resources used server-side, but does nothing to alleviate the primary issue above.\n\n=== Congestion ===\nA single region (65536&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of land hosted on a single [[CPU]]) is set to accommodate a limited number of Residents (40 on 'mainland' regions, up to 100 on private islands),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4010|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> causing some popular locations such as teleportation points to become inaccessible at times. It is possible for an area of land a Resident has paid for to become inaccessible because another area in the same region has exhausted the avatar limit.\n\n=== Interface ===\nThe control scheme for ''Second Life'' combines controls useful for 3D editing with those useful for game play, which can be highly unintuitive for many. This requires various combinations of [[Alt key|alt]], [[Control key|ctrl]], and the mouse for basic manipulation of the camera and in-world objects. Also, everything in the player's possession\u2014textures, animations, objects, clothing, sounds, videos\u2014shares a common directory tree, and can quickly become cluttered if not carefully managed.\n\n=== Alternative accounts ===\nThe ability for a single real individual to create an unlimited number of accounts for free could have the effect of highly exaggerating the \"residence\" figures. Blogs and forum posts regularly allege exaggerated membership and performance claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|title=I'll See Your Million\u2026 and Raise You a Million \u00ab Official Second Life Blog|publisher=Blog.secondlife.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203013528/http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|archive-date=2014-02-03|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|title=Linden's Second Life numbers and the press's desire to believe|publisher=Corante|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101072536/http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|archive-date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Customer security ===\nOn September 8, 2006, Linden Lab released a news bulletin that revealed their ''Second Life'' database had been compromised and customer information, including encrypted passwords and users' real names, had likely been accessed.<ref name=\"lindenblog-urgent-security-announcement\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/08/urgent-security-announcement/|title=Urgent Security Announcement|author=Linden, Robin|date=September 8, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref name=\"secondlifedotcom-security-bulletins\">{{cite web|url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|title=Second Life Security Bulletin|author=Linden Lab|date=September 8, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025064746/http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|archivedate=October 25, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> However, it was later revealed that the hacker had in fact been focused on trying to cheat the in-world money system<ref name=\"lindenblog-security-breach-update\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/22/security-breach-update/|title=Security breach update|author=Linden, Ian|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> and their access to personal information was believed incidental, although a full alert was still raised for safety's sake.\n\n=== Fraud and intellectual property protection ===\nAlthough ''Second Life''{{'}}s client and server incorporate [[digital rights management]] technology, the visual data of an object must ultimately be sent to the client in order for it to be drawn; thus unofficial third-party clients can bypass them. One such program, [[CopyBot]], was developed in 2006 as a debugging tool to enable objects to be backed up, but was immediately hijacked for use in copying objects; additionally, programs that generally attack client-side processing of data, such as [[GLIntercept]], can copy certain pieces of data. Such use is prohibited under the ''Second Life'' TOS<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/11/14/use-of-copybot-and-similar-tools-a-tos-violation/\n|title=Use of CopyBot and Similar Tools a ToS Violation\n|publisher=[[Linden Lab]]\n|date=November 14, 2006\n|accessdate = September 9, 2007\n}}</ref> and could be prosecuted under the [[DMCA]].\n\nLinden Lab may ban a user who is observed using CopyBot or a similar client, but it will not ban a user simply for uploading or even selling copied content; in this case, Linden Lab's enforcement of intellectual property law is limited to that required by the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], which requires filing a real-life lawsuit.

As a result, many ''Second Life'' businesses and their intellectual property remains effectively unprotected. Another case where settlement and dismissal was gained may be found in the matter of Eros, LLC v. Linden Research, Inc.

In addition, the technical process of removal and re-instatement of content on ''Second Life'' is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.\n\nMost users in the world as paying, private individuals are, likewise, effectively unprotected. Common forms of fraud taking place in-world include bogus investment and pyramid schemes, fake or hacked vendors, and failure to honor land rental agreements.\nA group of virtual landowners online have filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming the company broke the law when it rescinded their ownership rights.

This has led to occurrences of low-level fraud within ''Second Life'', in which users swindle other users out of money (via [[Linden dollar]]s which are later traded for real money). Linden Lab will not act on such fraud, and the amounts of money involved are usually small enough (less than US$100) that it is unlikely the victim will wish to spend the money and effort involved in real-life legal proceedings.\n\n=== False DMCA takedown notices ===\nThere have been issues with the use of false DMCA [[takedown notice]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com/2008/09/sweet-justice.html|title=~*Fresh Baked Goods*~: Sweet Justice...?|date=September 10, 2008|publisher=Slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Once a DMCA takedown notice is served, reversing it requires an individual to expose his personal information to the filer (filing a notice does not require this); for the penalty of perjury to be enacted, a lawsuit is required (anything less, the false DMCA claimer can just claim it from a different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses).

The fee for 4 OpenSpaces was identical to that for a single private region. However, in March 2008, this rule was modified to permit OpenSpaces to be bought individually and placed elsewhere, as well as increasing the prim load each one could handle. OpenSpaces were made available for a US$415 downpayment plus a US$75 monthly fee.\n\nIn October 2008, Linden Lab announced that the OpenSpaces being used for this purpose were being misused; there was in fact no technical throttle limiting their usage. Linden Lab raised the monthly fee per OpenSpace to US$125, the same cost as half a region; added an avatar limit of 20; and renamed it to Homestead.\n\nA week after the initial announcement Linden Lab stated its intention to add technical limits. A revised Openspace product, with far fewer prims, a no-residency rule, and costing the same monthly amount, was announced.\n\nIn May 2009, Linden Lab announced they were \"grandfathering\" OpenSpace sims (now rebranded as \"Homesteads\"), after a protracted protest movement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2008/10/save-our-open-s.html|title=Open Spaces Protest Closes Nautilus Sim! &#124; The Alphaville Herald|date=|publisher=Foo.secondlifeherald.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> caused a major amount of negative publicity and funded potential litigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sl-newspaper-bnc.blogspot.com/2008/11/intlibber-brautigan-on-openspace-policy.html|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091918/http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/land/blog/2009/05/26/good-news-homestead-pricing-to-be-grandfathered-if-purchased-before-july-1st-2009|title=Land - Second Life|date=|publisher=Blogs.secondlife.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2009}}\nLinden Lab has been accused{{who|date=February 2013}} of manipulation of user count statistics to make the world seem more popular than it is. This includes counting multiple avatars created by the same real person as separate accounts, never removing accounts from the database no matter how long they have been idle, counting accounts which are created for free and which never pay any money into the game equally with those that do, and implementing in-world systems which encourage the creation of bogus extra accounts (for example, \"traffic bots\" which simply remain stationary in a store, causing the system to rank the store as popular because there are people there).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-08/ff_sheep?currentPage=1|title=How Madison Avenue Is Wasting Millions on a Deserted Second Life|author=Frank Rose|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2009-03-08|publisher=Wired.com}}</ref><ref>Rolph, Shaun. \"[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/20/second_life_analysis/ The phony economics of Second Life].\" ''[[The Register]]''.

When a teen turned 18, he/she was transferred from the Teen Grid to the Main Grid. Linden Lab had received controversy for the lack of integration between teens and adults. The teen grid and the adult grid actually were technically parts of one grid called [[Agni]], due to ''Second Life''{{'}}s tradition of naming grids after [[Hindu gods]]. However, teen residents could not access the adult regions, and adult residents could not access the teen regions. Underage users, who were under 18 in real life, were not allowed onto the main grid, and being an underage user there was an offense that could be abuse reported.\n\nOn 19 January 2009, Linden Lab, Philip Linden related (in an interview with Metanomics) an intent to merge the two grids into one.

This included [[Grey goo|Grey Goo]] objects which infinitely reproduce, eventually overwhelming the servers;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6164806.stm |title='Worm' attacks Second Life world |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=BBC News | date=2006-11-20}}</ref> ''orbiters'' which throw an avatar so far upwards they cannot get back down in a reasonable timeframe without teleporting; ''cages'' which surround avatars, preventing them from moving, and similar tools. Although combat between users is sanctioned in certain areas of the world, these objects have been used to cause disruption in all areas. Attacks on the grid itself, such as Grey Goo, are strictly forbidden anywhere on the grid. It was possible to perpetrate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on other users simply by scripting objects that spew screen filling characters from anywhere on the grid to another avatar's location, thereby disabling a clear view to the virtual world. Such attacks were quickly blocked with the use of the \"mute\" tool. Bugs in the client and server software were also exploited by griefers to kick users, crash servers, and revert content; however, such exploits were promptly fixed by Linden Lab. <ref>{{cite web |title=Second Life Bug Tracker |url=https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/STORM-836?filter=-4&jql=ORDER%20BY%20created%20ASC |website=jira.secondlife.com |accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Unauthorized copying of content====\n''Second Life'' features a built-in [[digital rights management]] system that controls the movement of textures, sounds, scripts, and models with the ''Second Life'' servers at Linden Lab. At some point, though, this data must be sent to a user's computer to be displayed or played\u2014an issue fundamental to any system attempting to apply restrictions to digital information.\n\nIn November 2006 controversy arose over a tool called [[CopyBot]], developed as part of [[libsecondlife]] and was intended to allow users to legitimately back up their ''Second Life'' data. For a brief period, an unmodified CopyBot allowed any user to replicate SL items or avatars (although not scripts, which run only on the servers at Linden Lab). Later changes to the SecondLife protocols prevented unmodified copies of CopyBot from working. Nevertheless, the basic issue of users being able to duplicate content that is sent to them remains.\n\nResidents who copy content belonging to other users face being banned from ''Second Life'', but Linden Lab has so far never sued any of these users for copyright infringement; since the resident creators (and not Linden Lab) retain ownership of the rights, it is not clear whether Linden Lab would legally be able to do so. Linden Lab does, however, comply with DMCA [[takedown notice]]s served to them against resident content; serving a DMCA Takedown Notice is the normal procedure recommended by Linden Lab for having copyrighted content illegally resold on ''Second Life''.\n\nAny user who uploads, publishes or submits any content keeps the intellectual property rights of that content, however both Linden Lab and other users gain their own rights from your content. Linden Lab receives a content license from anything a user uploads to the server. Section 7.3 of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service states; \"you hereby automatically grant Linden Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-license able, and transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the content solely for the purpose of providing and promoting the service\".\nA user who uploads their content to a public area also gives a content licence to other users as well, which allows other users to replicate and record for use in Machinima (as outlined in section 7.4, Snapshot and Machinima Policy).<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\">{{cite web |url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/tos.php |title=Second Life Terms of Service |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=Linden Lab | date=2006-11-20}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of what rights and licences are given, Linden Lab takes no responsibility for the outcome of any dispute between users or the server regarding content. Section 10.2 states; \"you release Linden Lab (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users, including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute\". Section 10.3 repeats a similar passage but regarding the responsibility of Linden Lab during any data or technical fault.<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\" />\n\n== International issues ==\n=== Legality ===\n{{OR section|date=June 2017}}\nSecond Life users are expected to obey the laws of their own local countries with regard to their actions in the virtual world; however, a problem can arise in countries which have tough laws regarding material downloaded from the Internet, such as pornography. It is possible, for example, for a US user - even in a non-adult area \u2013 to approach German users and create an object displaying an obscene uploaded image which is illegal under German law but legal under US law. Although the US user has broken the ''Second Life'' terms of services as a result, and faces suspension or banning from ''Second Life'', the German user has broken a real-life sex offense law by downloading the image and faces a far worse penalty. Even if the user is eventually deemed to not be responsible for this download because it was unsolicited, they will still have been investigated for a sex offense. However, no actual prosecutions have resulted from actions of this type so far.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nIn late 2006, Linden Lab announced that, in accordance to sales tax regulations of the [[European Union]] (EU), they are required to charge ''value added tax'' (VAT) to EU residents on all money transactions involving the company. However, Linden Lab waives VAT to users who have a VAT registration ID.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Value_Added_Tax_%28VAT%29_Frequently_Asked_Questions|title = Linden Lab Official:Value Added Tax (VAT) Frequently Asked Questions|date = 29 November 2012|accessdate = 3 September 2014|website = Second Life Wiki|publisher = Linden Lab|last = |first = }}</ref> The introduction of VAT caused controversy with EU users, mostly among content creators who protested that the addition of VAT caused a disadvantage in comparison to competitors living outside the EU.\n\n==Litigation==\n===''Bragg v.

Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred as a result of the case, including a court ruling that parts of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service were unenforceable, due to being an unconscionable [[contract of adhesion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14176 |title=Gamasutra - Judge Rules Against Second Life Terms Of Service |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> The case eventually ended with Bragg's virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out-of-court settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://virtuallyblind.com/2007/10/04/bragg-linden-lab-settlement/ |title=Bragg v.

As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to ''Second Life''. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker{{Vague|date=May 2015}}, ''Second Life'' contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses.

A Premium membership (US$11.99 monthly, US$32.97 quarterly, or US$99 annually) extends access to an increased level of technical support, and also pays an automatic stipend of L$300/week into the member's avatar account, and after 45 days that resident will receive a L$700 bonus, making it L$1,000 for that week.  This amount has decreased since the original stipend of L$500, which is still paid to older accounts.  Certain accounts created during an earlier period may receive L$400. This stipend, if changed into USD, means that the actual cost for the benefit of extended tech support for an annual payment of US$72 is only about US$14, depending on the currency exchange rates. However, the vast majority of casual users of ''Second Life'' do not upgrade beyond the free \"basic\" account.\n\nAvatars may take any form users choose (human, animal, vegetable, mineral, or a combination thereof) or residents may choose to resemble themselves as they are in real life.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.weburbanist.com/2007/06/17/top-3-look-alike-avatars-and-people-from-second-life-to-real-life/\n|title=Second Life Avatars and their Real Life |publisher=Web Urbanist\n|accessdate = June 18, 2007\n|date=2007-06-17 }}</ref> They may choose even more abstract forms, given that almost every aspect of an avatar is fully customizable. [[Second Life Culture|''Second Life'' Culture]] consists of many activities and behaviors that are also present in real life. A single resident account may have only one avatar at a time, although the appearance of this avatar can change between as many different forms as the Resident wishes. Avatar forms, like almost everything else in Second Life, can be either created by the user, or bought pre-made. A single person may also have multiple accounts, and thus appear to be multiple Residents (a person's multiple accounts are referred to as ''[[Alternate character|alts]]'').\n\nAvatars can travel via walking, running, vehicular access, flying, or teleportation. Because ''Second Life'' is such a vast virtual world, teleportation is used when avatars wish to travel instantly and efficiently. Once they reach their destination, they may travel in more conventional means at various speeds.\n\nAvatars can communicate via local chat, group chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting is used for localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or among the members of a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other. As of version 1.18.1.2 (2007-Aug-02), voice chat, both local and IM, was also available.\nInstant messages may optionally be sent to a Resident's email when the Resident is logged off, although message length is limited to 4096 bytes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlEmail |title=LlEmail \u2013 Second Life Wiki |publisher=Wiki.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIdentities in ''Second Life'' can relate to the users' personality or creating their own character. It is based on their decisions on how to express themselves. Most avatars are human, but they can choose to be vampires or animals.

The complexities of those encounters depend on the engagement levels of the people behind the avatars, whether they are engaging Disassociatively (entertainment only), Immersively (as if the avatar was them), or Augmentatively (meaning they engage for a real-life purpose).<ref>Clift, Pamala, \u2033Virgin\u2032s Handbook on Virtual Relationships\u2033, Chapt.6, 2012 (CreateSpace){{ISBN|1463666993}}</ref>\n\n=== Science ===\n''Second Life'' is used for scientific research, collaboration, and data visualization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journal.chemistrycentral.com/content/3/1/14 |title=Chemistry in Second Life |publisher=Journal.chemistrycentral.com |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2010}}</ref> Examples include SciLands, American Chemical Society's ACS Island, Genome, Virginia Tech's SLATE, and Nature Publishing Group's Elucian Islands Village.\n\n=== Social network ===\n''Second Life'' can be a real-time, immersive social space for people including those with physical or mental disabilities that impair their first lives, who often find comfort and security interacting through anonymous avatars. (Indeed, some academics believe using ''Second Life'' might even help improve motor ability for people with [[Parkinson\u2019s disease]].).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/06/23/second-life-turns-10-what-it-did-wrong-and-why-it-will-have-its-own-second-life/ |title=Second Life turns 10: what it did wrong, and why it may have its own second life \u2014 Tech News and Analysis |publisher=Gigaom.com |date= 2013-06-23|accessdate=2014-08-01}}</ref> An example of how ''Second Life'' has been used by disabled people is [[Wheelies]], the widely publicised disability themed nightclub founded by [[Simon James Stevens|Simon Stevens]].\n\n=== Music streams ===\nShoutCast and Icecast Internet radio stations can be streamed into a land parcel in ''Second Life''. Streaming codecs are currently MP3 as AAC and OGG are not currently supported. There are [https://casthost.net internet radio providers] that offer these services or select from a [http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Music_streams#Second_Life_Musicians list] compiled by Lindal Kidd and is updated whenever by whoever as there's no officiant for it. At the time of this writing, media on a prim(MOAP) is not a reliable enough way of displaying media and such, sites listed work best with Parcel Media or Parcel Audio.\n\n=== Work solutions ===\n''Second Life'' gives companies the option to create virtual workplaces to allow employees to virtually meet, hold events, practice any kind of corporate communications, conduct training sessions in 3D immersive [[virtual learning environment]], simulate business processes, and prototype new products.\n\n== Criticism and controversy ==\n''Second Life'' has seen a number of controversies, as well. Issues range from the technical ([[Real estate (Second Life)#Budgeting of server resources|budgeting of server resources]]), to moral ([[Second Life issues and criticisms#Pornography|pornography]]), to legal ([[Economy of Second Life#Legal position of the Linden Dollar|legal position of the Linden Dollar]], ''[[Bragg v. Linden Lab]]''). Security issues have also been a concern.\n\n=== Regulation ===\nIn the past, large portions of the ''Second Life'' economy consisted of businesses that are regulated or banned. Changes to ''Second Life''{{'}}s Terms of Service in this regard have largely had the purpose of bringing activity within ''Second Life'' into compliance with various international laws, even though the person running the business may be in full compliance with the law in their own country.\n\nOn July 26, 2007, Linden Lab announced a ban on in-world gambling due to federal and state regulations on Internet gambling that could affect Linden Lab if it was permitted to continue. The ban was immediately met with in-world protests.<ref name=\"libsl-sl-gambling-banned\">{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201201441|\ntitle=Gambling Banned in Second Life|\naccessdate = 2007-07-26}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2007, a $750,000 in-world Linden Dollar bank or ponsi scheme called [[Ginko Financial]] collapsed due to a [[bank run]] triggered by Linden Lab's ban on gambling.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ginko Financial's End-Game |url=http://alphavilleherald.com/2007/08/ginko-financial-2.html |website=The Alpha Herald |accessdate=28 November 2019 |date=6 August 2007}}</ref> The aftershocks of this collapse caused severe liquidity problems for other virtual \"Linden Dollar banks\", which critics had long asserted were scams.

These include increased system latency, and intermittent client crashes. However, some faults are caused by the system's use of an \"asset server\" cluster, on which the actual data governing objects is stored separately from the areas of the world and the avatars that use those objects. The communication between the main servers and the asset cluster appears to constitute a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] which frequently causes problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massively.com/2008/01/06/second-life-grid-closed-due-to-asset-problems/ |title=Second Life grid closed due to asset problems \u2013 Massively |publisher=Massively.com |author=Tateru Nino |date= January 6, 2008 <!-- at 10:30 am --> |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/features/blog/2008/03/28/resolved-asset-server-issues |title=RESOLVED&#93; Asset Server Issues \u00ab Official Second Life Blog |publisher=Blog.secondlife.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondlifeinsider.com/2007/06/12/asset-server-issues/ |title=Asset server issues \u2013 Second Life Insider |publisher=Secondlifeinsider.com |author=Eloise PasteurFiled under: LSL, Gridbugs |date= June 12, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}</ref> Typically, when asset server downtime is announced, users are advised not to build, manipulate objects, or engage in business, leaving them with little to do but chat and generally reducing confidence in all businesses on the grid.\n\nAnother problem is inventory loss,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/UPDATED-Experiencing-inventory-loss-Read-on/ba-p/573214 |title=UPDATED&#93; Experiencing inventory loss?

Linden Lab offers no compensation for items that are lost in this way, although a policy change instituted in 2008 allows accounts to file support tickets when inventory loss occurs. Many in-world businesses will attempt to compensate for this or restore items, although they are under no obligation to do so and not all are able to do so. A recent change in how the company handles items which have \"lost their parent directory\" means that inventory loss is much less of a problem and resolves faster than in recent years. \"Loss to recovery times\" have gone from months (or never) to hours or a day or two for the majority of users, but inventory loss does still exist.\n\n''Second Life'' functions by streaming all data to the user live over the Internet with minimal local caching of frequently used data. The user is expected to have a minimum of 300kbit/s of Internet bandwidth for basic functionality. Due to the proprietary communications protocols, it is not possible to use a network proxy service to reduce network load when many people are all using the same location, such as when used for group activities in a school or business.\n\n=== Quality assurance ===\nCriticism of [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] of [[Second Life]] states that [[Linden Lab]] focuses too much on bringing new features to the production environment instead of fixing long-standing bugs that, in the worst case, cause financial loss for the users. On April 30, 2007, an open letter signed by over 3,000<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter-signers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.projectopenletter.com/News.aspx|title=Open Letters News, 5/1/2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503011341/http://www.projectopenletter.com/News.aspx|archivedate=May 3, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> users was sent to Linden Lab to protest the [[Software Quality Assurance|quality assurance]] process of the company.<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.projectopenletter.com/|title=Project Open Letter|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602235847/http://projectopenletter.com/|archive-date=2007-06-02|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref> Linden Lab has responded to the open letter.<ref name=\"secondlife-openletter-response\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/04/30/project-open-letter/|title=Response to the Open Letter|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506125440/http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/04/30/project-open-letter/|archivedate=May 6, 2007|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Frame rate ===\nComputer hardware and Internet connections capable of smoothly rendering high quality content in other [[MMOG]]s may perform poorly in ''Second Life'', resulting in low [[frame rate]]s and unresponsive controls on even minimal graphical configurations. The problem is especially prevalent when large numbers of avatars congregate in one area. The problem is largely due to the fact that the world is entirely user created, and the majority of content created by users is made without any sort of basic graphical optimization. As a result, objects with both unnecessarily high polygon counts, and unnecessarily high resolution textures are prevalent. It is not uncommon for users to have to download and use, upwards of dozens of times, the amount of resources than would actually be required for the equivalent visual result. Certain areas have guidelines for script usage, which helps reduce lag by reducing resources used server-side, but does nothing to alleviate the primary issue above.\n\n=== Congestion ===\nA single region (65536&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of land hosted on a single [[CPU]]) is set to accommodate a limited number of Residents (40 on 'mainland' regions, up to 100 on private islands),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.secondlife.com/ics/support/KBAnswer.asp?questionID=4010|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> causing some popular locations such as teleportation points to become inaccessible at times. It is possible for an area of land a Resident has paid for to become inaccessible because another area in the same region has exhausted the avatar limit.\n\n=== Interface ===\nThe control scheme for ''Second Life'' combines controls useful for 3D editing with those useful for game play, which can be highly unintuitive for many. This requires various combinations of [[Alt key|alt]], [[Control key|ctrl]], and the mouse for basic manipulation of the camera and in-world objects. Also, everything in the player's possession\u2014textures, animations, objects, clothing, sounds, videos\u2014shares a common directory tree, and can quickly become cluttered if not carefully managed.\n\n=== Alternative accounts ===\nThe ability for a single real individual to create an unlimited number of accounts for free could have the effect of highly exaggerating the \"residence\" figures. Blogs and forum posts regularly allege exaggerated membership and performance claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|title=I'll See Your Million\u2026 and Raise You a Million \u00ab Official Second Life Blog|publisher=Blog.secondlife.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203013528/http://community.secondlife.com/t5/Features/I-ll-See-Your-Million-and-Raise-You-a-Million/ba-p/544153|archive-date=2014-02-03|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|title=Linden's Second Life numbers and the press's desire to believe|publisher=Corante|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101072536/http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/12/26/lindens_second_life_numbers_and_the_presss_desire_to_believe.php|archive-date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2007-06-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Customer security ===\nOn September 8, 2006, Linden Lab released a news bulletin that revealed their ''Second Life'' database had been compromised and customer information, including encrypted passwords and users' real names, had likely been accessed.<ref name=\"lindenblog-urgent-security-announcement\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/08/urgent-security-announcement/|title=Urgent Security Announcement|author=Linden, Robin|date=September 8, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref><ref name=\"secondlifedotcom-security-bulletins\">{{cite web|url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|title=Second Life Security Bulletin|author=Linden Lab|date=September 8, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025064746/http://secondlife.com/corporate/bulletin.php|archivedate=October 25, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> However, it was later revealed that the hacker had in fact been focused on trying to cheat the in-world money system<ref name=\"lindenblog-security-breach-update\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/09/22/security-breach-update/|title=Security breach update|author=Linden, Ian|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref> and their access to personal information was believed incidental, although a full alert was still raised for safety's sake.\n\n=== Fraud and intellectual property protection ===\nAlthough ''Second Life''{{'}}s client and server incorporate [[digital rights management]] technology, the visual data of an object must ultimately be sent to the client in order for it to be drawn; thus unofficial third-party clients can bypass them. One such program, [[CopyBot]], was developed in 2006 as a debugging tool to enable objects to be backed up, but was immediately hijacked for use in copying objects; additionally, programs that generally attack client-side processing of data, such as [[GLIntercept]], can copy certain pieces of data. Such use is prohibited under the ''Second Life'' TOS<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://blog.secondlife.com/2006/11/14/use-of-copybot-and-similar-tools-a-tos-violation/\n|title=Use of CopyBot and Similar Tools a ToS Violation\n|publisher=[[Linden Lab]]\n|date=November 14, 2006\n|accessdate = September 9, 2007\n}}</ref> and could be prosecuted under the [[DMCA]].\n\nLinden Lab may ban a user who is observed using CopyBot or a similar client, but it will not ban a user simply for uploading or even selling copied content; in this case, Linden Lab's enforcement of intellectual property law is limited to that required by the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], which requires filing a real-life lawsuit.

As a result, many ''Second Life'' businesses and their intellectual property remains effectively unprotected. Another case where settlement and dismissal was gained may be found in the matter of Eros, LLC v. Linden Research, Inc. As of October 7, 2010, the case was transferred to private mediation and the plaintiffs filed for dismissal of charges on March 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patentarcade.com/2010/06/case-update-eros-llc-v-linden-research_21.html |title=Eros v.

In addition, the technical process of removal and re-instatement of content on ''Second Life'' is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.\n\nMost users in the world as paying, private individuals are, likewise, effectively unprotected. Common forms of fraud taking place in-world include bogus investment and pyramid schemes, fake or hacked vendors, and failure to honor land rental agreements.\nA group of virtual landowners online have filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming the company broke the law when it rescinded their ownership rights. The plaintiffs say a change in the terms of service forced them to either accept new terms that rescinded their virtual property ownership rights, or else be locked out of the site.<ref>{{cite web |title=Class Action Lawsuit Targets Second Life |website= CNET |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20004004-36.html}}</ref>\n\n=== The Emerald client and in-world logging scripts ===\nThe Emerald client was developed by a group of users based on Snowglobe, an opensource fork of the Second Life client.

This has led to occurrences of low-level fraud within ''Second Life'', in which users swindle other users out of money (via [[Linden dollar]]s which are later traded for real money). Linden Lab will not act on such fraud, and the amounts of money involved are usually small enough (less than US$100) that it is unlikely the victim will wish to spend the money and effort involved in real-life legal proceedings.\n\n=== False DMCA takedown notices ===\nThere have been issues with the use of false DMCA [[takedown notice]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com/2008/09/sweet-justice.html|title=~*Fresh Baked Goods*~: Sweet Justice...?|date=September 10, 2008|publisher=Slfreshbakedgoods.blogspot.com|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> Once a DMCA takedown notice is served, reversing it requires an individual to expose his personal information to the filer (filing a notice does not require this); for the penalty of perjury to be enacted, a lawsuit is required (anything less, the false DMCA claimer can just claim it from a different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses). In addition, the technical process of removal and re-instatement of content on ''Second Life'' is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.\n\nA group of virtual landowners online have filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming the company broke the law when it rescinded their ownership rights. The plaintiffs say a change in the terms of service forced them to either accept new terms that rescinded their virtual property ownership rights, or else be locked out of the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-20004004-36.html|title=Class Action Lawsuit Targets Second Life|date=3 May 2010|publisher=news.cnet.com|accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Terms of Service changes ===\nLinden Lab typically offer no compensation when a change to the platform or Terms of Service is made, even when it has a serious negative effect on users.

The fee for 4 OpenSpaces was identical to that for a single private region. However, in March 2008, this rule was modified to permit OpenSpaces to be bought individually and placed elsewhere, as well as increasing the prim load each one could handle. OpenSpaces were made available for a US$415 downpayment plus a US$75 monthly fee.\n\nIn October 2008, Linden Lab announced that the OpenSpaces being used for this purpose were being misused; there was in fact no technical throttle limiting their usage. Linden Lab raised the monthly fee per OpenSpace to US$125, the same cost as half a region; added an avatar limit of 20; and renamed it to Homestead.\n\nA week after the initial announcement Linden Lab stated its intention to add technical limits. A revised Openspace product, with far fewer prims, a no-residency rule, and costing the same monthly amount, was announced.\n\nIn May 2009, Linden Lab announced they were \"grandfathering\" OpenSpace sims (now rebranded as \"Homesteads\"), after a protracted protest movement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foo.secondlifeherald.com/slh/2008/10/save-our-open-s.html|title=Open Spaces Protest Closes Nautilus Sim! &#124; The Alphaville Herald|date=|publisher=Foo.secondlifeherald.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref> caused a major amount of negative publicity and funded potential litigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sl-newspaper-bnc.blogspot.com/2008/11/intlibber-brautigan-on-openspace-policy.html|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091918/http://www.ace-exchange.com/symbol/SOS/profile|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.secondlife.com/community/land/blog/2009/05/26/good-news-homestead-pricing-to-be-grandfathered-if-purchased-before-july-1st-2009|title=Land - Second Life|date=|publisher=Blogs.secondlife.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2009}}\nLinden Lab has been accused{{who|date=February 2013}} of manipulation of user count statistics to make the world seem more popular than it is. This includes counting multiple avatars created by the same real person as separate accounts, never removing accounts from the database no matter how long they have been idle, counting accounts which are created for free and which never pay any money into the game equally with those that do, and implementing in-world systems which encourage the creation of bogus extra accounts (for example, \"traffic bots\" which simply remain stationary in a store, causing the system to rank the store as popular because there are people there).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-08/ff_sheep?currentPage=1|title=How Madison Avenue Is Wasting Millions on a Deserted Second Life|author=Frank Rose|date=2007-07-24|accessdate=2009-03-08|publisher=Wired.com}}</ref><ref>Rolph, Shaun. \"[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/02/20/second_life_analysis/ The phony economics of Second Life].\" ''[[The Register]]''.

When a teen turned 18, he/she was transferred from the Teen Grid to the Main Grid. Linden Lab had received controversy for the lack of integration between teens and adults. The teen grid and the adult grid actually were technically parts of one grid called [[Agni]], due to ''Second Life''{{'}}s tradition of naming grids after [[Hindu gods]]. However, teen residents could not access the adult regions, and adult residents could not access the teen regions. Underage users, who were under 18 in real life, were not allowed onto the main grid, and being an underage user there was an offense that could be abuse reported.\n\nOn 19 January 2009, Linden Lab, Philip Linden related (in an interview with Metanomics) an intent to merge the two grids into one. This immediately attracted uproar on SL's private forums, largely from residents who feared they would be required to use the unpopular age verification system, and would be permanently under threat of a false sex-related allegation or lawsuit by a teenager or his/her parents.\n\nThe Main and Teen Grids were merged, with the Teen Grid being partially split up by age. Residents aged 13\u201317 are allowed to access General Rated areas only.<ref name=\"lindenlab.com\"/> The Teen Grid continues to exist in its original location on the Agni, but is now accessible by all residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.secondlife.com/t5/English-Knowledge-Base/Maturity-ratings/ta-p/700119#What_are_maturity_ratings.3F|title=Maturity ratings - Second Life|date=|publisher=Community.secondlife.com|accessdate=2014-07-09}}</ref>\n\n=== Content ===\n==== Sex ====\nIn ''Second Life'', users can do almost anything that they can do in their physical lives.

Although combat between users is sanctioned in certain areas of the world, these objects have been used to cause disruption in all areas. Attacks on the grid itself, such as Grey Goo, are strictly forbidden anywhere on the grid. It was possible to perpetrate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks on other users simply by scripting objects that spew screen filling characters from anywhere on the grid to another avatar's location, thereby disabling a clear view to the virtual world. Such attacks were quickly blocked with the use of the \"mute\" tool. Bugs in the client and server software were also exploited by griefers to kick users, crash servers, and revert content; however, such exploits were promptly fixed by Linden Lab. <ref>{{cite web |title=Second Life Bug Tracker |url=https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/STORM-836?filter=-4&jql=ORDER%20BY%20created%20ASC |website=jira.secondlife.com |accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Unauthorized copying of content====\n''Second Life'' features a built-in [[digital rights management]] system that controls the movement of textures, sounds, scripts, and models with the ''Second Life'' servers at Linden Lab. At some point, though, this data must be sent to a user's computer to be displayed or played\u2014an issue fundamental to any system attempting to apply restrictions to digital information.\n\nIn November 2006 controversy arose over a tool called [[CopyBot]], developed as part of [[libsecondlife]] and was intended to allow users to legitimately back up their ''Second Life'' data. For a brief period, an unmodified CopyBot allowed any user to replicate SL items or avatars (although not scripts, which run only on the servers at Linden Lab). Later changes to the SecondLife protocols prevented unmodified copies of CopyBot from working. Nevertheless, the basic issue of users being able to duplicate content that is sent to them remains.\n\nResidents who copy content belonging to other users face being banned from ''Second Life'', but Linden Lab has so far never sued any of these users for copyright infringement; since the resident creators (and not Linden Lab) retain ownership of the rights, it is not clear whether Linden Lab would legally be able to do so. Linden Lab does, however, comply with DMCA [[takedown notice]]s served to them against resident content; serving a DMCA Takedown Notice is the normal procedure recommended by Linden Lab for having copyrighted content illegally resold on ''Second Life''.\n\nAny user who uploads, publishes or submits any content keeps the intellectual property rights of that content, however both Linden Lab and other users gain their own rights from your content. Linden Lab receives a content license from anything a user uploads to the server. Section 7.3 of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service states; \"you hereby automatically grant Linden Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sub-license able, and transferable licence to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the content solely for the purpose of providing and promoting the service\".\nA user who uploads their content to a public area also gives a content licence to other users as well, which allows other users to replicate and record for use in Machinima (as outlined in section 7.4, Snapshot and Machinima Policy).<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\">{{cite web |url=http://secondlife.com/corporate/tos.php |title=Second Life Terms of Service |accessdate=2007-01-23 | work=Linden Lab | date=2006-11-20}}</ref>\n\nRegardless of what rights and licences are given, Linden Lab takes no responsibility for the outcome of any dispute between users or the server regarding content. Section 10.2 states; \"you release Linden Lab (and its officers, directors, shareholders, agents, subsidiaries, and employees) from claims, demands, losses, liabilities and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any dispute you have or claim to have with one or more users, including whether or not Linden Lab becomes involved in any resolution or attempted resolution of the dispute\". Section 10.3 repeats a similar passage but regarding the responsibility of Linden Lab during any data or technical fault.<ref name=\"Second Life Terms of Service\" />\n\n== International issues ==\n=== Legality ===\n{{OR section|date=June 2017}}\nSecond Life users are expected to obey the laws of their own local countries with regard to their actions in the virtual world; however, a problem can arise in countries which have tough laws regarding material downloaded from the Internet, such as pornography. It is possible, for example, for a US user - even in a non-adult area \u2013 to approach German users and create an object displaying an obscene uploaded image which is illegal under German law but legal under US law. Although the US user has broken the ''Second Life'' terms of services as a result, and faces suspension or banning from ''Second Life'', the German user has broken a real-life sex offense law by downloading the image and faces a far worse penalty. Even if the user is eventually deemed to not be responsible for this download because it was unsolicited, they will still have been investigated for a sex offense. However, no actual prosecutions have resulted from actions of this type so far.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nIn late 2006, Linden Lab announced that, in accordance to sales tax regulations of the [[European Union]] (EU), they are required to charge ''value added tax'' (VAT) to EU residents on all money transactions involving the company. However, Linden Lab waives VAT to users who have a VAT registration ID.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Linden_Lab_Official:Value_Added_Tax_%28VAT%29_Frequently_Asked_Questions|title = Linden Lab Official:Value Added Tax (VAT) Frequently Asked Questions|date = 29 November 2012|accessdate = 3 September 2014|website = Second Life Wiki|publisher = Linden Lab|last = |first = }}</ref> The introduction of VAT caused controversy with EU users, mostly among content creators who protested that the addition of VAT caused a disadvantage in comparison to competitors living outside the EU.\n\n==Litigation==\n===''Bragg v. Linden Lab''===\n{{Main|Bragg v. Linden Lab}}\nIn 2006, attorney Marc Bragg sued Linden Lab, claiming that it had illegally deprived him of access to his account<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/news/2006/05/70909 |title=Second Life Land Deal Goes Sour |publisher=Wired.com |date= 2006-05-18|accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> after he discovered a loophole in the online land auction system which allowed regions to be purchased at prices below [[reserve price|reserve]]. Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred as a result of the case, including a court ruling that parts of the ''Second Life'' Terms of Service were unenforceable, due to being an unconscionable [[contract of adhesion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=14176 |title=Gamasutra - Judge Rules Against Second Life Terms Of Service |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref> The case eventually ended with Bragg's virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out-of-court settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://virtuallyblind.com/2007/10/04/bragg-linden-lab-settlement/ |title=Bragg v.

Many of Bragg's legal arguments rested on the claim\u2014advertised on Linden Lab web site\u2014that virtual land within ''Second Life'' could be \"owned\" by the purchasing user, which was removed shortly after the settlement,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vintfalken.com/second-life-a-world-imagined-created-and-owned-by-its-residents-no-more/ |title=Second Life, a world imagined, created, and owned by its residents no more. &#124; VintFalken.com |publisher=Vintfalken.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225041758/http://www.vintfalken.com/second-life-a-world-imagined-created-and-owned-by-its-residents-no-more/ |archive-date=2008-12-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> leading to speculation that this was part of the reason for the settlement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technollama.blogspot.com/2007/10/bragg-v-linden-labs.html |title=TechnoLlama: Bragg v Linden Labs |publisher=Technollama.blogspot.com |date=October 19, 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-27}}</ref>\n\n===''Eros, LLC and Grei v.

The judge did rule that there was a basis to turn the litigation into a class action, and that there were two classes under which claimants could file claims. The primary class was those who suffered economic damages to their livelihoods, through loss of their business revenues in SL. The secondary class was those who suffered property losses from loss of land, money on hand, and virtual goods in avatar inventories.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14994713406594842869&q=%22evans+v+linden+research%22&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5&as_ylo=2012|title=Google Scholar}}</ref> In May 2013, attorney for defendants negotiated a settlement agreement with one of the lead attorneys that, in plain language, agreed to refund region setup fees for private island owners, pay land owners 2 Linden Dollars per square meter of virtual land, refund all L$ and USD amounts in the plaintiffs' accounts at the time of suspension, and allow the plaintiffs the option of either receiving $15US as compensation for loss of accounts and inventory virtual goods OR restoration of their accounts in order to sell their goods on the SL Marketplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alphavilleherald.com/2013/11/refunds-for-banned-second-life-players-shock.html|title=Refunds For Banned Second Life Players!!
