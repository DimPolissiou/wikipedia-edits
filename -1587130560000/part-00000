Despite the name, the station is located in the neighborhood of [[Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn|Fort Hamilton]] (as its original name implied) at the intersection of 95th Street and Fourth Avenue in southwestern [[Brooklyn]]. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe station was first planned in 1922 as the first part of an extension to [[Staten Island]] through [[Staten Island Tunnel|a tunnel]] under [[the Narrows]]. Construction began on December 17, 1923, after the construction contractor submitted, withdrew, and resubmitted its bid. The station opened on October 31, 1925, but the Staten Island extension was never built due to various funding disputes. The platform was lengthened in the 1960s.\n\n==History==\n\nOn August 25, 1922, the Transit Commission directed its chief engineer, [[Robert Ridgway (engineer)|Robert Ridgeway]], to plan an extension of the Fourth Avenue Line from 87th Street to Fort Hamilton. Initially, multiple stations along the extension were considered. This extension was to be the first part of an extension to [[Staten Island]] through a [[Staten Island Tunnel|tunnel]] under [[The Narrows]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/08/26/99061314.pdf|title=TO EXTEND SUBWAY TO FORT HAMILTON; Transit Commission Orders Plans for Lengthening the Fourth Avenue Line.

Despite the name, the station is located in the neighborhood of [[Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn|Fort Hamilton]] (as its original name implied) at the intersection of 95th Street and Fourth Avenue in southwestern [[Brooklyn]]. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe station was first planned in 1922 as the first part of an extension to [[Staten Island]] through [[Staten Island Tunnel|a tunnel]] under [[the Narrows]]. Construction began on December 17, 1923, after the construction contractor submitted, withdrew, and resubmitted its bid. The station opened on October 31, 1925, but the Staten Island extension was never built due to various funding disputes. The platform was lengthened in the 1960s.\n\n==History==\n\nOn August 25, 1922, the Transit Commission directed its chief engineer, [[Robert Ridgway (engineer)|Robert Ridgeway]], to plan an extension of the Fourth Avenue Line from 87th Street to Fort Hamilton. Initially, multiple stations along the extension were considered. This extension was to be the first part of an extension to [[Staten Island]] through a [[Staten Island Tunnel|tunnel]] under [[The Narrows]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/08/26/99061314.pdf|title=TO EXTEND SUBWAY TO FORT HAMILTON; Transit Commission Orders Plans for Lengthening the Fourth Avenue Line.

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two [[Island platform|island platforms]], only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916 as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. An elevator is being installed at the 86th Street station between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several [[New York City Transit]] bus routes.\n\n==History==\nOn January 24, 1913, construction began on Route 11B2, which includes this station and extends between 61st Street and 89th Street.

It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four-track express station with two [[Island platform|island platforms]], only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916 as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from [[59th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|59th Street]] to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. An elevator is being installed at the 86th Street station between 2018 and 2020.\n\nThe 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several [[New York City Transit]] bus routes.\n\n==History==\nOn January 24, 1913, construction began on Route 11B2, which includes this station and extends between 61st Street and 89th Street. Construction was completed on this section in 1915.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzKvSWhrQBW4d3pvOGZaSERiZEhpQ24xT19DTktkQUVlLW5j/view|title=New York Division ERA Bulletin May 1961|last=Rogoff|first=David|date=May 1961|work=Google Docs|access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref> 86th Street opened on January 15, 1916 as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 59th Street to 86th Street.<ref name=\"Station Opening\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/55570240|title=Subway Running To Eighty-Sixth Street Starts Building Boom In Bay Ridge|date=January 15, 1916|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=June 29, 2015|newspaper=[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpglAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA252|title=Documents of the Senate of the State of New York|last=Senate|first=New York (State) Legislature|date=January 1, 1917|language=en}}</ref> The station was the original terminal for the line until a one-stop southward extension to [[Bay Ridge\u201395th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Bay Ridge\u201395th Street]] opened on October 25, 1925.<ref name=\"NYTimes-95StBids-March1925\">{{cite web|title=Subway Bids Announced: For 95th Street Terminal, Brooklyn, and Corona Yard|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1925/03/01/105017557.pdf|website=[[The New York Times|nytimes.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=March 1, 1925}}</ref>\n\nThe platforms were originally {{Convert|435|feet|meters}} long, allowing for six-car local trains.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XoxBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18&dq=4th+Avenue+line&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGh7jL3tnTAhUByyYKHZe8BXIQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=4th%20Avenue%20line&f=false|title=Fourth Avenue Subway, Brooklyn's New Transportation Line: A Part of the Dual System of Rapid Transit of the City of New York|last=|first=|date=June 19, 1915|publisher=Public Service Commission|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref> On February 16, 1925, the [[New York City Board of Transportation]] directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at twelve stations along the Fourth Avenue Line, including this station, to accommodate eight-car trains at the cost of $633,000.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1925/02/17/archives/12-bm-t-stations-to-be-lengthehed-transportation-board-orders.html|title=12 B-M.

The station opened on June 22, 1915 as the terminal of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1925, and again in the 1960s. The station was also renovated to be [[ADA-accessible]] between 2018 and 2020.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe 59th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line.
