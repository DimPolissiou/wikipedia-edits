[[Benedict Arnold]] was a militia leader from Connecticut who had arrived with his unit in support of the [[Siege of Boston]]; he proposed to the Massachusetts Committee of Safety that [[Fort Ticonderoga]] on [[Lake Champlain]] in the [[Province of New York]] be captured from its small British garrison.  One reason that he gave to justify the move was the presence of heavy weaponry at Ticonderoga.  On May 3, the committee gave Arnold a Massachusetts colonel's commission and authorized the operation.<ref>Martin (1997), pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nThe idea to capture Ticonderoga had also been raised to [[Ethan Allen]] and the [[Green Mountain Boys]] in the disputed [[New Hampshire Grants]] territory in Vermont.<ref>Martin (1997), p. 67</ref>  Allen and Arnold joined forces, and a force of 83 men [[Capture of Fort Ticonderoga|captured the fort]] without a fight on May 10.

He eventually abandoned the idea of transporting the armaments to Boston and resigned his commission.<ref>Martin (1997), pp. 80\u201395</ref>\n\n==Expedition planning==\nIn July 1775, [[George Washington]] assumed command of the forces outside Boston,<ref>N.

Andr\u00e9 had been taken prisoner during the [[Siege of Fort St. Jean]] and was on his way south to a prison camp.  The two were of a similar age and temperament, and found much common ground to talk about.<ref>Callahan (1958), p. 39</ref> The next time they met, however, Knox presided over the court martial which convicted and sentenced Andr\u00e9 to death for his role in Benedict Arnold's treason.<ref>Callahan (1958), p. 40</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:HenryKnoxTrail.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The apparent route of the expedition, overlaid on a 1779 map]]\nKnox's letters and diaries provide the primary sources for much of the daily activity in this journey. His description is detailed for some of the events and dates, but there are also significant gaps, and significant portions of the journey are poorly documented, especially much of the Massachusetts section.  Some of these gaps occur because Knox did not write about them, and others because pages are missing from the diary.<ref>See the diary contents at Knox (1876), pp. 322\u201326</ref> Other sources confirm some of Knox's details or report additional details, but parts of the route are not known with certainty, and modern descriptions of those parts are based on what is known about Massachusetts roads at the time, including the placement of markers for the [[Henry Knox Trail]].<ref>See the inventory record for marker 21 on the trail.</ref> Regardless, the route was more or less in the corridor of today's Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90).\n\n==Albany==\nUpon arrival at Ticonderoga, Knox immediately set about identifying the equipment to take and organizing its transport.<ref name=\"Brooks40\">N. Brooks (1900), p. 40</ref>  He selected 59 pieces of equipment, including cannons ranging in size from 4- to [[24-pounder long gun|24-pounders]], mortars, and howitzers.  He estimated the total weight to be transported at 119,000 pounds (about 60 tons or 54 metric tons).  The largest pieces were the 24-pounders which were {{convert|11|ft|m}} long and estimated to weigh over {{convert|5000|lb|kg}}.<ref name=W19/>\n\nThe equipment was first carried overland from Ticonderoga to the northern end of [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], where most of the train was loaded onto a scow-like ship called a [[gundalow]].<ref name=W19/>  On December 6, the gundalow set sail for the southern end of the lake, with Knox sailing ahead in a small boat.  Ice was already beginning to cover the lake, but the gundalow reached Sabbath Day Point, after grounding once on a submerged rock.  They sailed on again the next day, with Knox going ahead. He reached Fort George in good time, but the gundalow did not appear when expected. A boat went to check on its progress and reported that the gundalow had foundered and sunk not far from Sabbath Day Point. This appeared to be a serious setback at first, but Knox's brother William, captain of the gundalow, reported that she had foundered but her gunnels were above the water line, and that she could be bailed out.  This was done, the ship was refloated, and the gundalow arrived at the southern end of the lake two days later.<ref name=W20>Ware (2000), p. 20</ref>\n[[File:Schuyler.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Philip Schuyler]]]]\n\nOn December 17, 1775, Knox wrote to Washington that he had built \"42 exceeding strong sleds, and have provided 80 yoke of oxen to drag them as far as [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]\",<ref name=W21_2>Ware (2000), pp. 21\u201322</ref> and that he hoped \"in 16 or 17 days to be able to present your Excellency a noble train of artillery\".<ref name=\"Brooks40\"/> He then set out for Albany ahead of the train, crossed the frozen [[Hudson River]] at [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]], and proceeded on through [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]] to reach [[Lansingburg, New York]] on Christmas Day. Two feet (0.6 m) of snow fell that day, slowing his progress, as the snow-covered route needed to be broken open. He finally reached Albany the next day, again slowed by significant snow on the ground. There he met with General [[Philip Schuyler]], and the two of them worked over the next few days to locate and send north equipment and personnel to assist in moving the train south from Lake George. The snowfall was sufficient to enable sleds to move the train overland, but the river ice was still too thin to move it over the Hudson. Knox and his men tried to accelerate the process of thickening the river ice by pouring additional water on top of existing ice. The first of the cannon arrived at Albany by January 4, but some cannons crashed through the ice into the river on the way to Albany, and again on crossing the Hudson heading east toward Massachusetts.  In every instance, however, the cannon was recovered.  On January 9, the last of cannons had crossed the Hudson, and Knox rode ahead to oversee the next stage of the journey.<ref>[[#Diary|Knox (1867)]], pp. 323\u2013324.

He reached the vicinity of [[Claverack, New York]] on January 9, 1776 and proceeded through the [[Berkshires]], reaching [[Blandford, Massachusetts]] two days later.<ref>Knox (1867), p. 325</ref>  There the lead crew refused to continue owing to a lack of snow and the upcoming steep descent to the [[Connecticut River]] valley, but Knox hired additional oxen and persuaded the crew to go on.  As the train moved east, news of it spread and people came out to watch it pass.  In [[Westfield, Massachusetts]], Knox loaded one of the big guns with powder and fired it to the applause of the assembled crowd.<ref name=W24>Ware (2000), p. 24</ref>\n\nAt Springfield, Knox had to hire new work crews, as his New York-based crews wanted to return home.<ref>Callahan (1958), p. 54</ref>  [[John Adams]] reported seeing the artillery train pass through [[Framingham, Massachusetts]] on January 25, and Knox arrived in Cambridge two days later and personally reported to Washington that they had arrived.  According to Knox's accounting, he spent \u00a3521 on an operation that he had hoped would take two weeks but actually took ten weeks.<ref>Drake (1873), p. 23</ref>\n\n==Arrival==\n{{further|Fortification of Dorchester Heights}}\nWashington wanted to end the siege, and he formulated a plan to draw at least some of the British out of Boston once the equipment began to arrive, at which point he would launch an attack on the city across the [[Charles River]]. He placed cannons from Ticonderoga at [[Lechmere Square|Lechmere's Point]] and Cobble Hill in Cambridge, and on Lamb's Dam in Roxbury.<ref name=\"VBrooks224\">V. Brooks (1999), p. 224</ref>  These batteries opened fire on Boston on the night of March 2, 1776, while preparations were made to fortify the [[Dorchester Heights]] from which cannons could threaten both the city and the British fleet in the harbor.

This appeared to be a serious setback at first, but Knox's brother William, captain of the gundalow, reported that she had foundered but her gunnels were above the water line, and that she could be bailed out.  This was done, the ship was refloated, and the gundalow arrived at the southern end of the lake two days later.<ref name=W20>Ware (2000), p. 20</ref>\n[[File:Schuyler.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Philip Schuyler]]]]\n\nOn December 17, 1775, Knox wrote to Washington that he had built \"42 exceeding strong sleds, and have provided 80 yoke of oxen to drag them as far as [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]]\",<ref name=W21_2>Ware (2000), pp. 21\u201322</ref> and that he hoped \"in 16 or 17 days to be able to present your Excellency a noble train of artillery\".<ref name=\"Brooks40\"/> He then set out for Albany ahead of the train, crossed the frozen [[Hudson River]] at [[Glens Falls, New York|Glens Falls]], and proceeded on through [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]] to reach [[Lansingburg, New York]] on Christmas Day. Two feet (0.6 m) of snow fell that day, slowing his progress, as the snow-covered route needed to be broken open. He finally reached Albany the next day, again slowed by significant snow on the ground. There he met with General [[Philip Schuyler]], and the two of them worked over the next few days to locate and send north equipment and personnel to assist in moving the train south from Lake George. The snowfall was sufficient to enable sleds to move the train overland, but the river ice was still too thin to move it over the Hudson. Knox and his men tried to accelerate the process of thickening the river ice by pouring additional water on top of existing ice. The first of the cannon arrived at Albany by January 4, but some cannons crashed through the ice into the river on the way to Albany, and again on crossing the Hudson heading east toward Massachusetts.  In every instance, however, the cannon was recovered.  On January 9, the last of cannons had crossed the Hudson, and Knox rode ahead to oversee the next stage of the journey.<ref>[[#Diary|Knox (1867)]], pp. 323\u2013324.

After a spring in which a record number of attacks against Canadian soldiers had been set, and numerous offensives by Canadians which included six deaths to the Canadian Forces, the Taliban in [[Kandahar]] and [[Helmand]] provinces were massing and [[Operation Mountain Thrust]] was launched in the beginning of the summer. Canadians were the leading combatants and the first fighting in the [[Battle of Panjwaii]] took place. Complex mud-walled compounds made the rural Panjwaii district take on an urban style of fighting in some places. Daily firefights, artillery bombardments, and allied airstrikes turned the tides of the battle in favour of the Canadians.\n\nAfter Operation Mountain Thrust came to an end, Taliban fighters flooded back into the Panjwaii district in numbers that had not been seen yet in a single area in the post Anaconda war. The Canadian Forces, which came under [[NATO]] command at the end of July, launched [[Operation Medusa]] in an attempt to clear the areas of Taliban fighters once and for all.\n\nThe fighting of Operation Medusa was conducted with a larger force of Canadians, most of them being brand new to combat and largely fought by the rotation replacing the 1PPCLI, a battle group built around the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] (RCR).\n\nFor their actions in 2006, the 1st Battalion PPCLI Battle Group was given the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation from the Governor-General of Canada.<ref group=b name=citation>\n{{citation\n|title= Department of National Defence\n|chapter= Army News : Governor General honours Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry with Unit Citation\n|url= http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/land-terre/news-nouvelles/story-reportage-eng.asp?id=4990\n|date= February 24, 2011\n|last1= McVeigh\n|first1= David\n|accessdate= February 23, 2011\n|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5wj1PcRVW\n|archivedate= February 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, PPCLI, took over from the 3rd Battalion, [[Royal 22nd Regiment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]] (R22eR) in February 2008.<ref group=b name=athena /> In August of the same year, it is replaced by the 3RCR, and in September 2009, 1PPCLI returns in Afghanistan to replace 2R22eR, where it stayed until May 2010.<ref group=b name=athena />\n\n==Lineage chart==\nLineage of the units of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry:<ref>{{cite web|title=Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry|url=http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/ol-lo/vol-tom-3/par2/ppclir-eng.asp|website=Official Lineages Volume 3, Part 2: Infantry Regiments|publisher=Directorate of History and Heritage|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>\n{{chart top|width=100%<!--|Add alternativ name here-->}}\n{{chart/start|align=center}}\n{{chart|aa914| |PPCLI| | | | | | | | | |aa914=1914|PPCLI=Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infy}}\n{{chart|aa918| | |!| | | | | | |260CR| |aa918=1918|260CR=260th Bn, Canadian Rifles, <small>CEF (Siberia)</small>}}\n{{chart|aa919| | |!| | |PPCLI| | |!| | |aa919=1919|PPCLI=Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infy.

From 1919 to 1994 however, PPCLI did maintain a [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band|regimental band]].  PPCLI's band date back to the [[First World War]] when it's core band came from the St. Mary's Boys Brigade Band and the 140th New Brunswick Battalion in January 1916. [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band|PPCLI Band]] was formed in 1919 under the guidance of Captain Tommy James and was stationed at Fort Osborne Barracks in [[Winnipeg]]. In early 1940s, the [[1st Canadian Division]] Band was largely made up of former PPCLI bandsmen, which provided the basis to be reactivated after the war at [[Wainwright, Alberta]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/princess-patricias-canadian-light-infantry-band-emc|title=Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Music in Canada]]|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://archives.ppcli.com/princess-patricias-canadian-light-infantry-band PPCLI archives, further links], eg. photograph collection</ref><ref>https://ppcli.com/wp-content/uploads/P18-PPCLI-Band-photo-collection.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjO353-5KfmAhVLMqwKHeH1BIoQFjANegQIChAB&usg=AOvVaw2bR1HsLq8zsnXtFLL8G4XT</ref> Due to military budget cuts in 1994, the entire band was disbanded and reduced to a corps of drums. The drum line was inactive due to the [[Afghanistan War]] in the early 2000s, however was re-formed under the leadership of Sergeant Keith Mooney and Warrant Officer Dave Kennedy in 2014. The process for establishment began in 2012 with the research for drum patterns and sequences.<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2484787179</ref> The drum line took part in the regimental Centennial Parade in September 2014.<ref>http://www.leaderpost.com/news/canada/Photos+Princess+Patricia+parade+celebrates+years+regiment/10108984/story.html</ref><ref>http://www.edmontonjournal.com/PPCLI+drum+line+takes+part+Regimental+Centennial+Parade+PPCLI+Princess+Patricia+Canadian+Light+Infantry+they+celebrate+years+regiment+history+took+place+Parade+Square+Edmonton+Garrison/10105301/story.html</ref>\n\nThe [[Edmonton Police Service]] pipe band, which was formed in 1914, was dissolved during the First World War, with its musicians being re-augmented to PPCLI and leading the regiment into battle. Members of the pipe band also served as stretcher bearers during the war. As a result of this close history together, the Pipes and Drums of the EPS, which was re-founded in 1961, is the only non-military civilian band within the Commonwealth to wear the badges of three Canadian regiments, with one of these being PPCLI. While serving as a public relations tool for the EPS, it still performs alongside the regiment today during public events in Edmonton.<ref>http://www.epspipeband.ca/performances-local/100th-anniversary-ppcli/</ref> The band was invited to play at PPCLI's [[beating retreat]] ceremony in 1964 and at the regimental [[trooping of the colour]] in 1967.<ref>http://www.cmhslivinghistory.org/ppcli1_band.htm</ref>\n\n== Traditions ==\n{{See also|The Canadian Crown and the Canadian Forces}}\n[[File:Adrienne Clarkson.jpg|thumb|right|Adrienne Clarkson, Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]\nSince March 17, 2007, the regiment's [[colonel-in-chief]] is former Governor-General of Canada [[Adrienne Clarkson]].

From 1919 to 1994 however, PPCLI did maintain a [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band|regimental band]].  PPCLI's band date back to the [[First World War]] when it's core band came from the St. Mary's Boys Brigade Band and the 140th New Brunswick Battalion in January 1916. [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band|PPCLI Band]] was formed in 1919 under the guidance of Captain Tommy James and was stationed at Fort Osborne Barracks in [[Winnipeg]]. In early 1940s, the [[1st Canadian Division]] Band was largely made up of former PPCLI bandsmen, which provided the basis to be reactivated after the war at [[Wainwright, Alberta]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/princess-patricias-canadian-light-infantry-band-emc|title=Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Band|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Music in Canada]]|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>[https://archives.ppcli.com/princess-patricias-canadian-light-infantry-band PPCLI archives, further links], eg. photograph collection</ref><ref>https://ppcli.com/wp-content/uploads/P18-PPCLI-Band-photo-collection.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjO353-5KfmAhVLMqwKHeH1BIoQFjANegQIChAB&usg=AOvVaw2bR1HsLq8zsnXtFLL8G4XT</ref> Due to military budget cuts in 1994, the entire band was disbanded and reduced to a corps of drums. The drum line was inactive due to the [[Afghanistan War]] in the early 2000s, however was re-formed under the leadership of Sergeant Keith Mooney and Warrant Officer Dave Kennedy in 2014. The process for establishment began in 2012 with the research for drum patterns and sequences.<ref>https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2484787179</ref> The drum line took part in the regimental Centennial Parade in September 2014.<ref>http://www.leaderpost.com/news/canada/Photos+Princess+Patricia+parade+celebrates+years+regiment/10108984/story.html</ref><ref>http://www.edmontonjournal.com/PPCLI+drum+line+takes+part+Regimental+Centennial+Parade+PPCLI+Princess+Patricia+Canadian+Light+Infantry+they+celebrate+years+regiment+history+took+place+Parade+Square+Edmonton+Garrison/10105301/story.html</ref>\n\nThe [[Edmonton Police Service]] pipe band, which was formed in 1914, was dissolved during the First World War, with its musicians being re-augmented to PPCLI and leading the regiment into battle. Members of the pipe band also served as stretcher bearers during the war. As a result of this close history together, the Pipes and Drums of the EPS, which was re-founded in 1961, is the only non-military civilian band within the Commonwealth to wear the badges of three Canadian regiments, with one of these being PPCLI. While serving as a public relations tool for the EPS, it still performs alongside the regiment today during public events in Edmonton.<ref>http://www.epspipeband.ca/performances-local/100th-anniversary-ppcli/</ref> The band was invited to play at PPCLI's [[beating retreat]] ceremony in 1964 and at the regimental [[trooping of the colour]] in 1967.<ref>http://www.cmhslivinghistory.org/ppcli1_band.htm</ref>\n\n== Traditions ==\n{{See also|The Canadian Crown and the Canadian Forces}}\n[[File:Adrienne Clarkson.jpg|thumb|right|Adrienne Clarkson, Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]]\nSince March 17, 2007, the regiment's [[colonel-in-chief]] is former Governor-General of Canada [[Adrienne Clarkson]]. The previous colonel-in-chief was [[Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Countess Mountbatten of Burma]], herself succeeding Princess Patricia. This is the first time that a person who is not a member of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]] has been invited to take such a position with the regiment.

The independent companies that preceded the formation of the [[42nd Regiment of Foot]] were known in [[Scottish Gaelic]] as ''Am Freiceadan Dubh'', which translates to \"The Black Watch\" in English.<ref>Simpson, Peter. \"The Independent Highland Companies, 1603 - 1760\".

It was the only coronation in the history of the Empire\u2014a short-lived [[one-party state]] and [[self-proclaimed monarchy]]\u2014which was established in 1976 by [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]], [[military dictator]] and [[president-for-life]] of the [[Central African Republic]].\n\nThe coronation\u2014which was almost an exact copy of the [[coronation of Napoleon I]] as [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804\u2014and related events were marked by luxury and pomp. Despite substantial material support from [[France]],{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}} expenses amounted to over US$20 million (${{Inflation|US|20|1977|r=-1|fmt=c}} million today) and caused serious damage to the state, leading to a huge outcry in Africa and around the world. After the coronation, Bokassa stayed in power for less than two years. In September 1979, [[Operation Caban]] took place in his absence, as a result, the country became a republic again.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=98}}{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440|1982|p=143}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{History of the Central African Republic}}\nIn the spring of 1976, during a visit by the French president, [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], Bokassa told him about his plans to proclaim the Central African Republic an empire and celebrate the occasion.\n\nAccording to Bokassa, the creation of a monarchy would help Central Africa improve its standing vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the continent and increase its authority in the international arena.{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440|1982|p=142}}. The French leader proposed to hold a modest coronation ceremony in the traditional African style, avoiding high costs because the Central African Republic was one of the poorest countries in Africa, and an opulent ceremony could have negative economic and social consequences.{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440|1982|p=143}}\n\nBokassa persistently requested d'Estaing for France's assistance in organizing the event. The French President was forced to agree for several reasons: first, the refusal could jeopardize the continuation of the profitable French role in the [[mining industry of the Central African Republic]]\u2014mostly of uranium and diamonds{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=83}}\u2014and secondly, France was interested in maintaining its influence in the country, which, along with [[Gabon]] and [[Zaire]], was part of the triangle on which French policy in the region rested. Anxiety on the part of France was heightened after Bokassa attempted to draw closer to [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who had strained relations with France and pro\u2013French [[Chad]] (because of a [[Aouzou Strip|territorial dispute]]).{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440|1982|p=142}} This forced d'Estaing to promise material assistance to the Central African President in exchange for cutting ties with Gaddafi.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}}\n\nOn 4 December 1976, at the extraordinary congress of the ruling [[Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa|MESAN]] party, Bokassa announced the renaming of the Central African Republic to the Central African Empire and proclaimed himself Emperor. At the congress, a pre-prepared constitution of the empire was adopted, according to which the Emperor was the head of the executive power, and the monarchy was declared to be [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], transferred down a [[Patrilineality|male line]] in the event that the Emperor himself did not appoint a future successor. The full title was Emperor of Central Africa by the will of the Central African people. Shortly after the proclamation of the empire, Bokassa, who had adopted [[Islam]] and changed his name to Salah Eddine Ahmed Bokassa during a September 1976 visit by Gaddafi, converted back to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].{{sfn|Musky|2002|pp=77\u201378}}\n\nThe first world leader to congratulate Bokassa on the imperial title was d'Estaing, who for several years maintained friendly relations with Bokassa. In 1975, the French head of state called himself a friend and family member of the Central African President.<ref>{{cite book| author = K.

The future dictator of the Central African Republic was well acquainted with the first President of the [[French Fifth Republic]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], who considered him to be his ally in arms. After the death of de Gaulle, Bokassa himself said: \"I lost my biological father as a child, and now I turned towards my true father, General de Gaulle&nbsp;...\"<ref>{{cite book| author = Taylor, Ian. | title = The international relations of Sub-Saharan Africa |date = 2010 |publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group| pages = 55}}</ref>\n\n== Preparations ==\nBokassa planned to conduct his coronation on 4 December 1977, exactly one year after the proclamation of the Central African Empire, following the example of [[Napoleon]] who was crowned on 2 December 1804, in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]. He considered the [[Emperor of the French]] as his idol.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=83}}. Beside Bokassa himself, his \"spouse number one\" Catherine Denguiad\u00e9 was to be crowned during the ceremony.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Their son, [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa Jr.]], one of more than 40&nbsp;children of Bokassa, was proclaimed the Crown Prince and heir apparent to the imperial throne. Consequently, he continues to be the head of the [[House of Bokassa]] and the formal pretender to the imperial throne to the present day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/respzyir/jean-bedel-bokassa/id9.html|title=His Imperial Majesty Jean-Bedel Bokassa's Genealogy|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Jean-Bedel Bokassa (official cite)|accessdate=2011-08-27|lang=en|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/657ceEiOO?url=http://mysite.verizon.net/respzyir/jean-bedel-bokassa/id9.html|archivedate=2012-02-01}}</ref> Other close relatives of the Emperor received titles of princes and princesses.\n\nIn preparation for the coronation, several special committees were formed, each of them responsible for a specific area of preparation. Thus, the committee responsible for the accommodation was charged with finding suitable premises for 2,500&nbsp;foreign guests. To this end, having received permission from Bokassa, the committee members began to requisition apartments, houses, and hotels from the inhabitants of Bangui for the period of the celebrations, and repaired the rooms intended for guests. The task of another committee was to completely change the appearance of the capital, and especially those areas that were to be used during the coronation. Under its leadership, street cleaning, painting of buildings, as well as removal of urban beggars and vagrants outside the central areas of Bangui took place.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=89}}\n\nTextile enterprises of the Central African Empire were engaged in sewing hundreds of ceremonial costumes for local residents, who were to become guests at the ceremony. The authorities regulated a certain dress code: children were instructed to wear white clothing, middle-level officials dark blue, and high-ranking officials and ministers black.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=89}}\n\nWhile preparations were being made in the capital for the event, Bokassa sought contacts with foreign artists and invited them to Bangui to perpetuate his name in their works. West German artist Hans Linus Murnau painted two large portraits of the Emperor. In one, Bokassa was depicted bareheaded, and in the other, wearing a crown. The last portrait was subsequently used in a commemorative postage stamp dedicated to the coronation.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=89}}. In addition, the Imperial March and the Imperial Waltz were written in France, as well as the coronation ode, which consisted of 20&nbsp;[[quatrain]]s.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=89}}\n\nMany of the objects used in the coronation were made by French masters. As early as November 1976, the representative of the [[List of diplomatic missions of the Central African Republic|Central African Embassy]] in France confidentially informed the sculptor Olivier Brice that President Bokassa would like to involve him in the work on the decoration of the [[Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Bangui)|Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame]] in Bangui. In addition, Brice was instructed to develop projects of the Imperial Throne and carriage.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=90}}\n\nBokassa ordered a large diamond ring from American entrepreneur and political operative [[Albert Jolis]] who took the order but did not have the funds to purchase a fairly large stone. Jolis arranged to process a low-grade, finely crystalline, black diamond, resembling the outlines of Africa on the map, and inserted it into a large ring. The place on the black diamond which roughly corresponded to the position of the Central African Empire in Africa, was decorated with a colorless diamond. The item, whose value did not exceed {{US$|500}}, was presented to Bokassa as a unique diamond worth more than {{US$|500,000}}. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baunatdiamonds.com//en/diversify-to-invest-smartly/what-are-the-most-famous-diamonds?currency=USD&VAT=1|title=Famous diamonds - Baunat Diamonds|website=www.baunatdiamonds.com|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref>After [[Operation Caban|his overthrow]], Bokassa took \"a unique diamond\" with him into exile, and Jolis cynically did not recommend selling it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.neatorama.com/2008/12/01/10-facts-about-diamonds-you-should-know/|title=10 Facts About Diamonds You Should Know|last=Monday|last2=December 1|website=Neatorama|language=en|access-date=2019-08-07|last3=AM|first3=2008 at 2:48}}</ref>\n\nThe Imperial Throne, made of gilded bronze, was designed as a sitting eagle with outstretched wings. The height of the throne was {{convert|3+1/2|by|4+1/2|m|ft|spell=in|sp=us}}, and weighed about two tons.{{sfn|Musky|2002|p=80}} For the manufacture of the throne, Brice built a special workshop near his home in [[Gisors]] in [[Normandy]], where about 300 workers were employed. The throne seat of red velvet, which occupied the cavity in the belly of the gilded eagle, was made by local draper Michel Cousin. In total, the cost of the throne was approximately {{US$|2,500,000}}. For the carriage, in which Bokassa was to pass through the streets of Bangui on the day of the coronation, the sculptor Brice bought an old carriage in [[Nice]], restored it, covered it with velvet on the inside, and partially decorated it with gold and added emblems to the outside. Eight white horses, which were planned to be harnessed to the Emperor's carriage, were procured from Belgium. In addition, several dozen of Norman gray horses were acquired for the Emperor's escort, whose members spent the entire summer of 1977 in Norman [[Arrondissement of Lisieux|Lisieux]], where they passed special riding courses.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=90}}\n\nMost of the costumes were also made in France. The French company, Guiselin, which once performed similar work under Napoleon, took up the creation of a coronation suit for the Emperor, in association with [[Pierre Cardin]]. The imperial attire consisted of a long, to-the-floor, toga, decorated with thousands of tiny pearls; shoes decorated with pearls, as well as a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on|spell=in|sp=us}} mantle of crimson velvet, decorated with golden emblems in the form of eagles and edged with ermine fur. All this together cost the Central African treasury {{US$|145,000}}. Another {{US$|72,400}} was the cost of a dress made by [[Lanvin (company)|Lanvin]] for Empress Catherine and adorned with 935&nbsp;thousand metallic glitters. In addition to the dress, a mantle was made for the Empress, similar to the Emperor's mantle, but in a more modest size.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=90}}\n\nThe [[Imperial crown|Imperial Crown]] was made by Arthus Bertrand, a jeweler from [[Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]]. The design of the crown was traditional: it had a heavy frame resting on an ermine headband with a crimson canopy. A golden crown was placed over the headband, in the middle of which was placed the figure of an eagle, and eight arcs branched from the crown, supporting the blue sphere\u2014the symbol of the Earth\u2014on which the outlines of Africa were highlighted in golden color. In addition, the entire crown was inlaid with diamonds, the largest of which\u201480&nbsp;carats\u2014was in the center of the figure of an eagle, in the most prominent place.{{sfn|Musky|2002|p=80}} The cost of the crown is estimated at no less than {{US$|2,500,000}}. A separate crown, in the form of a wreath, adorned with a 25-carat diamond, was also intended for the Empress. In addition, the imperial [[sceptre]], sword, and several items of jewelry were made for the coronation. All this, including both crowns, was estimated at about {{US$|5,000,000}}.{{sfn|Titley|2002|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nMore than 240 tons of food and beverages that were supposed to be served at the banquet after the coronation were also delivered to the country by airplanes from Europe. One winery in Bangui delivered up to 40,000&nbsp;bottles, including the production of farms [[Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild]] and [[Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild]], harvest 1971. Each bottle at that time was estimated at about {{US$|25}}. In addition to wine, Bokassa ordered 24,000&nbsp;bottles of [[Mo\u00ebt & Chandon]] champagne and his favorite Scotch whisky, [[Chivas Regal]], as well as 10,000&nbsp;items of silverware.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}}\n\nFinally, in order for foreign guests to be adequately received in Bangui, Bokassa ordered the purchase of 60 new&nbsp;[[Mercedes-Benz]] cars. Since the country was landlocked, the vehicles were initially transported to a port in [[Cameroon]] and then flown to Bangui at a cost of {{US$|300,000}}.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}}\n\nWhen everything designed for the coronation ceremony was successfully purchased and delivered to Bangui, the total amount, including both foreign acquisitions and domestic costs, was about {{US$|22,000,000}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} For the economy of a backward, practically impoverished African state such as the Central African Empire, this amount was extremely high, and equal to a quarter of the country's annual budget. Most of the expenses were paid by France, in exchange for the promised break with Libya. \"Everything here was financed by the French government. We ask the French for money, get it and waste it.\"<ref name=\"time1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945849-1,00.html|title=Mounting a Golden Throne|date=1977-12-19|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=2019-06-28}}</ref> Still, the Central African Empire had to pay a significant amount.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}}\n\n=== Invitations ===\n[[File:Paolovi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Pope Paul VI]]]]\nAs conceived by Bokassa, his coronation was to take place with the obligatory presence of [[Pope Paul VI]]. Apparently he intended, as supposedly Napoleon had done with [[Pope Pius VII]] at his coronation, to take the crown from the hands of the Paul VI and place it on his head himself.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} With a request to invite the head of the [[Catholic Church]] to the coronation, Bokassa turned to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bangui|Archbishop of Bangui]], Monsignor [[Joachim N'Dayen]], and [[Apostolic Nunciature|Apostolic Nuncio]] in the Central African Empire, [[Oriano Quilici]].\n\nResisting this idea, Quilici explained to Bokassa in June 1977 that the Pope was too old for such a long journey and would not be able to attend the ceremony. The best that Quilici could offer Bokassa was to hold the [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] after the coronation ceremony. Upon receiving the consent of Bokassa, Quilici contacted the [[Vatican City]] and secured an agreement for the Pope to be represented by Archbishop [[Domenico Enrici]], who had recently represented the Pope during the enthronement of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]] in 1975.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=92}}\n\nThe greatest concern on the part of Bokassa was caused by the refusals of the heads of state, including the monarchs invited to Bangui. Invitations were rejected by both [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito of Japan]] and [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] of [[Iran]]&nbsp;\u2013 the first in the guest list compiled by Bokassa. The other ruling monarchs, one by one, also did not express a desire to attend the ceremony. The Prime Minister of Mauritius, Sir [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]], and the president of Mauritania, [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], responded to the invitation by sending their spouses to Bangui. [[Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein (1908\u20131987)|Prince Emmanuel of Liechtenstein]] was the only aristocrat who flew to Bangui.\n\n[[File:Prins Emanuel van Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein (1908\u20131987)|Emmanuel of Liechtenstein]]]]\nMost of the states at the coronation ceremony were represented by their ambassadors, and a number of countries boycotted the ceremony altogether. Authoritarian African leaders such as [[Omar Bongo]] of [[Gabon]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of [[Zaire]], and [[Idi Amin]] of [[Uganda]] found reasons to refuse to visit the Central African Empire. Later, in one of his interviews, Bokassa motivated their refusals by saying: \"They were jealous of me because I had an empire and they didn\u2019t.\"{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}}\n\nMost unexpected was the decision of the French President not to attend. He limited himself to sending a sword of the Napoleonic era to Bokassa as a gift on behalf of the French government. The French head of state was represented in Bangui by the Minister of Cooperation [[Robert Galley]] and presidential adviser on African affairs Ren\u00e9 Journiquek. Supporting Bokassa, Galley condemned high-ranking officials who refused to accept an invitation to Bangui, but who were willing to take part in the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II]]. \"It smacks of racism,\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} he concluded. In the end, of the 2,500 invited guests, only 600 agreed to come, including 100&nbsp;journalists. Despite the complete absence of heads of state, there was no shortage of diplomats and businessmen in Bangui, including European ones.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}}\n\n== Ceremony ==\nOn 4 December 1977, at 07:00&nbsp;[[West Africa Time]], Mercedes-Benz limousines were already carrying guests in the direction of the new Yugoslav-built basketball stadium, where the coronation was to take place. On the way to the stadium, cars drove through the newly repaired streets of Bangui, and passed by the Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa Sports Palace, along Bokassa Avenue, not far from the [[University of Bangui|Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa University]].{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=92}} By 08:30, all the guests and participants of the ceremony\u2014about 4,000 people\u2014were in their seats, and by 09:00, the arrival of Bokassa himself was expected. To maintain the appropriate atmosphere, the speakers located in the stadium loudly played solemn music.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}}\n\nThe part of the stadium where the coronation was supposed to take place was, according to Brice's plan, decorated with banners and tapestries of national colors, and red curtains and carpeting. The low platforms seating the thrones of the Emperor and Empress were completely red. The Empress' throne was much more modest than the Emperor's: it was a high chair made of red velvet with a gold-fringed, velvet canopy. To his left was a small seat for the Crown Prince.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}} The stadium was carefully guarded by the [[French Armed Forces|French troops]], sent \"to secure the ceremony.\"{{sfn|\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043d|1997|p=93}}\n\nBy 09:00, the motorcade of Bokassa was still on the way, and the famous [[French Navy]] orchestra of 120&nbsp;people,{{sfn|\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043d|1997|p=93}} present at the stadium, began to play an old drinking song, {{lang|fr|Chevaliers de la table ronde}}, to distract guests. Since the air conditioning at the stadium did not work, the extremely high temperature\u2014more than {{convert|35|C}}\u2014gradually made itself felt, which created discomfort for those present who were dressed in suits and evening dresses. Some, in order not to sweat, fanned the ceremony programs, which were given out to each guest. Only at about 10:10, the imperial motorcade, which had traveled several kilometers in length from the Renaissance Palace itself, arrived at the stadium. Along the motorcade route, a change occurred: unable to withstand the heat of riding in a closed carriage, Bokassa and Empress Catherine moved into one of the Mercedes equipped with air conditioning, and several hundred meters before reaching the end point of the route they moved back to the carriage again.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}}\n\nAt 10:15, the coronation ceremony began. The first to enter the hall were two guardsmen in military uniforms of the [[Napoleonic era]] who carried the [[Flag of the Central African Republic|national flag]] and the imperial standard to the end of the carpet. They then stood with the flags on either side of the platform where the thrones were located. After the guardsmen followed the Crown Prince. The boy was dressed in a white, military-parade uniform with a golden braid and a ribbon over his shoulder, and a white cap on his head. Next, Empress Catherine appeared in the hall. A mantle was fastened on top of her dress, and a golden, laurel-like wreath adorned her head. The Empress was accompanied by [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]] in pink and white evening dresses and wide-brimmed hats, who supported the long train of her dress until she reached her throne.{{sfn|Titley|2002|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nBefore Bokassa himself entered the hall, the naval orchestra went silent. A voice from the loudspeaker announced to drumming: \"His Imperial Majesty Bokassa I, the Emperor of Central Africa!\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} Accompanied by the sounds of an imperial march, the Emperor appeared on the carpet, dressed in a white toga with a belt having five stripes of the colors of the national flag. A wide ribbon was draped over Bokassa's shoulder, white antelope skin gloves covered his hands, and his head was decorated with a golden wreath, crafted in ancient Roman style. Accompanied by his escort, cameramen and photographers, he climbed onto the platform to his throne, after which the guardsmen handed him attributes of imperial power: a sword and a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on|spell=in|sp=us}} sceptre, which Bokassa took in his right hand. Then several pairs of guardsmen brought a long velvet mantle to the throne, and one of them put it on the Emperor. After this, Bokassa himself placed the crown on his head. The audience responded with applause. To complete it the ceremony, the Emperor publicly took the oath to the Central African people:{{sfn|Titley|2002|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n{{quote|We, Bokassa I, the Emperor of Central Africa, by the will of the Central African people&nbsp;... solemnly swear and promise&nbsp;\u2013 before the people, before all mankind and before history&nbsp;\u2013 to do everything possible to protect the Constitution, protect national independence and territorial integrity&nbsp;... and serve the Central African people in accordance with the sacred ideals of the national political party.}}\n\nWhen Bokassa finished speaking, the audience applauded again, and loudspeakers sounded {{lang|fr|[[La Renaissance]]}}, the national anthem, in the [[Sango language]]. Upon its completion, the coronation of Empress Catherine began. Dressed in a robe, she went to her husband and knelt in front of him, after which he took off the wreath from her head and placed the crown. This scene, as witnesses of the coronation noticed, had a noticeable similarity to the moment captured on the painting ''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]].{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=83}} Noticeably, the French minister Robert Galley was dressed during the coronation as Marshal of the Empire [[Michel Ney]] during the coronation of Napoleon.<ref name=\"\u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430\">{{cite journal |author = \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432-\u0420\u044b\u0431\u0438\u043d|url= http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/vs/article/7238|title= \u041f\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u044b |edition= [[Vokrug sveta]] |date= November 2010|number= 11 (2842)|language= Russian}}</ref> The coronation ceremony was completed with a performance of the choir who arrived at the stadium.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=95}}\n\nAfter the coronation, the Emperor, the Empress with ladies-in-waiting, the Crown Prince, and the rest of the children of Bokassa, went to the Mass at the [[Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Bangui)|Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame]], two kilometers from the stadium. Along the way, they were accompanied by an equestrian unit of [[Hussar|hussars]]. While the Emperor and the Empress rode again in a closed carriage, the Crown Prince was separated from them, in an open horse-drawn carriage. On the way to the Cath\u00e9drale, the imperial [[Glossary of French expressions in English|cortege]] passed under the triumphal arches and banners with the letter \"B\", which appeared in Bangui on the eve of the festivities. Along the road crowds stood on the sidewalks, however, their actions, according to Brian Titley, did not demonstrate \"obvious enthusiasm.\"{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=95}}\n\nIn the Cath\u00e9drale, two thrones were prepared in advance for the Emperor and the Empress, and a small seat for the Crown Prince, similar to the one in the stadium. A few more seats were intended for high-ranking guests, but they didn't have enough seats for all, and many had to remain standing. The Mass in three languages\u2014French, Latin, and [[Sango language|Sango]]\u2014was held by Archbishop N'Dayen. He preached with dignity, wishing the Emperor success, but avoiding the expected excessive praise and adulation.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=95}}\n\n=== Dinner ===\nThe last event of 4 December was an evening banquet at the [[Renaissance Palace]] hosted by Bokassa for, in his view, the most outstanding guests. Those who were not invited to the reception, went to the bar of the Hotel Rock, equipped with air conditioning.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=96}}\n\nA total of about 400 people attended the banquet. Since, by evening, the heat in the capital had gradually subsided, the event was held in the open air: the tables where guests were seated were located in a vast, picturesque garden, decorated with fountains and bone carvings, adjacent to the Palace. For security, the garden was protected by bulletproof glass screens.{{sfn|Musky|2002|p=81}} By 21:00, when all the guests had gathered, the waiters started serving food, although Bokassa, as usual, was late and only appeared after some time. By this time, he changed his coronation clothes and regalia for a marshal's uniform with a cap featuring a cockade and ostrich feathers, and a black diamond ring glittered on the Emperor's finger. The Empress who accompanied him wore a long, {{lang|fr|[[haute couture]]}}, French evening dress.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=96}}\n\nA variety of dishes were served at the banquet. For dessert, the guests were offered a huge seven-layer imperial cake, decorated with green icing. When the cake was taken to the tables, the top part was removed from it, releasing half a dozen pigeons outside. Dishes on the tables corresponded to its contents: dinner was served on gold and porcelain plates, ordered specially from the famous [[Limoges]] master Berardo.{{sfn|Musky|2002|pp=80\u201381}} When the guests had eaten enough, Bokassa leaned over to Robert Galley and whispered: \"You did not notice it, but you ate human meat.\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} It is not known whether the Emperor was telling the truth or not, but later his words became one of the reasons for the belief that Bokassa was a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]].{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=96}} Moreover, it is believed that the served meat belonged to prisoners held in a Bangui prison.{{sfn|Musky|2002|p=81}}\n\nAfter dinner, a scheduled 35-minute break took place, during which a festive firework display was given at the Palace. Pyrotechnics, were brought from [[Paris]].{{sfn|\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043d|1997|pp=93\u201394}} The fireworks were followed by a pop show in which several songs were performed by a song-and-dance group of former bar girls from [[Saigon]], [[South Vietnam]]. The French naval orchestra, which had performed at the stadium, also participated. When it played the \"Imperial Waltz,\" written in France specifically on the occasion of the coronation of Bokassa, the Emperor and Empress invited guests to the dance floor. The party came to an end around 02:30.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=96}}\n\n=== Parade ===\nOn the morning of 5 December 1977, a solemn parade began in Bangui to mark the coronation of Bokassa. The parade was held on one of the main avenues of the Central African capital, where a special review platform was installed for the Emperor and his guests. At 10:00, Bokassa arrived, again an hour late. The Emperor was again dressed in a marshal's uniform, and Catherine was dressed in a garden party dress and a pale, purple, wide-brimmed hat.{{sfn|Titley|2002|pp=96\u201397}}\n\nThe parade was the final part of the celebrations accompanying the coronation. Additionally, in the afternoon, a number of sporting events were held in Bangui, also timed to coincide with the coronation, the largest of which was the Coronation Cup basketball tournament\u2014the Emperor himself was present. Later that evening, several parties and receptions took place. Gradually, the festive atmosphere in the capital faded and the guests began to go home, after which Bangui returned to the usual way of life.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=97}}\n\n=== Assessment ===\n[[File:Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]]]\nThe coronation of Bokassa I provoked a mixed reaction throughout the world, and led to mainly negative comments in Africa. Kenya's ''[[Daily Nation]]'' referred to Bokassa's \"clowning glory,\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} while the ''[[Zambia Daily Mail]]'' deplored his \"obnoxious excesses.\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} The reaction in Europe was generally dismissive: French journalists associated the coronation with a masquerade, ridiculing the wastefulness and vanity of Bokassa. The assessment of French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing was more optimistic. Having watched the recording of the ceremony on TV, he called what was happening \u201cbeautiful\u201d and emphasized the \u201ccertain dignity\u201d of such a coronation. He compared Empress Catherine with Napoleon's wife, [[Empress Jos\u00e9phine]], calling them both \"incarnations of modesty and charm.\"{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=97}}\n\nDespite the fact that the coronation and accompanying celebrations caused serious damage to the state budget, Bokassa was not the only contemporary monarch who decided to stage a similar lavish event: in 1971, on the occasion of the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]], Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] of the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Imperial State of Iran]] declared himself the successor to [[Cyrus the Great]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and spent about US$100 million (${{Inflation|US|100|1971|r=-1|fmt=c}} million today) to celebrate the anniversary.

It was the only coronation in the history of the Empire\u2014a short-lived [[one-party state]] and [[self-proclaimed monarchy]]\u2014which was established in 1976 by [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]], [[military dictator]] and [[president-for-life]] of the [[Central African Republic]].\n\nThe coronation\u2014which was almost an exact copy of the [[coronation of Napoleon I]] as [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804\u2014and related events were marked by luxury and pomp. Despite substantial material support from [[France]],{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}} expenses amounted to over US$20 million (${{Inflation|US|20|1977|r=-1|fmt=c}} million today) and caused serious damage to the state, leading to a huge outcry in Africa and around the world. After the coronation, Bokassa stayed in power for less than two years. In September 1979, [[Operation Caban]] took place in his absence, as a result, the country became a republic again.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=98}}{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440|1982|p=143}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{History of the Central African Republic}}\nIn the spring of 1976, during a visit by the French president, [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], Bokassa told him about his plans to proclaim the Central African Republic an empire and celebrate the occasion.\n\nAccording to Bokassa, the creation of a monarchy would help Central Africa improve its standing vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the continent and increase its authority in the international arena.{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440|1982|p=142}}. The French leader proposed to hold a modest coronation ceremony in the traditional African style, avoiding high costs because the Central African Republic was one of the poorest countries in Africa, and an opulent ceremony could have negative economic and social consequences.{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440|1982|p=143}}\n\nBokassa persistently requested d'Estaing for France's assistance in organizing the event. The French President was forced to agree for several reasons: first, the refusal could jeopardize the continuation of the profitable French role in the [[mining industry of the Central African Republic]]\u2014mostly of uranium and diamonds{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=83}}\u2014and secondly, France was interested in maintaining its influence in the country, which, along with [[Gabon]] and [[Zaire]], was part of the triangle on which French policy in the region rested. Anxiety on the part of France was heightened after Bokassa attempted to draw closer to [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who had strained relations with France and pro\u2013French [[Chad]] (because of a [[Aouzou Strip|territorial dispute]]).{{sfn|\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0435\u0440|1982|p=142}} This forced d'Estaing to promise material assistance to the Central African President in exchange for cutting ties with Gaddafi.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}}\n\nOn 4 December 1976, at the extraordinary congress of the ruling [[Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa|MESAN]] party, Bokassa announced the renaming of the Central African Republic to the Central African Empire and proclaimed himself Emperor. At the congress, a pre-prepared constitution of the empire was adopted, according to which the Emperor was the head of the executive power, and the monarchy was declared to be [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary]], transferred down a [[Patrilineality|male line]] in the event that the Emperor himself did not appoint a future successor. The full title was Emperor of Central Africa by the will of the Central African people. Shortly after the proclamation of the empire, Bokassa, who had adopted [[Islam]] and changed his name to Salah Eddine Ahmed Bokassa during a September 1976 visit by Gaddafi, converted back to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].{{sfn|Musky|2002|pp=77\u201378}}\n\nThe first world leader to congratulate Bokassa on the imperial title was d'Estaing, who for several years maintained friendly relations with Bokassa. In 1975, the French head of state called himself a friend and family member of the Central African President.<ref>{{cite book| author = K.

The future dictator of the Central African Republic was well acquainted with the first President of the [[French Fifth Republic]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], who considered him to be his ally in arms. After the death of de Gaulle, Bokassa himself said: \"I lost my biological father as a child, and now I turned towards my true father, General de Gaulle&nbsp;...\"<ref>{{cite book| author = Taylor, Ian. | title = The international relations of Sub-Saharan Africa |date = 2010 |publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group| pages = 55}}</ref>\n\n== Preparations ==\nBokassa planned to conduct his coronation on 4 December 1977, exactly one year after the proclamation of the Central African Empire, following the example of [[Napoleon]] who was crowned on 2 December 1804, in [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]. He considered the [[Emperor of the French]] as his idol.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=83}}. Beside Bokassa himself, his \"spouse number one\" Catherine Denguiad\u00e9 was to be crowned during the ceremony.{{cn|date=August 2019}} Their son, [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa Jr.]], one of more than 40&nbsp;children of Bokassa, was proclaimed the Crown Prince and heir apparent to the imperial throne. Consequently, he continues to be the head of the [[House of Bokassa]] and the formal pretender to the imperial throne to the present day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mysite.verizon.net/respzyir/jean-bedel-bokassa/id9.html|title=His Imperial Majesty Jean-Bedel Bokassa's Genealogy|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Jean-Bedel Bokassa (official cite)|accessdate=2011-08-27|lang=en|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/657ceEiOO?url=http://mysite.verizon.net/respzyir/jean-bedel-bokassa/id9.html|archivedate=2012-02-01}}</ref> Other close relatives of the Emperor received titles of princes and princesses.\n\nIn preparation for the coronation, several special committees were formed, each of them responsible for a specific area of preparation. Thus, the committee responsible for the accommodation was charged with finding suitable premises for 2,500&nbsp;foreign guests. To this end, having received permission from Bokassa, the committee members began to requisition apartments, houses, and hotels from the inhabitants of Bangui for the period of the celebrations, and repaired the rooms intended for guests. The task of another committee was to completely change the appearance of the capital, and especially those areas that were to be used during the coronation. Under its leadership, street cleaning, painting of buildings, as well as removal of urban beggars and vagrants outside the central areas of Bangui took place.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=89}}\n\nTextile enterprises of the Central African Empire were engaged in sewing hundreds of ceremonial costumes for local residents, who were to become guests at the ceremony. The authorities regulated a certain dress code: children were instructed to wear white clothing, middle-level officials dark blue, and high-ranking officials and ministers black.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=89}}\n\nWhile preparations were being made in the capital for the event, Bokassa sought contacts with foreign artists and invited them to Bangui to perpetuate his name in their works. West German artist Hans Linus Murnau painted two large portraits of the Emperor. In one, Bokassa was depicted bareheaded, and in the other, wearing a crown. The last portrait was subsequently used in a commemorative postage stamp dedicated to the coronation.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=89}}. In addition, the Imperial March and the Imperial Waltz were written in France, as well as the coronation ode, which consisted of 20&nbsp;[[quatrain]]s.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=89}}\n\nMany of the objects used in the coronation were made by French masters. As early as November 1976, the representative of the [[List of diplomatic missions of the Central African Republic|Central African Embassy]] in France confidentially informed the sculptor Olivier Brice that President Bokassa would like to involve him in the work on the decoration of the [[Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Bangui)|Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame]] in Bangui. In addition, Brice was instructed to develop projects of the Imperial Throne and carriage.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=90}}\n\nBokassa ordered a large diamond ring from American entrepreneur and political operative [[Albert Jolis]] who took the order but did not have the funds to purchase a fairly large stone. Jolis arranged to process a low-grade, finely crystalline, black diamond, resembling the outlines of Africa on the map, and inserted it into a large ring. The place on the black diamond which roughly corresponded to the position of the Central African Empire in Africa, was decorated with a colorless diamond. The item, whose value did not exceed {{US$|500}}, was presented to Bokassa as a unique diamond worth more than {{US$|500,000}}. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baunatdiamonds.com//en/diversify-to-invest-smartly/what-are-the-most-famous-diamonds?currency=USD&VAT=1|title=Famous diamonds - Baunat Diamonds|website=www.baunatdiamonds.com|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref>After [[Operation Caban|his overthrow]], Bokassa took \"a unique diamond\" with him into exile, and Jolis cynically did not recommend selling it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.neatorama.com/2008/12/01/10-facts-about-diamonds-you-should-know/|title=10 Facts About Diamonds You Should Know|last=Monday|last2=December 1|website=Neatorama|language=en|access-date=2019-08-07|last3=AM|first3=2008 at 2:48}}</ref>\n\nThe Imperial Throne, made of gilded bronze, was designed as a sitting eagle with outstretched wings. The height of the throne was {{convert|3+1/2|by|4+1/2|m|ft|spell=in|sp=us}}, and weighed about two tons.{{sfn|Musky|2002|p=80}} For the manufacture of the throne, Brice built a special workshop near his home in [[Gisors]] in [[Normandy]], where about 300 workers were employed. The throne seat of red velvet, which occupied the cavity in the belly of the gilded eagle, was made by local draper Michel Cousin. In total, the cost of the throne was approximately {{US$|2,500,000}}. For the carriage, in which Bokassa was to pass through the streets of Bangui on the day of the coronation, the sculptor Brice bought an old carriage in [[Nice]], restored it, covered it with velvet on the inside, and partially decorated it with gold and added emblems to the outside. Eight white horses, which were planned to be harnessed to the Emperor's carriage, were procured from Belgium. In addition, several dozen of Norman gray horses were acquired for the Emperor's escort, whose members spent the entire summer of 1977 in Norman [[Arrondissement of Lisieux|Lisieux]], where they passed special riding courses.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=90}}\n\nMost of the costumes were also made in France. The French company, Guiselin, which once performed similar work under Napoleon, took up the creation of a coronation suit for the Emperor, in association with [[Pierre Cardin]]. The imperial attire consisted of a long, to-the-floor, toga, decorated with thousands of tiny pearls; shoes decorated with pearls, as well as a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on|spell=in|sp=us}} mantle of crimson velvet, decorated with golden emblems in the form of eagles and edged with ermine fur. All this together cost the Central African treasury {{US$|145,000}}. Another {{US$|72,400}} was the cost of a dress made by [[Lanvin (company)|Lanvin]] for Empress Catherine and adorned with 935&nbsp;thousand metallic glitters. In addition to the dress, a mantle was made for the Empress, similar to the Emperor's mantle, but in a more modest size.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=90}}\n\nThe [[Imperial crown|Imperial Crown]] was made by Arthus Bertrand, a jeweler from [[Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]]. The design of the crown was traditional: it had a heavy frame resting on an ermine headband with a crimson canopy. A golden crown was placed over the headband, in the middle of which was placed the figure of an eagle, and eight arcs branched from the crown, supporting the blue sphere\u2014the symbol of the Earth\u2014on which the outlines of Africa were highlighted in golden color. In addition, the entire crown was inlaid with diamonds, the largest of which\u201480&nbsp;carats\u2014was in the center of the figure of an eagle, in the most prominent place.{{sfn|Musky|2002|p=80}} The cost of the crown is estimated at no less than {{US$|2,500,000}}. A separate crown, in the form of a wreath, adorned with a 25-carat diamond, was also intended for the Empress. In addition, the imperial [[sceptre]], sword, and several items of jewelry were made for the coronation. All this, including both crowns, was estimated at about {{US$|5,000,000}}.{{sfn|Titley|2002|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nMore than 240 tons of food and beverages that were supposed to be served at the banquet after the coronation were also delivered to the country by airplanes from Europe. One winery in Bangui delivered up to 40,000&nbsp;bottles, including the production of farms [[Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild]] and [[Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild]], harvest 1971. Each bottle at that time was estimated at about {{US$|25}}. In addition to wine, Bokassa ordered 24,000&nbsp;bottles of [[Mo\u00ebt & Chandon]] champagne and his favorite Scotch whisky, [[Chivas Regal]], as well as 10,000&nbsp;items of silverware.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}}\n\nFinally, in order for foreign guests to be adequately received in Bangui, Bokassa ordered the purchase of 60 new&nbsp;[[Mercedes-Benz]] cars. Since the country was landlocked, the vehicles were initially transported to a port in [[Cameroon]] and then flown to Bangui at a cost of {{US$|300,000}}.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}}\n\nWhen everything designed for the coronation ceremony was successfully purchased and delivered to Bangui, the total amount, including both foreign acquisitions and domestic costs, was about {{US$|22,000,000}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} For the economy of a backward, practically impoverished African state such as the Central African Empire, this amount was extremely high, and equal to a quarter of the country's annual budget. Most of the expenses were paid by France, in exchange for the promised break with Libya. \"Everything here was financed by the French government. We ask the French for money, get it and waste it.\"<ref name=\"time1\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945849-1,00.html|title=Mounting a Golden Throne|date=1977-12-19|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=2019-06-28}}</ref> Still, the Central African Empire had to pay a significant amount.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=91}}\n\n=== Invitations ===\n[[File:Paolovi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Pope Paul VI]]]]\nAs conceived by Bokassa, his coronation was to take place with the obligatory presence of [[Pope Paul VI]]. Apparently he intended, as supposedly Napoleon had done with [[Pope Pius VII]] at his coronation, to take the crown from the hands of the Paul VI and place it on his head himself.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} With a request to invite the head of the [[Catholic Church]] to the coronation, Bokassa turned to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bangui|Archbishop of Bangui]], Monsignor [[Joachim N'Dayen]], and [[Apostolic Nunciature|Apostolic Nuncio]] in the Central African Empire, [[Oriano Quilici]].\n\nResisting this idea, Quilici explained to Bokassa in June 1977 that the Pope was too old for such a long journey and would not be able to attend the ceremony. The best that Quilici could offer Bokassa was to hold the [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]] after the coronation ceremony. Upon receiving the consent of Bokassa, Quilici contacted the [[Vatican City]] and secured an agreement for the Pope to be represented by Archbishop [[Domenico Enrici]], who had recently represented the Pope during the enthronement of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I of Spain]] in 1975.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=92}}\n\nThe greatest concern on the part of Bokassa was caused by the refusals of the heads of state, including the monarchs invited to Bangui. Invitations were rejected by both [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito of Japan]] and [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] of [[Iran]]&nbsp;\u2013 the first in the guest list compiled by Bokassa. The other ruling monarchs, one by one, also did not express a desire to attend the ceremony. The Prime Minister of Mauritius, Sir [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]], and the president of Mauritania, [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], responded to the invitation by sending their spouses to Bangui. [[Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein (1908\u20131987)|Prince Emmanuel of Liechtenstein]] was the only aristocrat who flew to Bangui.\n\n[[File:Prins Emanuel van Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein (1908\u20131987)|Emmanuel of Liechtenstein]]]]\nMost of the states at the coronation ceremony were represented by their ambassadors, and a number of countries boycotted the ceremony altogether. Authoritarian African leaders such as [[Omar Bongo]] of [[Gabon]], [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of [[Zaire]], and [[Idi Amin]] of [[Uganda]] found reasons to refuse to visit the Central African Empire. Later, in one of his interviews, Bokassa motivated their refusals by saying: \"They were jealous of me because I had an empire and they didn\u2019t.\"{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}}\n\nMost unexpected was the decision of the French President not to attend. He limited himself to sending a sword of the Napoleonic era to Bokassa as a gift on behalf of the French government. The French head of state was represented in Bangui by the Minister of Cooperation [[Robert Galley]] and presidential adviser on African affairs Ren\u00e9 Journiquek. Supporting Bokassa, Galley condemned high-ranking officials who refused to accept an invitation to Bangui, but who were willing to take part in the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II]]. \"It smacks of racism,\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} he concluded. In the end, of the 2,500 invited guests, only 600 agreed to come, including 100&nbsp;journalists. Despite the complete absence of heads of state, there was no shortage of diplomats and businessmen in Bangui, including European ones.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}}\n\n== Ceremony ==\nOn 4 December 1977, at 07:00&nbsp;[[West Africa Time]], Mercedes-Benz limousines were already carrying guests in the direction of the new Yugoslav-built basketball stadium, where the coronation was to take place. On the way to the stadium, cars drove through the newly repaired streets of Bangui, and passed by the Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa Sports Palace, along Bokassa Avenue, not far from the [[University of Bangui|Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa University]].{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=92}} By 08:30, all the guests and participants of the ceremony\u2014about 4,000 people\u2014were in their seats, and by 09:00, the arrival of Bokassa himself was expected. To maintain the appropriate atmosphere, the speakers located in the stadium loudly played solemn music.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}}\n\nThe part of the stadium where the coronation was supposed to take place was, according to Brice\u2019s plan, decorated with banners and tapestries of national colors, and red curtains and carpeting. The low platforms seating the thrones of the Emperor and Empress were completely red. The Empress' throne was much more modest than the Emperor's: it was a high chair made of red velvet with a gold-fringed, velvet canopy. To his left was a small seat for the Crown Prince.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}} The stadium was carefully guarded by the [[French Armed Forces|French troops]], sent \"to secure the ceremony.\"{{sfn|\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043d|1997|p=93}}\n\nBy 09:00, the motorcade of Bokassa was still on the way, and the famous [[French Navy]] orchestra of 120&nbsp;people,{{sfn|\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043d|1997|p=93}} present at the stadium, began to play an old drinking song, {{lang|fr|Chevaliers de la table ronde}}, to distract guests. Since the air conditioning at the stadium did not work, the extremely high temperature\u2014more than {{convert|35|C}}\u2014gradually made itself felt, which created discomfort for those present who were dressed in suits and evening dresses. Some, in order not to sweat, fanned the ceremony programs, which were given out to each guest. Only at about 10:10, the imperial motorcade, which had traveled several kilometers in length from the Renaissance Palace itself, arrived at the stadium. Along the motorcade route, a change occurred: unable to withstand the heat of riding in a closed carriage, Bokassa and Empress Catherine moved into one of the Mercedes equipped with air conditioning, and several hundred meters before reaching the end point of the route they moved back to the carriage again.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=93}}\n\nAt 10:15, the coronation ceremony began. The first to enter the hall were two guardsmen in military uniforms of the [[Napoleonic era]] who carried the [[Flag of the Central African Republic|national flag]] and the imperial standard to the end of the carpet. They then stood with the flags on either side of the platform where the thrones were located. After the guardsmen followed the Crown Prince. The boy was dressed in a white, military-parade uniform with a golden braid and a ribbon over his shoulder, and a white cap on his head. Next, Empress Catherine appeared in the hall. A mantle was fastened on top of her dress, and a golden, laurel-like wreath adorned her head. The Empress was accompanied by [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]] in pink and white evening dresses and wide-brimmed hats, who supported the long train of her dress until she reached her throne.{{sfn|Titley|2002|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nBefore Bokassa himself entered the hall, the naval orchestra went silent. A voice from the loudspeaker announced to drumming: \"His Imperial Majesty Bokassa I, the Emperor of Central Africa!\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} Accompanied by the sounds of an imperial march, the Emperor appeared on the carpet, dressed in a white toga with a belt having five stripes of the colors of the national flag. A wide ribbon was draped over Bokassa\u2019s shoulder, white antelope skin gloves covered his hands, and his head was decorated with a golden wreath, crafted in ancient Roman style. Accompanied by his escort, cameramen and photographers, he climbed onto the platform to his throne, after which the guardsmen handed him attributes of imperial power: a sword and a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=on|spell=in|sp=us}} sceptre, which Bokassa took in his right hand. Then several pairs of guardsmen brought a long velvet mantle to the throne, and one of them put it on the Emperor. After this, Bokassa himself placed the crown on his head. The audience responded with applause. To complete it the ceremony, the Emperor publicly took the oath to the Central African people:{{sfn|Titley|2002|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n{{quote|We, Bokassa I, the Emperor of Central Africa, by the will of the Central African people&nbsp;... solemnly swear and promise&nbsp;\u2013 before the people, before all mankind and before history&nbsp;\u2013 to do everything possible to protect the Constitution, protect national independence and territorial integrity&nbsp;... and serve the Central African people in accordance with the sacred ideals of the national political party.}}\n\nWhen Bokassa finished speaking, the audience applauded again, and loudspeakers sounded {{lang|fr|[[La Renaissance]]}}, the national anthem, in the [[Sango language]]. Upon its completion, the coronation of Empress Catherine began. Dressed in a robe, she went to her husband and knelt in front of him, after which he took off the wreath from her head and placed the crown. This scene, as witnesses of the coronation noticed, had a noticeable similarity to the moment captured on the painting ''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]].{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=83}} Noticeably, the French minister Robert Galley was dressed during the coronation as Marshal of the Empire [[Michel Ney]] during the coronation of Napoleon.<ref name=\"\u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430\">{{cite journal |author = \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0435\u0432-\u0420\u044b\u0431\u0438\u043d|url= http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/vs/article/7238|title= \u041f\u044f\u0442\u044c\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u044b |edition= [[Vokrug sveta]] |date= November 2010|number= 11 (2842)|language= Russian}}</ref> The coronation ceremony was completed with a performance of the choir who arrived at the stadium.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=95}}\n\nAfter the coronation, the Emperor, the Empress with ladies-in-waiting, the Crown Prince, and the rest of the children of Bokassa, went to the Mass at the [[Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (Bangui)|Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame]], two kilometers from the stadium. Along the way, they were accompanied by an equestrian unit of [[Hussar|hussars]]. While the Emperor and the Empress rode again in a closed carriage, the Crown Prince was separated from them, in an open horse-drawn carriage. On the way to the Cath\u00e9drale, the imperial [[Glossary of French expressions in English|cortege]] passed under the triumphal arches and banners with the letter \"B\", which appeared in Bangui on the eve of the festivities. Along the road crowds stood on the sidewalks, however, their actions, according to Brian Titley, did not demonstrate \"obvious enthusiasm.\"{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=95}}\n\nIn the Cath\u00e9drale, two thrones were prepared in advance for the Emperor and the Empress, and a small seat for the Crown Prince, similar to the one in the stadium. A few more seats were intended for high-ranking guests, but they didn't have enough seats for all, and many had to remain standing. The Mass in three languages\u2014French, Latin, and [[Sango language|Sango]]\u2014was held by Archbishop N'Dayen. He preached with dignity, wishing the Emperor success, but avoiding the expected excessive praise and adulation.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=95}}\n\n=== Dinner ===\nThe last event of 4 December was an evening banquet at the [[Renaissance Palace]] hosted by Bokassa for, in his view, the most outstanding guests. Those who were not invited to the reception, went to the bar of the Hotel Rock, equipped with air conditioning.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=96}}\n\nA total of about 400 people attended the banquet. Since, by evening, the heat in the capital had gradually subsided, the event was held in the open air: the tables where guests were seated were located in a vast, picturesque garden, decorated with fountains and bone carvings, adjacent to the Palace. For security, the garden was protected by bulletproof glass screens.{{sfn|Musky|2002|p=81}} By 21:00, when all the guests had gathered, the waiters started serving food, although Bokassa, as usual, was late and only appeared after some time. By this time, he changed his coronation clothes and regalia for a marshal's uniform with a cap featuring a cockade and ostrich feathers, and a black diamond ring glittered on the Emperor's finger. The Empress who accompanied him wore a long, {{lang|fr|[[haute couture]]}}, French evening dress.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=96}}\n\nA variety of dishes were served at the banquet. For dessert, the guests were offered a huge seven-layer imperial cake, decorated with green icing. When the cake was taken to the tables, the top part was removed from it, releasing half a dozen pigeons outside. Dishes on the tables corresponded to its contents: dinner was served on gold and porcelain plates, ordered specially from the famous [[Limoges]] master Berardo.{{sfn|Musky|2002|pp=80\u201381}} When the guests had eaten enough, Bokassa leaned over to Robert Galley and whispered: \"You did not notice it, but you ate human meat.\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} It is not known whether the Emperor was telling the truth or not, but later his words became one of the reasons for the belief that Bokassa was a [[Cannibalism|cannibal]].{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=96}} Moreover, it is believed that the served meat belonged to prisoners held in a Bangui prison.{{sfn|Musky|2002|p=81}}\n\nAfter dinner, a scheduled 35-minute break took place, during which a festive firework display was given at the Palace. Pyrotechnics, were brought from [[Paris]].{{sfn|\u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043d|1997|pp=93\u201394}} The fireworks were followed by a pop show in which several songs were performed by a song-and-dance group of former bar girls from [[Saigon]], [[South Vietnam]]. The French naval orchestra, which had performed at the stadium, also participated. When it played the \"Imperial Waltz,\" written in France specifically on the occasion of the coronation of Bokassa, the Emperor and Empress invited guests to the dance floor. The party came to an end around 02:30.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=96}}\n\n=== Parade ===\nOn the morning of 5 December 1977, a solemn parade began in Bangui to mark the coronation of Bokassa. The parade was held on one of the main avenues of the Central African capital, where a special review platform was installed for the Emperor and his guests. At 10:00, Bokassa arrived, again an hour late. The Emperor was again dressed in a marshal's uniform, and Catherine was dressed in a garden party dress and a pale, purple, wide-brimmed hat.{{sfn|Titley|2002|pp=96\u201397}}\n\nThe parade was the final part of the celebrations accompanying the coronation. Additionally, in the afternoon, a number of sporting events were held in Bangui, also timed to coincide with the coronation, the largest of which was the Coronation Cup basketball tournament\u2014the Emperor himself was present. Later that evening, several parties and receptions took place. Gradually, the festive atmosphere in the capital faded and the guests began to go home, after which Bangui returned to the usual way of life.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=97}}\n\n=== Assessment ===\n[[File:Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]]]]\nThe coronation of Bokassa I provoked a mixed reaction throughout the world, and led to mainly negative comments in Africa. Kenya's ''[[Daily Nation]]'' referred to Bokassa's \"clowning glory,\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} while the ''[[Zambia Daily Mail]]'' deplored his \"obnoxious excesses.\"{{uncited quote|date=July 2019}} The reaction in Europe was generally dismissive: French journalists associated the coronation with a masquerade, ridiculing the wastefulness and vanity of Bokassa. The assessment of French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing was more optimistic. Having watched the recording of the ceremony on TV, he called what was happening \u201cbeautiful\u201d and emphasized the \u201ccertain dignity\u201d of such a coronation. He compared Empress Catherine with Napoleon's wife, [[Empress Jos\u00e9phine]], calling them both \"incarnations of modesty and charm.\"{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=97}}\n\nDespite the fact that the coronation and accompanying celebrations caused serious damage to the state budget, Bokassa was not the only contemporary monarch who decided to stage a similar lavish event: in 1971, on the occasion of the [[2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire]], Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] of the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Imperial State of Iran]] declared himself the successor to [[Cyrus the Great]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], and spent about US$100 million (${{Inflation|US|100|1971|r=-1|fmt=c}} million today) to celebrate the anniversary. This amount far exceeded the one that was spent by Bokassa in 1977.{{sfn|Titley|2002|p=97}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Coronations in Africa]]\n* [[History of the Central African Republic]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book| author = Titley, Brian. | chapter = | chapter-url = | format = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kEPbRmivj7IC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa | orig-year = | agency =  | edition =   |location= Quebec City |date = 2002 |publisher= McGill-Queen's Press |at=  |volume=  |issue = | pages = 82\u201398| page =  | series =  | isbn = | ref = Titley}}\n* {{cite book| author = Musky, I.
