The family had a long history of service to the royal family. His maternal great-grandfather was [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Arthur Bigge]], later Lord Stamfordham, private secretary to [[Queen Victoria]] and [[King George V]]. His paternal great-grandfather was Admiral [[Edward Stanley Adeane]].\n\nEdward was educated at [[Eton College]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where he graduated with an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]].  He was a [[Page of Honour]] to [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|The Queen]] from 1954 to 1956.<ref name=peerage>[http://thepeerage.com/p14133.htm#i141329 thePeerage.com \u2013 Person page 14133]</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1960\u20131961 he was a Plebiscite Supervisor in the Southern [[Cameroon]].  He was called to the Bar at the [[Middle Temple]] in July 1962, and specialised in libel until 1979.  As a barrister he defended ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' magazine, owned by [[Playboy Enterprises|Playboy Publications]], Inc., in 1973, when they had accused [[Fiona Lewis]], an actress, of being involved with South American revolutionaries.  She was awarded damages.\n\nThe following year, he represented ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine who had libelled publishers [[Jonathan Cape]], suggesting they were in financial difficulties, and won a similar outcome in that case.  In 1975 he was more successful in representing [[Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia, Lady Falkender]], who was falsely accused of forging the signature of her boss, former Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]].  She was paid damages and costs.  In 1977, Adeane represented [[Marlene Dietrich]], the glamorous Hollywood actress, in a libel case brought by producer [[Alexander H. Cohen|Alexander Cohen]] and Brentwood TV, of New York, for breach of contract, as a disreputable performer.<ref>Wilmington Morning Star, quoting British press reports, 22 April 1977</ref>\n\nAdeane was appointed Private Secretary and Treasurer to the [[Prince of Wales]] in May 1979 to succeed Sqdr Ldr [[David Checketts]].  Prince Charles and Edward Adeane shared a passion in angling on the River Test near Stockbridge, Hampshire.  They were members of the Houghton Fishing Club, where Adeane continued to fish right up until his last days.  On the engagement of [[Lady Diana Spencer]] and the Prince, she was due to arrive at Albany House, where Adeane had a barrister's set.  The staff expected octogenarian [[Lady Diana Cooper]], but were bemused to find a much younger lady arrive in her Mini Metro and park perfectly.  Princess Diana had a nervous start in a royal household, where she dismissed almost all of the staff.  Adeane was made the Princess's Treasurer in 1981 on their marriage.  Adeane was granted the additional appointment as private secretary to the Princess in 1984, following Oliver Everett's resignation.  The alleged trouble started during the 1983 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand, when the Princess first expressed concern at leaving her children behind in London.<ref>Ocala Star Banner, Sat 12 January 1985 citing Daily Express</ref> The Daily Mirror reported her calling Adeane a \"fuddy-duddy\".<ref>Sportsman Review, Spokane, WA, USA, citing Daily Mirror (11 January 1985), p.14</ref>\n\nWhen Adeane tried to plan a tour of Australia in 1984, he was accused of trying to manipulate State elections in Victoria for political purposes.  In attempting to distance the Premier, Adeane was quoted in the [[Daily Mirror]] and other newspapers.  The controversy behind the scenes stirred royal watchers to speculate that all was not well with the royal marriage when finally, the Prince and Princess of Wales stepped onto the Canberra tarmac early in October 1985.<ref>Sydney Morning Herald, 26 November 1989</ref> \"Obviously the key to this confusion will depend on whether Prince Charles wishes to adhere to the advice given in your letter of 15 May 1984, or not!\" exclaimed a rather uppity courtier.  The prince had changed the itinerary on several points, leaving an exasperated secretary to make a number of public pronouncements.<ref>Sydney M H, 26 November 1989</ref> What made matters worse was what assistant secretary called a \"bombshell\" dropped by RAAF which refused to carry the royal couple from Heathrow, but could only pick up from Bahrain or Singapore.<ref>Ken Anderson, The Royals Down Under</ref> Angry at being told to 'wait around' at foreign airports, Prince Charles deplored the chaos, and ultimately 'heads would roll.' It did not help matters that Major Ronald Ferguson, royal polo manager was embroiled in the disorganised mess on board.   The Australians objected to the mounting costs to the taxpayer; and the Americans suggested that on their leg, the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pick them up from Washington DC.  Ironically Prince Charles cut the itinerary down to avoid inappropriate and stressful visits and not cost.  But the consequences added to the growing disharmony in the royal household, for which Adeane had primary responsibility.\n\nAdeane resigned after disagreements and accusations that he was taking decisions without consulting the prince, and being too much of the 'old school tie' about him.<ref>Canada Daily Mail, 9 January 1985</ref> However Adeane found that the prince invariably did the opposite of what he was advised.  An almost unprecedented state of affairs materialised on 19 March 1985, when the press were invited into Buckingham Palace to discuss relations.<ref>Eagle, 5 May 1985, Parade Magazine, p.18</ref> Evidently the last straw for Adeane he resigned on 31 March 1985.

The three largest powers are the [[United Nations]] of [[Earth]] and [[Moon|Luna]], the Martian Congressional Republic on [[Mars]], and the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), a loose configuration of the [[asteroid belt]] and the moons of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]].\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 1 (2015\u201316)|l1=Season 1 episodes}}\nChrisjen Avasarala, a [[United Nations]] executive, works to prevent war between Earth and Mars. [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] police detective Joe Miller is sent to find a missing young woman, Julie Mao. The space-freighter ''Canterbury'' and the Martian Navy flagship ''Donnager'' are destroyed by ships built by Jules-Pierre Mao, Julie's father. James Holden, Naomi Nagata, Alex Kamal and Amos Burton escape in a Martian gunship named the ''Tachi''. They subsequently rename the ship ''Rocinante'', which becomes the main [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] of the series. The crew of the ''Rocinante'', with Miller's help, investigates and eventually discovers a biohazard that kills off most of the humans on the asteroid [[433 Eros|Eros]], including Julie.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_2_(2017)|l1=Season 2 episodes}}\nMartian Marine Bobbie Draper fights an inhuman figure on Ganymede and later becomes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Avasarala. The crew try to help a father find his daughter and, in the process, encounters and kills the figure that Draper fought, now known as a \"protomolecule hybrid\" developed by Jules-Pierre. A research ship, sent to Venus to investigate the crash of ''Eros'', is stopped dead in the atmosphere and completely disassembled by the protomolecule.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 3 (2018)|l1=Season 3 episodes}}\nThe UN declares war as Earth and Mars send science vessels to investigate what's happening on [[Venus]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 4 (2019)|l1=Season 4 episodes}}\nA vast land rush begins now that portals to other habitable worlds have opened up. Earth begins to invest vast resources (that it had earlier stinted Mars and the belt) on the new earthlike worlds through the portal. In the outer worlds, the residents' efforts to enhance life, particularly terraforming on Mars, begin to wane, since much richer worlds are now available, and investment \"here at home\" is not as attractive.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Thomas Jane]], [[Steven Strait]], [[Cas Anvar]]\n| image1      = Thomas Jane by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width1      = 2104\n| height1     = 2992\n| image2      = Steven Strait at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.jpg\n| width2      = 2504\n| height2     = 3340\n| image3      = Cas Anvar by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width3      = 1421\n| height3     = 1965\n}}{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Dominique Tipper]], [[Wes Chatham]], [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]]\n| image1      = Dominique Tipper (2012) (cropped).jpg\n| width1      = 1006\n| height1     = 1420\n| image2      = Wes Chatham.jpg\n| width2      = 1497\n| height2     = 1786\n| image3      = ShohrehAghdashloo08TIFF (cropped).jpg\n| width3      = 468\n| height3     = 550\n}}{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Frankie Adams]], [[Florence Faivre]], [[Chad Coleman|Chad L.

The three largest powers are the [[United Nations]] of [[Earth]] and [[Moon|Luna]], the Martian Congressional Republic on [[Mars]], and the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA), a loose configuration of the [[asteroid belt]] and the moons of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]].\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 1 (2015\u201316)|l1=Season 1 episodes}}\nChrisjen Avasarala, a [[United Nations]] executive, works to prevent war between Earth and Mars. [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] police detective Joe Miller is sent to find a missing young woman, Julie Mao. The space-freighter ''Canterbury'' and the Martian Navy flagship ''Donnager'' are destroyed by ships built by Jules-Pierre Mao, Julie's father. James Holden, Naomi Nagata, Alex Kamal and Amos Burton escape in a Martian gunship named the ''Tachi''. They subsequently rename the ship ''Rocinante'', which becomes the main [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] of the series. The crew of the ''Rocinante'', with Miller's help, investigates and eventually discovers a biohazard that kills off most of the humans on the asteroid [[433 Eros|Eros]], including Julie.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{main|List_of_The_Expanse_episodes#Season_2_(2017)|l1=Season 2 episodes}}\nMartian Marine Bobbie Draper fights an inhuman figure on Ganymede and later becomes a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Avasarala. The crew try to help a father find his daughter and, in the process, encounters and kills the figure that Draper fought, now known as a \"protomolecule hybrid\" developed by Jules-Pierre. A research ship, sent to Venus to investigate the crash of ''Eros'', is stopped dead in the atmosphere and completely disassembled by the protomolecule.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 3 (2018)|l1=Season 3 episodes}}\nThe UN declares war as Earth and Mars send science vessels to investigate what's happening on [[Venus]].\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{main|List of The Expanse episodes#Season 4 (2019)|l1=Season 4 episodes}}\nA vast land rush begins now that portals to other habitable worlds have opened up. Earth begins to invest vast resources (that it had earlier stinted Mars and the belt) on the new earthlike worlds through the portal. In the outer worlds, the residents' efforts to enhance life, particularly terraforming on Mars, begin to wane, since much richer worlds are now available, and investment \"here at home\" is not as attractive.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Thomas Jane]], [[Steven Strait]], [[Cas Anvar]]\n| image1      = Thomas Jane by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width1      = 2104\n| height1     = 2992\n| image2      = Steven Strait at the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival.jpg\n| width2      = 2504\n| height2     = 3340\n| image3      = Cas Anvar by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| width3      = 1421\n| height3     = 1965\n}}{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Dominique Tipper]], [[Wes Chatham]], [[Shohreh Aghdashloo]]\n| image1      = Dominique Tipper (2012) (cropped).jpg\n| width1      = 1006\n| height1     = 1420\n| image2      = Wes Chatham.jpg\n| width2      = 1497\n| height2     = 1786\n| image3      = ShohrehAghdashloo08TIFF (cropped).jpg\n| width3      = 468\n| height3     = 550\n}}{{Multiple image\n| total_width = 340\n| align       = right\n| footer      = [[Frankie Adams]], [[Florence Faivre]], [[Chad Coleman|Chad L.

He is a professor of psychology at the [[University of Toronto]]. After 2016, he gained attention for his outspoken views on cultural and political issues.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Alberta]], Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the [[University of Alberta]] and a PhD in clinical psychology from [[McGill University]]. After teaching and research at [[Harvard University]], he returned to Canada in 1998 to join the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, ''[[Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief]]'', which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book combined information from psychology, mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]].\n\nIn 2016, Peterson released a series of [[YouTube]] videos criticizing the ''[[Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code]]'' (Bill C-16), passed by the Parliament of Canada to introduce \"[[gender identity]] and [[gender expression|expression]]\" as a prohibited grounds of discrimination.{{efn-la|name=\"discrimination\"}} He argued that the bill would make the use of certain [[gender pronouns]] into [[compelled speech]], and related this argument to a general critique of [[political correctness]] and [[identity politics]]. He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, Peterson's lectures and debates\u2014propagated through podcasts and YouTube\u2014gradually gathered millions of views. He put his clinical practice and teaching duties on hold by 2018, when he published his second book, ''[[12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos]]''. Promoted with a world tour, it became a bestseller in several countries.\n\n== Early life ==\nPeterson was born on June 12, 1962.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/pg/drjordanpeterson/about/ \"About\"], Peterson's official Facebook page</ref> He grew up in [[Fairview, Alberta|Fairview]], [[Alberta]], a small town northwest of his birthplace ([[Edmonton]]).<ref name=\":0\">[[Nellie Bowles|Bowles, Nellie]] (May 18, 2018).

He is a professor of psychology at the [[University of Toronto]]. After 2016, he gained attention for his outspoken views on cultural and political issues.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Alberta]], Peterson obtained bachelor's degrees in political science and psychology from the [[University of Alberta]] and a PhD in clinical psychology from [[McGill University]]. After teaching and research at [[Harvard University]], he returned to Canada in 1998 to join the faculty of psychology at the University of Toronto. In 1999, he published his first book, ''[[Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief]]'', which became the basis for many of his subsequent lectures. The book combined information from psychology, mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and neuroscience to analyze systems of belief and [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]].\n\nIn 2016, Peterson released a series of [[YouTube]] videos criticizing the ''[[Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code]]'' (Bill C-16), passed by the Parliament of Canada to introduce \"[[gender identity]] and [[gender expression|expression]]\" as a prohibited grounds of discrimination.{{efn-la|The phrase \"a prohibited ground of discrimination\" means that it is illegal to discriminate against an individual or groups of people {{em|on the grounds of}} (based on) race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, etc.}} He argued that the bill would make the use of certain [[gender pronouns]] into [[compelled speech]], and related this argument to a general critique of [[political correctness]] and [[identity politics]]. He subsequently received significant media coverage, attracting both support and criticism.\n\nIn the wake of the controversy, Peterson's lectures and debates\u2014propagated through podcasts and YouTube\u2014gradually gathered millions of views. He put his clinical practice and teaching duties on hold by 2018, when he published his second book, ''[[12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos]]''. Promoted with a world tour, it became a bestseller in several countries.\n\n== Early life ==\nPeterson was born on June 12, 1962.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/pg/drjordanpeterson/about/ \"About\"], Peterson's official Facebook page</ref> He grew up in [[Fairview, Alberta|Fairview]], [[Alberta]], a small town northwest of his birthplace ([[Edmonton]]).<ref name=\":0\">[[Nellie Bowles|Bowles, Nellie]] (May 18, 2018).

It is about a postman who gets involved in the lives of people.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nThe film opens with a postman in Maharashtra. He tells three stores about his life.\n\nThe first story is about an old man who has worked all his life at a saw mill. The postman regularly brings him letters from his children. The postman's pregnant wife reads some of the letters. She believes they are not merely letters; they carry messages and emotions. To the postman the letters are merely his job. He delivers letters and sometimes read them aloud when the recipient cannot read. One day the old man decides to retire from his job and go live peacefully with his children. He asks the owner of the saw mill to settle his dues. The owner, shrewd and deceitful, says the old man is due nothing; in fact the old man must repay his loans, now with interest totaling one thousand rupees. The old man decides he will repay the loan by working it off, and then leave with a clean account. At the end of the month the owner reports that the old man's work just covers the interest accrued in that month. The old man realizes that the loan is usurious; he will not be able to pay it off by working. The old man writes a letter to God. He writes that he has lived an honest life and if God has created a righteous world then God must send him the thousand rupees so he can leave with honor. The postman's wife reads this letter and decides to send the old man her savings, seven hundred rupees. The postman delivers the money but is insufficient and the old man must return to work. A few days later the old man dies at the saw mill. In his last letter, to God, he asks why God has created wicked men like the postman who cruelly stole three hundred rupees from the thousand rupees God had sent him. The postman sorrowfully reads this letter to his wife.\n\nSome years later the postman was assigned to a hill station. His second story is about his job at that hill station. One of his daily tasks is to incinerate letters which cannot be delivered or returned. The postman's wife has gone to her own village to deliver their second child. The postman sometimes reads the dead letters before he incinerates them. One such letter, which arrives frequently, is from a woman to a man, probably her husband. One day when the postman is about to enter a school he is stopped by a man at the school gate. The man introduces himself; the postman recognizes his name immediately as the recipient of the woman's letters. The man hands the postman a letter addressed to the frequent letter writer who, says the man, is his daughter. The man implores the postman to deliver it promptly and directly to his daughter. He is a soldier. He wants to see his daughter. He must see her today because tomorrow he must return to his duty, far away. The postman brings his letter to the school matron. There is no such girl at the school. The matron searches the old registers and uncovers that the girl had graduated and left the school many years ago. They come to the gate but the father has vanished. On the following day the soldier meets the postman again. This time he tells the postman a story. Many years ago, he traveled home to see his daughter at her school. His bus had accidentally tumbled into a valley and everyone (including him) was killed. He only wants to see his daughter. Now the postman realizes that the soldier is a ghost. The postman sets about tracking down the daughter. She runs a bar. The postman meets her and tells her the story. At first she laughs but she gradually realizes, to her shock and grief, that the story is true. She had thought her father had abandoned her. She realizes her father has died, today, because the postman brought her the news. She breaks down and curses at the postman and drives him away.\n\nThe third story is about the postman's job at another village. Every day a woman calls out to him, qasim, the bringer of news. She asks, always eagerly, if he has a letter from her lover and sometimes when there is a letter she is overjoyed. She is a dancing girl, a nautch girl. One day her lover comes to see her. He leaves the following morning; he promises to take her with him the next time. He writes letters and, some weeks later, visits her again. She wants to go with him. He says it is not possible today. There is a loud fight. He exclaims that money is required to buy her freedom before he can take her away; he does not have the money yet. Some days later the postman sees a medicine man on the roadside. The medicine man has a mask, a wooden face mask, for sale. It is charmed and it can grant wishes, says the medicine man. The postman recognizes the mask immediately; it was made by the old man of the saw mill as a present for his grandchild. The postman remembers the same mask hanging on the wall of the bar. The medicine man says it costs three hundred rupees. The postman recalls the soldier's daughter had quoted the same sum when the postman had asked about the mask at the bar. The postman contemplates buying the mask but decides not to meddle with forces that may be beyond him. Some days later he finds the dancing girl has bought the mask. That night she wishes it to bring her money so she can buy her freedom and join her lover. In a few days the postman brings her a large sum of money and a letter from her lover's firm. Her lover was caught in the machinery and was mangled to death; this is insurance money which he had willed to her. The postman is disturbed by the turn of events. He leaves the village to his next posting. He sees the girl, now pale and dreadful, going to return the mask.\n\nThe film ends when the postman and his family board the bus to his next job. The soldier appears on the bus, smiling and giving sweets to the postman's daughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n*Grish Kulkarni The postman\n*Dilip Prabhavalkar The old man\n*Vibhavari Deshpande The soldier's daughter\n*Radhika Apte The dancing girl\n\n== External links ==\n\n*IMDB\n\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = Postcard - Marathi Movie\n| director       = [[Gajendra Ahire]]\n| producer       = Vinay Waman Ganu\n| screenplay     = [[Gajendra Ahire]]\n| story          = \n| starring       = Girish Kulkarni <br> Sai Tamhankar\n| music          = Gandhar Sangoram\n| cinematography = Yogesh Rajguru\n| editing        = Mayur Hardas\n| released       = {{Film date|2014|04|25}}\n| runtime        = 116 minutes\n| country        = India\n| language       = Marathi\n}}\n'''''Postcard''''' is a 2014 Marathi movie written and directed by Gajendra Ahire.

Some days later the postman sees a medicine man on the roadside. The medicine man has a mask, a wooden face mask, for sale. It is charmed and it can grant wishes, says the medicine man. The postman recognizes the mask immediately; it was made by the old man of the saw mill as a present for his grandchild. The postman remembers the same mask hanging on the wall of the bar. The medicine man says it costs three hundred rupees. The postman recalls the soldier\u2019s daughter had quoted the same sum when the postman had asked about the mask at the bar. The postman contemplates buying the mask but decides not to meddle with forces that may be beyond him. Some days later he finds the dancing girl has bought the mask. That night she wishes it to bring her money so she can buy her freedom and join her lover. In a few days the postman brings her a large sum of money and a letter from her lover\u2019s firm. Her lover was caught in the machinery and was mangled to death; this is insurance money which he had willed to her. The postman is disturbed by the turn of events. He leaves the village to his next posting. He sees the girl, now pale and dreadful, going to return the mask.\n\nThe film ends when the postman and his family board the bus to his next job. The soldier appears on the bus, smiling and giving sweets to the postman\u2019s daughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n*Grish Kulkarni The postman\n*Dilip Prabhavalkar The old man\n*Vibhavari Deshpande The soldier's daughter\n*Radhika Apte The dancing girl\n\n== External links ==\n\n*IMDB\n\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:2014 films]]\n", "name_user": "CAPTAIN RAJU", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (5)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcard_(2013_film)"}

Maglev being poorly developed at the time, he proposed steel wheels. The chamber's door to the tube would be opened, and enough air admitted behind to accelerate the train into the tube. Gravity would further accelerate the departing train down to cruise level. Rising from cruise level, the arriving train would decelerate by compressing the rarefied air ahead of it, which would be vented. Pumps at the stations would make up for losses due to friction or air escaping around the edges of the train, the train itself requiring no motor. This combination of modified (shallow) [[gravity train]] and [[atmospheric railway]] propulsion would consume little [[energy]] but limit the system to subsonic speeds, hence initial routes of tens or hundreds of miles or kilometers rather than transcontinental distances were proposed.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nTrains were to require no [[Railway coupling|coupler]]s, each car being directly welded, bolted, or otherwise firmly connected to the next, the route calling for no more bending than the flexibility of steel could easily handle. At the end of the line the train would be moved sideways into the end chamber of the return tube. The railway would have both an inner evacuated tube and an outer tunnel. At cruise depth, the space between would have enough water to float the vacuum tube, softening the ride.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nA route through the [[Northeast Megalopolis]] was laid out, with nine stations, one each in [[Washington DC]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Massachusetts]], and two in [[Connecticut]]. [[Commuter rail]] systems were mapped for the [[San Francisco]] and New York areas, the commuter version having longer, heavier trains, to be propelled less by air and more by gravity than the intercity version. The New York system was to have three lines, terminating in [[Babylon (village), New York|Babylon]], [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Huntington, New York|Huntington]], [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], and [[St. George, Staten Island|St. George]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nSalter pointed out how such a system would help reduce the environmental damage being done to the atmosphere by [[aviation]] and surface transportation. He called underground Very High Speed Transportation (tube shuttles) his nation's \"logical next step\". The plans were never taken to the next stage.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAt the time these reports were published, national prestige was an issue as [[Japan]] had been operating its showcase [[shinkansen]] for several years and [[maglev train]] research was hot technology. The American ''Planetran'' would establish transcontinental subway service in the United States and provide a commute from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]] in one hour. The tunnel would be buried to a depth of several hundred feet in solid rock formations. Construction would make use of [[laser]]s to ensure alignment and use [[tungsten]] probes to melt through [[igneous]] rock formations. The tunnel would maintain a partial vacuum to minimize [[Drag (physics)|drag]]. A trip would average {{convert|3000|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} and subject passengers to accelerations up to 1.4 times that of gravity, requiring the use of [[gimbal]]led compartments. Enormous construction costs (estimated as high as US$1 trillion) were the primary reason why Salter's proposal was never built.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Swissmetro Network 2005.png|thumb|[[Swissmetro]] as proposed in 2005]]\nStarting in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the [[Swissmetro]] was proposed to leverage the invention of the experimental German [[Transrapid]] maglev train, and operate in large tunnels reduced to the pressure altitude of {{convert|68000|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} at which the [[Concorde]] SST was certified to fly.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Frank P.

The transit tube would remain at least {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} below the ocean surface to avoid water turbulence.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn November 18, 1991, [[Gerard K.

He called the company he wanted to form ''VSE International'', for velocity, silence, and efficiency.<ref name=\"Dyson93p98\">{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=98}}</ref>  However, the concept itself he called ''[[Magnetic Flight]]''.  The vehicles, instead of running on a pair of tracks, would be elevated using electromagnetic force by a single track within a tube (permanent magnets in the track, with variable magnets on the vehicle), and propelled by electromagnetic forces through tunnels. He estimated the trains could reach speeds of up to {{convert|2,500|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} \u2013 about five times faster than a jet airliner \u2013 if the air was evacuated from the tunnels.<ref>{{harvnb|Daniels|1992}}</ref> To obtain such speeds, the vehicle would accelerate for the first half of the trip, and then decelerate for the second half of the trip. The acceleration was planned to be a maximum of about one-half of the force of gravity. O'Neill planned to build a network of stations connected by these tunnels, but he died two years before his first patent on it was granted.<ref name=\"Dyson93p98\"/>\n\n==21st century==\n[[James R.
