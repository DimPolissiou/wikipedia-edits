{"title_page": "Sports in Kentucky", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2014}}\n\n==High school sports==\n{{see also|List of Kentucky \"Mr. Basketball\" award winners}}\nDespite the national stereotype that Kentucky is a diehard basketball state, at the high school level the state produces many times over more top nationally ranked football players than basketball. In the past ten years the state has produced many players ranked among the top 20 in their position, notably [[Tim Couch]], [[Chris Redman]], [[Dennis Johnson (defensive end)|Dennis Johnson]], Eric Shelton, [[Michael Bush]], [[Brian Brohm]], [[Mario Urrutia]], Earl Heyman, [[Andr\u00e9 Woodson]], Micah Johnson, and [[DeVante Parker]]. An increasingly growing number of top baseball talent is also coming from Kentucky, such as [[Brandon Webb]], [[Austin Kearns]], and [[Paul Byrd]].\n\nLouisville has had practically a monopoly on the state's top players since their recent success on the national stage. The football Cardinals have historically depended on the states of Florida and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for a majority of their talent, and currently over 65% of the team's starters are from those two states.\n\nAs of 2012, there were six high school [[Rugby union in the United States|rugby]] teams in Kentucky.<ref>The Courier-Journal, Louisville rugby | Cards have 14 players in the 2012 recruiting class, 3 September 2012, http://www.courier-journal.com/article/B2/20120903/SPORTS02/309030065/Louisville-rugby-Cards-14-players-2012-recruiting-class</ref>\n\n==College sports==\nDespite a recent surge in the quality of the [[University of Louisville]] football team, and all UofL sports during the \"[[year of the cardinal]]\" or \"[[Louisville slam]]\", college basketball remains the sport of choice in most of [[Kentucky]]. [[Western Kentucky University]]'s men's basketball program is one of the ten most winning in the history of the NCAA, and has one Final Four appearance (1971). [[Murray State University]] is a perennial threat to win the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] and appear in the NCAA Tournament, having done so 13 times. However, the question in Kentucky college athletics is most often \"Red or Blue?\" referring to the primary colors of its two flagship universities \u2013 the [[University of Kentucky]] (blue) and the [[University of Louisville]] (red).\n\nIn recent years, the [[Louisville Cardinals]] have further proven themselves, not only as one of the state's best organized college athletic programs, but elite on the national stage. The University of Louisville Cardinals are consistently the most profitable college sports franchise in the nation, ranking first in Kentucky with a basketball revenue of $42,434,684 during the 2012 fiscal year. Kentucky came in at 5th on the list making $21,598,681.<ref>[http://businessofcollegesports.com/2013/11/14/most-profitable-football-and-basketball-programs/]</ref> The Cardinals' program has been deemed to have the most equitable fanbase of any school in the country, according to a study conducted by [[Emory Sports Marketing Analytics]].<ref>[http://collegebasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/29/study-says-louisville-has-college-basketballs-best-fanbase-kentucky-7th/]</ref> This is likely due to the fact that almost half of the state of Kentucky's population lives in the city of Louisville and the university has a strong presence citywide. The University of Kentucky is ranked 7th on the list.\n\n===The Battle for the Bluegrass===\n{{see also|Kentucky Wildcats|Louisville Cardinals}}\nThe rivalry between the [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] and the [[Duke Blue Devils]] is perhaps the only in-state basketball rivalry that compares on a national scale to the rivalry between the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] and [[Louisville Cardinals]].\n\nA 2006 ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' article stated that interest in UofL sports is surging across the state of Kentucky, especially in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]] and [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]].<ref>[http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/sports/fans/15763558.htm Where is everybody? \u2013 ''Lexington Herald-Leader'']</ref> An October 21, 2006 ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' article also stated that the total sales of UofL merchandise has tripled since 2001 and that the school now ranks 32nd nationally in sales, up from 41st in 2001. UofL ranks 2nd in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] and the 3rd highest among all urban universities (to [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] and [[University of Miami|Miami]]) in merchandise sales. UK's merchandise sales have steadily remained around 14th in the nation, by far the best in the state. UofL now has more registered collegiate license plates than the [[University of Kentucky]] (18,300 to 17,000); a fourfold increase since 2004. In 1995 UK had a 15,000 plate lead on UofL.<ref name=\"merchsales\">[http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061021/NEWS01/610210358 Racking up sales \u2013 ''The Courier-Journal'']</ref> \nIt is also important to note that in the last few years the [[Louisville Cardinals]] have been the most profitable college sports franchise in the nation and have been deemed to have the most equitable fanbase of any school in the country according to a few studies.\n\nFuel was added to the fire of this rivalry when [[Rick Pitino]], the UK coach who led the Wildcats to their 1996 National Title before leaving to become coach of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Boston Celtics]], returned to the Bluegrass State to coach the Cardinals in 2001. Many in the state compared the move to the treachery of [[Benedict Arnold]]. The situation was exacerbated by the transfer of underachieving Wildcat [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]]/[[center (basketball)|center]] [[Marvin Stone (basketball)|Marvin Stone]]. Stone's best season with the Cats was his sophomore season, when the former [[McDonald's All-American Team|McDonald's All-American]] averaged 6.0 points and 4.6 rebounds per game.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/draft2003/profiles/StoneMarvin.html NBA.com Prospect Profile \u2013 Marvin Stone]</ref> Under Pitino, however, Stone averaged 10.7 points and 7.3 rebounds for the Cards, including a 16-point, 7-rebound, 2-block performance against the Wildcats in an 81\u201363 Louisville win on December 28.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/players/1634/ CNNSI.com Player Profile \u2013 Marvin Stone]</ref>\n\n===College basketball===\n[[File:Battle4bluegrass.GIF|thumb|right]]\nThe modern series, which began in 1983, was started with a win by the [[Louisville Cardinals]]. However, in recent years the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] have dominated the series, winning 5 of the last 7 meetings.\nAt least three college coaching legends have been associated with programs in the state of Kentucky: [[Adolph Rupp]] (UK), [[Denny Crum]] (UofL), and [[Rick Pitino]] (both UK and UofL). Also, several successful [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players played in the state, including [[Pat Riley]], [[Wes Unseld]], and [[Dan Issel]]. Only the [[UCLA Bruins]] have won more NCAA championships than the [[Kentucky Wildcats]], with the Wildcats ranking first in almost every other significant measure of a successful program. In addition to UK and UofL, the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky Hilltoppers]] are also a historically successful basketball program.\n\nIn 2011, the [[University of Pikeville]] won the [[NAIA Men's Basketball Championships|NAIA Men's Basketball National Championship]], followed only days later by [[Bellarmine University]], who won the 2011 [[NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Division II National Championship]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Both teams began their 2011-2012 seasons ranked #1 in the nation in their respective leagues.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Team'''\n![[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]]\n![[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]]\n![[WKU Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky Hilltoppers]]\n|-\n| All-time win-loss record (rank)\n|2,021-637 (1st)\n|1,726-874 (12th)\n|1,622\u2013720 (14th)\n|-\n| All-time winning percentage (rank)\n|76.0% (1st)\n|66.1% (8th)\n|66.5%  (7th)\n|-\n| NCAA Tourney appearances\n|55 (1st)\n|41 (5th)\n|21\n|-\n| NCAA Tourney wins (rank)\n|121 (1st)\n|75 (6th)\n|18\n|-\n| NCAA Final Fours\n|17 (T-2nd)\n|10 (T-5th)\n|1\n|-\n| NCAA titles\n|8 (2nd)\n|3 (6th)\n|0\n|}\n\n====Eras of dominance====\nThe impressive history of college basketball in Kentucky has been punctuated by a few notable eras of dominance by the two flagship schools.\n\n=====UK: Rupp's early years=====\nUnder [[Adolph Rupp]], the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] were the most dominant team in the early history of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]]. From 1942 to 1958 the Wildcats won four NCAA titles (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958). They also won the 1942 [[National Invitation Tournament]].\n\n=====UofL: The Team of the 1980s=====\nThe [[Louisville Cardinals]] were dubbed \"The Team of the 1980s\", winning two national titles during that decade (1980 and 1986). (Only the [[Indiana Hoosiers]] equaled this number during the 1980s.) Under coach [[Denny Crum]], UofL was the only team to go to four Final Fours during the decade, and had more wins than any other team over that span. Darrell Griffith won the [[John Wooden Award]] in 1980 and in 1986 \"Never Nervous\" [[Pervis Ellison]] became the first freshman to ever be named NCAA Final Four MVP, a feat equaled only by [[Syracuse Orangemen|Syracuse]]'s [[Carmelo Anthony]].\n\n=====UK: The Team of the 1990s=====\nThe [[Kentucky Wildcats]] were the most dominant team of the 1990s, winning two national titles (1996 and 1998), with three straight trips to the NCAA Championship game and four total trips to the Final Four. UK's 1996 National Championship team is considered to be the best [[NCAA]] team of all time, as evidenced by the nine players on the roster who played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].<ref>Another future NBA player, [[Scott Padgett]], was attending UK at the time, but was academically ineligible for the 1995\u201396 season.</ref>\n\n===College football===\n[[File:Footballupdated.GIF|thumb|right|UofL has recently dominated the football rivalry, winning 70% of the games in the Modern Series which began in 1994. UK leads the all-time series, 10\u20138.]]\n\nFor all their success in basketball, the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] have been unable to remain consistently competitive in football. The last two Kentucky football seasons have resulted in an embarrassing 2-10 record. Playing in the brutally competitive [[Southeastern Conference]], the Wildcats won an SEC title in 1950 under legendary coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant]] and shared SEC titles in 1976 and 1977 under [[Fran Curci]]. Bryant left the school in 1953; some attribute the move to a conclusion that the football program's popularity would always remain a distant second to the basketball program, at that time coached by [[Adolph Rupp]], a legend in his own right.\n\nUofL hired legendary coach [[Howard Schnellenberger]] in 1984. The team has continued to rise under coaches [[John L. Smith]], [[Bobby Petrino]], and [[Charlie Strong]]. On November 2, 2006, the 5th-ranked [[2006 Louisville Cardinals football team|UofL football team]] defeated the 3rd-ranked [[2006 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia Mountaineers]] in what was dubbed \"The Dream Game\", the second time in [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] history that two top-5 teams had ever met. The game was ranked as the most-viewed [[ESPN]] Thursday night football game ever.<ref>[http://www.bigeast.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110306aal.html West Virginia-Louisville Ranks as Most-Viewed ESPN Thursday Night Football Game Ever]{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The game marked a new high in a program that had been on the rise for several years.\n\nOnly one week later the Cardinals were defeated by a third undefeated [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] team, the upstart and 15th-ranked [[2006 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers Scarlet Knights]], in what was billed as the biggest college football game in the New York City Metro Area [[1946 Army vs. Notre Dame football game|in 60 years]]; with the [[Empire State Building]] even being lit with the Rutgers team colors. The game was also one of the highest rated ESPN Thursday Night games ever as a record crowd in [[Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, New Jersey]] stormed the field in celebration. The loss ended the Cardinals' national title hopes, but the team did receive a bid to the FedEx [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]]. On January 2 the Cardinals defeated Wake Forest 24\u201313<ref>[http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/results Louisville defeats Wake Forrest 24\u201313 in the Orange Bowl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418005305/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/results |date=April 18, 2008 }}</ref> in the Orange Bowl to claim the team's first BCS Bowl win.\n\nMore recently, the state has been at the forefront of coaching integration in Division I FBS football. Following the 2009 season, all three of the state's FBS programs filled their coaching vacancies with African Americans. The first to do so was Western Kentucky, who hired [[Willie Taggart]] to replace the fired [[David Elson]]. Louisville followed suit by hiring [[Charlie Strong]] to replace the fired [[Steve Kragthorpe]]. Finally, [[Joker Phillips]], who had been the designated successor to [[Rich Brooks]] at Kentucky, took over after the latter announced his retirement. The first African American head coach at any of the Division I football programs in Kentucky was [[Ron Cooper (American football)|Ron Cooper]], who coached at Louisville between 1995 and 1997.\n\nThe Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels]] have held a long tradition of football success. Until the 2009-2010 season, the Colonels were tied with [[Florida State University]] for the most consecutive winning seasons (32). In that season, EKU finished 5-6. Eastern returned to the FCS Playoffs in the 2011 season, in which it lost to #17 James Madison 20-17 in the opening round. The Colonels have won 20 [[Ohio Valley Conference]] (OVC) titles and two FCS (formerly I-AA) National Championships, in 1979 and 1982. Much of Eastern Kentucky's success came during the long tenure of head coach [[Roy Kidd]], who led the team from 1964 through 2002. The program has continued its success under more recent coaches [[Danny Hope]] and [[Dean Hood]].\n\n===List of NAIA teams===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!School\n!Nickname\n!Conference\n|-\n|[[Alice Lloyd College]]\n|Eagles\n|[[River States Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Asbury University]]\n|Eagles\n|[[River States Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Brescia University]]\n|Bearcats\n|[[River States Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Campbellsville University]]\n|Tigers\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[University of the Cumberlands]]\n|Patriots\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Georgetown College]]\n|Tigers\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Lindsey Wilson College]]\n|Blue Raiders\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Midway University]]\n|Eagles\n|[[River States Conference]]\n|-\n|[[University of Pikeville]]\n|Bears/Lady Bears\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Thomas More University]]\n|Saints\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Union College]]\n|Bulldogs\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|}\n\n===NJCAA===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!School\n!Nickname\n!Division\n|-\n|[[Elizabethtown Community and Technical College]]\n|Barons\n|III\n|-\n|[[Simmons College of Kentucky]]\n|Panthers\n|I\n|-\n|}\n\n==Professional sports teams==\nProfessional football, baseball and basketball all at one time had teams in Kentucky.

In the past ten years the state has produced many players ranked among the top 20 in their position, notably [[Tim Couch]], [[Chris Redman]], [[Dennis Johnson (defensive end)|Dennis Johnson]], Eric Shelton, [[Michael Bush]], [[Brian Brohm]], [[Mario Urrutia]], Earl Heyman, [[Andr\u00e9 Woodson]], Micah Johnson, and [[DeVante Parker]]. An increasingly growing number of top baseball talent is also coming from Kentucky, such as [[Brandon Webb]], [[Austin Kearns]], and [[Paul Byrd]].\n\nLouisville has had practically a monopoly on the state's top players since their recent success on the national stage. The football Cardinals have historically depended on the states of Florida and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] for a majority of their talent, and currently over 65% of the team's starters are from those two states.\n\nAs of 2012, there were six high school [[Rugby union in the United States|rugby]] teams in Kentucky.<ref>The Courier-Journal, Louisville rugby | Cards have 14 players in the 2012 recruiting class, 3 September 2012, http://www.courier-journal.com/article/B2/20120903/SPORTS02/309030065/Louisville-rugby-Cards-14-players-2012-recruiting-class</ref>\n\n==College sports==\nDespite a recent surge in the quality of the [[University of Louisville]] football team, and all UofL sports during the \"[[year of the cardinal]]\" or \"[[Louisville slam]]\", college basketball remains the sport of choice in most of [[Kentucky]]. [[Western Kentucky University]]'s men's basketball program is one of the ten most winning in the history of the NCAA, and has one Final Four appearance (1971). [[Murray State University]] is a perennial threat to win the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] and appear in the NCAA Tournament, having done so 13 times. However, the question in Kentucky college athletics is most often \"Red or Blue?\" referring to the primary colors of its two flagship universities \u2013 the [[University of Kentucky]] (blue) and the [[University of Louisville]] (red).\n\nIn recent years, the [[Louisville Cardinals]] have further proven themselves, not only as one of the state's best organized college athletic programs, but elite on the national stage. The University of Louisville Cardinals are consistently the most profitable college sports franchise in the nation, ranking first in Kentucky with a basketball revenue of $42,434,684 during the 2012 fiscal year. Kentucky came in at 5th on the list making $21,598,681.<ref>[http://businessofcollegesports.com/2013/11/14/most-profitable-football-and-basketball-programs/]</ref> The Cardinals' program has been deemed to have the most equitable fanbase of any school in the country, according to a study conducted by [[Emory Sports Marketing Analytics]].<ref>[http://collegebasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/05/29/study-says-louisville-has-college-basketballs-best-fanbase-kentucky-7th/]</ref> This is likely due to the fact that almost half of the state of Kentucky's population lives in the city of Louisville and the university has a strong presence citywide. The University of Kentucky is ranked 7th on the list.\n\n===The Battle for the Bluegrass===\n{{see also|Kentucky Wildcats|Louisville Cardinals}}\nThe rivalry between the [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] and the [[Duke Blue Devils]] is perhaps the only in-state basketball rivalry that compares on a national scale to the rivalry between the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] and [[Louisville Cardinals]].\n\nA 2006 ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' article stated that interest in UofL sports is surging across the state of Kentucky, especially in [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]] and [[Owensboro, Kentucky|Owensboro]].<ref>[http://www.kentucky.com/mld/kentucky/sports/fans/15763558.htm Where is everybody? \u2013 ''Lexington Herald-Leader'']</ref> An October 21, 2006 ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' article also stated that the total sales of UofL merchandise has tripled since 2001 and that the school now ranks 32nd nationally in sales, up from 41st in 2001. UofL ranks 2nd in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] and the 3rd highest among all urban universities (to [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] and [[University of Miami|Miami]]) in merchandise sales. UK's merchandise sales have steadily remained around 14th in the nation, by far the best in the state. UofL now has more registered collegiate license plates than the [[University of Kentucky]] (18,300 to 17,000); a fourfold increase since 2004. In 1995 UK had a 15,000 plate lead on UofL.<ref name=\"merchsales\">[http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061021/NEWS01/610210358 Racking up sales \u2013 ''The Courier-Journal'']</ref> \nIt is also important to note that in the last few years the [[Louisville Cardinals]] have been the most profitable college sports franchise in the nation and have been deemed to have the most equitable fanbase of any school in the country according to a few studies.\n\nFuel was added to the fire of this rivalry when [[Rick Pitino]], the UK coach who led the Wildcats to their 1996 National Title before leaving to become coach of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Boston Celtics]], returned to the Bluegrass State to coach the Cardinals in 2001. Many in the state compared the move to the treachery of [[Benedict Arnold]]. The situation was exacerbated by the transfer of underachieving Wildcat [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]]/[[center (basketball)|center]] [[Marvin Stone (basketball)|Marvin Stone]]. Stone's best season with the Cats was his sophomore season, when the former [[McDonald's All-American Team|McDonald's All-American]] averaged 6.0 points and 4.6 rebounds per game.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/draft2003/profiles/StoneMarvin.html NBA.com Prospect Profile \u2013 Marvin Stone]</ref> Under Pitino, however, Stone averaged 10.7 points and 7.3 rebounds for the Cards, including a 16-point, 7-rebound, 2-block performance against the Wildcats in an 81\u201363 Louisville win on December 28.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/men/players/1634/ CNNSI.com Player Profile \u2013 Marvin Stone]</ref>\n\n===College basketball===\n[[File:Battle4bluegrass.GIF|thumb|right]]\nThe modern series, which began in 1983, was started with a win by the [[Louisville Cardinals]]. However, in recent years the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] have dominated the series, winning 5 of the last 7 meetings.\nAt least three college coaching legends have been associated with programs in the state of Kentucky: [[Adolph Rupp]] (UK), [[Denny Crum]] (UofL), and [[Rick Pitino]] (both UK and UofL). Also, several successful [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players played in the state, including [[Pat Riley]], [[Wes Unseld]], and [[Dan Issel]]. Only the [[UCLA Bruins]] have won more NCAA championships than the [[Kentucky Wildcats]], with the Wildcats ranking first in almost every other significant measure of a successful program. In addition to UK and UofL, the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky Hilltoppers]] are also a historically successful basketball program.\n\nIn 2011, the [[University of Pikeville]] won the [[NAIA Men's Basketball Championships|NAIA Men's Basketball National Championship]], followed only days later by [[Bellarmine University]], who won the 2011 [[NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship|NCAA Men's Basketball Division II National Championship]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. Both teams began their 2011-2012 seasons ranked #1 in the nation in their respective leagues.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Team'''\n![[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcats]]\n![[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]]\n![[WKU Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky Hilltoppers]]\n|-\n| All-time win-loss record (rank)\n|2,021-637 (1st)\n|1,726-874 (12th)\n|1,622\u2013720 (14th)\n|-\n| All-time winning percentage (rank)\n|76.0% (1st)\n|66.1% (8th)\n|66.5%  (7th)\n|-\n| NCAA Tourney appearances\n|55 (1st)\n|41 (5th)\n|21\n|-\n| NCAA Tourney wins (rank)\n|121 (1st)\n|75 (6th)\n|18\n|-\n| NCAA Final Fours\n|17 (T-2nd)\n|10 (T-5th)\n|1\n|-\n| NCAA titles\n|8 (2nd)\n|3 (6th)\n|0\n|}\n\n====Eras of dominance====\nThe impressive history of college basketball in Kentucky has been punctuated by a few notable eras of dominance by the two flagship schools.\n\n=====UK: Rupp's early years=====\nUnder [[Adolph Rupp]], the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] were the most dominant team in the early history of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]]. From 1942 to 1958 the Wildcats won four NCAA titles (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958). They also won the 1942 [[National Invitation Tournament]].\n\n=====UofL: The Team of the 1980s=====\nThe [[Louisville Cardinals]] were dubbed \"The Team of the 1980s\", winning two national titles during that decade (1980 and 1986). (Only the [[Indiana Hoosiers]] equaled this number during the 1980s.) Under coach [[Denny Crum]], UofL was the only team to go to four Final Fours during the decade, and had more wins than any other team over that span. Darrell Griffith won the [[John Wooden Award]] in 1980 and in 1986 \"Never Nervous\" [[Pervis Ellison]] became the first freshman to ever be named NCAA Final Four MVP, a feat equaled only by [[Syracuse Orangemen|Syracuse]]'s [[Carmelo Anthony]].\n\n=====UK: The Team of the 1990s=====\nThe [[Kentucky Wildcats]] were the most dominant team of the 1990s, winning two national titles (1996 and 1998), with three straight trips to the NCAA Championship game and four total trips to the Final Four. UK's 1996 National Championship team is considered to be the best [[NCAA]] team of all time, as evidenced by the nine players on the roster who played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].<ref>Another future NBA player, [[Scott Padgett]], was attending UK at the time, but was academically ineligible for the 1995\u201396 season.</ref>\n\n===College football===\n[[File:Footballupdated.GIF|thumb|right|UofL has recently dominated the football rivalry, winning 70% of the games in the Modern Series which began in 1994. UK leads the all-time series, 10\u20138.]]\n\nFor all their success in basketball, the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] have been unable to remain consistently competitive in football. The last two Kentucky football seasons have resulted in an embarrassing 2-10 record. Playing in the brutally competitive [[Southeastern Conference]], the Wildcats won an SEC title in 1950 under legendary coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul \"Bear\" Bryant]] and shared SEC titles in 1976 and 1977 under [[Fran Curci]]. Bryant left the school in 1953; some attribute the move to a conclusion that the football program's popularity would always remain a distant second to the basketball program, at that time coached by [[Adolph Rupp]], a legend in his own right.\n\nUofL hired legendary coach [[Howard Schnellenberger]] in 1984. The team has continued to rise under coaches [[John L. Smith]], [[Bobby Petrino]], and [[Charlie Strong]]. On November 2, 2006, the 5th-ranked [[2006 Louisville Cardinals football team|UofL football team]] defeated the 3rd-ranked [[2006 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia Mountaineers]] in what was dubbed \"The Dream Game\", the second time in [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] history that two top-5 teams had ever met. The game was ranked as the most-viewed [[ESPN]] Thursday night football game ever.<ref>[http://www.bigeast.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110306aal.html West Virginia-Louisville Ranks as Most-Viewed ESPN Thursday Night Football Game Ever]{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The game marked a new high in a program that had been on the rise for several years.\n\nOnly one week later the Cardinals were defeated by a third undefeated [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] team, the upstart and 15th-ranked [[2006 Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team|Rutgers Scarlet Knights]], in what was billed as the biggest college football game in the New York City Metro Area [[1946 Army vs. Notre Dame football game|in 60 years]]; with the [[Empire State Building]] even being lit with the Rutgers team colors. The game was also one of the highest rated ESPN Thursday Night games ever as a record crowd in [[Rutgers Stadium|Piscataway, New Jersey]] stormed the field in celebration. The loss ended the Cardinals' national title hopes, but the team did receive a bid to the FedEx [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]]. On January 2 the Cardinals defeated Wake Forest 24\u201313<ref>[http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/results Louisville defeats Wake Forrest 24\u201313 in the Orange Bowl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418005305/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/results |date=April 18, 2008 }}</ref> in the Orange Bowl to claim the team's first BCS Bowl win.\n\nMore recently, the state has been at the forefront of coaching integration in Division I FBS football. Following the 2009 season, all three of the state's FBS programs filled their coaching vacancies with African Americans. The first to do so was Western Kentucky, who hired [[Willie Taggart]] to replace the fired [[David Elson]]. Louisville followed suit by hiring [[Charlie Strong]] to replace the fired [[Steve Kragthorpe]]. Finally, [[Joker Phillips]], who had been the designated successor to [[Rich Brooks]] at Kentucky, took over after the latter announced his retirement. The first African American head coach at any of the Division I football programs in Kentucky was [[Ron Cooper (American football)|Ron Cooper]], who coached at Louisville between 1995 and 1997.\n\nThe Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels]] have held a long tradition of football success. Until the 2009-2010 season, the Colonels were tied with [[Florida State University]] for the most consecutive winning seasons (32). In that season, EKU finished 5-6. Eastern returned to the FCS Playoffs in the 2011 season, in which it lost to #17 James Madison 20-17 in the opening round. The Colonels have won 20 [[Ohio Valley Conference]] (OVC) titles and two FCS (formerly I-AA) National Championships, in 1979 and 1982. Much of Eastern Kentucky's success came during the long tenure of head coach [[Roy Kidd]], who led the team from 1964 through 2002. The program has continued its success under more recent coaches [[Danny Hope]] and [[Dean Hood]].\n\n===List of NAIA teams===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!School\n!Nickname\n!Conference\n|-\n|[[Alice Lloyd College]]\n|Eagles\n|[[River States Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Asbury University]]\n|Eagles\n|[[River States Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Brescia University]]\n|Bearcats\n|[[River States Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Campbellsville University]]\n|Tigers\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[University of the Cumberlands]]\n|Patriots\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Georgetown College]]\n|Tigers\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Lindsey Wilson College]]\n|Blue Raiders\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Midway University]]\n|Eagles\n|[[River States Conference]]\n|-\n|[[University of Pikeville]]\n|Bears/Lady Bears\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Thomas More University]]\n|Saints\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|-\n|[[Union College]]\n|Bulldogs\n|[[Mid-South Conference]]\n|}\n\n===NJCAA===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!School\n!Nickname\n!Division\n|-\n|[[Elizabethtown Community and Technical College]]\n|Barons\n|III\n|-\n|[[Simmons College of Kentucky]]\n|Panthers\n|I\n|-\n|}\n\n==Professional sports teams==\nProfessional football, baseball and basketball all at one time had teams in Kentucky. The [[National Football League]] and [[National League]] had early franchises in Louisville, and the [[Kentucky Colonels]] were a mainstay of the [[American Basketball Association]] that joined the [[National Basketball Association]] with the [[ABA-NBA merger]] in 1976; the Colonels were one of only two ABA teams that were kept out of the merger (the other was the [[Spirits of St. Louis]]).\n\nIn 2004, the [[American Basketball Association (2000-)|New ABA]] added a Louisville-based team called the [[Kentucky Colonels (ABA 2000)|Kentucky Colonels]], which was replaced by a team in [[Murray, Kentucky]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.thenews.org/media/storage/paper651/news/2007/01/19/Sports/American.Basketball.Association.Team.Looks.To.Bring.New.Energy.To.Murray-2653852.shtml |title=American Basketball Association team looks to bring new energy to Murray |work=The Murray State News |date=January 19, 2007 |accessdate=February 14, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315032900/http://media.www.thenews.org/media/storage/paper651/news/2007/01/19/Sports/American.Basketball.Association.Team.Looks.To.Bring.New.Energy.To.Murray-2653852.shtml |archivedate=March 15, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> That team was originally also named the [[Kentucky Colonels]], but the name was changed to the [[Kentucky Retros]] in March 2007 in deference to the tradition of the Louisville-based teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abalive.com/news/releases/?newsid=2007031406004 |title=Kentucky team announces name change |publisher=American Basketball Association |date=March 14, 2007 |accessdate=March 16, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155448/http://www.abalive.com/news/releases/?newsid=2007031406004 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> The team eventually announced that they would relocate to Louisville.<ref>[http://abalive.com/news/releases/?newsid=2007061806001 ABAlive.com \u2013 Home of the American Basketball Association]</ref> The team folded during the 2007-08 season.

In the independent minor leagues, the [[Florence Y'alls]] are a member of the [[Frontier League]]'s midwestern division, playing their home games at [[UC Health Stadium]].\n* In soccer, Louisville is home to one semi-professional team. [[Louisville City FC]] began play in the [[United Soccer League]] in 2015. They were the reserve team for [[Orlando City SC]] in that season, but the affiliation ended when Orlando City announced plans to field a team-operated reserve side, [[Orlando City B]], in the USL starting in 2016. Since then, they have won two [[USL Cup|USL Cups]] in 2017 and 2018, advanced to the Cup final in 2019, and were Regular Season runner-ups in 2015, 2016, and 2017.\n\n===Minor league baseball===\n{{location map+ |Kentucky |float=right |width=300|caption=Minor League Baseball in Kentucky|places=\n{{location map~ |Kentucky |lat=38.25 |long=-85.766667 |mark = Blue pog.svg |label=<div style=\"font-size:95%;\">[[Louisville Bats|Bats]]</div>|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Kentucky |lat=36.981667 |long=-86.444444 |mark = Blue pog.svg |label=<div style=\"font-size:95%;\">[[Bowling Green Hot Rods|Hot Rods]]</div>|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Kentucky |lat=38.029722 |long=-84.494722 |mark = Blue pog.svg |label=<div style=\"font-size:95%;\">[[Lexington Legends|Legends]]</div>|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Kentucky |lat=38.993333 |long=-84.6425 |mark = Blue pog.svg |label=<div style=\"font-size:95%;\">[[Florence Y'alls|Y'alls]]</div>|position=right}}\n}}\n*[[Louisville Bats]] (Triple-A [[International League]] affiliate of the [[Cincinnati Reds]])\n*[[Bowling Green Hot Rods]] (Single-A [[Midwest League]] affiliate of the [[Tampa Bay Rays]])\n*[[Lexington Legends]] (Single-A [[South Atlantic League]] affiliate of the [[Kansas City Royals]])\n*[[Florence Y'alls]] (Independent, [[Frontier League]])\n\n===Football===\nSemi-pro football\n\n* Kentucky Banditz<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idflnation.com/teams/mens-outdoor/|title=Mens Outdoor|website=idflnation.com|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> (Impact Developmental Football League, Men's Outdoor)\n* Kentucky Spartans<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/KYspartansfootball/|title=The Kentucky Spartans|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idflnation.com/teams/mens-outdoor/|title=Mens Outdoor|website=idflnation.com|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> (Impact Developmental Football League, Men's Outdoor)\n* Western Kentucky Thoroughbreds<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/westernkentuckythoroughbreds/|title=Western Kentucky Thoroughbreds Semi Pro Football|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idflnation.com/teams/mens-outdoor/|title=Mens Outdoor|website=idflnation.com|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> (Impact Developmental Football League, Men's Outdoor)\n* Kentuckiana Kurse<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Sports-Team/Kentuckiana-Kurse-Indoor-Football-Team-108004277336595/|title=Kentuckiana Kurse Indoor Football Team|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idflnation.com/teams/mens-indoor/|title=Mens Indoor|website=idflnation.com|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> (Impact Developmental Football League, Men's Indoor)\n\nWomen's football:\n*[[Derby City Dynamite|Derby-City Dynamite]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://derbycitydynamite.com/|title=Welcome to The Derby City|last=Dynamite|first=Derby City|website=Derby City Dynamite|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref> ([[Women's Football Alliance]])\n\n=== Basketball ===\n\n* [[Owensboro Thoroughbreds]] ([[The Basketball League]])\n\n===Soccer===\n* [[Louisville City FC]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.louisvillecityfc.com/|title=Louisville City FC|website=www.louisvillecityfc.com|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref> ([[USL Championship]])\n*[[Metro Louisville FC]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/LouisvilleNPSL/|title=Metro Louisville FC|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npsl.com/14005/|title=Metro Louisville FC Joins the NPSL for the 2020 Season|date=2020-03-17|website=National Premier Soccer League|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> (starting [[National Premier Soccer League]] play in 2020)\n*[[Lexington Landsharks]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexingtonlandsharks.com/|title=Home|last=jrue|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerinthebluegrass.com/2019/11/25/lexington-landsharks-new-competitive-adult-team/|title=Lexington Landsharks -
