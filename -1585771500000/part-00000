Tin is a silvery metal that characteristically has a faint yellow hue. Tin, like [[indium]], is soft enough to be cut without much force.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gray |first=Theodore |url=http://www.theodoregray.com/Periodictable/Ref/050/index.html |work=The Elements |title=Tin images |publisher=Black Dog & Leventhal |date=2007}}</ref> When a bar of tin is bent, the so-called \u201c[[tin cry]]\u201d can be heard as a result of sliding tin crystals reforming; this trait is shared by indium, [[cadmium]], and frozen [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Pure tin after solidifying keeps a mirror-like appearance similar to most metals. However, in most tin [[alloy]]s (such as [[pewter]]), the metal solidifies with a dull gray color. Tin is a [[post-transition metal]] in [[group 14]] of the [[periodic table of elements]]. It is obtained chiefly from the [[mineral]] [[cassiterite]], which contains [[tin dioxide|stannic oxide]], SnO<sub>2</sub>. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, [[germanium]] and [[lead]], and has two main [[oxidation state]]s, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element on Earth and has, with 10&nbsp;stable isotopes, the largest number of stable [[isotope]]s in the periodic table, thanks to its [[magic number (physics)|magic number]] of protons. It has two main [[allotrope]]s: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is \u03b2-tin, a silvery-white, [[malleable]] metal, but at low temperatures, it transforms into the less dense grey \u03b1-tin, which has the [[diamond cubic]] structure. Metallic tin does not easily [[oxidation|oxidize]] in air.\n\nThe first tin alloy used on a large scale was [[bronze]], made of {{frac|1|8}}&nbsp;tin and {{frac|7|8}}&nbsp;[[copper]], from as early as 3000&nbsp;BCE. After 600&nbsp;BCE, pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85\u201390% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of [[copper]], [[antimony]], and lead, was used for [[tableware|flatware]] from the [[Bronze Age]] until the 20th&nbsp;century. In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin / lead soft [[solder]]s, which are typically 60% or more tin, and in the manufacture of transparent, electrically conducting films of [[indium tin oxide]] in [[optoelectronic]] applications. Another large application for tin is [[corrosion]]-resistant [[tin plating]] of [[steel]]. Because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, tin-plated steel is widely used for food packaging as [[tin can]]s. However, some [[Organotin chemistry|organotin compounds]] can be almost as toxic as [[cyanide]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical===\n[[File:Tin-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Drop (liquid)|Droplet]] of solidified molten tin]]\nTin is a soft, [[malleable]], [[ductile]] and highly [[crystal]]line silvery-white [[metal]].

The earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and sporadic and led to the \"First International Tin Agreement\" in 1956, the first of a continuously numbered series that effectively collapsed in 1985. Through this series of agreements, the [[International Tin Council]] (ITC) had a considerable effect on tin prices. The ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling tin from the stockpile. This was an anti-free-market approach, designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a profit for producer countries. However, the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large, and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose, sometimes sharply, especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies.<ref name=price/>\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. Government tin stockpile was in an aggressive selling mode, partly to take advantage of the historically high tin prices. The sharp recession of 1981\u201382 proved to be quite harsh on the tin industry. Tin consumption declined dramatically. The ITC was able to avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer stockpile; this activity required the ITC to borrow extensively from banks and metal trading firms to augment its resources. The ITC continued to borrow until late 1985 when it reached its credit limit. Immediately, a major \"tin crisis\" followed \u2014 tin was delisted from trading on the London Metal Exchange for about three years, the ITC dissolved soon afterward, and the price of tin, now in a free-market environment, plummeted sharply to $4 per pound and remained at that level through the 1990s.<ref name=price>Carlin, James F., Jr. (1998).

The proportion of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, since tin has a desirable tonal resonance. When a tin/lead alloy cools, the lead phase solidifies first, then when the eutectic temperature is reached the remaining liquid forms the layered tin/lead eutectic structure, which is shiny and the contrast with the lead phase produces a mottled or spotted effect. This metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal. Major advantages of using tin for pipes include its appearance, its workability, and resistance to corrosion.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=cgDJaeFFUPoC&pg=PT426|isbn = 978-0-415-94174-7|page = [https://archive.org/details/organencyclopedi0000unse/page/411 411]|chapter = Pipe Metal|editor = Robert Palmieri|date = 2006|publisher = Garland|location = New York|title = Encyclopedia of keyboard instruments|url = https://archive.org/details/organencyclopedi0000unse/page/411}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=I0h525OVoTgC&pg=PA501|page=[https://archive.org/details/artoforganbuildi00auds/page/501 501]|title=The Art of Organ Building Audsley, George Ashdown|isbn=978-0-486-21315-6|chapter=Metal Pipes: And the Materials used in their Construction|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|date=1988|author=George Ashdown Audsley|url=https://archive.org/details/artoforganbuildi00auds/page/501}}</ref><!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=aU6giw-OdyUC&pg=PA32-->\n\n===Optoelectronics===\nThe [[Indium tin oxide|oxides of indium and tin]] are electrically conductive and transparent, and are used to make transparent electrically conducting films with applications in [[Optoelectronics]] devices such as [[liquid crystal displays]].<ref name=Kimetal>{{cite journal|author1=Kim, H. |author2=Gilmore, C. |author3=Pique, A. |author4=Horwitz, J. |author5=Mattoussi, H. |author6=Murata, H. |author7=Kafafi, Z. |author8=Chrisey, D. |year=1999 |title=Electrical, optical, and structural properties of indium tin oxide thin films for organic light-emitting devices|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=86|issue=11|pages=6451|doi=10.1063/1.371708|bibcode=1999JAP....86.6451K}}</ref>\n\n===Other applications===\n[[File:Punched tin barn lantern.jpeg|thumb|upright|A 21st-century reproduction barn lantern made of punched tin.<!--Barn lanterns were placed over candles and oil lamps to reduce fire hazard when inside barns, and were in use up until the mid-20th century by some farmers.-->]]\nPunched tin-plated steel, also called pierced tin, is an artisan technique originating in central Europe for creating housewares that are both functional and decorative.

It has two main [[allotrope]]s: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is \u03b2-tin, a silvery-white, [[malleable]] metal, but at low temperatures, it transforms into the less dense grey \u03b1-tin, which has the [[diamond cubic]] structure. Metallic tin does not easily [[oxidation|oxidize]] in air.\n\nThe first tin alloy used on a large scale was [[bronze]], made of {{frac|1|8}}&nbsp;tin and {{frac|7|8}}&nbsp;[[copper]], from as early as 3000&nbsp;BCE. After 600&nbsp;BCE, pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85\u201390% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of [[copper]], [[antimony]], and lead, was used for [[tableware|flatware]] from the [[Bronze Age]] until the 20th&nbsp;century. In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin / lead soft [[solder]]s, which are typically 60% or more tin, and in the manufacture of transparent, electrically conducting films of [[indium tin oxide]] in [[optoelectronic]] applications. Another large application for tin is [[corrosion]]-resistant [[tin plating]] of [[steel]]. Because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, tin-plated steel is widely used for food packaging as [[tin can]]s. However, some [[Organotin chemistry|organotin compounds]] can be almost as toxic as [[cyanide]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical===\n[[File:Tin-2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Drop (liquid)|Droplet]] of solidified molten tin]]\nTin is a soft, [[malleable]], [[ductile]] and highly [[crystal]]line silvery-white [[metal]].

The earlier agreements tended to be somewhat informal and sporadic and led to the \"First International Tin Agreement\" in 1956, the first of a continuously numbered series that effectively collapsed in 1985. Through this series of agreements, the [[International Tin Council]] (ITC) had a considerable effect on tin prices. The ITC supported the price of tin during periods of low prices by buying tin for its buffer stockpile and was able to restrain the price during periods of high prices by selling tin from the stockpile. This was an anti-free-market approach, designed to assure a sufficient flow of tin to consumer countries and a profit for producer countries. However, the buffer stockpile was not sufficiently large, and during most of those 29 years tin prices rose, sometimes sharply, especially from 1973 through 1980 when rampant inflation plagued many world economies.<ref name=price/>\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the U.S. Government tin stockpile was in an aggressive selling mode, partly to take advantage of the historically high tin prices. The sharp recession of 1981\u201382 proved to be quite harsh on the tin industry. Tin consumption declined dramatically. The ITC was able to avoid truly steep declines through accelerated buying for its buffer stockpile; this activity required the ITC to borrow extensively from banks and metal trading firms to augment its resources. The ITC continued to borrow until late 1985 when it reached its credit limit. Immediately, a major \"tin crisis\" followed \u2014 tin was delisted from trading on the London Metal Exchange for about three years, the ITC dissolved soon afterward, and the price of tin, now in a free-market environment, plummeted sharply to $4 per pound and remained at that level through the 1990s.<ref name=price>Carlin, James F., Jr. (1998).

The proportion of tin in the pipe defines the pipe's tone, since tin has a desirable tonal resonance. When a tin/lead alloy cools, the lead phase solidifies first, then when the eutectic temperature is reached the remaining liquid forms the layered tin/lead eutectic structure, which is shiny and the contrast with the lead phase produces a mottled or spotted effect. This metal alloy is referred to as spotted metal. Major advantages of using tin for pipes include its appearance, its workability, and resistance to corrosion.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=cgDJaeFFUPoC&pg=PT426|isbn = 978-0-415-94174-7|page = [https://archive.org/details/organencyclopedi0000unse/page/411 411]|chapter = Pipe Metal|editor = Robert Palmieri|date = 2006|publisher = Garland|location = New York|title = Encyclopedia of keyboard instruments|url = https://archive.org/details/organencyclopedi0000unse/page/411}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=I0h525OVoTgC&pg=PA501|page=[https://archive.org/details/artoforganbuildi00auds/page/501 501]|title=The Art of Organ Building Audsley, George Ashdown|isbn=978-0-486-21315-6|chapter=Metal Pipes: And the Materials used in their Construction|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|date=1988|author=George Ashdown Audsley|url=https://archive.org/details/artoforganbuildi00auds/page/501}}</ref><!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=aU6giw-OdyUC&pg=PA32-->\n\n===Optoelectronics===\nThe [[Indium tin oxide|oxides of indium and tin]] are electrically conductive and transparent, and are used to make transparent electrically conducting films with applications in [[Optoelectronics]] devices such as [[liquid crystal displays]].<ref name=Kimetal>{{cite journal|author1=Kim, H. |author2=Gilmore, C. |author3=Pique, A. |author4=Horwitz, J. |author5=Mattoussi, H. |author6=Murata, H. |author7=Kafafi, Z. |author8=Chrisey, D. |year=1999 |title=Electrical, optical, and structural properties of indium tin oxide thin films for organic light-emitting devices|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|volume=86|issue=11|pages=6451|doi=10.1063/1.371708|bibcode=1999JAP....86.6451K}}</ref>\n\n===Other applications===\n[[File:Punched tin barn lantern.jpeg|thumb|upright|A 21st-century reproduction barn lantern made of punched tin.<!--Barn lanterns were placed over candles and oil lamps to reduce fire hazard when inside barns, and were in use up until the mid-20th century by some farmers.-->]]\nPunched tin-plated steel, also called pierced tin, is an artisan technique originating in central Europe for creating housewares that are both functional and decorative. Decorative piercing designs exist in a wide variety, based on local tradition and the artisan's personal creations. Punched tin lanterns are the most common application of this artisan technique. The light of a candle shining through the pierced design creates a decorative light pattern in the room where it sits.

''The Washington Post'' reported in a front-page story on Sunday, February 4, the following:\n\n<blockquote>Thanks to the FBI's undercover \"sting\" operation, there now exists incontrovertible evidence that one senator would not be bought. Preserved among the videotape footage that may be used as bribery evidence against a number of members of Congress, there is a special moment in which Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD) tells the undercover agents, in effect, to take their sting and stick it. Pressler, according to law enforcement sources was the one approached member of Congress who flatly refused to consider financial favors in exchange for legislative favors, as suggested by undercover agents posing as Arabs. At the time he said he was not aware that he was doing anything quite so heroic.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/130384902.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Feb+4%2C+1980&author=By+Martin+Schram+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&pub=The+Washington+Post++(1974-Current+file)&edition=&startpage=A1&desc=Sen.+Pressler%3A+He+Spurned+the+%27Arabs%27 |title=Sen.

Preserved among the videotape footage that may be used as bribery evidence against a number of members of Congress, there is a special moment in which Sen. Larry Pressler (R-SD) tells the undercover agents, in effect, to take their sting and stick it. Pressler, according to law enforcement sources was the one approached member of Congress who flatly refused to consider financial favors in exchange for legislative favors, as suggested by undercover agents posing as Arabs. At the time he said he was not aware that he was doing anything quite so heroic.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/130384902.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Feb+4%2C+1980&author=By+Martin+Schram+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&pub=The+Washington+Post++(1974-Current+file)&edition=&startpage=A1&desc=Sen.+Pressler%3A+He+Spurned+the+%27Arabs%27 |title=Sen.

Considered an outstanding preacher as well as a strong polemical writer defending [[Anglicanism]], Stillingfleet was known as \"the beauty of holiness\" for his good looks in the pulpit,<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Sermon|volume=24|page=674}}</ref> and was called by [[John Hough (bishop)|John Hough]] \"the ablest man of his time\".<ref>[[David C. Douglas]], ''English Scholars'' (1939), p. 254.</ref>\n\n==Life==\nHe was born in [[Cranborne]], [[Dorset]]. He went at the age of thirteen to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. in 1652.<ref>{{acad|id=STLT648E|name=Stillingfleet, Edward}}</ref> He became vicar of [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]] in 1657.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911b, p. 921\">{{cite EB1911 |date=1911b|wstitle=Stillingfleet, Edward |volume=25 |page=921}}</ref>\n\nIn 1665, after he had made his name as a writer, he became vicar at [[St Andrew, Holborn]].  He preached at [[St Margaret, Westminster]] on 10 October 1666, the 'day of humiliation and fasting' after the [[Great Fire of London]], with such an attendance that there was standing room only. [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded that he could not get in to hear the sermon, eating a meal of herrings in a pub instead.<ref>Adrian Tinniswood, ''By Permission of Heaven: The Story of the Great Fire of London'' (2003), p. 181.</ref>\n\nHe then held many [[preferment]]s, including a [[chaplain|Royal Chaplaincy]], and the [[Dean of St Paul's|Deanery of St Paul's]] (1678), the latter involving him in work connected with the building of the new [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. He became [[Bishop of Worcester]] in 1689. He was a frequent speaker in the [[House of Lords]], and had considerable influence as a churchman.\n\nHe supported [[Richard Bentley]], who lived in his household as a tutor for a number of years, from shortly after his graduation in 1693. Bentley would later be his chaplain and biographer, and describe him as \"one of the most universal scholars that ever lived\".<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bentley, Richard (scholar) |display=Bentley, Richard |volume=3 |page=750}}</ref><ref>http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45118 british-history.ac.uk</ref>\n\nIn 1691, at his request, [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] wrote to the magistrates of [[Middlesex]], asking for stronger enforcement of the laws against [[vice]]. This was an early move in the campaign of the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]].<ref>Deborah Payne Fisk, ''The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre'' (20000, p. 212.</ref>\n\nAt his death Stillingfleet left a library of some 10,000 printed books, which were purchased by [[Narcissus Marsh]] and today are part of [[Marsh's Library]] in Dublin, Ireland. His manuscript collection was purchased by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (1661\u20131724), and passed with the Harleian Manuscripts to the British Museum in 1753 as one of the foundation collections.\n\n==Patronage, politics and views==\nStillingfleet had to wait many years for a bishopric, a fact linked to his disfavour at Court in the 1680s. He never, though, lacked for well-connected patrons. The first was [[Sir Roger Burgoyne, 2nd Baronet]], a barrister and MP in the [[Long Parliament]], in whose gift was [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]], his living; followed by Francis Pierrepont, a Parliamentarian colonel and younger brother of [[Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester]] (a Royalist) and [[William Pierrepont (politician)|William Pierrepont]] (like Francis a Parliamentarian). These both offered him tutoring positions. He was also supported by [[Sir Harbottle Grimston, 2nd Baronet|Harbottle Grimstone]], who as [[Master of the Rolls]] gave him a preaching position in the [[Rolls Chapel]].<ref>John Trevor Cliffe, ''The Puritan Gentry Besieged, 1650-1700'' (1993), p. 40.</ref>\n\nThe transition at the Restoration was certainly problematic. [[Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]] presented Stillingfleet to St Andrew, Holborn. [[Humphrey Henchman]], [[Bishop of London]], employed him to write a vindication of [[William Laud]]'s answer to [[John Percy]] (''alias'' Fisher).<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911b, p. 921\"/> According to Jon Parkin,\n\n{{cquote|The apparent ease with which younger writers like Stillingfleet squared their allegiance to the restored regime, coupled with their espousal of a naturalistic, [[erastian]] and apparently [[Hobbesian]] [[ecclesiology]], earned them the description of 'men of latitude'.}}\n\nStillingfleet was a leader within the Church of England of the \"[[latitudinarian]]s\", the group of Anglicans thus defined pejoratively. Latitudinarism as doctrine was considered to have grown from the teaching of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], but in practical terms conditions at the Restoration did not favour it. Quite a number of its Cambridge adherents left an unpromising career in religion for the law, or had to rely for patronage on those who had done so.<ref>Parkin, p. 27.</ref>\n\nStillingfleet was most closely associated, in his attitudes, with such as [[Isaac Barrow (bishop)|Isaac Barrow]], [[Robert South]] and [[John Tillotson]]. They agreed, for example, on a literal interpretation to Biblical [[exegesis]], discarding [[allegorical]] readings.<ref>B. W. Young, ''Religion and Enlightenment in Eighteenth-Century England: Theological Debate from Locke to Burke'' (1998), p. 190.</ref> With Tillotson he favoured the so-called Erastian view, that the ruler had great powers over the Church, from the days of 1660; after the [[Glorious Revolution]] they became [[Low Church]] moderates.<ref>Tony Claydon, ''Europe and the Making of England, 1660-1760'' (2007), p. 330.</ref> With [[Gilbert Burnet]], [[Benjamin Hoadly]], [[Simon Patrick]], [[William Powell (clergyman)|William Powell]] and [[William Whiston]], he held some [[High Church]] views also.<ref>William Gibson, ''Altitudinarian Equivocation: George Smalridge's Churchmanship'', p. 57 in William Gibson, Robert G. Ingram (editors), ''Religious Identities in Britain, 1660-1832'' (2005).</ref>\n\nWith [[Thomas Tenison]], Stillingfleet and Tillotson preached on behalf of reason and [[natural religion]]. They are described as influential [[Arminianism|Arminian]] [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].{{sfn|Coffey|2006|p=227|ps=. Besides Sancroft, there were other young men at Cambridge in the early 1650s who were to become influential Arminian Anglicans: Isaac Barrow [...], John Tillotson [...], Simon Patrick [...], Edward Stillingfleet [...], Richard Kidder [...], Thomas Tenison. [...] The most important influences on them were clearly the Cambridge Platonists, and the Anglican Arminian, Henry Hammond. But ''Redemption Redeemed'' may have helped to confirm their rejection of Calvinism.}} They adopted an [[Arminian]] scheme of justification in opposition to the  [[Calvinist]]'s one, took the stock of core beliefs to be a small set of fundamentals.{{sfn|Griffin|1992|loc=Introduction|p=7}} In Stillingfleet's case, it supported reconciliation with [[Presbyterians]].\n\n{{cquote|...stood for an attitude and a temper rather than for any particular creed.  Though they did not abandon the objective side of religion, their emphasis was primarily on a proper moral outlook of life.

Considered an outstanding preacher as well as a strong polemical writer defending [[Anglicanism]], Stillingfleet was known as \"the beauty of holiness\" for his good looks in the pulpit,<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Sermon|volume=24|page=674}}</ref> and was called by [[John Hough (bishop)|John Hough]] \"the ablest man of his time\".<ref>[[David C. Douglas]], ''English Scholars'' (1939), p. 254.</ref>\n\n==Life==\nHe was born in [[Cranborne]], [[Dorset]]. He went at the age of thirteen to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he graduated B.A. in 1652.<ref>{{acad|id=STLT648E|name=Stillingfleet, Edward}}</ref> He became vicar of [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]] in 1657.<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911b, p. 921\">{{cite EB1911 |date=1911b|wstitle=Stillingfleet, Edward |volume=25 |page=921}}</ref>\n\nIn 1665, after he had made his name as a writer, he became vicar at [[St Andrew, Holborn]].  He preached at [[St Margaret, Westminster]] on 10 October 1666, the 'day of humiliation and fasting' after the [[Great Fire of London]], with such an attendance that there was standing room only. [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded that he could not get in to hear the sermon, eating a meal of herrings in a pub instead.<ref>Adrian Tinniswood, ''By Permission of Heaven: The Story of the Great Fire of London'' (2003), p. 181.</ref>\n\nHe then held many [[preferment]]s, including a [[chaplain|Royal Chaplaincy]], and the [[Dean of St Paul's|Deanery of St Paul's]] (1678), the latter involving him in work connected with the building of the new [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. He became [[Bishop of Worcester]] in 1689. He was a frequent speaker in the [[House of Lords]], and had considerable influence as a churchman.\n\nHe supported [[Richard Bentley]], who lived in his household as a tutor for a number of years, from shortly after his graduation in 1693. Bentley would later be his chaplain and biographer, and describe him as \"one of the most universal scholars that ever lived\".<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Bentley, Richard (scholar) |display=Bentley, Richard |volume=3 |page=750}}</ref><ref>http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45118 british-history.ac.uk</ref>\n\nIn 1691, at his request, [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] wrote to the magistrates of [[Middlesex]], asking for stronger enforcement of the laws against [[vice]]. This was an early move in the campaign of the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]].<ref>Deborah Payne Fisk, ''The Cambridge Companion to English Restoration Theatre'' (20000, p. 212.</ref>\n\nAt his death Stillingfleet left a library of some 10,000 printed books, which were purchased by [[Narcissus Marsh]] and today are part of [[Marsh's Library]] in Dublin, Ireland. His manuscript collection was purchased by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]] (1661\u20131724), and passed with the Harleian Manuscripts to the British Museum in 1753 as one of the foundation collections.\n\n==Patronage, politics and views==\nStillingfleet had to wait many years for a bishopric, a fact linked to his disfavour at Court in the 1680s. He never, though, lacked for well-connected patrons. The first was [[Sir Roger Burgoyne, 2nd Baronet]], a barrister and MP in the [[Long Parliament]], in whose gift was [[Sutton, Bedfordshire]], his living; followed by Francis Pierrepont, a Parliamentarian colonel and younger brother of [[Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester]] (a Royalist) and [[William Pierrepont (politician)|William Pierrepont]] (like Francis a Parliamentarian). These both offered him tutoring positions. He was also supported by [[Sir Harbottle Grimston, 2nd Baronet|Harbottle Grimstone]], who as [[Master of the Rolls]] gave him a preaching position in the [[Rolls Chapel]].<ref>John Trevor Cliffe, ''The Puritan Gentry Besieged, 1650-1700'' (1993), p. 40.</ref>\n\nThe transition at the Restoration was certainly problematic. [[Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton|Earl of Southampton]] presented Stillingfleet to St Andrew, Holborn. [[Humphrey Henchman]], [[Bishop of London]], employed him to write a vindication of [[William Laud]]'s answer to [[John Percy]] (''alias'' Fisher).<ref name=\"Chisholm 1911b, p. 921\"/> According to Jon Parkin,\n\n{{cquote|The apparent ease with which younger writers like Stillingfleet squared their allegiance to the restored regime, coupled with their espousal of a naturalistic, [[erastian]] and apparently [[Hobbesian]] [[ecclesiology]], earned them the description of 'men of latitude'.}}\n\nStillingfleet was a leader within the Church of England of the \"[[latitudinarian]]s\", the group of Anglicans thus defined pejoratively. Latitudinarism as doctrine was considered to have grown from the teaching of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], but in practical terms conditions at the Restoration did not favour it. Quite a number of its Cambridge adherents left an unpromising career in religion for the law, or had to rely for patronage on those who had done so.<ref>Parkin, p. 27.</ref>\n\nStillingfleet was most closely associated, in his attitudes, with such as [[Isaac Barrow (bishop)|Isaac Barrow]], [[Robert South]] and [[John Tillotson]]. They agreed, for example, on a literal interpretation to Biblical [[exegesis]], discarding [[allegorical]] readings.<ref>B. W. Young, ''Religion and Enlightenment in Eighteenth-Century England: Theological Debate from Locke to Burke'' (1998), p. 190.</ref> With Tillotson he favoured the so-called Erastian view, that the ruler had great powers over the Church, from the days of 1660; after the [[Glorious Revolution]] they became [[Low Church]] moderates.<ref>Tony Claydon, ''Europe and the Making of England, 1660-1760'' (2007), p. 330.</ref> With [[Gilbert Burnet]], [[Benjamin Hoadly]], [[Simon Patrick]], [[William Powell (clergyman)|William Powell]] and [[William Whiston]], he held some [[High Church]] views also.<ref>William Gibson, ''Altitudinarian Equivocation: George Smalridge's Churchmanship'', p. 57 in William Gibson, Robert G. Ingram (editors), ''Religious Identities in Britain, 1660-1832'' (2005).</ref>\n\nWith [[Thomas Tenison]], Stillingfleet and Tillotson preached on behalf of reason and [[natural religion]]. They are described as influential [[Arminianism|Arminian]] [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].{{sfn|Coffey|2006|p=227|ps=.

After moving to the [[New York City]] area in the late 1950s, the group had their first successes during these early years, first coming to prominence in 1959 with their fourth single, \"[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]\", written by the three brothers. Initially a modest charted single, the song eventually [[List of music recording certifications|sold over a million copies]]. In the 1960s, the group recorded songs for a variety of [[record labels|labels]], including the top 20 single \"[[Twist and Shout]]\" and the Motown single \"[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]\", before recording and issuing the [[1970 Grammy Awards|Grammy Award-winning]] hit \"[[It's Your Thing]]\" on their own label, [[T-Neck Records]].\n\nInfluenced by gospel and doo-wop music, the group began experimenting with different musical styles incorporating elements of rock and funk as well as pop balladry. The inclusion of younger brothers [[Ernie Isley]] (lead guitar, drums) and [[Marvin Isley]] (bass guitar), and Rudolph's brother-in-law [[Chris Jasper]] (keyboards, synthesizers), in 1973 turned the original vocal trio into a complete band and reached the height of their success. For the next full decade, they recorded a string of top-selling albums including ''[[The Heat Is On (album)|The Heat Is On]]'' and ''[[Between the Sheets (The Isley Brothers album)|Between the Sheets]]''.\n\nThe six-member band splintered in 1983, with Ernie, Marvin, and Chris Jasper forming the short-lived spinoff group [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]]. The oldest member, O'Kelly, died in 1986 and Rudolph and Ronald released a pair of albums as a duo before Rudolph retired to a life in the Christian ministry in 1989. Ronald reconvened the group two years later in 1991 with Ernie and Marvin; five years later, in 1996, Marvin Isley left the group due to complications of diabetes. The remaining duo of Ronald and Ernie achieved mainstream success with the albums ''[[Mission to Please]]'' (1996), ''[[Eternal (The Isley Brothers album)|Eternal]]'' (2001) and ''[[Body Kiss]]'' (2003). ''Eternal'' spawned the top twenty hit \"[[Contagious (song)|Contagious]]\". {{As of|2019}}, the Isley Brothers continue to perform under the lineup of Ronald and Ernie.\n\nThe Isley Brothers have over 17.5 million units in the United States alone.[https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Isley+brothers#search_section] They have had several hit songs including four Top 10 singles on the United States ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]'' chart.

Their father, O'Kelly Isley, Sr., a former [[United States Navy]] [[sailor]] and [[vaudeville]] performer from [[Durham, North Carolina]], and their mother Sallye, from Georgia, guided the elder four Isley boys in their singing in church. The brothers began performing together in 1954, patterning themselves after groups such as [[Billy Ward and His Dominoes]] and [[The Dixie Hummingbirds]].{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193}} Eventually they landed a spot on [[Ted Mack (radio-TV host)|Ted Mack]]'s ''Amateur Hour'', where they won the competition (their prize was a watch).{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193}} With Vernon singing lead vocals, the quartet soon began touring all over the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern US]], performing in a variety of churches. When Vernon was thirteen, he was killed by a car which struck him as he was riding his bike in his neighborhood. Devastated, the remaining trio disbanded.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193}}\n\nEventually persuaded to regroup, with Ronnie assuming the lead vocal position, the brothers decided to record popular music and left Cincinnati for New York in 1957 with their parents' blessings.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193\u2013194}} The group got in touch with Richard Barrett, who soon had them in contact with a variety of New York record producers.

By 1959, the group landed a recording deal with [[RCA Records]]. Later that year, the group recorded their first composition together, \"[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]\", mixing their brand of gospel vocals and doo-wop harmonies, a song derived from a [[Washington, D.C.]], club performance in which the brothers had covered [[Jackie Wilson]]'s \"[[Lonely Teardrops]]\".{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=194}} The original version of the song peaked at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and never reached the R&B chart.

Early the following year, the group released their second Top 40 hit single, \"[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]\". While the Isley Brothers' recordings with Motown were more successful than their earlier works, they struggled to score a follow-up Top 40 hit with the label. They left Motown in 1968.\n\n===Major success===\nResurrecting their T-Neck label that year, the brothers signed a distribution deal with [[Buddah Records]] and issued \"[[It's Your Thing]]\" in February 1969. The song, which featured the first appearance of Ernie Isley on bass, became their biggest success to date, reaching number 2 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on the R&B chart. The song's parent album, ''[[It's Our Thing]]'', reached number 22 on the [[Billboard 200|Pop LP]] chart, and \"It's Your Thing\" became the group's second million-seller and won them a Grammy Award. The release of \"It's Your Thing\" brought record label conflicts between the Isleys and Motown, as Motown argued that the group had recorded the song while still under their Motown contract. A 1975 court decision eventually found in the Isleys' favor.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=199}}\n\nBy 1971, the younger Isley brothers Ernie and Marvin and their brother-in-law Chris Jasper started to add to the band's music, first performing on the Isleys' ''[[Givin' It Back]]''. The album featured reinterpretations of rock songs mixing them with funk and gospel elements. The new members played an even bigger role in the 1972 album, ''[[Brother, Brother, Brother]]''. Both albums yielded Top 40 hits, including \"[[Love the One You're With]]\" and \"[[Pop That Thang]]\". By the end of their Buddah tenure in 1973, the brothers had signed a distribution deal with [[Epic Records]] and made Ernie, Marvin, and Chris official members. In 1973, the Isleys released ''[[3 + 3]]'', which included the Top 10 hit single \"[[That Lady (song)|That Lady]]\" and a UK Top 10 cover of \"[[Summer Breeze (song)|Summer Breeze]]\". Incorporating hard rock and folk rock as well as funk and soulful balladry, the album became their breakthrough hit, eventually selling over two million copies.\n\nThe following year, the album ''[[Live It Up (The Isley Brothers album)|Live It Up]]'' reached gold. In 1975, the brothers made one of their most successful recordings, ''[[The Heat Is On (album)|The Heat Is On]]'', which featured the hits \"[[Fight the Power (Part 1 & 2)|Fight the Power]]\" and \"[[For the Love of You]]\", and became their first album to reach number 1 on the Pop LP chart, going double-platinum at two million copies sold. The brothers would have more hit albums, including ''[[Harvest for the World]]'' (1976), ''[[Go for Your Guns]]'' (1977), and ''[[Showdown (The Isley Brothers album)|Showdown]]'' (1978), all of which went gold or platinum, and yielded several Top 40 pop and R&B singles and popular radio cuts. By 1979, with the release of ''[[Winner Takes All (album)|Winner Takes All]]'', the brothers had incorporated disco and [[quiet storm]] music into their work. The Isley Brothers' final album under their six-member lineup, ''[[Between the Sheets (The Isley Brothers album)|Between the Sheets]]'' (1983), sold more than two million copies. By then, financial struggles, creative difficulties, and other issues affected the group. Shortly after the success of ''Between the Sheets'', Ernie, Marvin, and Chris left the Isley Brothers and formed [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]]. They later recorded the hit \"[[Caravan of Love]]\".\n\n===Later years===\n{{sources|section|date=March 2020}}\nIn 1985, the original Isleys trio of O'Kelly, Rudy, and Ronnie signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and recorded and released the album ''[[Masterpiece (The Isley Brothers album)|Masterpiece]]''.

Shortly after the latter release, Rudy retired from the music industry and followed life in the [[Christian ministry|ministry]]. Ron put the group on a brief hiatus in 1990 while he recorded solo material. In 1991, Ron revived the group; Ernie Isley and brother Marvin returned to the fold. that year they released the album, ''[[Tracks of Life]]''. Five years later, Ron Isley gained popularity as video villain Frank Biggs (or Mr. Biggs) in the music video for [[R. Kelly]]'s hit \"[[Down Low (Nobody Has to Know)]]\", which included the Isley Brothers as featured artists. The success of the song and its video helped the brothers' 1996 album ''[[Mission to Please]]'' reach platinum status.\n\nThat same year, Marvin Isley's career ended after a bout with diabetes forced him to have both of his legs amputated. Ron and Ernie have carried on as a duo from then on. In 2001, the duo released their best-selling album in years with the ''[[Eternal (The Isley Brothers album)|Eternal]]'' album, which sold over two million copies and featured the top 20 hit single \"[[Contagious (song)|Contagious]]\", making the Isley Brothers the only act to reach the Hot 100 (in fact, that chart's top 50) during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.  Two years later, the brothers' ''[[Body Kiss]]'' album peaked at number-one on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart, becoming their second to reach the position and the first to do so since ''The Heat Is On''. Their next two released albums included 2006's ''[[Baby Makin' Music]]'' and the 2007 holiday album ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''. In 2007, the Isleys' career was interrupted by Ron Isley's three-year prison sentence for tax evasion.<ref name=3years>{{cite web |url=http://www.today.com/id/14681264/ns/today-entertainment/t/singer-ronald-isley-gets-years-prison/#.UVRKkTfKSSo |title=Singer Ronald Isley gets 3 years in prison |website=Today.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref> He was released in 2010.

That same year, R&B singer [[Aaliyah]] did a cover version of \"[[(At Your Best) You Are Love]]\" for her debut album.\n\nAfter the break-up of [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]] in 1987, Chris Jasper continued as a solo artist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer, forming his own independent record label, Gold City Records. He has since released 14 solo albums, including 4 gospel albums. He released the #1 R&B hit \"Superbad\" in 1988, a song which emphasized the importance of education, a theme Jasper continues to emphasize in many of the songs he has written since his days with the Isleys. In January 2013, Jasper released ''Inspired: By Love, By Life, By the Spirit'', a compilation of love songs as well as socially conscious and spiritual tracks. In May 2014, Jasper released ''The One'', reminiscent of the soulful R&B and funk music he wrote for the Isleys. In 2016, Jasper released ''Share With Me'', which included a cover of the Billy Preston hit, \"You Are So Beautiful\" and a track called \"America\", a tribute to the nation and a call to come together. In April 2018, Jasper pre-released a double-A single \"The Love That You Give/It's a Miracle\" from his 15th solo album ''Dance With You'', scheduled for a July 2018 release. \n\nJasper, who earned a law degree in 2004, has continued to write, record, and perform all the music on his solo albums and produce artists for his Gold City label, including Liz Hogue, Out Front, and Brothaz By Choice. The most recent addition to the Gold City label is Jasper's son, Michael Jasper, a songwriter, recording artist and screenplay writer, who earned his law degree in 2018. In 1989, Chris Jasper wrote, produced and performed on \"Make It Last\" for [[Chaka Khan]]'s ''[[CK (album)|CK]]'' album. In 2015, in conjunction with Sony Music, Jasper released the ''Essential Chris Jasper'' which encompasses all of the tracks that Jasper sang lead on during his Isley-Jasper-Isley years and solo career at CBS/Sony Music.

After moving to the [[New York City]] area in the late 1950s, the group had their first successes during these early years, first coming to prominence in 1959 with their fourth single, \"[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]\", written by the three brothers. Initially a modest charted single, the song eventually [[List of music recording certifications|sold over a million copies]]. In the 1960s, the group recorded songs for a variety of [[record labels|labels]], including the top 20 single \"[[Twist and Shout]]\" and the Motown single \"[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]\", before recording and issuing the [[1970 Grammy Awards|Grammy Award-winning]] hit \"[[It's Your Thing]]\" on their own label, [[T-Neck Records]].\n\nInfluenced by gospel and doo-wop music, the group began experimenting with different musical styles incorporating elements of rock and funk as well as pop balladry. The inclusion of younger brothers [[Ernie Isley]] (lead guitar, drums) and [[Marvin Isley]] (bass guitar), and Rudolph's brother-in-law [[Chris Jasper]] (keyboards, synthesizers), in 1973 turned the original vocal trio into a complete band and reached the height of their success. For the next full decade, they recorded a string of top-selling albums including ''[[The Heat Is On (album)|The Heat Is On]]'' and ''[[Between the Sheets (The Isley Brothers album)|Between the Sheets]]''.\n\nThe six-member band splintered in 1983, with Ernie, Marvin, and Chris Jasper forming the short-lived spinoff group [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]]. The oldest member, O'Kelly, died in 1986 and Rudolph and Ronald released a pair of albums as a duo before Rudolph retired to a life in the Christian ministry in 1989. Ronald reconvened the group two years later in 1991 with Ernie and Marvin; five years later, in 1996, Marvin Isley left the group due to complications of diabetes. The remaining duo of Ronald and Ernie achieved mainstream success with the albums ''[[Mission to Please]]'' (1996), ''[[Eternal (The Isley Brothers album)|Eternal]]'' (2001) and ''[[Body Kiss]]'' (2003). ''Eternal'' spawned the top twenty hit \"[[Contagious (song)|Contagious]]\". {{As of|2019}}, the Isley Brothers continue to perform under the lineup of Ronald and Ernie.\n\nThe Isley Brothers have over 17.5 million units in the United States alone.https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Isley+brothers#search_section They have had several hit songs including four Top 10 singles on the United States ''[[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard]]'' chart. With their first major hit charting in 1959 (\"Shout\"), and their last one in 1996 (\"Down Low\"), they are among the few groups ever to have hit the Billboard Hot 100 with new music in five different decades. Sixteen of their albums charted in the Top 40 and thirteen of those albums have been [[RIAA certification|certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the RIAA]]. The brothers have been honored by several musical institutions, including [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees|the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], which inducted them in 1992.<ref name=\"rockhall\">{{cite web|title=The Isley Brothers|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-isley-brothers/|year=1992|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> Five years later, they were added to [[Hollywood's Rockwalk]], and in 2003 they were inducted to the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://vocalgroup.org/inductees/the-isley-brothers/|title=The Isley Brothers|last=|first=|date=|website=The Vocal Group Hall of Fame|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> They received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2014.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/isley-brothers|title=Isley Brothers|last=|first=|date=|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Origins and initial recordings===\nThe Isley Brothers originally came from Cincinnati, Ohio, and were raised in the city's [[Lincoln Heights, Ohio|Lincoln Heights]] suburb, eventually settling in the satellite town of [[Blue Ash, Ohio|Blue Ash]] when they were teenagers. Their father, O'Kelly Isley, Sr., a former [[United States Navy]] [[sailor]] and [[vaudeville]] performer from [[Durham, North Carolina]], and their mother Sallye, from Georgia, guided the elder four Isley boys in their singing in church. The brothers began performing together in 1954, patterning themselves after groups such as [[Billy Ward and His Dominoes]] and [[The Dixie Hummingbirds]].{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193}} Eventually they landed a spot on [[Ted Mack (radio-TV host)|Ted Mack]]'s ''Amateur Hour'', where they won the competition (their prize was a watch).{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193}} With Vernon singing lead vocals, the quartet soon began touring all over the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern US]], performing in a variety of churches. When Vernon was thirteen, he was killed by a car which struck him as he was riding his bike in his neighborhood. Devastated, the remaining trio disbanded.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193}}\n\nEventually persuaded to regroup, with Ronnie assuming the lead vocal position, the brothers decided to record popular music and left Cincinnati for New York in 1957 with their parents' blessings.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=193\u2013194}} The group got in touch with Richard Barrett, who soon had them in contact with a variety of New York record producers. They eventually had their first recorded songs produced by [[George Goldner]], including \"Angels Cried\" and \"The Cow Jumped Over the Moon\" for the Teenage, Cindy, and Mark X imprints.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=194}} The songs were only regional hits, however. By 1959, the group landed a recording deal with [[RCA Records]]. Later that year, the group recorded their first composition together, \"[[Shout (The Isley Brothers song)|Shout]]\", mixing their brand of gospel vocals and doo-wop harmonies, a song derived from a [[Washington, D.C.]], club performance in which the brothers had covered [[Jackie Wilson]]'s \"[[Lonely Teardrops]]\".{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=194}} The original version of the song peaked at number 47 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and never reached the R&B chart. Nevertheless, it sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/115 115]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/115\n}}</ref> Follow-up recordings on RCA failed to chart and the brothers left the label in 1961, and later signed with [[Scepter Records]]. In 1962, the Isley Brothers scored their first top 40 hit with the [[Bert Berns]] song \"[[Twist and Shout]]\", which reached number 17 on the Hot 100 and number 2 on the R&B chart, staying on the charts for 19 weeks.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=195}} The song had been produced by Berns for the brothers to teach then-struggling producer [[Phil Spector]] how to produce a hit.<ref>[http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atlanticstory.html David Edwards and Mike Callahan, ''The Atlantic Records Story''], February 1990, Bsnpubs.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bertberns.com/bio.html|title=Bert Berns: Songwriter, Producer and Label Chief|website=Bertberns.com}}</ref>\n\nMoving their entire operations to [[New Jersey]],<ref name=Isley>Wilner, Paul.

Accessed September 18, 2011. \"WHEN Sallye Isley moved her brood of children from Cincinnati to Englewood in the summer of 1959, she was participating in a show-business phenomenon.... While their older brothers toured America, the younger Isley boys enrolled successively in Englewood Junior High and Dwight Morrow High School.... Right now, the brothers reside near enough to each other to keep in close touch. Ronald lives in Teaneck, Kelly Jr. in Alpine, Rudolph in Haworth and Ernie in Englewood.\"</ref> the brothers continued to struggle with recordings, and eventually formed [[T-Neck Records]] in 1964.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=196}} During that period, [[Jimi Hendrix]] began playing lead guitar for the brothers' band. Bringing Hendrix with them to the studio, they recorded the song \"[[Testify (The Isley Brothers song)|Testify]]\". Later, Hendrix contributed guitar to another Isleys single, \"Move On Over and Let Me Dance\", which was recorded for T-Neck and distributed by [[Atlantic Records]]. After both songs failed to chart and Hendrix left the Isleys for good in 1965, the brothers signed with [[Motown Records]]. Early the following year, the group released their second Top 40 hit single, \"[[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)]]\". While the Isley Brothers' recordings with Motown were more successful than their earlier works, they struggled to score a follow-up Top 40 hit with the label. They left Motown in 1968.\n\n===Major success===\nResurrecting their T-Neck label that year, the brothers signed a distribution deal with [[Buddah Records]] and issued \"[[It's Your Thing]]\" in February 1969. The song, which featured the first appearance of Ernie Isley on bass, became their biggest success to date, reaching number 2 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on the R&B chart. The song's parent album, ''[[It's Our Thing]]'', reached number 22 on the [[Billboard 200|Pop LP]] chart, and \"It's Your Thing\" became the group's second million-seller and won them a Grammy Award. The release of \"It's Your Thing\" brought record label conflicts between the Isleys and Motown, as Motown argued that the group had recorded the song while still under their Motown contract. A 1975 court decision eventually found in the Isleys' favor.{{sfn|Gulla|2008|p=199}}\n\nBy 1971, the younger Isley brothers Ernie and Marvin and their brother-in-law Chris Jasper started to add to the band's music, first performing on the Isleys' ''[[Givin' It Back]]''. The album featured reinterpretations of rock songs mixing them with funk and gospel elements. The new members played an even bigger role in the 1972 album, ''[[Brother, Brother, Brother]]''. Both albums yielded Top 40 hits, including \"[[Love the One You're With]]\" and \"[[Pop That Thang]]\". By the end of their Buddah tenure in 1973, the brothers had signed a distribution deal with [[Epic Records]] and made Ernie, Marvin, and Chris official members. In 1973, the Isleys released ''[[3 + 3]]'', which included the Top 10 hit single \"[[That Lady (song)|That Lady]]\" and a UK Top 10 cover of \"[[Summer Breeze (song)|Summer Breeze]]\". Incorporating hard rock and folk rock as well as funk and soulful balladry, the album became their breakthrough hit, eventually selling over two million copies.\n\nThe following year, the album ''[[Live It Up (The Isley Brothers album)|Live It Up]]'' reached gold. In 1975, the brothers made one of their most successful recordings, ''[[The Heat Is On (album)|The Heat Is On]]'', which featured the hits \"[[Fight the Power (Part 1 & 2)|Fight the Power]]\" and \"[[For the Love of You]]\", and became their first album to reach number 1 on the Pop LP chart, going double-platinum at two million copies sold. The brothers would have more hit albums, including ''[[Harvest for the World]]'' (1976), ''[[Go for Your Guns]]'' (1977), and ''[[Showdown (The Isley Brothers album)|Showdown]]'' (1978), all of which went gold or platinum, and yielded several Top 40 pop and R&B singles and popular radio cuts. By 1979, with the release of ''[[Winner Takes All (album)|Winner Takes All]]'', the brothers had incorporated disco and [[quiet storm]] music into their work. The Isley Brothers' final album under their six-member lineup, ''[[Between the Sheets (The Isley Brothers album)|Between the Sheets]]'' (1983), sold more than two million copies. By then, financial struggles, creative difficulties, and other issues affected the group. Shortly after the success of ''Between the Sheets'', Ernie, Marvin, and Chris left the Isley Brothers and formed [[Isley-Jasper-Isley]]. They later recorded the hit \"[[Caravan of Love]]\".\n\n===Later years===\n{{sources|section|date=March 2020}}\nIn 1985, the original Isleys trio of O'Kelly, Rudy, and Ronnie signed with [[Warner Bros.

Ron put the group on a brief hiatus in 1990 while he recorded solo material. In 1991, Ron revived the group; Ernie Isley and brother Marvin returned to the fold. that year they released the album, ''[[Tracks of Life]]''. Five years later, Ron Isley gained popularity as video villain Frank Biggs (or Mr. Biggs) in the music video for [[R. Kelly]]'s hit \"[[Down Low (Nobody Has to Know)]]\", which included the Isley Brothers as featured artists. The success of the song and its video helped the brothers' 1996 album ''[[Mission to Please]]'' reach platinum status.\n\nThat same year, Marvin Isley's career ended after a bout with diabetes forced him to have both of his legs amputated. Ron and Ernie have carried on as a duo from then on. In 2001, the duo released their best-selling album in years with the ''[[Eternal (The Isley Brothers album)|Eternal]]'' album, which sold over two million copies and featured the top 20 hit single \"[[Contagious (song)|Contagious]]\", making the Isley Brothers the only act to reach the Hot 100 (in fact, that chart's top 50) during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s.  Two years later, the brothers' ''[[Body Kiss]]'' album peaked at number-one on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart, becoming their second to reach the position and the first to do so since ''The Heat Is On''. Their next two released albums included 2006's ''[[Baby Makin' Music]]'' and the 2007 holiday album ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''.

He has since released 14 solo albums, including 4 gospel albums. He released the #1 R&B hit \"Superbad\" in 1988, a song which emphasized the importance of education, a theme Jasper continues to emphasize in many of the songs he has written since his days with the Isleys. In January 2013, Jasper released ''Inspired: By Love, By Life, By the Spirit'', a compilation of love songs as well as socially conscious and spiritual tracks. In May 2014, Jasper released ''The One'', reminiscent of the soulful R&B and funk music he wrote for the Isleys. In 2016, Jasper released ''Share With Me'', which included a cover of the Billy Preston hit, \"You Are So Beautiful\" and a track called \"America\", a tribute to the nation and a call to come together. In April 2018, Jasper pre-released a double-A single \"The Love That You Give/It's a Miracle\" from his 15th solo album ''Dance With You'', scheduled for a July 2018 release. \n\nJasper, who earned a law degree in 2004, has continued to write, record, and perform all the music on his solo albums and produce artists for his Gold City label, including Liz Hogue, Out Front, and Brothaz By Choice.

A determined [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialist]], he led the party's guerrilla insurgency in the [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948-1960), fighting against British and Commonwealth forces in an attempt to establish an independent socialist state. After the MCP's defeat and subsequent Malayan independence, Chin waged [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)|a second campaign]] (1968-1989) against the newly formed government of [[Malaysia]] in an attempt to replace its government with a socialist one from exile. This second insurgency came to an end with the [[Peace Agreement of Hat Yai 1989]].\n\nChin Peng died at the age of 88, in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] where he was cremated according to Buddhist rites. Prior to his death, he lived in exile in Thailand. Contrary to one of the conditions of the 1989 peace agreement, he was not permitted to return to Malaysia.\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years ===\nChin Peng was born on 21 October 1924 into a middle-class family in the small seaside town of [[Sitiawan]], in [[Perak]] state, [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. His father went to live in  Sitiawan in 1920. He set up a bicycle, tire and spare motor parts business with the help of a relative from Singapore.<ref>C.C. Chin and Karl Hack, ''Dialogues with Chin Peng'', pp. 3, 38.</ref>\n{{Maoism sidebar}}\nChin Peng attended a Chinese language school in Sitiawan. In 1937 he joined the Chinese ''[[Anti Enemy Backing Up Society]]'' (AEBUS), formed that year to send aid to China in response to Japan's aggression. According to Chin and Hack, he was not a communist then.<ref>Chin and Hack, p. 40.</ref> He was in charge of anti-Japanese activities at his school, and was reportedly a supporter of [[Sun Yat-sen]]. By  early 1939 he had embraced Communism. He planned to go to [[Yan'an]], the renowned communist base in China, but was persuaded to remain in Malaya and take on heavier responsibilities in the newly formed Malayan Communist Party.\n\nIn late 1939, when Chin Peng was at 4th year of his Secondary school education (known as Senior Middle Level One), his school announced that the Senior Middle section was to be closed due to lack of funds. He decided to continue his education in the [[Methodism#Malaysia and Singapore|Methodist]]-run [[Anglo-Chinese Continuation School]], which operated in English, because it provided a good cover for his underground activities. He did not want to have to move to Singapore to continue with his education in Chinese. He left the school \"for fear of British harassment\" after just 6 months<ref>Chin and Hack, p. 39.</ref>\nHe was now focused fully on his political activities and became, from that point on, a full-time revolutionary. In January 1940 he was  put in charge of three anti-Japanese organisations that were targeting  students, teachers, members of cultural activities and general labourers. At the end of January 1940 he was admitted to the [[Malayan Communist Party]] as a member.\n<ref name=\"Chin and Hack, p. 41\">Chin and Hack, p. 41.</ref>\n\nHarassment by the authorities led him to leave his home town for [[Kuala Kangsar]] in July 1940. (This may be at the time when he left his  school, refer to above). Later he spent a month in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]]. In September 1940 the party posted him to [[Ipoh]] as a  Standing committee member for Perak. In December he attained full Party membership.\n\nIn early 1941 AEBUS was dissolved. Chin Peng became Ipoh District committee member of the Party. \"He led student underground cells of three Chinese secondary schools and the Party's organisations of the shop assistants, domestic servants of European families, workers at brick kilns and barbers.\"\n<ref name=\"Chin and Hack, p. 41\"/>\nIn June 1941 he became a member of the Perak State Committee.\n\n=== Rise to prominence ===\nChin Peng rose to prominence during [[World War II]] when many [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] [[British Malaya|Malayans]] took to the jungle to fight a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the Japanese. These fighters, inspired by the example of the [[Communist Party of China]], became known as the [[Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA). Chin Peng became the liaison officer between the MPAJA and the British military in South-East Asia.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of Malaya began in December 1941. In 1942 Chin was the youngest of three members of the Secretariat of the Perak State Committee: Su Yew Meng was secretary and Chang Meng Ching (''hanyu pinyin:'' Zhang Ming Jin) was the other member. In early 1943 the two senior members were captured by the Japanese, which left Chin Peng in charge. Contact with the Party's Central Committee had been lost; he attempted to re-establish it, travelling to Kuala Lumpur and meeting Chai Ker Meng. Later Lai Tek, the Party leader, sent another Central Committee member, Lee Siow Peng (Siao Ping), to replace Chin as State Secretary. However, Lee Siow Peng was captured not long after, while travelling to a meeting that was to be held in Singapore.\n\nThus the job of establishing contact with the British commando [[Force 136#Malayan Communist Party|Force 136]] fell to Chin Peng. The first party of that force, consisting of Capt. John Davis and five Chinese agents, had landed in Malaya on 24 May 1943, by submarine. Chin Peng made contact with this armed group on 30 September 1943. He was active in his support for the British stay-behind troops, but had no illusions about their failure to protect Malaya against the Japanese. In the course of this activity, he came into contact with [[Freddie Spencer Chapman]], who called him a 'true friend' in his Malayan jungle memoir, 'The Jungle Is Neutral'.\n\nBecause of his services during the war, Chin was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> (though it was subsequently withdrawn later by the British government), a mention in despatches and two campaign [[medal]]s by Britain. He was elected the Secretary General of the Communist Party of Malaya after the betrayal of previous leader [[Lai Tek]] who turned out to be an agent for both the British and the Japanese and had denounced the leadership of the Party to the [[Japanese secret police]]. Chin Peng was the most senior surviving member.\n\n=== Before the Emergency ===\nIn 1948, the Federation of Malaya Plan replaced the Malayan Union plan, frustrating the CPM as they felt the plan was undemocratic and biased towards the Malay elites. They accused the British for forcing the Federation idea on the people by portraying it as a constitutional solution to Malaya's crisis.<ref>Ng, p. 11</ref><ref>Chin, p.201</ref> According to Chin, the central committee still adhered to Lai Teck's peace struggle strategy in facing the Federation, as they thought that the people of Malaya were still recovering from the horrors of the Japanese Occupation. To launch an armed rebellion so soon would not only cause them to lose the mass support they had been enjoying but, at the same time, also drive the already wary Malays to openly resist them.<ref>Ng, p. 78</ref><ref>Chin and Hack, p. 118</ref><ref>Chin, p.193</ref>\n\nSome scholars allege that the CPM received secret directives from Moscow agents on the methods and timing for a near-simultaneous uprising against colonial authorities during the Southeast Asian Youth Conference held in Calcutta on 19 February 1948 which eventually caused the CPM's insurrection. Chin denied it, stating that the conference actually argued against such a move. Laurence Sharkey, party secretary of the Australian Communist Party, informed Chin and the central committee of the conference's decision while stopping over in Singapore on his way home.<ref>Ng, p. 79</ref><ref>Chin, p. 202</ref> In March 1948, the central committees were discussing new policies as the labour strikes were not bringing the results that they hoped for. Chin Peng estimated it would be a year or two before the British took actions against the CPM, leaving them ample time to prepare for a guerrilla war.<ref>Ng, p. 80</ref><ref>Chin, p. 205</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 1948, the colonial government outlawed the burgeoning trade union federations amid a rising atmosphere of tension. Since then, there was no reduction in the level of violent activities, other than the neutralisation of trade unions. Political murders of informers, anyone found to be working against the labour movement or the CPM, non-Europeans considered enemies to the communist cause, or strike-breakers who used thugs and gangsters to harass protesters rose.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 81\">Ng, p. 81</ref> The murder of three Kuomintang leaders in Johor on 12 June had convinced the British that the communists were escalating the conflict in retaliation for outlawing the trade unions, while in the CPM's eyes these murders were just purely acts of intimidation. Chin again claimed that he was not aware of the murders at the time, although he approved of the later killing of the plantation managers who he claimed were harsh and cruel towards farm workers.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 81\"/><ref>Chin, p. 215</ref>\n\n=== The Emergency (1948\u20131989) ===\n[[File:Chin Peng wanted by Malaya.jpg|thumb|Headline on page 1 of ''[[The Straits Times]]'' of {{date|df=yes|1952|05|01}}]]\nOn 16 June 1948, three European plantation managers were murdered in Sungai Siput, which has generally been identified as the incident contributing to the Malayan colonial administration declaration of a state of emergency. Rather, Sze-Chieh Ng argued these murders were merely the final catalyst for a long-brewing crisis that had been going on since the trade unions began agitating in 1945. Anthony Short feels that this was more of a panic reaction than a carefully considered move. According to him, the government had been powerless to deal with the unrest plaguing Malaya since 1945. According to Purcell's viewpoint, the Emergency was declared in response to increasing incidents of violence and lawlessness.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 82\">Ng, p. 82</ref><ref>Short, p. 75</ref><ref>Purcell, p. 61</ref>\n\nMany Singaporean historians and [[anti-communist]]s allege that Chin Peng ordered the killings. Chin claimed he had no prior knowledge of the plot. He added that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and he lost touch with the Party for a couple of days.<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 215\u2013222.</ref> Chin became the most wanted man of the British government, with the government offering a reward of $250,000 for his capture. On 17 July 1948, CPM offices in Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Singapore, and other major cities were raided, followed by mass arrests of suspected communists and anti-government individuals on 21 July.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 83\">Ng, p. 83</ref> The CPM was banned in July 1948.\n\nIn response to the Emergency and the mass arrests of its members, the CPM issued a call to its members to revive its disbanded wartime resistance army, the MPAJA, take up arms again and escape to the jungles.<ref>Cheah, p. 135</ref> In fact, since late May and early June the communists had been secretly setting up platoons in several states in preparation for an expected British crackdown in September. The Emergency's sudden declaration in June, however, forced the MCP to accelerate its plan and it called out to comrades and volunteers to join them in the struggle.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 82\"/> The new guerrilla army, now known as the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), spent the first year of the Emergency reconsolidating and rearming.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 83\"/>\n\nAt that time, the CPM was in chaos, which the members were dispersed in the jungles, and operating without a command structure and a central leadership. According to Chin, attacks were being carried out without his approval or knowledge and there was no co-ordination between the units. Guerrilla casualties were high in return for little to no strategic gains in those early months.<ref>Chin, p. 226</ref> Chin was desperate to assert control over the MNLA, which had been operating independently since June. It was not until August that some form of central authority was finally set up in the Cameron Highlands, with Chin ordering the guerrillas to adopt Mao Zedong's strategy of establishing liberated zones as they drove the British from an area.<ref>Chin,p. 230</ref> However, this strategy failed. British forces continued to hound the guerrillas, who were often forced to relocate deeper into the jungles and disperse their forces into smaller units. This was due to difficulties in resupply and the dangers of maintaining a large force, where the chances of discovery and annihilation by British patrols were high.<ref>Ng, p. 84</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the CPM was losing civilian support, and lacking material assistance and intelligence, the party suffered. Chin admitted they had wrongly assumed that the people would be willing to offer their support as they had in World War II. When that failed to happen, they resorted to forceful measures to obtain what they needed.<ref>Chin, p. 273</ref>\n\nThe CPM and MNLA also suffered under British propaganda, which labelled them as bandits and communist terrorists. Old suspicions and assumptions that the CPM had clandestine support from either the CCP or the Soviet Union had, over time, became an accepted fact.<ref>Ng, p. 85</ref> Post-Cold War materials have finally overturned the convenient lie the British promoted more than half a century ago, revealing not only that the CPM had not sought external support but also that no agents from either China or Russia had even made contact with them. The only \u2018support\u2019 Chin recalled obtaining was the encouraging news that Mao's guerrillas had defeated Chiang Kai-shek's well-equipped and numerically superior KMT army in 1949.<ref>Ng, p. 86</ref><ref>Chin, p. 356</ref>\n\n'''''Briggs Plan'''''\n\nIn 1950, a series of strategies were introduced by the Director of Operations for the anti-communist war in Malaya, Lt. General Sir Harold Briggs, that later became known as \u2018[[Briggs' Plan]].\u2019<ref>Ng, p. 87</ref> The plan, which aimed to defeat the guerrillas by cutting off their sources of civilian support, was a success. The creation of \u2018New Villages\u2019 under this plan had limited intelligence and food supplies for the CPM, and thus had a devastating effect on the guerrillas.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 88\">Ng, p. 88</ref> Chin concurred this fact, as he nearly starved on several occasions during those twelve years.<ref>Chin, p. 395</ref>\n\nAfter several reviews and amendments, the CPM ordered the guerrillas to cease sabotage and terror operations, and to develop closer ties with the middle-class in order to preserve their organizational strength.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 88\"/> Chin would later admit in an interview in 1999 that this directive was a mistake as it allowed the British to press on with their attacks on the MNLA, whom they correctly assessed to be quite demoralised by then.<ref>Chin and Hack, p. 160</ref>\n\nAfter Sir Harold Briggs died, Lt. General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed as the new commander, introducing aggressive strategies which differed from the Briggs Plan. These included interrogations, food rationing, large monetary rewards for captured or killed communists coupled with intense military operations, and the mobilisation of a large number of troops to hound the guerrillas.<ref>Short, p. 365</ref><ref>Chin, p. 299</ref> In 1953, the CPM relocated their headquarters to Betong, in southern Thailand. They reestablished its networks to connect the scattered units and review its strategy.<ref>Ng, p. 91</ref><ref>Chin, p. 278</ref>\n\nIn late 1953 and early 1954, the war was at a semi-stalemate due to both the MNLA and the British being unable to decisively defeat one another.<ref>Ng, p. 92</ref> In early 1954, Siao Chang, a top CPM leader who had been sent to Beijing in late 1952 to deepen his Marxist\u2013Leninist education while also serving as liaison to the CCP, announced a new direction for the party, which was to abandon the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Malaya and join with other Malayan political parties in a legal fight for Malaya independence.<ref>Ng, p. 93</ref> Chin described Siao as the CPM's \u2018insurance policy\u2019 in the event the central committee was eliminated.<ref name=\"Chin, p. 351\">Chin, p. 351</ref>\n\nAlthough this was not their decision, Chin and the other central committees decided to join the other Malayan parties, reasoning that the Malay politicians had achieved more for the independence movement within the last few years than the MNLA had since 1948. The Beijing announcement also revealed to the CPM that both the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China had viewed the armed struggle in Malaya as untenable.<ref>Ng, p. 94</ref><ref name=\"Chin, p. 351\"/><ref>Chin and Hack, p. 164</ref>\n\n'''''Baling Talks'''''\n\nOn 24 September 1955, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to negotiate peace. On 17 October, talks between two government representatives and Chin Peng and another central committee of the CPM were held at Klian Intan.<ref>O'Ballance, p. 152</ref> A new \u2018Eight Point Program\u2019 was introduced by the CPM to call for an end to the Emergency and a cessation of hostilities, a reform of Malaya's political system, expand democratic rights, support for world peace, and attention to other matters including education, health, welfare, and industrial production.\n\nOn 28 and 29 December 1955, the negotiations reached its peak at the small northern town of Baling in Kedah. Representatives from the Government were Tunku Abdul Rahman, David Marshall, the Chief Minister of Singapore, and Sir Cheng Lock Tan, the leader of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA). The CPM was represented by Chin Peng, Chen Tian, and Abdul Rashid bin Maidin. The first day of the talks did not go well, as Chin wanted the CPM to be recognised as a legal party again, or for the leaders and members of the MNLA to at least be allowed to regain their freedom of movement and not face any legal persecution or imprisonment.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 97\">Ng, p. 97</ref> Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this request, and demanded at the beginning of the meeting that the CPM fully surrender as the only way to peace, but then promised that those who surrendered would undergo a period of rehabilitation before being allowed to become free citizens again.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 97\"/>\n\nChin again argued freedom of thought and choice must be recognised by the Malayan government if the new nation was to survive past its independence, as the people should have the right to decide which political path the nation should take rather than having that choice be decided by a select few in the government.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 97\"/> Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this as well, and only promised freedom for the CPM members to join any existing political party after being cleared by the authorities.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 97\"/>\n\nOn the second day of talks, Chin asserted that the CPM would cease its hostilities and lay down its arms if the Alliance government could obtain the powers of internal security and defence from the British government.<ref>Cheah, p. 141</ref> Tunku Abdul Rahman accepted it as a challenge and promised that he would push for it on his upcoming trip to London.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 98\">Ng, p. 98</ref> Great publicity was given in the media to this dramatic challenge from Chin Peng. The challenge, indeed, served to strengthen the Alliance government's bargaining position at the London talks. Anxious to end the Emergency, the British government agreed to concede those powers of internal security and defence, and to accede to the demand for independence for Malaya by 31 August 1957, if possible.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 142\">Cheah, p. 142</ref> Chin claimed it was his challenge to Tunku Abdul Rahman that hastened the independence of Malaya.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 142\"/> Tunku Abdul Rahman had acknowledged the importance of the Baling talks, writing in 1974 that \u2018Baling had led straight to Merdeka (Independence).\u2019<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 142\"/>\n\nRegardless, the talks themselves ended without a consensus between the two sides. The talks finally collapsed but were regarded as both a success and failure for Tunku Abdul Rahman, as the talks made the British regard him as a strong leader who was tough on communism. His performance had also impressed the Colonial Office enough to grant Malaya independence. For the CPM, it was a very demoralising affair which nearly destroyed their already ailing struggle.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 98\"/> The failure of the Baling Talks had a great negative impact towards the CPM, accumulated with the lost of hope to either end the war or achieve the advancement of their ideology. Due to the mounting combat casualties plus the lack of stable food supplies, the members started to turn themselves in to the government in return for financial rewards and pardons.<ref>Ng, p. 99</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to resume negotiations. This was rejected by Rahman in a broadcast on 2 April. The MNLA would lose almost 88% of its men, from an approximately 3000-strong army when they first raised arms in mid-1948 to no more than 350 men by late 1958 due to casualties and surrenders.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 100\">Ng, p. 100</ref><ref>Short, p. 493</ref><ref>Chin, p. 403</ref>\n\nIn 1959, the central committees of CPM decided to demobilise their activities and to have the guerrillas reintegrate into society while continuing to promote their communist ideals until such a time when they could once again rise up in revolt.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 100\"/> Chin then moved to south Thailand with the remnants of his forces during the latter part of the Emergency due to pressure from the Malayan security forces, which by 1952 totalled over 32,000 regular troops in Malaya, about three-fifths of whom were Europeans from the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.<ref>Cheah, p. 137</ref>\n\n'''''The Second Insurgency (1968-1989)'''''\n\nIn 1961, members of the CPM central committee such as Chin Peng, Chen Tien, and Lee An Tung moved to Beijing to seek political advice and guidance from the more experienced Chinese Communist Party.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 100\"/> Chin would, however, remain in Beijing for the next 29 years and the party would not lay down its arms until 1989. The reasons for this reversal of the party's decision to disband, according to Chin, was the advice given to him by the Vietnamese communist leaders in Hanoi, the opening of the second \u2018Vietnam War\u2019, which was followed by China's Cultural Revolution, all of which stressed a strong militant line to be taken by Asian communist parties.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 143\">Cheah, p. 143</ref>\n\nWhile in Beijing, Chin Peng was also advised by [[Deng Xiaoping]], to continue the armed struggle in Malaya as Deng felt the time was ripe for revolutions to take place in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 101\">Ng, p. 101</ref> Deng insisted that the military struggle should not only be maintained but stepped up.<ref name=\"Taaffe, 2005\">Taaffe, 2005</ref> Deng even promised financial support to the CPM if they should take up arms once again.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 101\"/> Deng's offer was to remain a secret as the CCP did not wish to let it be known that they had been actively supporting Southeast Asia's communist movements. Chin reluctantly decided to acquiesce to Deng's suggestion. This was also the first time that the CPM had accepted foreign assistance in its struggle and it was with this financial backing that the second armed struggle in Malaya would be launched in 1968.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 101\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, back in Malaya, the Malayan government had declared the Emergency over on 31 July 1960 once they became confident the MNLA had ceased to be a credible threat, with the surviving guerrillas retreating to their sanctuary in southern Thailand.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 101\"/> However, the insurgency continued with the insurgents increasing their attacks, ambushing military convoys, bombing national monuments, and assassinations of marked police officers and political \u2018enemy targets\u2019. The insurgency, which began as a war against the British colonialists, was now transformed into a war against \u2018federalists, compressors capitalists and lackeys of British imperialism\u2019.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 143\"/> The Malayan government maintained a high security alert by devoting one-third of its national budget to defence and internal security needs, and requested British, Australian and New Zealand troops to remain in the country until its internal security and national armed forces could be built up and the foreign troops gradually phased out.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 143\"/>\n\nIn 1970, the CPM's guerrilla bases in Thailand were hard hit by the trials and executions of supposed spies. Two breakaway factions were formed which condemned the purge. Chin, who was then based in China, denied involvement and later rehabilitated his accused comrades.<ref>Chin, p. 466-469, 499</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, the CPM intensified its activities and clashes with the security forces. These activities were due to a rivalry among three factions in the CPM over party purges and strategies, with each faction trying to outdo the other in militancy and violence.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 148\">Cheah, p. 148</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1980, Deng Xiaoping refocused his priorities back on the Chinese bureaucracy after his return to power in 1978. He welcomed Lee Kuan Yew, the then-Prime Minister of Singapore and its leading political figure since independence from Malaysia, in a visit to Beijing.<ref name=\"Taaffe, 2005\"/> Chin recalled that Deng had not bothered to meet him since then. Finally in December 1980, Deng summoned Chin. In the meeting, Deng demanded Chin to immediately close down all the CPM's radio stations which were broadcasting from China to Malaysia. When Chin asked Deng when he would like him to cease the broadcasting, Deng replied, \u201cThe sooner the better... Lee (Lee Kuan Yew) asked me to stop the broadcasts immediately.\u201d<ref name=\"Taaffe, 2005\"/> Moreover, during his official visit to China, the second Prime Minister of Malaysian government Tun Razak held talks with Chinese communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong and urged him to stop giving aid to the CPM. The fourth Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammad further succeeded in persuading China to downgrade its ties with the CPM. This was an important factor that contributed to the CPM's decision to end its armed struggle.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 148\"/><ref>Chin, p. 482-483</ref>\n\n'''''The End of the Emergency'''''\n\nThe CPM finally laid down its arms in 1989. The death toll during the armed conflict totalled thousands. Those sympathetic to Chin Peng tend to portray the violence perpetrated by the CPM as defensive, while right-wing opponents tend to portray it as aggressive and unethical. Some have claimed the large number of civilian casualties was in contrast to the stance adopted by Mao Zedong and his policy of the Eight Points of Attention.\n\nOn 2 December 1989, at the town of Hat Yai in Southern Thailand, Chin, Rashid Maidin and Abdullah CD met with representatives of the Malaysian and Thai governments. Separate peace agreements were signed between the MCP and both governments. One of the terms of the agreement was that MCP members of Malayan origin be allowed to return to live in Malaysia.\n\nWhen all hostilities ceased, the total number of CPM members was 1,188; 694 were Thai-born and 494 claimed origins in Peninsular Malaysia. They were given a temporary grant and promised integration into Malaysia.<ref name=\"Taaffe, 2005\"/>\n\nIn Chin's opinion, a peace could have been achieved as early as 1955 during the Baling Talks, if the British, Tunku Abdul Rahman and David Marshall had not demanded that the communist fighters capitulate and surrender but, rather, had allowed them to hand over or destroy their weapons in a mutually agreed way and then resume normal life with full political freedom, which was the broad outcome of the 1989 accords.<ref>Symon, 2003</ref>\n\n=== Application to return to Malaysia ===\nChin never officially returned to Malaysia after the 1989 Hat Yai Peace Accords, but continued his exile in Thailand. He gave lectures at the National University of Singapore in 2004, using purposes of academic research as his reason to gain the visitation permission from the Singaporean government. At the beginning of 2000, he applied for permission to return to [[Malaysia]]. His application was rejected by the High Court on 25 July 2005.\n\nIn June 2008, Chin again lost his bid to return to Malaysia when the Court of Appeal upheld an earlier ruling that compelled him to show identification papers to prove his citizenship. Chin maintained that his birth certificate was seized by the police during a raid in 1948. His counsel [[Raja Aziz Addruse]] had submitted before the Court of Appeal that it was wrong for the Malaysian government to compel him to produce the documents, because he was entitled to enter and live in Malaysia by virtue of the peace agreement.\n\nOn April 2009, Chin's application to return to Malaysia was once again rejected by the High Court for the same reason as his previous attempt. The Malaysian government insisted that his possible return would cause people who lost their loved ones during the Emergency to relive their pain again.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/world/2013/09/130916_world_chen_ping \"Former CPM General Secretary Chen Ping Died in Thailand\"]</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, Chin issued an apology to the victims and their family members for the atrocities committed by the CPM.<ref>[http://www.sinchew.com.my/node/139557 \"Chin Peng apologies on behalf of CPM\"]</ref> However, the then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Muhyiddin Yassin]], replied that despite Chin's apology, he would still not be allowed to return to Malaysia.<ref>\u201cMuhyidin: Government will not change the decision, Chin Peng can't return even if he apologized\u201d [http://www.sinchew.com.my/node/1165778]</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\nChin died at the age of 88 in a Bangkok hospital on the morning of 16 September 2013, the 50th anniversary of Malaysia Day,<ref>[https://archive.is/20130916104141/http://news.sinchew.com.my/topic/node/405309?tid=1166 \"CPM General Secretary Chen Ping Died\"]</ref> and the 90th birthday of Lee Kuan Yew. He was cremated according to Buddhist rites.\n\nWhile Chin had previously voiced wishes to be buried in Sitiawan, his remains continued to be denied entry for burial in Malaysia by the Malaysian government, as it was claimed that the one-year window after the agreement to reapply for citizenship had long lapsed and Chin was assumed to have relinquished his rights to return.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/open-door-to-chin-pengs-ashes-since-malay-terrorists-also-buried-here-says |title=Open door to Chin Peng\u2019s ashes since Malay terrorists also buried here, says MCA |last1=Lim |first1=Ida |last2= |first2= |date=20 September 2013 |work= |publisher=[[The Malay Mail]] |accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Publications about Chin Peng ===\nChin Peng co-authored his story with Singapore-based writers and publishers Ian Ward, who was formerly the Southeast Asia correspondent for the London conservative newspaper, [[The Daily Telegraph]], and Ward's wife Norma Miraflor. The book named \u201c''Alias Chin Peng:'' ''My Side of History''\u201d, was published in 2003.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2013/09/17/an-intriguing-enigma-to-the-end/ \"An intriguing enigma to the end\"]</ref>\n\nAnother book, \u201cDialogues with Chin Peng: New Light on the Malayan Communist Party\u201d by editors C. C. Chin and Karl Hack, was published by the Singapore University Press in 2004. This book details a series of meetings held in Australia that Chin Peng had attended with historians and military experts.\n\n== Media portrayal ==\nIn 2006, a documentary film about Chin Peng was made called ''[[The Last Communist]]''. It was banned by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs of Malaysia]].\n\nAnother documentary film about him called ''[[I Love Malaya]]'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|title=I Love Malaya|url=http://ilovemalaya.wordpress.com/}}</ref>\n\n== Chronology ==\n* 22 October 1924: Birth.\n* January 1940: Accepted as probationary member of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM); put in charge of Communist members in Sitiawan.\n* 4 July 1940: Leaves home.\n* December 1941: Communists' offer of help accepted; joins the fight against the Japanese.\n* 10 January 1942: The first batch of the Malayan Peoples Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA).\n* 1942: Meets future wife, Lee Khoon Wah.\n* 1945: World War II ends.\n* January 1946: Awarded 2 war medals; boycotts tour of British bases; forced to sign letter of apology.\n* Mid-October 1946: In Penang, Yeung Kuo reveals that [[Lai Teck]] has betrayed the CPM; Lai Teck subsequently absconds with most of party's money.\n* 6 March 1947: MCP Central Executive Committee meeting held to deal with Lai Teck controversy; Lai Teck fails to appear and is never seen by MCP again.

A determined [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonialist]], he led the party's guerrilla insurgency in the [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948-1960), fighting against British and Commonwealth forces in an attempt to establish an independent socialist state. After the MCP's defeat and subsequent Malayan independence, Chin waged [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)|a second campaign]] (1968-1989) against the newly formed government of [[Malaysia]] in an attempt to replace its government with a socialist one from exile. This second insurgency came to an end with the [[Peace Agreement of Hat Yai 1989]].\n\nChin Peng died at the age of 88, in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] where he was cremated according to Buddhist rites. Prior to his death, he lived in exile in Thailand. Contrary to one of the conditions of the 1989 peace agreement, he was not permitted to return to Malaysia.\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early years ===\nChin Peng was born on 21 October 1924 into a middle-class family in the small seaside town of [[Sitiawan]], in [[Perak]] state, [[British Malaya|Malaya]]. His father went to live in  Sitiawan in 1920. He set up a bicycle, tire and spare motor parts business with the help of a relative from Singapore.<ref>C.C. Chin and Karl Hack, ''Dialogues with Chin Peng'', pp. 3, 38.</ref>\n{{Maoism sidebar}}\nChin Peng attended a Chinese language school in Sitiawan. In 1937 he joined the Chinese ''[[Anti Enemy Backing Up Society]]'' (AEBUS), formed that year to send aid to China in response to Japan's aggression. According to Chin and Hack, he was not a communist then.<ref>Chin and Hack, p. 40.</ref> He was in charge of anti-Japanese activities at his school, and was reportedly a supporter of [[Sun Yat-sen]]. By  early 1939 he had embraced Communism. He planned to go to [[Yan'an]], the renowned communist base in China, but was persuaded to remain in Malaya and take on heavier responsibilities in the newly formed Malayan Communist Party.\n\nIn late 1939, when Chin Peng was at 4th year of his Secondary school education (known as Senior Middle Level One), his school announced that the Senior Middle section was to be closed due to lack of funds. He decided to continue his education in the [[Methodism#Malaysia and Singapore|Methodist]]-run [[Anglo-Chinese Continuation School]], which operated in English, because it provided a good cover for his underground activities. He did not want to have to move to Singapore to continue with his education in Chinese. He left the school \"for fear of British harassment\" after just 6 months<ref>Chin and Hack, p. 39.</ref>\nHe was now focused fully on his political activities and became, from that point on, a full-time revolutionary. In January 1940 he was  put in charge of three anti-Japanese organisations that were targeting  students, teachers, members of cultural activities and general labourers. At the end of January 1940 he was admitted to the [[Malayan Communist Party]] as a member.\n<ref name=\"Chin and Hack, p. 41\">Chin and Hack, p. 41.</ref>\n\nHarassment by the authorities led him to leave his home town for [[Kuala Kangsar]] in July 1940. (This may be at the time when he left his  school, refer to above). Later he spent a month in [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]]. In September 1940 the party posted him to [[Ipoh]] as a  Standing committee member for Perak. In December he attained full Party membership.\n\nIn early 1941 AEBUS was dissolved. Chin Peng became Ipoh District committee member of the Party. \"He led student underground cells of three Chinese secondary schools and the Party's organisations of the shop assistants, domestic servants of European families, workers at brick kilns and barbers.\"\n<ref name=\"Chin and Hack, p. 41\"/>\nIn June 1941 he became a member of the Perak State Committee.\n\n=== Rise to prominence ===\nChin Peng rose to prominence during [[World War II]] when many [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] [[British Malaya|Malayans]] took to the jungle to fight a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the Japanese. These fighters, inspired by the example of the [[Communist Party of China]], became known as the [[Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA). Chin Peng became the liaison officer between the MPAJA and the British military in South-East Asia.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of Malaya began in December 1941. In 1942 Chin was the youngest of three members of the Secretariat of the Perak State Committee: Su Yew Meng was secretary and Chang Meng Ching (''hanyu pinyin:'' Zhang Ming Jin) was the other member. In early 1943 the two senior members were captured by the Japanese, which left Chin Peng in charge. Contact with the Party's Central Committee had been lost; he attempted to re-establish it, travelling to Kuala Lumpur and meeting Chai Ker Meng. Later Lai Tek, the Party leader, sent another Central Committee member, Lee Siow Peng (Siao Ping), to replace Chin as State Secretary. However, Lee Siow Peng was captured not long after, while travelling to a meeting that was to be held in Singapore.\n\nThus the job of establishing contact with the British commando [[Force 136#Malayan Communist Party|Force 136]] fell to Chin Peng. The first party of that force, consisting of Capt. John Davis and five Chinese agents, had landed in Malaya on 24 May 1943, by submarine. Chin Peng made contact with this armed group on 30 September 1943. He was active in his support for the British stay-behind troops, but had no illusions about their failure to protect Malaya against the Japanese. In the course of this activity, he came into contact with [[Freddie Spencer Chapman]], who called him a 'true friend' in his Malayan jungle memoir, 'The Jungle Is Neutral'.\n\nBecause of his services during the war, Chin was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> (though it was subsequently withdrawn later by the British government), a mention in despatches and two campaign [[medal]]s by Britain. He was elected the Secretary General of the Communist Party of Malaya after the betrayal of previous leader [[Lai Tek]] who turned out to be an agent for both the British and the Japanese and had denounced the leadership of the Party to the [[Japanese secret police]]. Chin Peng was the most senior surviving member.\n\n=== Before the Emergency ===\nIn 1948, the Federation of Malaya Plan replaced the Malayan Union plan, frustrating the CPM as they felt the plan was undemocratic and biased towards the Malay elites. They accused the British for forcing the Federation idea on the people by portraying it as a constitutional solution to Malaya's crisis.<ref>Ng, p. 11</ref><ref>Chin, p.201</ref> According to Chin, the central committee still adhered to Lai Teck's peace struggle strategy in facing the Federation, as they thought that the people of Malaya were still recovering from the horrors of the Japanese Occupation. To launch an armed rebellion so soon would not only cause them to lose the mass support they had been enjoying but, at the same time, also drive the already wary Malays to openly resist them.<ref>Ng, p. 78</ref><ref>Chin and Hack, p. 118</ref><ref>Chin, p.193</ref>\n\nSome scholars allege that the CPM received secret directives from Moscow agents on the methods and timing for a near-simultaneous uprising against colonial authorities during the Southeast Asian Youth Conference held in Calcutta on 19 February 1948 which eventually caused the CPM's insurrection. Chin denied it, stating that the conference actually argued against such a move. Laurence Sharkey, party secretary of the Australian Communist Party, informed Chin and the central committee of the conference's decision while stopping over in Singapore on his way home.<ref>Ng, p. 79</ref><ref>Chin, p. 202</ref> In March 1948, the central committees were discussing new policies as the labour strikes were not bringing the results that they hoped for. Chin Peng estimated it would be a year or two before the British took actions against the CPM, leaving them ample time to prepare for a guerrilla war.<ref>Ng, p. 80</ref><ref>Chin, p. 205</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 1948, the colonial government outlawed the burgeoning trade union federations amid a rising atmosphere of tension. Since then, there was no reduction in the level of violent activities, other than the neutralisation of trade unions. Political murders of informers, anyone found to be working against the labour movement or the CPM, non-Europeans considered enemies to the communist cause, or strike-breakers who used thugs and gangsters to harass protesters rose.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 81\">Ng, p. 81</ref> The murder of three Kuomintang leaders in Johor on 12 June had convinced the British that the communists were escalating the conflict in retaliation for outlawing the trade unions, while in the CPM's eyes these murders were just purely acts of intimidation. Chin again claimed that he was not aware of the murders at the time, although he approved of the later killing of the plantation managers who he claimed were harsh and cruel towards farm workers.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 81\"/><ref>Chin, p. 215</ref>\n\n=== The Emergency (1948\u20131989) ===\n[[File:Chin Peng wanted by Malaya.jpg|thumb|Headline on page 1 of ''[[The Straits Times]]'' of {{date|df=yes|1952|05|01}}]]\nOn 16 June 1948, three European plantation managers were murdered in Sungai Siput, which has generally been identified as the incident contributing to the Malayan colonial administration declaration of a state of emergency. Rather, Sze-Chieh Ng argued these murders were merely the final catalyst for a long-brewing crisis that had been going on since the trade unions began agitating in 1945. Anthony Short feels that this was more of a panic reaction than a carefully considered move. According to him, the government had been powerless to deal with the unrest plaguing Malaya since 1945. According to Purcell's viewpoint, the Emergency was declared in response to increasing incidents of violence and lawlessness.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 82\">Ng, p. 82</ref><ref>Short, p. 75</ref><ref>Purcell, p. 61</ref>\n\nMany Singaporean historians and [[anti-communist]]s allege that Chin Peng ordered the killings. Chin claimed he had no prior knowledge of the plot. He added that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and he lost touch with the Party for a couple of days.<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 215\u2013222.</ref> Chin became the most wanted man of the British government, with the government offering a reward of $250,000 for his capture. On 17 July 1948, CPM offices in Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Singapore, and other major cities were raided, followed by mass arrests of suspected communists and anti-government individuals on 21 July.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 83\">Ng, p. 83</ref> The CPM was banned in July 1948.\n\nIn response to the Emergency and the mass arrests of its members, the CPM issued a call to its members to revive its disbanded wartime resistance army, the MPAJA, take up arms again and escape to the jungles.<ref>Cheah, p. 135</ref> In fact, since late May and early June the communists had been secretly setting up platoons in several states in preparation for an expected British crackdown in September. The Emergency's sudden declaration in June, however, forced the MCP to accelerate its plan and it called out to comrades and volunteers to join them in the struggle.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 82\"/> The new guerrilla army, now known as the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), spent the first year of the Emergency reconsolidating and rearming.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 83\"/>\n\nAt that time, the CPM was in chaos, which the members were dispersed in the jungles, and operating without a command structure and a central leadership. According to Chin, attacks were being carried out without his approval or knowledge and there was no co-ordination between the units. Guerrilla casualties were high in return for little to no strategic gains in those early months.<ref>Chin, p. 226</ref> Chin was desperate to assert control over the MNLA, which had been operating independently since June. It was not until August that some form of central authority was finally set up in the Cameron Highlands, with Chin ordering the guerrillas to adopt Mao Zedong's strategy of establishing liberated zones as they drove the British from an area.<ref>Chin,p. 230</ref> However, this strategy failed. British forces continued to hound the guerrillas, who were often forced to relocate deeper into the jungles and disperse their forces into smaller units. This was due to difficulties in resupply and the dangers of maintaining a large force, where the chances of discovery and annihilation by British patrols were high.<ref>Ng, p. 84</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the CPM was losing civilian support, and lacking material assistance and intelligence, the party suffered. Chin admitted they had wrongly assumed that the people would be willing to offer their support as they had in World War II. When that failed to happen, they resorted to forceful measures to obtain what they needed.<ref>Chin, p. 273</ref>\n\nThe CPM and MNLA also suffered under British propaganda, which labelled them as bandits and communist terrorists. Old suspicions and assumptions that the CPM had clandestine support from either the CCP or the Soviet Union had, over time, became an accepted fact.<ref>Ng, p. 85</ref> Post-Cold War materials have finally overturned the convenient lie the British promoted more than half a century ago, revealing not only that the CPM had not sought external support but also that no agents from either China or Russia had even made contact with them. The only \u2018support\u2019 Chin recalled obtaining was the encouraging news that Mao's guerrillas had defeated Chiang Kai-shek's well-equipped and numerically superior KMT army in 1949.<ref>Ng, p. 86</ref><ref>Chin, p. 356</ref>\n\n'''''Briggs Plan'''''\n\nIn 1950, a series of strategies were introduced by the Director of Operations for the anti-communist war in Malaya, Lt. General Sir Harold Briggs, that later became known as \u2018[[Briggs' Plan]].\u2019<ref>Ng, p. 87</ref> The plan, which aimed to defeat the guerrillas by cutting off their sources of civilian support, was a success. The creation of \u2018New Villages\u2019 under this plan had limited intelligence and food supplies for the CPM, and thus had a devastating effect on the guerrillas.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 88\">Ng, p. 88</ref> Chin concurred this fact, as he nearly starved on several occasions during those twelve years.<ref>Chin, p. 395</ref>\n\nAfter several reviews and amendments, the CPM ordered the guerrillas to cease sabotage and terror operations, and to develop closer ties with the middle-class in order to preserve their organizational strength.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 88\"/> Chin would later admit in an interview in 1999 that this directive was a mistake as it allowed the British to press on with their attacks on the MNLA, whom they correctly assessed to be quite demoralised by then.<ref>Chin and Hack, p. 160</ref>\n\nAfter Sir Harold Briggs died, Lt. General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed as the new commander, introducing aggressive strategies which differed from the Briggs Plan. These included interrogations, food rationing, large monetary rewards for captured or killed communists coupled with intense military operations, and the mobilisation of a large number of troops to hound the guerrillas.<ref>Short, p. 365</ref><ref>Chin, p. 299</ref> In 1953, the CPM relocated their headquarters to Betong, in southern Thailand. They reestablished its networks to connect the scattered units and review its strategy.<ref>Ng, p. 91</ref><ref>Chin, p. 278</ref>\n\nIn late 1953 and early 1954, the war was at a semi-stalemate due to both the MNLA and the British being unable to decisively defeat one another.<ref>Ng, p. 92</ref> In early 1954, Siao Chang, a top CPM leader who had been sent to Beijing in late 1952 to deepen his Marxist\u2013Leninist education while also serving as liaison to the CCP, announced a new direction for the party, which was to abandon the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Malaya and join with other Malayan political parties in a legal fight for Malaya independence.<ref>Ng, p. 93</ref> Chin described Siao as the CPM's \u2018insurance policy\u2019 in the event the central committee was eliminated.<ref name=\"Chin, p. 351\">Chin, p. 351</ref>\n\nAlthough this was not their decision, Chin and the other central committees decided to join the other Malayan parties, reasoning that the Malay politicians had achieved more for the independence movement within the last few years than the MNLA had since 1948. The Beijing announcement also revealed to the CPM that both the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China had viewed the armed struggle in Malaya as untenable.<ref>Ng, p. 94</ref><ref name=\"Chin, p. 351\"/><ref>Chin and Hack, p. 164</ref>\n\n'''''Baling Talks'''''\n\nOn 24 September 1955, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to negotiate peace. On 17 October, talks between two government representatives and Chin Peng and another central committee of the CPM were held at Klian Intan.<ref>O'Ballance, p. 152</ref> A new \u2018Eight Point Program\u2019 was introduced by the CPM to call for an end to the Emergency and a cessation of hostilities, a reform of Malaya's political system, expand democratic rights, support for world peace, and attention to other matters including education, health, welfare, and industrial production.\n\nOn 28 and 29 December 1955, the negotiations reached its peak at the small northern town of Baling in Kedah. Representatives from the Government were Tunku Abdul Rahman, David Marshall, the Chief Minister of Singapore, and Sir Cheng Lock Tan, the leader of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA). The CPM was represented by Chin Peng, Chen Tian, and Abdul Rashid bin Maidin. The first day of the talks did not go well, as Chin wanted the CPM to be recognised as a legal party again, or for the leaders and members of the MNLA to at least be allowed to regain their freedom of movement and not face any legal persecution or imprisonment.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 97\">Ng, p. 97</ref> Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this request, and demanded at the beginning of the meeting that the CPM fully surrender as the only way to peace, but then promised that those who surrendered would undergo a period of rehabilitation before being allowed to become free citizens again.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 97\"/>\n\nChin again argued freedom of thought and choice must be recognised by the Malayan government if the new nation was to survive past its independence, as the people should have the right to decide which political path the nation should take rather than having that choice be decided by a select few in the government.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 97\"/> Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this as well, and only promised freedom for the CPM members to join any existing political party after being cleared by the authorities.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 97\"/>\n\nOn the second day of talks, Chin asserted that the CPM would cease its hostilities and lay down its arms if the Alliance government could obtain the powers of internal security and defence from the British government.<ref>Cheah, p. 141</ref> Tunku Abdul Rahman accepted it as a challenge and promised that he would push for it on his upcoming trip to London.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 98\">Ng, p. 98</ref> Great publicity was given in the media to this dramatic challenge from Chin Peng. The challenge, indeed, served to strengthen the Alliance government's bargaining position at the London talks. Anxious to end the Emergency, the British government agreed to concede those powers of internal security and defence, and to accede to the demand for independence for Malaya by 31 August 1957, if possible.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 142\">Cheah, p. 142</ref> Chin claimed it was his challenge to Tunku Abdul Rahman that hastened the independence of Malaya.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 142\"/> Tunku Abdul Rahman had acknowledged the importance of the Baling talks, writing in 1974 that \u2018Baling had led straight to Merdeka (Independence).\u2019<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 142\"/>\n\nRegardless, the talks themselves ended without a consensus between the two sides. The talks finally collapsed but were regarded as both a success and failure for Tunku Abdul Rahman, as the talks made the British regard him as a strong leader who was tough on communism. His performance had also impressed the Colonial Office enough to grant Malaya independence. For the CPM, it was a very demoralising affair which nearly destroyed their already ailing struggle.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 98\"/> The failure of the Baling Talks had a great negative impact towards the CPM, accumulated with the lost of hope to either end the war or achieve the advancement of their ideology. Due to the mounting combat casualties plus the lack of stable food supplies, the members started to turn themselves in to the government in return for financial rewards and pardons.<ref>Ng, p. 99</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to resume negotiations. This was rejected by Rahman in a broadcast on 2 April. The MNLA would lose almost 88% of its men, from an approximately 3000-strong army when they first raised arms in mid-1948 to no more than 350 men by late 1958 due to casualties and surrenders.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 100\">Ng, p. 100</ref><ref>Short, p. 493</ref><ref>Chin, p. 403</ref>\n\nIn 1959, the central committees of CPM decided to demobilise their activities and to have the guerrillas reintegrate into society while continuing to promote their communist ideals until such a time when they could once again rise up in revolt.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 100\"/> Chin then moved to south Thailand with the remnants of his forces during the latter part of the Emergency due to pressure from the Malayan security forces, which by 1952 totalled over 32,000 regular troops in Malaya, about three-fifths of whom were Europeans from the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.<ref>Cheah, p. 137</ref>\n\n'''''The Second Insurgency (1968-1989)'''''\n\nIn 1961, members of the CPM central committee such as Chin Peng, Chen Tien, and Lee An Tung moved to Beijing to seek political advice and guidance from the more experienced Chinese Communist Party.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 100\"/> Chin would, however, remain in Beijing for the next 29 years and the party would not lay down its arms until 1989. The reasons for this reversal of the party's decision to disband, according to Chin, was the advice given to him by the Vietnamese communist leaders in Hanoi, the opening of the second \u2018Vietnam War\u2019, which was followed by China's Cultural Revolution, all of which stressed a strong militant line to be taken by Asian communist parties.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 143\">Cheah, p. 143</ref>\n\nWhile in Beijing, Chin Peng was also advised by [[Deng Xiaoping]], to continue the armed struggle in Malaya as Deng felt the time was ripe for revolutions to take place in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 101\">Ng, p. 101</ref> Deng insisted that the military struggle should not only be maintained but stepped up.<ref name=\"Taaffe, 2005\">Taaffe, 2005</ref> Deng even promised financial support to the CPM if they should take up arms once again.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 101\"/> Deng's offer was to remain a secret as the CCP did not wish to let it be known that they had been actively supporting Southeast Asia's communist movements. Chin reluctantly decided to acquiesce to Deng's suggestion. This was also the first time that the CPM had accepted foreign assistance in its struggle and it was with this financial backing that the second armed struggle in Malaya would be launched in 1968.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 101\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, back in Malaya, the Malayan government had declared the Emergency over on 31 July 1960 once they became confident the MNLA had ceased to be a credible threat, with the surviving guerrillas retreating to their sanctuary in southern Thailand.<ref name=\"Ng, p. 101\"/> However, the insurgency continued with the insurgents increasing their attacks, ambushing military convoys, bombing national monuments, and assassinations of marked police officers and political \u2018enemy targets\u2019. The insurgency, which began as a war against the British colonialists, was now transformed into a war against \u2018federalists, compressors capitalists and lackeys of British imperialism\u2019.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 143\"/> The Malayan government maintained a high security alert by devoting one-third of its national budget to defence and internal security needs, and requested British, Australian and New Zealand troops to remain in the country until its internal security and national armed forces could be built up and the foreign troops gradually phased out.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 143\"/>\n\nIn 1970, the CPM's guerrilla bases in Thailand were hard hit by the trials and executions of supposed spies. Two breakaway factions were formed which condemned the purge. Chin, who was then based in China, denied involvement and later rehabilitated his accused comrades.<ref>Chin, p. 466-469, 499</ref> During the 1970s and 1980s, the CPM intensified its activities and clashes with the security forces. These activities were due to a rivalry among three factions in the CPM over party purges and strategies, with each faction trying to outdo the other in militancy and violence.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 148\">Cheah, p. 148</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1980, Deng Xiaoping refocused his priorities back on the Chinese bureaucracy after his return to power in 1978. He welcomed Lee Kuan Yew, the then-Prime Minister of Singapore and its leading political figure since independence from Malaysia, in a visit to Beijing.<ref name=\"Taaffe, 2005\"/> Chin recalled that Deng had not bothered to meet him since then. Finally in December 1980, Deng summoned Chin. In the meeting, Deng demanded Chin to immediately close down all the CPM's radio stations which were broadcasting from China to Malaysia. When Chin asked Deng when he would like him to cease the broadcasting, Deng replied, \u201cThe sooner the better... Lee (Lee Kuan Yew) asked me to stop the broadcasts immediately.\u201d<ref name=\"Taaffe, 2005\"/> Moreover, during his official visit to China, the second Prime Minister of Malaysian government Tun Razak held talks with Chinese communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong and urged him to stop giving aid to the CPM. The fourth Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammad further succeeded in persuading China to downgrade its ties with the CPM. This was an important factor that contributed to the CPM's decision to end its armed struggle.<ref name=\"Cheah, p. 148\"/><ref>Chin, p. 482-483</ref>\n\n'''''The End of the Emergency'''''\n\nThe CPM finally laid down its arms in 1989. The death toll during the armed conflict totalled thousands. Those sympathetic to Chin Peng tend to portray the violence perpetrated by the CPM as defensive, while right-wing opponents tend to portray it as aggressive and unethical. Some have claimed the large number of civilian casualties was in contrast to the stance adopted by Mao Zedong and his policy of the Eight Points of Attention.\n\nOn 2 December 1989, at the town of Hat Yai in Southern Thailand, Chin, Rashid Maidin and Abdullah CD met with representatives of the Malaysian and Thai governments. Separate peace agreements were signed between the MCP and both governments. One of the terms of the agreement was that MCP members of Malayan origin be allowed to return to live in Malaysia.\n\nWhen all hostilities ceased, the total number of CPM members was 1,188; 694 were Thai-born and 494 claimed origins in Peninsular Malaysia. They were given a temporary grant and promised integration into Malaysia.<ref name=\"Taaffe, 2005\"/>\n\nIn Chin's opinion, a peace could have been achieved as early as 1955 during the Baling Talks, if the British, Tunku Abdul Rahman and David Marshall had not demanded that the communist fighters capitulate and surrender but, rather, had allowed them to hand over or destroy their weapons in a mutually agreed way and then resume normal life with full political freedom, which was the broad outcome of the 1989 accords.<ref>Symon, 2003</ref>\n\n=== Application to return to Malaysia ===\nChin never officially returned to Malaysia after the 1989 Hat Yai Peace Accords, but continued his exile in Thailand. He gave lectures at the National University of Singapore in 2004, using purposes of academic research as his reason to gain the visitation permission from the Singaporean government. At the beginning of 2000, he applied for permission to return to [[Malaysia]]. His application was rejected by the High Court on 25 July 2005.\n\nIn June 2008, Chin again lost his bid to return to Malaysia when the Court of Appeal upheld an earlier ruling that compelled him to show identification papers to prove his citizenship. Chin maintained that his birth certificate was seized by the police during a raid in 1948. His counsel [[Raja Aziz Addruse]] had submitted before the Court of Appeal that it was wrong for the Malaysian government to compel him to produce the documents, because he was entitled to enter and live in Malaysia by virtue of the peace agreement.\n\nOn April 2009, Chin's application to return to Malaysia was once again rejected by the High Court for the same reason as his previous attempt. The Malaysian government insisted that his possible return would cause people who lost their loved ones during the Emergency to relive their pain again.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/world/2013/09/130916_world_chen_ping \"Former CPM General Secretary Chen Ping Died in Thailand\"]</ref>\n\nIn November 2009, Chin issued an apology to the victims and their family members for the atrocities committed by the CPM.<ref>[http://www.sinchew.com.my/node/139557 \"Chin Peng apologies on behalf of CPM\"]</ref> However, the then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Muhyiddin Yassin]], replied that despite Chin's apology, he would still not be allowed to return to Malaysia.<ref>\u201cMuhyidin: Government will not change the decision, Chin Peng can't return even if he apologized\u201d [http://www.sinchew.com.my/node/1165778]</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\nChin died at the age of 88 in a Bangkok hospital on the morning of 16 September 2013, the 50th anniversary of Malaysia Day,<ref>[https://archive.is/20130916104141/http://news.sinchew.com.my/topic/node/405309?tid=1166 \"CPM General Secretary Chen Ping Died\"]</ref> and the 90th birthday of Lee Kuan Yew. He was cremated according to Buddhist rites.\n\nWhile Chin had previously voiced wishes to be buried in Sitiawan, his remains continued to be denied entry for burial in Malaysia by the Malaysian government, as it was claimed that the one-year window after the agreement to reapply for citizenship had long lapsed and Chin was assumed to have relinquished his rights to return.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/open-door-to-chin-pengs-ashes-since-malay-terrorists-also-buried-here-says |title=Open door to Chin Peng\u2019s ashes since Malay terrorists also buried here, says MCA |last1=Lim |first1=Ida |last2= |first2= |date=20 September 2013 |work= |publisher=[[The Malay Mail]] |accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Publications about Chin Peng ===\nChin Peng co-authored his story with Singapore-based writers and publishers Ian Ward, who was formerly the Southeast Asia correspondent for the London conservative newspaper, [[The Daily Telegraph]], and Ward's wife Norma Miraflor.

C. Chin and Karl Hack, was published by the Singapore University Press in 2004. This book details a series of meetings held in Australia that Chin Peng had attended with historians and military experts.\n\n== Media portrayal ==\nIn 2006, a documentary film about Chin Peng was made called ''[[The Last Communist]]''. It was banned by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs of Malaysia]].\n\nAnother documentary film about him called ''[[I Love Malaya]]'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|title=I Love Malaya|url=http://ilovemalaya.wordpress.com/}}</ref>\n\n== Chronology ==\n* 22 October 1924: Birth.\n* January 1940: Accepted as probationary member of the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM); put in charge of Communist members in Sitiawan.\n* 4 July 1940: Leaves home.\n* December 1941: Communists' offer of help accepted; joins the fight against the Japanese.\n* 10 January 1942: The first batch of the Malayan Peoples Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA).\n* 1942: Meets future wife, Lee Khoon Wah.\n* 1945: World War II ends.\n* January 1946: Awarded 2 war medals; boycotts tour of British bases; forced to sign letter of apology.\n* Mid-October 1946: In Penang, Yeung Kuo reveals that [[Lai Teck]] has betrayed the CPM; Lai Teck subsequently absconds with most of party's money.\n* 6 March 1947: MCP Central Executive Committee meeting held to deal with Lai Teck controversy; Lai Teck fails to appear and is never seen by MCP again. Later, Chin Peng is elected secretary-general of MCP.\n* 1948: Three planters killed at Sungei Siput; Emergency declared; MCP declared illegal.\n* Late 1950: Briggs arrives in Malaya and implements \"Brigg's plan\" \u2013 resettling people into \"New Villages\". If the people refused to move, the British would forcibly remove them and sometimes burn down their houses. This made it difficult for the Communists to gain food supplies from the \"Min Yuen\", their supporters in the villages.\n* 6 October 1951: Sir [[Henry Gurney]], British High Commissioner in Malaya, is assassinated on Gap road to Fraser's Hill by Siew Ma.  It was a \"chance\" ambush by Siew Ma and his party and not a plan to assassinate Gurney.\n* 7 February 1952: Sir [[Gerald Templer]], arrives to take the place of Gurney, and implements harsh measures against the Communists.\n* 28 December 1955: [[Baling Talks]] held with David Marshall and Tunku Abdul Rahman, unsuccessful because of surrender terms. After the Baling Talks, Chin Peng retires to Thailand. Ah Hai replaces him as acting Secretary-General in Malaya.\n* 1960: The Emergency is officially declared at an end. However, fighting still continues. Special Malaysian government troops going by the name \"[[Senoi Praaq]]\" prove to be a thorn in Chin Peng's side.\n* 2 December 1989: A peace treaty is signed between the communists, Thailand and Malaysia. The long, hard war the British had preferred to term an Emergency was over.\n* 6\u20138 October 2004: Chin Peng visits Singapore for 3 days to speak at the Institute of South-east Asian Studies (ISEAS).\n* 2005: Chin Peng is pending to return to Malaysia. His hearing was scheduled for 25 May 2005, and the High Court postponed it to 25 July 2005. This application was subsequently rejected.\n* June 2008: Chin Peng's lost his bid to return to Malaysia when the Court of Appeal demanded he showed identification papers to prove his Malayan citizenship.\n* 16 September 2013: Chin Peng died at a hospital in Bangkok. He was 88. According to the Bangkok Post, he was pronounced dead at 6.20am (GMT+8).\n\n== References ==\n* \u5289\u9452\u9293\u7b49\u4eba\uff0c\u9752\u5c71\u4e0d\u8001\uff0d\u99ac\u5171\u7684\u6b77\u7a0b\uff0c(2004)\u9999\u6e2f\uff1a\u660e\u5831\u51fa\u7248\u793e {{ISBN|962-8871-28-5}}\n* Cheah, B.

It is a silvery-grey [[metal]] in the [[actinide]] series of the [[periodic table]]. A uranium atom has 92 [[proton]]s and 92 [[electron]]s, of which 6 are [[valence electron]]s. Uranium is weakly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] because all [[isotopes of uranium]] are unstable; the [[half-lives]] of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in [[natural uranium]] are [[uranium-238]] (which has 146 [[neutron]]s and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and [[uranium-235]] (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest [[atomic weight]] of the [[primordial nuclide|primordially]] occurring elements. Its [[density]] is about 70% higher than that of [[lead]], and slightly lower than that of [[gold]] or [[tungsten]]. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few [[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|parts per million]] in soil, rock and water, and is commercially [[uranium mining|extracted]] from uranium-bearing [[mineral]]s such as [[uraninite]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranium|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/uranium|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate= 22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739\u201399.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198\u20130.7202%), and a very small amount of [[uranium-234]] (0.0050\u20130.0059%).<ref>{{cite web|title = Uranium Isotopes|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/u-isotopes.htm|accessdate = 14 March 2012}}</ref> Uranium decays slowly by emitting an [[alpha particle]].

Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring [[fissile]] [[isotope]], which makes it widely used in [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]] so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is [[fertile material|fertile]], meaning it can be [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] to fissile [[plutonium-239]] in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Another fissile isotope, [[uranium-233]], can be produced from natural [[thorium]] and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for [[spontaneous fission]] or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. [[Depleted uranium]] (<sup>238</sup>U) is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s and [[vehicle armour|armor plating]].<ref name=\"BuildingBlocks479\">{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=479}}.</ref> Uranium is used as a colorant in [[uranium glass]], producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early [[photography]].\n\nThe 1789 [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of uranium in the mineral [[uraninite|pitchblende]] is credited to [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], who named the new element after the recently discovered planet [[Uranus]]. [[Eug\u00e8ne-Melchior P\u00e9ligot]] was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]]. Research by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, such as [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in ''[[Little Boy]]'', the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first nuclear weapon used in war]]. An ensuing [[arms race]] during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived [[plutonium-239]]. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)#Dissolution of the USSR|breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/world/20100218/157925732.html \"U.S. to pump money into nuke stockpile, increase security,\"] ''RIA Novosti'' 18 February 2010</ref> See [[Nuclear proliferation]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A neutron-induced nuclear fission event involving uranium-235|alt=A diagram showing a chain transformation of uranium-235 to uranium-236 to barium-141 and krypton-92]]\nWhen [[refining (metallurgy)|refined]], uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive [[metal]].

If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a [[nuclear chain reaction]] occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion.

Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses [[plutonium-239]] derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ([[thermonuclear weapon]]) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of [[tritium]] and [[deuterium]] to undergo [[nuclear fusion]]. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by [[fast neutron]]s from the nuclear fusion process.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm\n |title=Nuclear Weapon Design\n |publisher=Federation of American Scientists\n |date=1998\n |accessdate=19 February 2007\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226091803/https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm\n |archivedate=26 December 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n===Civilian===\n[[File:Nuclear Power Plant 2.jpg|thumb|The most visible civilian use of uranium is as the thermal power source used in [[nuclear power plant]]s.|alt=Photograph featuring sunflowers in front and a plant on the back.

The most common ionic forms are {{chem|U|3+}} (brown-red), {{chem|U|4+}} (green), {{chem|UO|2|+}} (unstable), and {{chem|UO|2|2+}} (yellow), for U(III), U(IV), U(V), and U(VI), respectively.<ref name=\"EncyChem778\">{{Harvnb|Seaborg|1968|p=778}}.</ref> A few [[solid]] and semi-metallic compounds such as UO and US exist for the formal oxidation state uranium(II), but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state.

The {{chem|UO|2|2+}} ion represents the uranium(VI) state and is known to form compounds such as [[uranyl carbonate]], [[uranyl chloride]] and [[uranyl sulfate]]. {{chem|UO|2|2+}} also forms [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]] with various [[organic compound|organic]] [[chelation|chelating]] agents, the most commonly encountered of which is [[uranyl acetate]].<ref name=\"EncyChem778\"/>\n\nUnlike the uranyl salts of uranium and [[polyatomic ion]] uranium-oxide cationic forms, the [[uranate]]s, salts containing a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion, are generally not water-soluble.\n\n====Carbonates====\nThe interactions of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the [[Pourbaix diagram]] to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution. While the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), uranium carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:center\"\n|+[[Pourbaix diagram]]s<ref name=\"medusa\">Puigdomenech, Ignasi ''Hydra/Medusa Chemical Equilibrium Database and Plotting Software'' (2004) KTH Royal Institute of Technology, freely downloadable software at {{cite web |url=http://www.kemi.kth.se/medusa/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929153029/http://www.kemi.kth.se/medusa/ |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n|[[File:Uranium pourdaix diagram in water.png|thumb|center|upright=0.8|alt=A graph of potential vs. pH showing stability regions of various uranium compounds]]\n|[[File:Uranium pourdiax diagram in carbonate media.png|center|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A graph of potential vs. pH showing stability regions of various uranium compounds]]\n|-\n|Uranium in a non-complexing aqueous medium (e.g. [[perchloric acid]]/sodium hydroxide).<ref name=\"medusa\"/>\n|Uranium in carbonate solution\n|-\n|[[File:Uranium fraction diagram with no carbonate.png|thumb|center|alt=A graph of potential vs. pH showing stability regions of various uranium compounds]]\n|[[File:Uranium fraction diagram with carbonate present.png|thumb|center|upright=1.05|alt=A graph of potential vs. pH showing stability regions of various uranium compounds]]\n|-\n|Relative concentrations of the different chemical forms of uranium in a non-complexing aqueous medium (e.g. [[perchloric acid]]/sodium hydroxide).<ref name=\"medusa\"/>\n|Relative concentrations of the different chemical forms of uranium in an aqueous carbonate solution.<ref name=\"medusa\"/>\n|}\n\n====Effects of pH====\nThe uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.\n\nWhen carbonate is added, uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the pH is increased. One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8, a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels.\n\n===Hydrides, carbides and nitrides===\nUranium metal heated to {{convert|250|to|300|C|F}} reacts with [[hydrogen]] to form [[uranium hydride]].

All three are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]], emitting [[alpha particle]]s, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing [[spontaneous fission]]. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when <sup>238</sup>U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another <sup>238</sup>U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when <sup>238</sup>U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to [[neptunium-237]]; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the [[decay chain]] of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that [[thorium-232]] should be able to undergo [[double beta decay]], which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.<ref name=NUBASE>{{NUBASE 2003}}</ref>\n\nUranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium, with a [[half-life]] of about 4.468{{e|9}} years, roughly the [[age of the Earth]]. Uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13{{e|8}} years, and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48{{e|5}} years.<ref name=\"EncyChem777\">{{Harvnb|Seaborg|1968|p=777}}.</ref>\nFor natural uranium, about 49% of its alpha rays are emitted by <sup>238</sup>U, and also 49% by <sup>234</sup>U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the <sup>235</sup>U. When the Earth was young, probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of <sup>234</sup>U was probably much lower than this.\n\nUranium-238 is usually an \u03b1 emitter (occasionally, it undergoes spontaneous fission), decaying through the [[decay chain#Uranium series|uranium series]], which has 18 members, into [[lead#Isotopes|lead-206]], by a variety of different decay paths.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/>\n\nThe [[decay chain]] of <sup>235</sup>U, which is called the [[decay chain#Actinium series|actinium series]], has 15 members and eventually decays into lead-207.<ref name=\"ColumbiaEncy\"/> The constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to [[decay product|daughter elements]] useful in [[radiometric dating]].\n\nUranium-234, which is a member of the uranium series (the decay chain of uranium-238), decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes.\n\nUranium-233 is made from [[thorium#Isotopes|thorium-232]] by neutron bombardment, usually in a nuclear reactor, and <sup>233</sup>U is also fissile.<ref name=\"LANL\"/> Its decay chain forms part of the [[decay chain#Neptunium series|neptunium series]] and ends at [[bismuth-209]] and [[thallium]]-205.\n\nUranium-235 is important for both [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s, because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is [[fissile]].

Indeed, the <sup>238</sup>U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope [[uranium-239]]. <sup>239</sup>U decays by [[beta emission]] to [[neptunium]]-239, also a beta-emitter, that decays in its turn, within a few days into plutonium-239. <sup>239</sup>Pu was used as fissile material in the first [[atomic bomb]] detonated in the \"[[Trinity test]]\" on 15 July 1945 in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"EncyChem773\"/>\n\n===Enrichment===\n{{Main|Enriched uranium}}\n[[File:Gas centrifuge cascade.jpg|thumb|Cascades of [[gas centrifuge]]s are used to enrich uranium ore to concentrate its fissionable isotopes.|alt=A photo of a large hall filled with arrays of long white standing cylinders.]]\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and uranium-235 (0.7204%).

It is a silvery-grey [[metal]] in the [[actinide]] series of the [[periodic table]]. A uranium atom has 92 [[proton]]s and 92 [[electron]]s, of which 6 are [[valence electron]]s. Uranium is weakly [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] because all [[isotopes of uranium]] are unstable; the [[half-lives]] of its naturally occurring isotopes range between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in [[natural uranium]] are [[uranium-238]] (which has 146 [[neutron]]s and accounts for over 99% of uranium on Earth) and [[uranium-235]] (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest [[atomic weight]] of the [[primordial nuclide|primordially]] occurring elements. Its [[density]] is about 70% higher than that of [[lead]], and slightly lower than that of [[gold]] or [[tungsten]]. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few [[Parts-per notation#Parts-per expressions|parts per million]] in soil, rock and water, and is commercially [[uranium mining|extracted]] from uranium-bearing [[mineral]]s such as [[uraninite]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranium|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/uranium|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate= 22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739\u201399.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198\u20130.7202%), and a very small amount of [[uranium-234]] (0.0050\u20130.0059%).<ref>{{cite web|title = Uranium Isotopes|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/u-isotopes.htm|accessdate = 14 March 2012}}</ref> Uranium decays slowly by emitting an [[alpha particle]].

Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring [[fissile]] [[isotope]], which makes it widely used in [[nuclear power plant]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo [[uranium enrichment|enrichment]] so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is [[fertile material|fertile]], meaning it can be [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] to fissile [[plutonium-239]] in a [[nuclear reactor]]. Another fissile isotope, [[uranium-233]], can be produced from natural [[thorium]] and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for [[spontaneous fission]] or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. [[Depleted uranium]] (<sup>238</sup>U) is used in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s and [[vehicle armour|armor plating]].<ref name=\"BuildingBlocks479\">{{Harvnb|Emsley|2001|p=479}}.</ref> Uranium is used as a colorant in [[uranium glass]], producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early [[photography]].\n\nThe 1789 [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery]] of uranium in the mineral [[uraninite|pitchblende]] is credited to [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], who named the new element after the recently discovered planet [[Uranus]]. [[Eug\u00e8ne-Melchior P\u00e9ligot]] was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]]. Research by [[Otto Hahn]], [[Lise Meitner]], [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, such as [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in ''[[Little Boy]]'', the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first nuclear weapon used in war]]. An ensuing [[arms race]] during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived [[plutonium-239]]. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)#Dissolution of the USSR|breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety.<ref>[http://en.rian.ru/world/20100218/157925732.html \"U.S. to pump money into nuke stockpile, increase security,\"] ''RIA Novosti'' 18 February 2010</ref> See [[Nuclear proliferation]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A neutron-induced nuclear fission event involving uranium-235|alt=A diagram showing a chain transformation of uranium-235 to uranium-236 to barium-141 and krypton-92]]\nWhen [[refining (metallurgy)|refined]], uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive [[metal]].

Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 [[isotope]] will most of the time divide into two smaller [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], releasing nuclear [[binding energy]] and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a [[nuclear chain reaction]] occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a [[neutron poison]], absorbing some of the free neutrons.

Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses [[plutonium-239]] derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb ([[thermonuclear weapon]]) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of [[tritium]] and [[deuterium]] to undergo [[nuclear fusion]]. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by [[fast neutron]]s from the nuclear fusion process.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm\n |title=Nuclear Weapon Design\n |publisher=Federation of American Scientists\n |date=1998\n |accessdate=19 February 2007\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226091803/https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm\n |archivedate=26 December 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n===Civilian===\n[[File:Nuclear Power Plant 2.jpg|thumb|The most visible civilian use of uranium is as the thermal power source used in [[nuclear power plant]]s.|alt=Photograph featuring sunflowers in front and a plant on the back.

The channel's programming is devoted completely to the Dodgers, and includes coverage of all Dodgers games not being exclusively televised by MLB's national television partners, along with news, interview, and documentary programming focusing on the team.\n\nThe channel, which launched on February 25, 2014, was the result of a 25-year deal with Time Warner Cable reached in January 2013, valued at $8.35 billion, succeeding [[Fox Sports West]] as the regional rights holder for the team. The channel is one of three regional sports networks owned by Charter Communications serving the Los Angeles region.\n\nUntil April 2020 when AT&T, owner of [[DirecTV]], came to terms with Charter, SportsNet LA reached less than half the Southern California market.  Disputes in negotiations  included the cost of the channel and the requirement that SportsNet LA be carried with other mainstream premium channels rather than in a separate sports tier or on an [[A la carte pay television|\"a la carte\"]] basis.\n\n==History==\n\nIn late 2012, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]' exclusive period for negotiating a new broadcast deal with the Dodgers ended. Reports published at that time indicated that the team was negotiating with other potential broadcasters, such as the recently established [[Time Warner Cable SportsNet (Los Angeles)|Time Warner Cable SportsNet]], and contemplating forming an in-house network with [[Dick Clark Productions]], a television production company recently purchased by the Dodgers' new parent company, [[Guggenheim Partners]].<ref name=forbes-dcdodgers>{{cite web|last=Ozanian|first=Mark|date=December 14, 2012|title=Dodgers Exploring TV Deal With Dick Clark Productions|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2012/12/14/dodgers-exploring-tv-deal-with-dick-clark-productions/|work=Forbes|access-date=December 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn January 22, 2013, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that [[Time Warner Cable]] had signed a deal to partner with the Dodgers to form a new regional sports network, which would be majority-owned by the team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shaikin |first=Bill |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-time-warner-20130122,0,471512.story |title=Dodgers, Time Warner Cable have a deal |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]] |date=January 22, 2013 |access-date=January 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn January 28, the Dodgers and Time Warner Cable signed a 25-year broadcast agreement valued at $8.35 billion,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-dodgers-tv-standoff-20140718-story.html?track=rss#page=1|title = Standoff over Dodgers games could be defining moment in sports TV|last = Flint|first = Joe|date = July 17, 2014|work = Los Angeles Times|access-date = November 2, 2016}}</ref> subject to the approval of Major League Baseball, which would see the establishment of a new channel known as '''SportsNet LA'''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Axisa |first=Mike |url=http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/eye-on-baseball/21620862/dodgers-announce-deal-with-time-warner-launch-of-sportsnet-la |title=Dodgers announce deal with Time Warner, launch of SportsNet LA |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | date=January 28, 2013 | access-date=January 29, 2013}}</ref> The deal ended long-standing broadcast partnerships with Fox Sports West, which had aired Dodgers games on its ''Prime Ticket'' channel since [[1997 MLB season|1997]]; and with [[KCAL-TV]], an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] which had been the Dodgers' over-the-air broadcast television outlet since [[2006 MLB season|2006]]. TWC's winning bid exceeded Fox's bid by $2 billion and was worth $210 million for the inaugural 2014 season or $1.5 million a game. That amount exceeded the revenues from ''Prime Ticket'' and KCAL-TV by more than four times. The agreement increased the number of games aired: nearly 100 games were carried in 2014 compared with the 49 games aired by ''Prime Ticket'' in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the approval of the Dodgers' television deal, the team announced on January 16, 2014, that SportsNet LA would launch on February 25, the eve of [[spring training]], and that all of the Dodgers' spring training games would be televised by the new channel. At least 75 games broadcast by the channel in the 2014 season were simulcast in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; the channel plans to televise all its games in Spanish in the future.

The channel's programming is devoted completely to the Dodgers, and includes coverage of all Dodgers games not being exclusively televised by MLB's national television partners, along with news, interview, and documentary programming focusing on the team.\n\nThe channel, which launched on February 25, 2014, was the result of a 25-year deal with Time Warner Cable reached in January 2013, valued at $8.35 billion, succeeding [[Fox Sports West]] as the regional rights holder for the team. The channel is one of three regional sports networks owned by Charter Communications serving the Los Angeles region.\n\nUntil April 2020 when AT&T, owner of [[DirecTV]] came to terms with Charter, SportsNet LA reached less than half the Southern California market.  Disputes in negotiations  included the cost of the channel and the requirement that SportsNet LA be carried with other mainstream premium channels rather than in a separate sports tier or on an [[A la carte pay television|\"a la carte\"]] basis.\n\n==History==\n\nIn late 2012, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]]' exclusive period for negotiating a new broadcast deal with the Dodgers ended.

TWC's winning bid exceeded Fox's bid by $2 billion and was worth $210 million for the inaugural 2014 season or $1.5 million a game. That amount exceeded the revenues from ''Prime Ticket'' and KCAL-TV by more than four times. The agreement increased the number of games aired: nearly 100 games were carried in 2014 compared with the 49 games aired by ''Prime Ticket'' in 2013.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the approval of the Dodgers' television deal, the team announced on January 16, 2014, that SportsNet LA would launch on February 25, the eve of [[spring training]], and that all of the Dodgers' spring training games would be televised by the new channel. At least 75 games broadcast by the channel in the 2014 season were simulcast in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; the channel plans to televise all its games in Spanish in the future.
