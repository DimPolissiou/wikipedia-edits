Its depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the ''Nautilus'', is regarded as ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's [[submarines]], which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.\n\nA model of the [[French submarine Plongeur|French submarine ''Plongeur'']] (launched in 1863) figured at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], where Jules Verne examined it <ref>Payen, J.

This distinction becomes clearer when the book's French title is correctly translated: rendered literally, it should read \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\u201d (not \u201cSea\u201d).  The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it's later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town just then and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also don [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", i.e, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nThe novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his program of revenge, Nemo \u2014 whom Aronnax dubs an \"archangel of hatred\" \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of shore and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him. Yet he's still drawn to the man, fears that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nevertheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus encounters the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] in the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it is \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under an earlier Polish hero, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]]; Ko\u015bciuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nSix years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It alters the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Thus Nemo's unnamed enemy is converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an East Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his loved ones were slain by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]]. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered [[nautilus]]. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which guided him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe diving gear used by passengers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it's muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later \"re-translations\" continued to recycle its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nHowever, in 1962 Anthony Bonner published a fresh, essentially complete translation of Verne's masterwork for [[Bantam Classics]]. This edition also included a special introduction written by sci-fi celebrity [[Ray Bradbury]] and comparing Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nA significant modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans).

Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nMercier's errors were further corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources along with a new translation, again by Walter James Miller but in collaboration with fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter. The volume was published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] and subtitled \"The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online for readers only.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]].\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}} with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La Isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. Disney's filmscript elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to acquire Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film. Also, Nemo's submarine confines her activities to a defined, circular section of the Pacific Ocean, unlike the movements of the original ''Nautilus''. \n\nFinally, Nemo is again depicted as East Indian in the Soviet 3-episode TV film ''[[Captain Nemo (film)|Captain Nemo]]'' (1975), which also includes some plot details from ''The Mysterious Island''.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* {{annotated link|French corvette Alecton}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea|''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''}}\n{{wikisourcelang|fr|Vingt mille lieues sous les mers|''Vingt mille lieues sous les mers''}}\n{{Commons category|Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n*[http://jv.gilead.org.il/fpwalter ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''], p.d. trans. by F.

This distinction becomes clearer when the book's French title is correctly translated: rendered literally, it should read \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\u201d (not \u201cSea\u201d).  The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it's later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town just then and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also don [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", i.e, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nThe novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his program of revenge, Nemo \u2014 whom Aronnax dubs an \"archangel of hatred\" \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of shore and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him. Yet he's still drawn to the man, fears that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nevertheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus encounters the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] in the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it is \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> As for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisher [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under an earlier Polish hero, [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]]; Ko\u015bciuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nSix years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It alters the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Thus Nemo's unnamed enemy is converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an East Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his loved ones were slain by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]]. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered [[nautilus]]. As noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which guided him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe diving gear used by passengers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it's muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's omitting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, and some later \"re-translations\" continued to recycle its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nHowever, in 1962 Anthony Bonner published a fresh, essentially complete translation of Verne's masterwork for [[Bantam Classics]]. This edition also included a special introduction written by sci-fi celebrity [[Ray Bradbury]] and comparing Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nA significant modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans). ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', [[Washington Square Press]], 1966. Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nMercier's errors were further corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources along with a new translation, again by Walter James Miller but in collaboration with fellow Vernian Frederick Paul Walter. The volume was published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] and subtitled \"The Completely Restored and Annotated Edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online for readers only.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an extensive introduction, textual notes, and bibliography, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]].\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation from the French original, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}}, with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La Isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. Disney's filmscript elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to acquire Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film. Also, Nemo's submarine confines her activities to a defined, circular section of the Pacific Ocean, unlike the movements of the original ''Nautilus''. \n\nFinally, Nemo is again depicted as East Indian in the Soviet 3-episode TV film ''[[Captain Nemo (film)|Captain Nemo]]'' (1975), which also includes some plot details from ''The Mysterious Island''.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Novels}}\n* {{annotated link|French corvette Alecton}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea|''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea''}}\n{{wikisourcelang|fr|Vingt mille lieues sous les mers|''Vingt mille lieues sous les mers''}}\n{{Commons category|Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n*[http://jv.gilead.org.il/fpwalter ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas''], p.d. trans. by F.

Both his parents were very musical and facilitated Em\u012bls's first musical education. His father, being an amateur musician and conductor of a local choir, taught his son to play the piano. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161's attachment to music became stronger after he almost lost his eyesight at the age of 3, as a result of overstraining it while reading. He was also diagnosed allergic to sunlight, so for 5 years he was living in a completely dark room. He could go back to normal life when he was eight. Since then he also was going to school.\n\nD\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 spent his childhood in the country and attended various local schools. During those years he became familiar with the music of [[Beethoven]] and [[Mozart]]. At the age of 16 D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 moved to Riga, where he continued his studies in music and composed his first choral piece \"J\u016bs, kalni, j\u016bs, lejas\" (You, mountains, you, lowlands). This song received favourable mention from the well-known Latvian composer, [[J\u0101zeps V\u012btols]], who had been a pupil of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161's attendance at the 4th Latvian Song Festival in [[Jelgava]] finally strengthened his determination to become a musician.\n\nIn 1897 D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 began study at the [[Moscow Conservatory]], but was forced to leave because of an abrupt sickness. He finally entered [[St Petersburg Conservatory]], in the organ class. Due to financial hardship D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 was forced to give music lessons, yet that was not enough to cover his living expenses. In spring 1901, not having finished his studies, D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 returned to Riga where he started to work as a music critic, teacher, choir conductor and pianist. \"To work for my nation and its art - that will be my motto!\" - he wrote in one letter at that time.\n\nIn November 1903 D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 married Marija Deidere, yet the marriage was not a happy one, partially due to endless material difficulties, also due to the composer's growing addiction to alcohol. The latter was apparently exarcebated by the especially hostile attitude that other Latvian musicians apparently displayed towards him. In 1906 their son [[Volfgangs D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161|Volfgangs]] was born.\n\nIn the beginning of 1908 two orchestral pieces by D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 were performed in Riga, yet these met with fierce negative criticism from other Latvian composers. P. Jurj\u0101ns called him \"a dilettante and a boasting critic\" and even accused him of plagiarism. D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 objected and asked for an independent opinion of an authoritative professor [[Alexander Glazunov]], who found the criticisms unfounded. Yet Jurj\u0101ns had obtained a letter from [[Sibelius]] which apparently supported his biting criticism. Having received this strong moral blow, D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 decided to destroy all his orchestral works. The well known \"Melanholiskais valsis (Melancholy waltz)\" was restored after his death. \n\nAt the end of the same year D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 started work on opera \"Ro\u017eain\u0101s dienas\", which, however, was left unfinished. The composer died on August 31, 1910, in an accident the causes of which are still the subject of controversy. It is believed that he committed suicide by falling under a train.\n\nThe [[Emils Darzins School of Music|Em\u012bls D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161 Music School]] is named after him.\n\n==External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070217034052/http://www.liis.lv/muzika/komponisti/Emils_Darzins/index.php Article in ''Latvian Education Informatization System''] (in Latvian)\n*[http://www.enc-baltija.lv/front/document_data.php?editid=171&search_enabled=T&search_tem=d&page_id=1&order_by=gr_name&Order=asc Article in ''Jaunie\u0161u enciklop\u0113dija \"Baltija\"'']{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in Latvian)\n*{{IMSLP|id=D\u0101rzi\u0146\u0161, Em\u012bls}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darzins, Emils}}\n[[Category:1875 births]]\n[[Category:1910 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Jaunpiebalga Municipality]]\n[[Category:People from the Governorate of Livonia]]\n[[Category:Latvian composers]]\n[[Category:Latvian conductors (music)]]\n[[Category:Latvian music critics]]\n[[Category:Suicides by train]]\n[[Category:Suicides in Latvia]]\n[[Category:Composers who committed suicide]]\n[[Category:Male suicides]]\n", "name_user": "87.110.134.17", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBiography)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em%C4%ABls_D%C4%81rzi%C5%86%C5%A1"}
