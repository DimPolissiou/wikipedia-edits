A medical emergency occurred on the ship while she was en route to Ushuaia, which delayed the ship, so the passengers were flown to Buenos Aires to meet the ship.  The ship sailed from Buenos Aires on 19 October.  On 22 October, the ship entered the port at Puerto Madryn to refuel.  After sitting in port for two days, it was revealed that the fuel could not be obtained because of non-payment by the ship operator, One Ocean Expeditions.  The Antarctic expedition was cancelled and the ship sailed back to Buenos Aires with all her passengers.  Once in Buenos Aires, the passengers disembarked and were left on their own with no reimbursement or compensation.  The ship was subsequently arrested in Buenos Aires for non-payment of debts. <ref>https://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Rcgs-Resolute-9000168.html</ref> <ref>https://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/dates-and-rates</ref>\n\n== Incidents ==\n\n=== 1996 grounding ===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1997 grounding ===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 2005 grounding ===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 2013 drydock fire ===\n\nOn 13 June 2013, the ship was in [[drydock]] at the Bredo Shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany when a fire broke out in the shipyard.

The Venezuelan ship ordered the cruise ship to follow her to Puerto Moreno on Isla De Margarita, located to the east, accusing her of violating the country's territorial waters. Gun shots were fired and, shortly thereafter, the navy vessel approached the starboard side at speed with an angle of 135\u00b0 and purposely collided with ''RCGS Resolute''. The navy vessel continued to ram the starboard bow in an apparent attempt to turn the ship's head towards Venezuelan territorial waters.

A medical emergency occurred on the ship while she was en route to Ushuaia, which delayed the ship, so the passengers were flown to Buenos Aires to meet the ship.  The ship sailed from Buenos Aires on 19 October.  On 22 October, the ship entered the port at Puerto Madryn to refuel.  After sitting in port for two days, it was revealed that the fuel could not be obtained because of non-payment by the ship operator, One Ocean Expeditions.  The Antarctic expedition was cancelled and the ship sailed back to Buenos Aires with all her passengers.  Once in Buenos Aires, the passengers disembarked and were left on their own with no reimbursement or compensation.  The ship was subsequently arrested in Buenos Aires for non-payment of debts. <ref>https://www.vesseltracker.com/en/Ships/Rcgs-Resolute-9000168.html</ref> <ref>https://www.oneoceanexpeditions.com/dates-and-rates</ref>\n\n== Incidents ==\n\n=== 1996 grounding ===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1997 grounding ===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 2005 grounding ===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 2013 drydock fire ===\n\nOn 13 June 2013, the ship was in [[drydock]] at the Bredo Shipyard in [[Bremerhaven]], Germany when a fire broke out in the shipyard.
