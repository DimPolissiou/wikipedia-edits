Both appear primarily in the serial as a married couple between 1990 and 1992. Celestine makes a further guest appearance in 1993, while Etta makes a guest appearance in 1994, both visiting remaining members of the Tavernier family. Celestine is portrayed as a strict disciplinarian and a devout Christian who expects everyone in his family to show similar dedication to the church and abide by his rules. His unwavering demand for respect often alienates his children and almost causes the breakdown of his marriage.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Also religious, Etta is portrayed as a career woman; her most prominent storylines concern marital problems and crises of faith.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nCelestine and Etta were born in [[Trinidad]]. Celestine was raised by his grandmother after his mother died and his father left to find work in [[Jamaica]]. He came to Britain in 1966, recruited by [[London Transport Board|London Transport]], with the intention of studying at evening classes for a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] job. It was a time when most West-Indians were expected to work on the buses or in hospitals and not to be too ambitious. However, he achieved his ambition, conformed and worked hard and eventually got promoted to manager at Walford [[Department of Social Security]] (DSS).\n\nCelestine married  [[Etta Tavernier]] in Jamaica and after the birth of their first son in 1968 she joined Celestine in England, later having two more children. Etta decided to train for a job that she knew she could do well - teaching.\n\n===1990\u20131994===\nCelestine and Etta and their three children, [[Clyde Tavernier|Clyde]] ([[Steven Woodcock]]), the oldest, and twins [[Hattie Tavernier|Hattie]] ([[Michelle Gayle]]) and [[Lloyd Tavernier|Lloyd]] ([[Garey Bridges]]), move to [[Albert Square]] along with Celestine's father [[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules]] ([[Tommy Eytle]]), when they are rehoused by the [[City council|council]] in 1990 after Etta acquires a new job [[Teacher|teaching]] at Walford Primary School.\n\nCelestine is put in an awkward position in 1990 when he discovers that [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]) is working and signing on for dole money at the same time. He eventually decides that he cannot 'turn a blind eye' to Arthur's fraudulent behaviour and turns him in to the authorities at his work, but his self-righteous attitude earns him few friends on the square.\n\nCelestine is unwavering with his expectations of his offspring. He demands respect and adherence at all times, and because of this he finds it extremely difficult to relate to his children, who often feel that his strict rules are harsh and unfair. Celestine has a tempestuous relationship with Clyde in particular. Clyde feels that his father has 'sold out' by accepting the prejudices of his bosses who are slow to promote him, whilst Celestine cannot relate to Clyde's lack of ambition. He is also regularly accused of turning his back on his roots by his father Jules and because Jules never went through Celestine's struggles for acceptance in a white community, he doesn't really understand his son.\n\nCelestine is a dedicated [[Church service|Church]]-goer and spends most of his spare time performing religious readings and educating 'young disciples' in the teachings of the [[Bible]]. Etta is also a devout [[Christians|Christian]] and a dedicated mother, but the big love of her life is teaching, so she is thrilled when she gets promoted to 'acting head' at Walford primary in 1991. However, Celestine blights what should have been a happy time for Etta by continuously arguing with her about her new job. Celestine, is unhappy about Etta's promotion as he feels threatened by her higher status and earning power and believes that she has deliberately set out to undermine his status as the head of the household. The rift between them nearly drives Celestine into the arms of another woman whom he had been [[mentor]]ing in bible studies. The woman, [[Yvonne (EastEnders)|Yvonne]] ([[Pamela Nomvete]]), wants more than friendship from Celestine and propositions him one night following a row with Etta. It is a testing time for Celstine, but the sanctity of marriage is more important to him and he manages to resist the temptation.\n\nTheir marriage is tested again later in 1991 when Etta decides that she wants to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] in order not to pass on her [[Sickle-cell anaemia|Sickle-cell]] [[gene]] to any future children (their youngest son Lloyd has already inherited the gene and his life has been severely limited because of this). Celestine refuses to entertain the idea, however, as he feels that such an act goes against their religious principles. Etta decides to go ahead with the sterilisation anyway, only to discover that she is already [[pregnant]] and that her unborn child is carrying a double dose of the sickle-cell gene. Upon realising this Celestine is forced to reappraise his priorities and to agree, unwillingly, to a [[abortion|termination]]. It is a traumatic time for the Taverniers, but the ordeal eventually manages to bring them closer and they emerge from it a much stronger couple.\n\nIn 1992 Etta is offered a permanent role as [[head teacher]] at Walford primary and Celestine proves that he has learnt from his past mistakes by showing genuine happiness for Etta's success. However, in June of that year Celestine is offered a promotion in [[Norwich]]. Etta is unwilling to move but after Lloyd gets into trouble with the [[police]] for [[Joyride (crime)|joy-riding]], she decides that a fresh start for the family might be best. So the couple leave Walford for a new start.\n\nCelestine returns briefly in July 1993 when he finds out that his daughter is planning on marrying [[Steve Elliot]] ([[Mark Monero]]) and is extremely shocked to find out that she is pregnant. Celestine is also shocked to meet his previously unknown of niece, [[Gidea Thompson]] (Sian Martin), and he is appalled to find out that his father, Jules, had abandoned Gidea's grandmother - who at the time was pregnant with Gidea's mother - many years earlier.\n\nEtta returns briefly in February 1994 to stop Steve (Hattie's ex-boyfriend) from attempting to contact her daughter when he arrives in Norwich and the following week she visits Walford to try to persuade her father-in-law, Jules, to come and live with them following his mugging. Jules declines and says he is happy in the square.\n\n==Creation and development==\nIn the latter part of 1989 ''EastEnders'' acquired a new executive producer named [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], who took over from [[Mike Gibbon]]. Ferguson had previously been a producer on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]'' \u2014 a hard-hitting, gritty and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging ''EastEnders'' in providing a realistic vision of modern life in [[London]].

Colin Brake has described the Taverniers as the major new additions that year, and it heralded the first time that an entire family had joined the serial all at once.

The couple persistently worked hard for their money to ensure that their children had the upbringing and opportunities they themselves had missed out on. Hann and Bich were thrifty and by 2004 were financially stable enough to purchase a \"large\" house with a two-car garage on a residential street in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], a town with a large Asian population.<ref name=LauImmigrantDream/> Bich drove a [[Lexus ES 300]] and Hann drove a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203)]]. They had accumulated [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]200,000 in savings.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer's parents set many goals for their children and had extremely high expectations of them. Jennifer was made to take piano lessons at the age of four, as well as [[figure skating]] classes where she trained most days during the week. She had hopes of becoming an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] figure skating champion until she tore a ligament in her knee. Jennifer attended [[Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School]] where she played the [[flute]] in the school band.<ref name=Revenge/> According to her high school friend Karen K. Ho, Hann was seen as \"the classic [[tiger parenting|tiger dad]],\" and Bich was \"his reluctant accomplice.\" The Pans picked Jennifer up when classes ended each day and monitored her extracurricular activities very closely. They never permitted her to date boys while attending high school, or to attend high school dances or [[prom]]s out of fear that these activities would distract her from her academic commitments. Jennifer was not permitted to attend any parties while her parents believed that she was attending university. At the age of 22, \"she had never gone to a club, been drunk, visited a friend's cottage or gone on vacation without her family.\"<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer and her friends reportedly regarded this upbringing as restrictive and greatly oppressive.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nDespite her parents' high expectations and the fact that Jennifer had received good grades in lower school, throughout high school her grades were somewhat average (in the 70% range) except for music. Multiple times, she forged [[report card]]s using false templates to show her parents that she had received straight As when she had not. When Jennifer failed calculus class in her senior year of high school, [[Ryerson University]] rescinded her early admission. As she could not bear to be perceived as a failure, she began to lie to those she knew, including her parents, and pretended she was attending university. Instead, she sat in caf\u00e9s, taught as a piano instructor and worked in a restaurant to earn money. In order to maintain the charade, Jennifer told her parents she had won scholarships, later falsely claiming that she had accepted an offer into the pharmacology program at the [[University of Toronto]]. She went to the extent of purchasing second-hand textbooks and watching videos related to pharmacology in order to create notebooks full of purported class notes that she could show her parents. Jennifer also requested permission from her parents to stay near the campus with a friend throughout the week.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer was actually staying with her boyfriend,<ref name=Revenge/> Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong,{{#tag:ref|''Daniel Chi-Kwong Wong'': {{zh|first=t,j|t=\u9ec3\u5fd7\u5149|s=\u9ec4\u5fd7\u5149|j=wong4 zi3 gwong1|p=Hu\u00e1ng Zh\u00ecgu\u0101ng|labels=no}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2014-05-10/city1399706077d5044769.html|title=\u7537\u53cb\u7206\u6f58\u5973\u66fe\u906d5\u6f22\u6027\u4fb5 \u8072\u7a31\u6536\u8b66\u544a\u77ed\u8a0a \u77e2\u53e3\u5426\u8a8d\u6d89\u6848|work=[[Sing Tao Daily]]|date=2014-05-10|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref>|group=note}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/4th-arrest-in-markham-home-invasion-homicide-1.1038532|agency=[[The Canadian Press]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|title=4th arrest in Markham home invasion homicide|date=2011-04-26|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref> a high school sweetheart whom her parents knew nothing about.<ref name=Revenge/><ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> Wong was of mixed Chinese and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ancestry,<ref name=\"BrownChineseCubs\">{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Vanessa|title=When Chinese cubs turn on their Tiger Parents|url=http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/when-chinese-cubs-turn-on-their-tiger-parents/news-story/36ad884522b2d22ba1e2f88faa5d72ab|accessdate=9 January 2017|work=News.com.au|date=11 December 2016}}</ref><ref>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.es/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT31 PT 31]: \"[...]commenting on the fact that he was only half Chinese. \"[...]you're [part] Filipino.\"\"</ref> resided in [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]],<ref name=GillisWendyFifth>{{cite news|author=Gillis, Wendy|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2011/05/04/fifth_suspect_arrested_in_deadly_markham_home_invasion.html|title=Fifth suspect arrested in deadly Markham home invasion |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=May 4, 2011|accessdate=September 18, 2018}}</ref> and worked at a [[Boston Pizza]] restaurant.<ref name=GrimaldiPT90>Grimaldi, {{ISBN|1459735269}}, 9781459735262, [https://books.google.cz/books?id=zomGCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT90 PT 90]. \"Daniel Wong is arrested at work in front of his colleagues at Boston Pizza on April 26, 2011.\"</ref> Wong, once a student at Mary Ward, transferred to [[Cardinal Carter Academy]] in North York, Toronto due to low grades<!--\"he was falling behind\"-->, and later studied at [[York University]].<ref name=Revenge/> He was an active [[marijuana]] dealer.<ref name=Revenge/><!--\"he had been charged with trafficking after cops found half a pound of weed in his car.\"--><ref name=Dimannoastonishing>{{cite news|last=Dimanno|first=Rosie|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2014/09/15/the_fantastic_testimony_of_jennifer_pan.html|title=The astonishing testimony of Jennifer Pan|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=September 25, 2018|quote=Seven years until Wong \u2014 Pan says he was the one who put her in touch with \u201cHomeboy,\u201d a man he knew through his marijuana dealing}}</ref>\n\n==Adult life==\nWhile pretending to complete her degree at the University of Toronto, Jennifer told her parents that she had started working as a volunteer at Toronto's [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]], known as Sick Kids. Hann and Bich soon became suspicious when they realized she did not have a hospital ID badge or uniform. On one occasion, Bich followed her daughter to \"work\" and quickly discovered her deception. In a state of shock, Hann wanted to throw Jennifer out of the house, but her mother persuaded him to allow her to stay. As she had not completed high school due to failing calculus, she eventually began working to finish high school completely and was later encouraged by her parents to apply to university. She was, however, forbidden to contact Wong or to go anywhere except to her piano-teaching job. Nevertheless, she and Wong spoke clandestinely during this period.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nBy the time that Jennifer was 24, Wong had grown weary of trying to pursue a relationship with Jennifer. As she was so daunted and restricted by her parents that she lived at home and only met him in secret, Wong began to date another young woman whom he soon fell in love with.<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer quickly invented a new story and told Wong that a man had entered her house, showing what appeared to be a police badge. She then told him that several men had rushed in and [[gang rape]]d her. After this, Jennifer insisted that a bullet was mailed to her, telling Wong that it was sent from his new girlfriend.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\n==Murder==\nIn Spring 2010, Jennifer was in contact with Andrew Montemayor, a high school friend who, she claims, had boasted in their high school years about robbing people at knife point, an assertion denied by Montemayor. Montemayor introduced her to Ricardo Duncan, a \"[[Goth subculture|goth]] kid\" whom Pan gave $1,500 to [[contract killing|kill her father]] in the parking lot at his workplace. Duncan says that she once gave him $200 for a night out, but that he returned it, and that he rebuffed her when she asked him to kill her parents.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer and Wong were back in contact at this time and according to the police, came up with a plan to hire a professional [[hitman]] for $10,000 to kill her parents, calculating that she would then inherit $500,000.

The couple persistently worked hard for their money to ensure that their children had the upbringing and opportunities they themselves had missed out on. Hann and Bich were thrifty and by 2004 were financially stable enough to purchase a \"large\" house with a two-car garage on a residential street in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], a town with a large Asian population.<ref name=LauImmigrantDream/> Bich drove a [[Lexus ES 300]] and Hann drove a [[Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W203)]]. They had accumulated [[Canadian dollar|CAD$]]200,000 in savings.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer's parents set many goals for their children and had extremely high expectations of them. Jennifer was made to take piano lessons at the age of four, as well as [[figure skating]] classes where she trained most days during the week. She had hopes of becoming an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] figure skating champion until she tore a ligament in her knee. Jennifer attended [[Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School]] where she played the [[flute]] in the school band.<ref name=Revenge/> According to her high school friend Karen K. Ho, Hann was seen as \"the classic [[tiger parenting|tiger dad]],\" and Bich was \"his reluctant accomplice.\" The Pans picked Jennifer up when classes ended each day and monitored her extracurricular activities very closely. They never permitted her to date boys while attending high school, or to attend high school dances or [[prom]]s out of fear that these activities would distract her from her academic commitments. Jennifer was not permitted to attend any parties while her parents believed that she was attending university. At the age of 22, \"she had never gone to a club, been drunk, visited a friend's cottage or gone on vacation without her family.\"<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer and her friends reportedly regarded this upbringing as restrictive and greatly oppressive.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nDespite her parents' high expectations and the fact that Jennifer had received good grades in lower school, throughout high school her grades were somewhat average (in the 70% range) except for music. Multiple times, she forged [[report card]]s using false templates to show her parents that she had received straight As when she had not. When Jennifer failed calculus class in her senior year of high school, [[Ryerson University]] rescinded her early admission. As she could not bear to be perceived as a failure, she began to lie to those she knew, including her parents, and pretended she was attending university. Instead, she sat in caf\u00e9s, taught as a piano instructor and worked in a restaurant to earn money. In order to maintain the charade, Jennifer told her parents she had won scholarships, later falsely claiming that she had accepted an offer into the pharmacology program at the [[University of Toronto]]. She went to the extent of purchasing second-hand textbooks and watching videos related to pharmacology in order to create notebooks full of purported class notes that she could show her parents.

Hann and Bich soon became suspicious when they realized she did not have a hospital ID badge or uniform. On one occasion, Bich followed her daughter to \"work\" and quickly discovered her deception. In a state of shock, Hann wanted to throw Jennifer out of the house, but her mother persuaded him to allow her to stay. As she had not completed high school due to failing calculus, she eventually began working to finish high school completely and was later encouraged by her parents to apply to university. She was, however, forbidden to contact Wong or to go anywhere except to her piano-teaching job. Nevertheless, she and Wong spoke clandestinely during this period.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nBy the time that Jennifer was 24, Wong had grown weary of trying to pursue a relationship with Jennifer. As she was so daunted and restricted by her parents that she lived at home and only met him in secret, Wong began to date another young woman whom he soon fell in love with.<ref name=Revenge/> Jennifer quickly invented a new story and told Wong that a man had entered her house, showing what appeared to be a police badge. She then told him that several men had rushed in and [[gang rape]]d her. After this, Jennifer insisted that a bullet was mailed to her, telling Wong that it was sent from his new girlfriend.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\n==Murder==\nIn Spring 2010, Jennifer was in contact with Andrew Montemayor, a high school friend who, she claims, had boasted in their high school years about robbing people at knife point, an assertion denied by Montemayor. Montemayor introduced her to Ricardo Duncan, a \"[[Goth subculture|goth]] kid\" whom Pan gave $1,500 to [[contract killing|kill her father]] in the parking lot at his workplace. Duncan says that she once gave him $200 for a night out, but that he returned it, and that he rebuffed her when she asked him to kill her parents.<ref name=Revenge/>\n\nJennifer and Wong were back in contact at this time and according to the police, came up with a plan to hire a professional [[hitman]] for $10,000 to kill her parents, calculating that she would then inherit $500,000.

It lies on the northern rim of the Vale of Pewsey, and is near two other Neolithic sites: [[Adam's Grave]], a chambered [[long barrow]] less than a mile to the west, and [[Rybury]], another causewayed enclosure, two miles beyond Adam's Grave.  The hilltop contains a smaller banked enclosure next to the Neolithic site, which appears to have been occupied from just before the arrival of the Romans until Saxon times.  This second enclosure was also briefly occupied during the 17th century, perhaps by shepherds.  Two barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it.  A Saxon sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.\n\nThe site is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified.  Benjamin and Maud Cunnington spent two summers investigating the site, in 1908 and 1909, and Maud Cunnington published two reports of their work, noting that there were multiple gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure.  In the late 1920s, after the excavation of [[Windmill Hill]] among other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the neolithic period.  Originally they were thought to have been inhabited, and so were called \"causewayed camps\", but that name has fallen out of use.  About seventy causewayed enclosures have now been found in Britain, and about a thousand in all in Europe.\n\nThe site was excavated again in 1961 by Graham Connah, who found a later burial in one of the ditches.  Connah kept excellent stratigraphic documentation of his finds, and this was taken advantage of by the Gathering Time project, which in 2011 published an analysis of radiocarbon dates from almost forty British causewayed enclosures.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch was filled by between 3525 and 3220 BC.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Knap Hill area from OS map 1961.png|thumb|upright=3|Area around Knap Hill in Wiltshire]]\nThe main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]],<ref>Oswald et al.

There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.<ref>Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>  They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since the land may have had to be cleared which would have required substantial labour.<ref>Andersen (2019), p. 807.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Cecil Curwen identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.<ref>Curwen (1930).</ref><ref name=\":8\">Oswald et al.

The western barrow was about two feet high, with a small ditch around it.  Near the top of the barrow Thurman found animal bones, which he described as \"of a sheep and perhaps other ruminants\", and commented in his account that this was consistent with other barrows in Wiltshire, which often contained animal bones near the surface of the barrow.  He speculated that they were probably from a sacrifice or feast over the graves.  Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk, two feet deep and two feet across.  It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones. The barrow outside the enclosure, which lay to the southwest, was about a foot high and Thurnam found nothing there but some animal bones near the surface.<ref name=\":11\">Thurnam (1860), pp. 326\u2013327.</ref><ref name=\":10\">Cunnington (1912), p. 43.</ref>\n\n=== Benjamin and Maud Cunnington, 1908-9 ===\nThe Neolithic enclosure was first excavated by [[Maud Cunnington|Maud]] and [[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin Cunnington]], in the summers of 1908 and 1909.  ODB 12.  The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

The only human bone found was a small jaw bone with worn teeth.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 60\u201361.</ref>  The pottery was coarse, with flint inclusions, and was found associated with flint flakes, leading Maud Cunnington to suggest that the people who used the pottery may have been Neolithic, though she concluded that the inability to tell undecorated pottery of the [[Bronze Age]] and Neolithic periods apart meant that it was not possible to confidently assign a period.<ref name=\":15\">Cunnington (1912), p. 50.</ref><ref name=\":14\">Cunnington (1912), pp. 56\u201357.</ref>  The Cunningtons found several [[flint-knapping]] clusters, including one group of seventy-two flint chips six foot deep in the ditch.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 61-62.</ref><ref name=\":18\">Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 97-98.</ref>\n\nIt was clear to Cunnington that the plateau enclosure was much more recent than the old enclosure, since the plateau enclosure's southwestern ditch was dug through the old enclosure's ditch, which had silted up almost completely by that time.  Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to be no earlier than the early [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":14\" />  The ditch and low rampart that surrounded the enclosure were mostly undetectable on the surface; Cunnington cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path.<ref name=\":12\" />  A gap was also found in the plateau enclosure ditch at the southwestern edge, where it overlapped with the old enclosure, but Cunnington could not tell what the gap was for\u2014an entrance was implausible as the bank was very steep at that point.<ref name=\":15\" />  The pottery found in the plateau ditch and bank was of much better quality than the coarse Neolithic pottery associated with the old enclosure: it included [[bead-rim pottery]] which Cunnington dated to just before, or during the early years of, the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n[[File:Knap Hill Saxon sword.png|left|thumb|upright=2|Saxon sword found in the plateau enclosure by the Cunningtons]]\nWithin the plateau enclosure was a long bank, running from southwest to northeast, with a circular mound at the northeastern end.  Cunnington found pottery sherds in the long bank that she dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, marked P.P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about 2 feet deep, and 3 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353.</ref>  A 6th-century [[Saxons|Saxon]] iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound. A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman.  Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais) ; this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a quern, damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery.  Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a catastrophic end to the inhabitation of the enclosure.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 52\u201354.</ref>\n\nBetween the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), 23 feet by 13 1/2 feet, with walls made of blocks of chalk.  Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy.  The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the relics at different levels.  The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the wals and under the foundations.  It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but Cunnington found no other evidence that would help determine its date.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Cunnington speculated that the skeleton had been placed so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nTwo low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from the fourth causeway, counting clockwise from the left of the plan.  The one to the east was known locally as \"The Devil's Trackway\".  The western bank led for fifty yards towards an old track across the hill.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== C.W. Phillips, 1939 ===\nIn 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a [[bowl barrow]] outside the enclosure, but never published a report.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by [[Leslie Grinsell]], published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13.  Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds would have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.  Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Graham Connah, 1961 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill map RHCM Connah 1961.png|thumb|upright=4|Knap Hill site, showing trenches from the 1961 excavation]]\nIn 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by [[Graham Connah]].<ref name=\":4\" />  Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.<ref>Connah (1965), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>  Like Cunnington, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings.<ref name=\":18\" />  Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912.  Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint [[Temper (pottery)|inclusions]], but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least 20 miles away.  Similar combinations of finds had been reported at [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]], [[Robin Hood's Ball]], and [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]].<ref name=\":5\">Connah (1965), p. 11.</ref>  Connah classified the pottery from the ditches as [[Windmill Hill ware]],<ref name=\":5\" /> a classification current in the 1960s that attempted to identify individual cultures within the Neolithic, but since overturned in favour of separating Neolithic sites into Early and Late Neolithic.<ref>Pouncett (2008), p. 37.</ref>  In addition to the Windmill Hill ware, fragments from seven or eight pots of [[Beaker ware]] were found.  Connah also found some Romano-British pottery in his cuttings, including four [[Samian ware|Samian]] sherds, one of which could be dated to the late 1st century AD.  Some later medieval pottery fragments could not be accurately dated.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 12.</ref><ref>Connah (1965), p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch.  Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them.  Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman-British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 7.</ref>  The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about 5 feet 2 inches tall.  She suffered from osteo-arthritis, and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \"most probably suffered agonies\".<ref>Connah (1965). pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nConnah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of the fourth causeway found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank.  Neither ditch was noticed by the Cunningtons.  Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Gathering Time, 2011 ===\nIn 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].  Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project.  Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again.  Five other samples drawn from Connah's finds were also radiocarbon dated, as Connah's stratigraphic recording was precise enough to make it possible to identify samples which had good association with the building of the enclosure.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch was filled by between 3525 and 3220 BC.<ref>Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 99-102.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=notes/>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{Cite book|last=Andersen|first=Niels H.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-883249-2|editor-last=Fowler|editor-first=Chris|location=Oxford|pages=795-812|chapter=Causewayed Enclosures in Northern and Western Europe|orig-year=2015|editor-last2=Harding|editor-first2=Jan|editor-last3=Hofmann|editor-first3=Daniela}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|date=1969|title=Radiocarbon dating for Knap Hill|journal=Antiquity|volume=43|pages=304-305|via=|issue=172|url=|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|last2=Smith|first2=I.F.|date=1965|title=Excavations at Knap Hill, Alton Priors|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/138882#page/7/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=60|pages=1\u201323|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Crawford|first=O.G.S.|title=Archaeology in the Field|publisher=Phoenix House|year=1960|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1953}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|year=1909|title=On a remarkable feature in the entrenchments of Knap Hill Camp, Wiltshire|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2839810|journal=Man|volume=9|pages=49\u201352|doi=10.2307/2839810}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|date=1912|title=Knap Hill Camp|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132441#page/68/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=37|pages=42-65|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Curwen|first=E.

It lies on the northern rim of the Vale of Pewsey, and is near two other Neolithic sites: [[Adam's Grave]], a chambered [[long barrow]] less than a mile to the west, and [[Rybury]], another causewayed enclosure, two miles beyond Adam's Grave.  The hilltop contains a smaller banked enclosure next to the Neolithic site, which appears to have been occupied from just before the arrival of the Romans until Saxon times.  This second enclosure was also briefly occupied during the 17th century, perhaps by shepherds.  Two barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it.  A Saxon sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.\n\nThe site is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified.  Benjamin and Maud Cunnington spent two summers investigating the site, in 1908 and 1909, and Maud Cunnington published two reports of their work, noting that there were multiple gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure.  In the late 1920s, after the excavation of Windmill Hill among other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the neolithic period.  Originally they were thought to have been inhabited, and so were called \"causewayed camps\", but that name has fallen out of use.  About seventy causewayed enclosures have now been found in Britain, and about a thousand in all in Europe.\n\nThe site was excavated again in 1961 by Graham Connah, who found a later burial in one of the ditches.  Connah kept excellent stratigraphic documentation of his finds, and this was taken advantage of by the Gathering Time project, which in 2011 published an analysis of radiocarbon dates from almost forty British causewayed enclosures.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch was filled by between 3525 and 3220 BC.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Knap Hill area from OS map 1961.png|thumb|upright=3|Area around Knap Hill in Wiltshire]]\nThe main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]],<ref>Oswald et al.

(2001), p. 3.</ref>  They are characterized by a full or partial enclosure of an area with segmented ditches, often with earthworks and palisades in some combination.<ref name=\":3\" />  The use to which these enclosures has long been a matter of debate.  They may have seen use as settlements, with early investigators suggesting that the inhabitants lived in the ditches, though this idea was later abandoned in favour of any settlement being within the enclosure boundaries.<ref name=\":7\">Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), p. 5.</ref>  In the report on the excavation at Knap Hill it was assumed that the ramparts were a form of defence.<ref name=\":6\">Cunnington (1912), p.48.</ref> The causeways were difficult to explain in military terms, though it was suggested they could have been sally ports for defenders to emerge from and attack a besieging force;<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Curwen (1930), p. 50.</ref> evidence of attacks at some sites provided support for the idea that the enclosures were fortified settlements.<ref name=\":7\" /> They may have been seasonal meeting places, used for trading cattle or other goods such as pottery, and if they were a focus for the local people, they may have been evidence of a local hierarchy with a tribal chief.  There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.<ref>Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>  They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since the land may have had to be cleared which would have required substantial labour.<ref>Andersen (2019), p. 807.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Cecil Curwen identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.<ref>Curwen (1930).</ref><ref name=\":8\">Oswald et al.

Near the top of the barrow Thurman found animal bones, which he described as \"of a sheep and perhaps other ruminants\", and commented in his account that this was consistent with other barrows in Wiltshire, which often contained animal bones near the surface of the barrow.  He speculated that they were probably from a sacrifice or feast over the graves.  Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk, two feet deep and two feet across.  It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones. The barrow outside the enclosure, which lay to the southwest, was about a foot high and Thurnam found nothing there but some animal bones near the surface.<ref name=\":11\">Thurnam (1860), pp. 326\u2013327.</ref><ref name=\":10\">Cunnington (1912), p. 43.</ref>\n\n=== Benjamin and Maud Cunnington, 1908-9 ===\nThe Neolithic enclosure was first excavated by [[Maud Cunnington|Maud]] and [[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin Cunnington]], in the summers of 1908 and 1909.  ODB 12.  The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

They also made cuttings along the southern edge of the hilltop to determine if a ditch existed there which was no longer visible on the surface, and found two short ditch sections at the eastern corner (marked S\u2013S on the plan).<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 59\u201360.</ref>  Most of the relics obtained from the ditches of the old enclosure were found in clusters, and were usually within a foot of the bottom; they included some sherds of pottery, flint flakes and burnt flints, fragments of animal bones, and pieces of sarsen stone.  The only human bone found was a small jaw bone with worn teeth.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 60\u201361.</ref>  The pottery was coarse, with flint inclusions, and was found associated with flint flakes, leading Maud Cunnington to suggest that the people who used the pottery may have been Neolithic, though she concluded that the inability to tell undecorated pottery of the [[Bronze Age]] and Neolithic periods apart meant that it was not possible to confidently assign a period.<ref name=\":15\">Cunnington (1912), p. 50.</ref><ref name=\":14\">Cunnington (1912), pp. 56\u201357.</ref>  The Cunningtons found several [[flint-knapping]] clusters, including one group of seventy-two flint chips six foot deep in the ditch.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 61-62.</ref><ref name=\":18\">Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 97-98.</ref>\n\nIt was clear to Cunnington that the plateau enclosure was much more recent than the old enclosure, since the plateau enclosure's southwestern ditch was dug through the old enclosure's ditch, which had silted up almost completely by that time.  Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to be no earlier than the early [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":14\" />  The ditch and low rampart that surrounded the enclosure were mostly undetectable on the surface; Cunnington cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path.<ref name=\":12\" />  A gap was also found in the plateau enclosure ditch at the southwestern edge, where it overlapped with the old enclosure, but Cunnington could not tell what the gap was for\u2014an entrance was implausible as the bank was very steep at that point.<ref name=\":15\" />  The pottery found in the plateau ditch and bank was of much better quality than the coarse Neolithic pottery associated with the old enclosure: it included [[bead-rim pottery]] which Cunnington dated to just before, or during the early years of, the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n[[File:Knap Hill Saxon sword.png|left|thumb|upright=2|Saxon sword found in the plateau enclosure by the Cunningtons]]\nWithin the plateau enclosure was a long bank, running from southwest to northeast, with a circular mound at the northeastern end.  Cunnington found pottery sherds in the long bank that she dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, marked P.P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about 2 feet deep, and 3 1/2 to 4 feet in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353.</ref>  A 6th-century [[Saxons|Saxon]] iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound. A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman.  Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais) ; this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a quern, damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery.  Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a catastrophic end to the inhabitation of the enclosure.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 52\u201354.</ref>\n\nBetween the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), 23 feet by 13 1/2 feet, with walls made of blocks of chalk.  Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy.  The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the relics at different levels.  The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the wals and under the foundations.  It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but Cunnington found no other evidence that would help determine its date.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Cunnington speculated that the skeleton had been placed so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nTwo low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from the fourth causeway, counting clockwise from the left of the plan.  The one to the east was known locally as \"The Devil's Trackway\".  The western bank led for fifty yards towards an old track across the hill.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== C.W. Phillips, 1939 ===\nIn 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a [[bowl barrow]] outside the enclosure, but never published a report.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by [[Leslie Grinsell]], published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13.  Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds would have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.  Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Graham Connah, 1961 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill map RHCM Connah 1961.png|thumb|upright=4|Knap Hill site, showing trenches from the 1961 excavation]]\nIn 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by [[Graham Connah]].<ref name=\":4\" />  Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.<ref>Connah (1965), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>  Like Cunnington, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings.<ref name=\":18\" />  Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912.  Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint [[Temper (pottery)|inclusions]], but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least 20 miles away.  Similar combinations of finds had been reported at [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]], [[Robin Hood's Ball]], and [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]].<ref name=\":5\">Connah (1965), p. 11.</ref>  Connah classified the pottery from the ditches as [[Windmill Hill ware]],<ref name=\":5\" /> a classification current in the 1960s that attempted to identify individual cultures within the Neolithic, but since overturned in favour of separating Neolithic sites into Early and Late Neolithic.<ref>Pouncett (2008), p. 37.</ref>  In addition to the Windmill Hill ware, fragments from seven or eight pots of [[Beaker ware]] were found.  Connah also found some Romano-British pottery in his cuttings, including four [[Samian ware|Samian]] sherds, one of which could be dated to the late 1st century AD.  Some later medieval pottery fragments could not be accurately dated.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 12.</ref><ref>Connah (1965), p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch.  Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them.  Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman-British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 7.</ref>  The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about 5 feet 2 inches tall.  She suffered from osteo-arthritis, and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \"most probably suffered agonies\".<ref>Connah (1965). pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nConnah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of the fourth causeway found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank.  Neither ditch was noticed by the Cunningtons.  Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Gathering Time, 2011 ===\nIn 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].  Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project.  Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again.  Five other samples drawn from Connah's finds were also radiocarbon dated, as Connah's stratigraphic recording was precise enough to make it possible to identify samples which had good association with the building of the enclosure.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch was filled by between 3525 and 3220 BC.<ref>Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 99-102.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=notes/>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{Cite book|last=Andersen|first=Niels H.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-883249-2|editor-last=Fowler|editor-first=Chris|location=Oxford|pages=795-812|chapter=Causewayed Enclosures in Northern and Western Europe|orig-year=2015|editor-last2=Harding|editor-first2=Jan|editor-last3=Hofmann|editor-first3=Daniela}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|date=1969|title=Radiocarbon dating for Knap Hill|journal=Antiquity|volume=43|pages=304-305|via=|issue=172|url=|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|last2=Smith|first2=I.F.|date=1965|title=Excavations at Knap Hill, Alton Priors|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/138882#page/7/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=60|pages=1\u201323|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Crawford|first=O.G.S.|title=Archaeology in the Field|publisher=Phoenix House|year=1960|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1953}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|year=1909|title=On a remarkable feature in the entrenchments of Knap Hill Camp, Wiltshire|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2839810|journal=Man|volume=9|pages=49\u201352|doi=10.2307/2839810}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|date=1912|title=Knap Hill Camp|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132441#page/68/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=37|pages=42-65|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Curwen|first=E.

Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was ''Malmhaug'' (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\n\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the [[\u00d8resund]], with the German [[Hanseatic League]] frequenting it as a [[marketplace]], and was notable for its flourishing [[herring]] fishery. In 1437, King [[Eric of Pomerania]] (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: [[argent]] with a [[griffin]] [[gules]], based on Eric's arms from [[Pomerania]]. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of [[Scania]] from 1660.\n\nIn 1434, a new [[citadel]] was constructed at the beach south of the town. This [[fortress]], known today as [[Malm\u00f6 Castle|''Malm\u00f6hus'']], did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only ''Malm\u00f6hus'' remains.\n\n[[File:Malm\u00f6 city 1580.png|thumb|left|Malm\u00f6 in 1580: [[Malm\u00f6 Castle]] can be seen at far left, [[Sankt Petri Church, Malm\u00f6|Sankt Petri Church]]'s tower at center]]\n[[Lutheran]] teachings spread during the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]], and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\n\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (''[[Sk\u00e5neland]]'') came under control of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\n\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to [[bubonic plague]] epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Vart-Malmo/Vart-Malmo-artiklar/2011-02-20-Sa-har-Malmo-vuxit-genom-aren.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101064647/http://malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Vart-Malmo/Vart-Malmo-artiklar/2011-02-20-Sa-har-Malmo-vuxit-genom-aren.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 January 2016 |title=S\u00e5 har Malm\u00f6 vuxit genom \u00e5ren |publisher=[[Malm\u00f6 Municipality]] |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2015 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sodergatan-1913.jpg|thumb|left|''S\u00f6dergatan'' in 1913]]\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the [[Kockums]] shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The [[Southern Main Line]] was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n===1900\u20131969===\n[[File:Meeting of Scandinavian kings 2.jpeg|thumb|right|Malm\u00f6, 18 December 1914. All three Scandinavian Kings on the same balcony.]]\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the [[Baltic Exhibition]]. The large park [[Pildammsparken]] was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of [[World War I]].\n\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the ''Three Kings Meeting'' was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the [[Swedish-Norwegian Union]], King [[Oscar II]] was replaced with King [[H\u00e5kon VII]] in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King [[Christian X]]. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son [[Gustav V]] became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\n\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with [[association football|football]]. [[IFK Malm\u00f6]] participated in the first ever edition of [[Allsvenskan]] 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n===1970s and later===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} ([[Svedala]] was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\n\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a [[recession]] that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of [[Scania]]. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as [[Vellinge Municipality]], [[Lomma Municipality]] and [[Staffanstorp Municipality]], which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor [[Ilmar Reepalu]], the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive [[\u00d6resund Bridge]] road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new [[Malm\u00f6 University]] opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition ([[Bo01]]) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\n\nSince 1974, the [[Kockums Crane]] had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of [[Turning Torso]], the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\n\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, [[Police in Sweden]] placed the [[Roseng\u00e5rd]] and the [[S\u00f6dra Sofielund|S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved]] district in the [[Vulnerable area#Especially vulnerable area|most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates]].<ref name=\"map_noa_utsatta_2015_p29\">{{Cite book|url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|title=Utsatta omr\u00e5den \u2013 sociala risker, kollektiv f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga och o\u00f6nskade h\u00e4ndelser|publisher=Police in Sweden \u2013 Nationella Operativa Avdelningen \u2013 December 2015|page=29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819054415/https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%C3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"map_noa_utsatta_2017_p41\">{{cite book|title=Utsatta omr\u00e5den \u2013 Social ordning, kriminell struktur och utmaningar f\u00f6r polisen / Dnr HD 44/14A203.023/2016|date=June 2017|publisher=[[Police in Sweden]] \u2013 Nationella operativa avdelningen \u2013 Underr\u00e4ttelseenheten|page=41|url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/Ovriga%20rapporter/Utsatta%20omr%c3%a5den%20-%20social%20ordning,%20kriminell%20struktur%20och%20utmaningar%20f%c3%b6r%20polisen.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at [[13th meridian east|13\u00b000' east]] and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of [[Scania]].\n\nThe city is part of the transnational [[\u00d6resund Region]] and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the [[\u00d6resund]] to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 [[Falsterbo]], to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours.

The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the [[X 2000]] and [[Intercity train]]s to [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], and [[Kalmar]] cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the [[City Tunnel (Malm\u00f6)|City Tunnel]], which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from [[Malm\u00f6 Central Station]] through an underground station at the [[Triangeln railway station]] to [[Hylliev\u00e5ng]] (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter [[Hyllie railway station|Hyllie Station]], also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\n\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, [[Malm\u00f6 Airport]], today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, [[charter flights]] and [[low-cost carriers]].\n\nThe [[motorway]] system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the [[European route E20]] goes over the bridge and then, together with the [[European route E6]] follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013[[Helsingborg]] to Gothenburg.

The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in [[Lund]] about {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion [[Swedish krona]] (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nHowever, during the last two decades, there has been a revival. One contributing factor has been the economic integration with [[Denmark]] brought about by the [[\u00d6resund Bridge]], which opened in July 2000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Also the university founded in 1998 and the effects of integration into the [[European Union]] have contributed. In 2017 the unemployment rate is still high but Malm\u00f6 has, in the last 20 years, had one of the strongest employment growth rates in Sweden.

To date, they are the only Swedish football club to have reached the final of the competition.

A second football team, [[IFK Malm\u00f6]] played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history.

Malm\u00f6 was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city. Its original name was ''Malmhaug'' (with alternate spellings), meaning \"Gravel pile\" or \"Ore Hill\".\n\nIn the 15th century, Malm\u00f6 became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the [[\u00d8resund]], with the German [[Hanseatic League]] frequenting it as a [[marketplace]], and was notable for its flourishing [[herring]] fishery. In 1437, King [[Eric of Pomerania]] (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: [[argent]] with a [[griffin]] [[gules]], based on Eric's arms from [[Pomerania]]. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malm\u00f6 extended to the entire province of [[Scania]] from 1660.\n\nIn 1434, a new [[citadel]] was constructed at the beach south of the town. This [[fortress]], known today as [[Malm\u00f6 Castle|''Malm\u00f6hus'']], did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malm\u00f6 Sweden's most fortified city, but only ''Malm\u00f6hus'' remains.\n\n[[File:Malm\u00f6 city 1580.png|thumb|left|Malm\u00f6 in 1580: [[Malm\u00f6 Castle]] can be seen at far left, [[Sankt Petri Church, Malm\u00f6|Sankt Petri Church]]'s tower at center]]\n[[Lutheran]] teachings spread during the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]], and Malm\u00f6 became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527\u20131529) to this Protestant denomination.\n\nIn the 17th century, Malm\u00f6 and the Scanian region (''[[Sk\u00e5neland]]'') came under control of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malm\u00f6 for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.\n\nBy the dawn of the 18th century, Malm\u00f6 had about 2,300 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] (reigned 1697\u20131718) and to [[bubonic plague]] epidemics, the population dropped to 1,500 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbor was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Vart-Malmo/Vart-Malmo-artiklar/2011-02-20-Sa-har-Malmo-vuxit-genom-aren.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101064647/http://malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Vart-Malmo/Vart-Malmo-artiklar/2011-02-20-Sa-har-Malmo-vuxit-genom-aren.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 January 2016 |title=S\u00e5 har Malm\u00f6 vuxit genom \u00e5ren |publisher=[[Malm\u00f6 Municipality]] |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2015 |language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sodergatan-1913.jpg|thumb|left|''S\u00f6dergatan'' in 1913]]\nIn 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the [[Kockums]] shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The [[Southern Main Line]] was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malm\u00f6 to become a center of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malm\u00f6 overtook [[Norrk\u00f6ping]] to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malm\u00f6 had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malm\u00f6 continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.\n\n===1900\u20131969===\n[[File:Meeting of Scandinavian kings 2.jpeg|thumb|right|Malm\u00f6, 18 December 1914. All three Scandinavian Kings on the same balcony.]]\nIn 1914 (15 May to 4 October) Malm\u00f6 hosted the [[Baltic Exhibition]]. The large park [[Pildammsparken]] was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of [[World War I]].\n\nOn 18 and 19 December 1914, the ''Three Kings Meeting'' was held in Malm\u00f6. After a somewhat infected period (1905\u20131914), which included the dissolution of the [[Swedish-Norwegian Union]], King [[Oscar II]] was replaced with King [[H\u00e5kon VII]] in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King [[Christian X]]. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son [[Gustav V]] became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unclear, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.\n\nWithin sports, Malm\u00f6 has mostly been associated with [[association football|football]]. [[IFK Malm\u00f6]] participated in the first ever edition of [[Allsvenskan]] 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.\n\n===1970s and later===\nBy 1971, Malm\u00f6 reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} ([[Svedala]] was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malm\u00f6 municipality.)\n\nBy the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a [[recession]] that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of [[Scania]]. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malm\u00f6 as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malm\u00f6 plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as [[Vellinge Municipality]], [[Lomma Municipality]] and [[Staffanstorp Municipality]], which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malm\u00f6 had lost 35,000 inhabitants and was down to 229,000.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Swedish financial crises of the early 1990s exacerbated Malm\u00f6's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malm\u00f6 lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor [[Ilmar Reepalu]], the city of Malm\u00f6 started to create a new economy as a center of culture and knowledge. Malm\u00f6 reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive [[\u00d6resund Bridge]] road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new [[Malm\u00f6 University]] opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside. Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbor followed; a city architecture exposition ([[Bo01]]) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to be and has been successful in attracting the urban middle-class.\n\nSince 1974, the [[Kockums Crane]] had been a landmark in Malm\u00f6 and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malm\u00f6 gained a new landmark with completion of [[Turning Torso]], the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malm\u00f6, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.\n\nIn its 2015 and 2017 reports, [[Police in Sweden]] placed the [[Roseng\u00e5rd]] and the [[S\u00f6dra Sofielund|S\u00f6dra Sofielund/Seved]] district in the [[Vulnerable area#Especially vulnerable area|most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates]].<ref name=\"map_noa_utsatta_2015_p29\">{{Cite book|url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|title=Utsatta omr\u00e5den \u2013 sociala risker, kollektiv f\u00f6rm\u00e5ga och o\u00f6nskade h\u00e4ndelser|publisher=Police in Sweden \u2013 Nationella Operativa Avdelningen \u2013 December 2015|page=29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819054415/https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%C3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"map_noa_utsatta_2017_p41\">{{cite book|title=Utsatta omr\u00e5den \u2013 Social ordning, kriminell struktur och utmaningar f\u00f6r polisen / Dnr HD 44/14A203.023/2016|date=June 2017|publisher=[[Police in Sweden]] \u2013 Nationella operativa avdelningen \u2013 Underr\u00e4ttelseenheten|page=41|url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/Ovriga%20rapporter/Utsatta%20omr%c3%a5den%20-%20social%20ordning,%20kriminell%20struktur%20och%20utmaningar%20f%c3%b6r%20polisen.pdf|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMalm\u00f6 is located at [[13th meridian east|13\u00b000' east]] and 55\u00b035' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in the province of [[Scania]].\n\nThe city is part of the transnational [[\u00d6resund Region]] and, since 2000, has been linked by the \u00d6resund Bridge across the [[\u00d6resund]] to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002\u20132014 [[Falsterbo]], to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours.

The trip takes around 35\u201340 minutes. Additionally, some of the [[X 2000]] and [[Intercity train]]s to [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], and [[Kalmar]] cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the [[City Tunnel (Malm\u00f6)|City Tunnel]], which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from [[Malm\u00f6 Central Station]] through an underground station at the [[Triangeln railway station]] to [[Hylliev\u00e5ng]] (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter [[Hyllie railway station|Hyllie Station]], also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing \u00d6resund line in either direction, with the \u00d6resund Bridge lying due west.\n\nBesides the Copenhagen Airport, Malm\u00f6 has an airport of its own, [[Malm\u00f6 Airport]], today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, [[charter flights]] and [[low-cost carriers]].\n\nThe [[motorway]] system has been incorporated with the \u00d6resund Bridge; the [[European route E20]] goes over the bridge and then, together with the [[European route E6]] follows the Swedish west coast from Malm\u00f6\u2013[[Helsingborg]] to Gothenburg.

The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in [[Lund]] about {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north-east. As a result, Malm\u00f6 had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990\u20131995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion [[Swedish krona]] (SEK). In 1995, Malm\u00f6 had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nHowever, during the last two decades, there has been a revival.

Malm\u00f6 FF is the club where for instance, [[Bo Larsson|Bosse Larsson]] and [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]] began their football careers.  A second football team, [[IFK Malm\u00f6]] played in Sweden's top flight for about 20 years and the club's quarterfinal in the European Cup is the club's greatest achievement in its history.

Drought is another serious concern as the island's limited freshwater supply comes entirely from the shallow freshwater lens, which becomes salty close to the coast especially during drought periods. Like all of the atolls of Kiribati, Maiana is at serious risk from sea level rise, as even small changes in sea level can cause accelerated erosion and threaten infrastructure, agriculture and water supplies.<ref name=\"M2012\"/><ref name=\"CCP2008M\">{{cite web|last=Dr Temakei Tebano & others |work=Office of Te  Beretitent - Republic of Kiribati Island Report Series (for KAP II (Phase 2) |title=Island/atoll climate change profiles -  Maiana Atoll |date=August 2008 |url=http://www.climate.gov.ki/library.html |accessdate=28 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106060656/http://www.climate.gov.ki/library.html |archivedate=November 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Maiana Island Council compound.jpg|thumb|The Island Council compound in Maiana, Kiribati]]\nMaiana is administered by an Island Council based in Tebangetua village.

Apart from that, the local people of Maiana also have their ruling system that survive from the past. Unimwane Ruling System (Elders or old men ruling system). All villages from Tebikerai to Bubutei have their unimwane represent their villages to the Unimwane Council Body. This body called Tebau-ni-Maiana (The Crown of Maiana, sometimes called the most upper chamber of the Island). Among all Te Unimwane, they will choose the most aging one (older one) as their Baatua (Head of them). They execute rules of the Island that binding people together to follow. This rules and regulations based on the culture and religious belief of Maiana. For example, Uriam Kauongo was a Baatu before he died.\n\n==Myths and legends==\nThere are different stories told as to the creation of Maiana and the other islands in the Gilberts. An important legend in the culture of Maiana is that spirits who lived in a tree in Samoa migrated northward carrying branches from the tree, ''Te Kaintikuaba'', which translates as the tree of life. It was these spirits, together with Nareau the Wise who created the islands of Tungaru (the Gilbert Islands).{{#tag:ref|Sir [[Arthur Grimble]], cadet administrative officer in the Gilberts from 1914 and resident commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony from 1926, recorded the myths and oral traditions of the Kiribati people.
