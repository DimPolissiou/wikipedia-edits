Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.\n\nIrrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.\n\nThe origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the [[Punic Wars]] of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly [[Ludi|games]].\n\nThe gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD. The games finally declined during the early 5th century after the adoption of [[Christianity]] as [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, although beast hunts (''[[venatio]]nes'') continued into the 6th century.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Fronton marmol anfiteatro romano de Merida.JPG|thumb|Relief of gladiators from [[Amphitheatre of M\u00e9rida]], Spain]]\nEarly literary sources seldom agree on the origins of gladiators and the gladiator games.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=82}}.</ref> In the late 1st century BC, [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] believed they were [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=16\u201317}}.

This is described as a ''[[wiktionary:munus#Latin|munus]]'' (plural: ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]''), a commemorative duty owed the [[manes]] of a dead ancestor by his descendants.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=18\u201319}}.

Evidence of \"Samnite\" as an insult in earlier writings fades as Samnium is absorbed into the Republic.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe war in Samnium, immediately afterwards, was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, had made their battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver&nbsp;... The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage&nbsp;... The [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], as decreed by the [[Roman senate|senate]], celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armour. So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name Samnites.<ref>Livy 9.40. Quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4\u20135}}.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLivy's account skirts the funereal, sacrificial function of early Roman gladiator combats and reflects the later theatrical ethos of the Roman gladiator show: splendidly, exotically armed and armoured [[barbarians]], treacherous and degenerate, are dominated by Roman iron and native courage.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=67 (Note #84)}}. Livy's published works are often embellished with illustrative rhetorical detail.</ref> His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the Gods. Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators who may not be Samnites, but play the Samnite role. Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded. Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome.<ref>The ''velutes'' and later, the ''provocatores'' were exceptions, but as \"historicised\" rather than contemporary Roman types. See [[List of Roman gladiator types|Gladiator types]].</ref> The ''munus'' became a morally instructive form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well, or else die well.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=80\u201381}}.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nIn 216 BC, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 232 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], late [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[augur]], was honoured by his sons with three days of ''gladiatora munera'' in the [[Forum Romanum]], using twenty-two pairs of gladiators.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}. Welch is citing Livy, 23.30.15. The Aemilii Lepidii were one of the most important families in Rome at the time, and probably owned a gladiator school (''ludus'').</ref> Ten years later, [[Scipio Africanus]] gave a commemorative ''munus'' in Iberia for his father and uncle, casualties in the Punic Wars. High status non-Romans, and possibly Romans too, volunteered as his gladiators.<ref name=\"Futrell, 8-9\">{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref> The context of the [[Punic Wars]] and Rome's near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC) link these early games to munificence, the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster; these ''munera'' appear to serve a morale-raising agenda in an era of military threat and expansion.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=30}}.</ref> The next recorded ''munus'', held for the funeral of [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius]] in 183 BC, was more extravagant. It involved three days of funeral games, 120 gladiators, and public distribution of meat (''visceratio data'')<ref>Livy, 39.46.2.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius Italicus.<ref>Silius Italicus quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4\u20135}}.</ref>\n\nThe enthusiastic adoption of ''gladiatoria munera'' by Rome's Iberian allies shows how easily, and how early, the culture of the gladiator ''munus'' permeated places far from Rome itself. By 174 BC, \"small\" Roman ''munera'' (private or public), provided by an ''[[wiktionary:editor#Latin|editor]]'' of relatively low importance, may have been so commonplace and unremarkable they were not considered worth recording:<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nMany gladiatorial games were given in that year, some unimportant, one noteworthy beyond the rest&nbsp;\u2014 that of [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|Titus Flamininus]] which he gave to commemorate the death of his father, which lasted four days, and was accompanied by a public distribution of meats, a banquet, and scenic performances. The climax of the show which was big for the time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought.<ref>Livy, ''Annal for the Year 174 BC'' (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 105 BC, the ruling consuls offered Rome its first taste of state-sponsored \"[[barbarian]] combat\" demonstrated by gladiators from Capua, as part of a training program for the military.

In the [[Byzantine]] Empire, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatrical shows]] and [[chariot race]]s continued to attract the crowds, and drew a generous Imperial subsidy.\n \nIt is not known how many ''gladiatoria munera'' were given throughout the Roman period. Many, if not most, involved ''venationes'', and in the later Empire some may have been only that. In 165 BC, at least one ''munus'' was held during April's [[Megalesia]]. In the early Imperial era, ''munera'' in Pompeii and neighbouring towns were dispersed from March through November. They included a provincial magnate's five-day ''munus'' of thirty pairs, plus beast-hunts.<ref>Alison E. Cooley and MGL Cooley, ''Pompeii, A Sourcebook'', Routledge, 2004, p. 218.</ref> A single late primary source, the ''Calendar of Furius Dionysius Philocalus'' for 354, shows how seldom gladiators featured among a multitude of official festivals. Of 176 days reserved for spectacles of various kinds, 102 were for theatrical shows, 64 for [[chariot race]]s and just 10 in December for gladiator games and ''venationes''. A century before this, the emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (r. 222\u2013235) may have intended a more even redistribution of ''munera'' throughout the year; but this would have broken with what had become the traditional positioning of the major gladiator games, at the year's ending. As Wiedemann points out, December was also the month for the [[Saturnalia]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn's]] festival, in which death was linked to renewal, and the lowest were honoured as the highest.<ref>{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=11\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\nThe earliest ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]'' took place at or near the tomb of the deceased and these were organised by their ''munerator'' (who made the offering). Later games were held by an ''editor'', either identical with the ''munerator'' or an official employed by him. As time passed, these titles and meanings may have merged.<ref name=\"Kyle 1998 80\">{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=80}}.</ref> In the Republican era, private citizens could own and train gladiators, or lease them from a ''lanista'' (owner of a gladiator training school). From the Principate onwards, private citizens could hold munera and own gladiators only under Imperial permission, and the role of ''editor'' was increasingly tied to state officialdom. Legislation by [[Claudius]] required that [[quaestor]]s, the lowest rank of Roman magistrate, personally subsidise two-thirds of the costs of games for their small-town communities&nbsp;\u2013 in effect, both an advertisement of their personal generosity and a part-purchase of their office. Bigger games were put on by senior magistrates, who could better afford them. The largest and most lavish of all were paid for by the emperor himself.<ref name=\"Futrell, 43\">{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=43}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=440\u2013446}}.</ref>\n\n==The gladiators==\n{{Main|List of Roman gladiator types}}\nThe earliest types of gladiator were named after Rome's enemies of that time: the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]], [[Thraex|Thracian]] and [[List of Roman gladiator types#Gallus|Gaul]]. The Samnite, heavily armed, elegantly helmed and probably the most popular type, was renamed [[secutor]] and the Gaul renamed [[murmillo]], once these former enemies had been conquered then absorbed into Rome's Empire. In the mid-republican ''munus'', each type seems to have fought against a similar or identical type. In the later Republic and early Empire, various \"fantasy\" types were introduced, and were set against dissimilar but complementary types. For example, the bareheaded, nimble [[retiarius]] (\"net-man\"), armoured only at the left arm and shoulder, pitted his net, trident and dagger against the more heavily armoured, helmeted Secutor.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=313}}</ref> Most depictions of gladiators show the most common and popular types. Passing literary references to others has allowed their tentative reconstruction. Other novelties introduced around this time included gladiators who fought from [[Essedarius|chariots or carts]], or from horseback.\n\nThe trade in gladiators was empire-wide, and subjected to official supervision. Rome's military success produced a supply of soldier-prisoners who were redistributed for use in State mines or amphitheatres and for sale on the open market. For example, in the aftermath of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish Revolt]], the gladiator schools received an influx of Jews&nbsp;\u2013 those rejected for training would have been sent straight to the arenas as ''noxii'' (lit. [[wiktionary:noxius#Latin|\"hurtful ones\"]]).<ref>Josephus. ''The Jewish War'', 6.418, 7.37\u201340; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=93}}.

In the late Republican era, a fear of similar uprisings, the usefulness of gladiator schools in creating private armies, and the exploitation of ''munera'' for political gain led to increased restrictions on gladiator school ownership, siting and organisation.

It was [[Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre|inaugurated]] by [[Titus]] in 80 AD as the personal gift of the Emperor to the people of Rome, paid for by the imperial share of booty after the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish Revolt]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=151\u2013152}}.</ref>\n[[File:arlesarena.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arles Amphitheatre]], inside view]]\nAmphitheatres were usually oval in plan. Their seating tiers surrounded the arena below, where the community's judgments were meted out, in full public view. From across the stands, crowd and ''editor'' could assess each other's character and temperament. For the crowd, amphitheatres afforded unique opportunities for free expression and free speech (''theatralis licentia''). Petitions could be submitted to the ''editor'' (as magistrate) in full view of the community. ''Factiones'' and claques could vent their spleen on each other, and occasionally on Emperors. The emperor Titus's dignified yet confident ease in his management of an amphitheatre crowd and its factions were taken as a measure of his enormous popularity and the rightness of his imperium. The amphitheatre ''munus'' thus served the Roman community as living theatre and a court in miniature, in which judgement could be served not only on those in the arena below, but on their judges.<ref>{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, \"Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics\", pp. 184\u2013185}}.

Their seating was \"disorderly and indiscriminate\" until [[Augustus]] prescribed its arrangement in his Social Reforms. To persuade the Senate, he expressed his distress on behalf of a Senator who could not find seating at a crowded games in [[Pozzuoli|Puteoli]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn consequence of this the senate decreed that, whenever any public show was given anywhere, the first row of seats should be reserved for senators; and at Rome he would not allow the envoys of the free and allied nations to sit in the orchestra, since he was informed that even freedmen were sometimes appointed. He separated the soldiery from the people. He assigned special seats to the married men of the commons, to boys under age their own section and the adjoining one to their preceptors; and he decreed that no one wearing a dark cloak should sit in the middle of the house. He would not allow women to view even the gladiators except from the upper seats, though it had been the custom for men and women to sit together at such shows. Only the Vestal virgins were assigned a place to themselves, opposite the praetor's tribunal.<ref>Suetonius.

Titus and Trajan preferred the ''parmularii'' and Domitian the ''secutarii''; Marcus Aurelius took neither side. Nero seems to have enjoyed the brawls between rowdy, enthusiastic and sometimes violent factions, but called in the troops if they went too far.<ref name=\"Futrell, 96, 104, 105\">{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=96,104\u2013105}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=111}}.</ref>\n\nThere were also local rivalries. At Pompeii's amphitheatre, during Nero's reign, the trading of insults between [[Pompeii|Pompeians]] and [[Nuceria]]n spectators during public ''ludi'' led to stone throwing and riot. Many were killed or wounded. Nero banned gladiator ''munera'' (though not the games) at Pompeii for ten years as punishment. The story is told in Pompeian graffiti and high quality wall painting, with much boasting of Pompeii's \"victory\" over Nuceria.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=107\u2013108}}.

From the early days of the Republic, ten years of military service were a citizen's duty and a prerequisite for election to public office. ''[[Devotio]]'' (willingness to sacrifice one's life to the greater good) was central to the Roman military ideal, and was the core of the Roman military oath. It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=81}}. It was notably fulfilled and celebrated in the battlefield ''devotio'' of two consular [[:Category:Decii|Decii]]; firstly by [[Publius Decius Mus (340 BC)|the father]] and later by his [[Publius Decius Mus (312 BC)|son]].</ref> As a soldier committed his life (voluntarily, at least in theory) to the greater cause of Rome's victory, he was not expected to survive defeat.<ref>{{harvnb|Edwards|2007|pp=19\u201345}}; Livy, 22.51.5\u20138, has wounded Romans at Cannae stretch out their necks for the death blow by comrades: ''cf'' Cicero's death in Seneca's ''Suasoriae'', 6.17.</ref>\n\nThe Punic Wars of the late 3rd century BC&nbsp;\u2013 in particular the near-catastrophic defeat of Roman arms at Cannae&nbsp;\u2013 had long-lasting effects on the Republic, its citizen armies, and the development of the gladiatorial ''munera''. In the aftermath of Cannae, Scipio Africanus crucified Roman deserters and had non-Roman deserters thrown to the beasts.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}.</ref> The Senate refused to ransom Hannibal's Roman captives: instead, they consulted the [[Sibylline books]], then made drastic preparations:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn obedience to the Books of Destiny, some strange and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them. A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium&nbsp;... They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods were believed to be duly propitiated&nbsp;... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.<ref>Livy, 22.55\u201357.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[File:Kourion10.jpg|thumb|190px|Late 3rd century gladiator mosaic from a private residence in [[Kourion]], [[Cyprus]]. All the participants are named, including the referee]]\nThe account notes, uncomfortably, the bloodless human sacrifices performed to help turn the tide of the war in Rome's favour. While the Senate mustered their willing slaves, Hannibal offered his dishonoured Roman captives a chance for honourable death, in what Livy describes as something very like the Roman ''munus''. The ''munus'' thus represented an essentially military, self-sacrificial ideal, taken to extreme fulfillment in the gladiator's oath.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> By the ''devotio'' of a voluntary oath, a slave might achieve the quality of a Roman (''[[Romanitas]]''), become the embodiment of true ''virtus'' (manliness, or manly virtue), and paradoxically, be granted ''missio'' while remaining a slave.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The gladiator as a specialist fighter, and the ethos and organization of the gladiator schools, would inform the development of the Roman military as the most effective force of its time.<ref>{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=274}}.</ref> In 107 BC, the [[Gaius Marius|Marian]] Reforms established the Roman army as a professional body. Two years later, following its defeat at the [[Battle of Arausio]]:\n\n<blockquote>\n...weapons training was given to soldiers by P. Rutilius, consul with C. Mallis. For he, following the example of no previous general, with teachers summoned from the gladiatorial training school of C. Aurelus Scaurus, implanted in the legions a more sophisticated method of avoiding and dealing a blow and mixed bravery with skill and skill back again with virtue so that skill became stronger by bravery's passion and passion became more wary with the knowledge of this art.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nThe military were great aficionados of the games, and supervised the schools. Many schools and amphitheatres were sited at or near military barracks, and some [[Roman province|provincial]] army units owned gladiator troupes.<ref>{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=45}}.</ref> As the Republic wore on, the term of military service increased from ten to the sixteen years formalised by Augustus in the Principate. It would rise to twenty, and later, to twenty-five years. Roman military discipline was ferocious; severe enough to provoke mutiny, despite the consequences. A career as a volunteer gladiator may have seemed an attractive option for some.<ref>{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=126\u2013128}}. Mattern is citing Tacitus's ''Annals'', 1.17.</ref>\n\nIn AD 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], [[Otho]]'s troops at [[Bedriacum]] included 2000 gladiators.

Even the most complex and sophisticated ''munera'' of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral ''dii manes'' of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of ''sacrificium''. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; [[Cicero]] acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=16}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Letters to Friends'', 2.3.</ref> Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: \"Even when [gladiators] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has been brought to the ground, when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?\" His own death would later emulate this example.<ref>Cicero's admiration: ''Tusculan Disputations'', 2.41.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=39}}. Barton is citing Seneca's ''Suasoriae'', 6.17 for Cicero's death.</ref> Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]], publicly and scathingly, as a ''bustuarius''&nbsp;\u2013 literally, a \"funeral-man\", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. \"Gladiator\" could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and \"Samnite\" doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=273}}. For ''bustuarius'', with reference to Clodius's alleged impious disturbance at the funeral of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], see Cicero's ''In Pisonem'' (Against Piso). See {{harvnb|Bagnani|1956|p=26}}, for the bustuarius as a lower class of gladiator than one employed in the public ''munus''. Cicero's unflattering references to Marcus Antonius as ''gladiator'' are in his 2nd Philippic.</ref> [[Silius Italicus]] wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate [[Campania#Ancient tribes and Samnite Wars|Campanians]] had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: \"It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [(Samnites)] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua.\"<ref>Silius Italicus, 11.51 (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=3}}).</ref> Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.<ref>{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, \"Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics\", p. 185}}. Tacitus, in ''Annals'' 15.44, describes the public repugnance towards Nero's punishment of Christians, which seemed based on his appetite for cruelty, rather than a desire for the public good.</ref>\n[[File:Retiarius vs secutor from Borghese mosaic.jpg|thumb|210px|Detail of the [[Gladiator Mosaic]], 4th century AD]]\n\nThe ''munus'' itself could be interpreted as pious necessity, but its increasing luxury corroded Roman virtue, and created an un-Roman appetite for profligacy and self-indulgence.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=4}}. Roman commentators associated ''munera'' with Capua's proverbial luxury and excess.</ref> Caesar's 46 BC ''ludi'' were mere entertainment for political gain, a waste of lives and of money that would have been better doled out to his legionary veterans.<ref>Cassius Dio, 43.24.</ref> Yet for Seneca, and for Marcus Aurelius&nbsp;\u2013 both professed [[Stoics]]&nbsp;\u2013 the degradation of gladiators in the ''munus'' highlighted their Stoic virtues: their unconditional obedience to their master and to fate, and equanimity in the face of death. Having \"neither hope nor illusions\", the gladiator could transcend his own debased nature, and disempower death itself by meeting it face to face. Courage, dignity, altruism and loyalty were morally redemptive; [[Lucian]] idealised this principle in his story of Sisinnes, who voluntarily fought as a gladiator, earned 10,000 drachmas and used it to buy freedom for his friend, Toxaris.<ref>{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=154}}. Futrell is citing Lucian's ''Toxaris'', 58\u201359.</ref> Seneca had a lower opinion of the mob's un-Stoical appetite for ''ludi meridiani'': \"Man [is]...now slaughtered for jest and sport; and those whom it used to be unholy to train for the purpose of inflicting and enduring wounds are thrust forth exposed and defenceless.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nThese accounts seek a higher moral meaning from the ''munus'', but [[Ovid]]'s very detailed (though satirical) instructions for seduction in the amphitheatre suggest that the spectacles could generate a potent and dangerously sexual atmosphere.<ref name=\"Futrell 205\"/> Augustan seating prescriptions placed women&nbsp;\u2013 excepting the Vestals, who were legally inviolate&nbsp;\u2013 as far as possible from the action of the arena floor; or tried to.

Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.\n\nIrrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.\n\nThe origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the [[Punic Wars]] of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly [[Ludi|games]].\n\nThe gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD.  The games finally declined during the early 5th century after the adoption of [[Christianity]] as [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, although beast hunts (''[[venatio]]nes'') continued into the 6th century.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Fronton marmol anfiteatro romano de Merida.JPG|thumb|Relief of gladiators from [[Amphitheatre of M\u00e9rida]], Spain]]\nEarly literary sources seldom agree on the origins of gladiators and the gladiator games.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=82}}.</ref> In the late 1st century BC, [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] believed they were [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=16\u201317}}.

Futrell is citing Livy, 9.40.17.</ref> Long after the games had ceased, the 7th century AD writer [[Isidore of Seville]] derived Latin ''[[wiktionary:lanista#Latin|lanista]]'' (manager of gladiators) from the Etruscan word for \"executioner,\" and the title of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] (an official who accompanied the dead from the Roman gladiatorial arena) from [[Charun]], [[psychopomp]] of the Etruscan underworld.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=14\u201315}}.</ref> This was accepted and repeated in most early modern, standard histories of the games.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=11}}.</ref>\n\nReappraisal of pictorial evidence supports a Campanian origin, or at least a borrowing, for the games and gladiators.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=3\u20135}}.</ref> Campania hosted the earliest known gladiator schools (''[[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludi]]'').<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}.</ref> Tomb [[fresco]]es from the Campanian city of [[Paestum]] (4th century BC) show paired fighters, with helmets, spears and shields, in a propitiatory funeral blood-rite that anticipates early Roman gladiator games.<ref>{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}. Paestum was colonized by Rome in 273 BC.</ref> Compared to these images, supporting evidence from Etruscan tomb-paintings is tentative and late. The Paestum frescoes may represent the continuation of a much older tradition, acquired or inherited from Greek colonists of the 8th century BC.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=15, 18}}.</ref>\n\nLivy places the first Roman gladiator games (264 BC) in the early stage of Rome's [[First Punic War]] against [[Carthage]], when [[Decimus Junius Brutus Scaeva]] had three gladiator pairs fight to the death in Rome's \"cattle market\" Forum (''[[Forum Boarium]]'') to honor his dead father, Brutus Pera. This is described as a ''[[wiktionary:munus#Latin|munus]]'' (plural: ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]''), a commemorative duty owed the [[manes]] of a dead ancestor by his descendants.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=18\u201319}}. Livy's account (summary 16) places beast-hunts and gladiatorial ''munera'' within this single ''[[wikt:munus|munus]]''.</ref><ref>A single, later source describes the gladiator type involved as [[Thraex|Thracian]]. See {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=19}}. Welch is citing Ausanius: Seneca simply says they were \"war captives\".</ref> The development of the ''munus'' and its [[List of Roman gladiator types|gladiator types]] was most strongly influenced by Samnium's support for [[Hannibal]] and the subsequent punitive expeditions against the Samnites by Rome and her Campanian allies; the earliest and most frequently mentioned type was the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=273}}. Evidence of \"Samnite\" as an insult in earlier writings fades as Samnium is absorbed into the Republic.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe war in Samnium, immediately afterwards, was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, had made their battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver&nbsp;... The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage&nbsp;... The [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], as decreed by the [[Roman senate|senate]], celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armour. So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name Samnites.<ref>Livy 9.40. Quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4\u20135}}.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nLivy's account skirts the funereal, sacrificial function of early Roman gladiator combats and reflects the later theatrical ethos of the Roman gladiator show: splendidly, exotically armed and armoured [[barbarians]], treacherous and degenerate, are dominated by Roman iron and native courage.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=67 (Note #84)}}. Livy's published works are often embellished with illustrative rhetorical detail.</ref> His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the Gods. Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators who may not be Samnites, but play the Samnite role. Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded. Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome.<ref>The ''velutes'' and later, the ''provocatores'' were exceptions, but as \"historicised\" rather than contemporary Roman types. See [[List of Roman gladiator types|Gladiator types]].</ref> The ''munus'' became a morally instructive form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well, or else die well.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=80\u201381}}.</ref>\n\n===Development===\nIn 216 BC, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 232 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], late [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[augur]], was honoured by his sons with three days of ''gladiatora munera'' in the [[Forum Romanum]], using twenty-two pairs of gladiators.<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}. Welch is citing Livy, 23.30.15. The Aemilii Lepidii were one of the most important families in Rome at the time, and probably owned a gladiator school (''ludus'').</ref> Ten years later, [[Scipio Africanus]] gave a commemorative ''munus'' in Iberia for his father and uncle, casualties in the Punic Wars. High status non-Romans, and possibly Romans too, volunteered as his gladiators.<ref name=\"Futrell, 8-9\">{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=8\u20139}}.</ref> The context of the [[Punic Wars]] and Rome's near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC) link these early games to munificence, the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster; these ''munera'' appear to serve a morale-raising agenda in an era of military threat and expansion.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=30}}.</ref> The next recorded ''munus'', held for the funeral of [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius]] in 183 BC, was more extravagant. It involved three days of funeral games, 120 gladiators, and public distribution of meat (''visceratio data'')<ref>Livy, 39.46.2.</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius Italicus.<ref>Silius Italicus quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4\u20135}}.</ref>\n\nThe enthusiastic adoption of ''gladiatoria munera'' by Rome's Iberian allies shows how easily, and how early, the culture of the gladiator ''munus'' permeated places far from Rome itself. By 174 BC, \"small\" Roman ''munera'' (private or public), provided by an ''[[wiktionary:editor#Latin|editor]]'' of relatively low importance, may have been so commonplace and unremarkable they were not considered worth recording:<ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nMany gladiatorial games were given in that year, some unimportant, one noteworthy beyond the rest&nbsp;\u2014 that of [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|Titus Flamininus]] which he gave to commemorate the death of his father, which lasted four days, and was accompanied by a public distribution of meats, a banquet, and scenic performances. The climax of the show which was big for the time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought.<ref>Livy, ''Annal for the Year 174 BC'' (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 105 BC, the ruling consuls offered Rome its first taste of state-sponsored \"[[barbarian]] combat\" demonstrated by gladiators from Capua, as part of a training program for the military. It proved immensely popular.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=6\u20137}}. Wiedemann is citing Valerius Maximus, 2.3.2.</ref> Thereafter, the gladiator contests formerly restricted to private ''munera'' were often included in the state games (''[[ludi]]'')<ref>The games were always referred to in the plural, as ''ludi''. Gladiator schools were also known as ''ludi'' when plural; a single school was ''ludus''</ref> that accompanied the major religious festivals. Where traditional ''ludi'' had been dedicated to a deity, such as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the ''munera'' could be dedicated to an aristocratic sponsor's divine or heroic ancestor.<ref name=\"Lintott 2004 183\">{{harvnb|Lintott|2004|p=183}}.</ref>\n\n===Peak===\n[[File:Retiarius stabs secutor (color).jpg|thumb|A ''[[retiarius]]'' stabs at a ''[[secutor]]'' with his [[trident]] in this mosaic from the villa at [[Nennig]], Germany, c. 2nd\u20133rd century AD.]]\nGladiator games offered their sponsors extravagantly expensive but effective opportunities for self-promotion, and gave their clients and potential voters exciting entertainment at little or no cost to themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=50}}.</ref> Gladiators became big business for trainers and owners, for politicians on the make and those who had reached the top and wished to stay there.

Many, if not most, involved ''venationes'', and in the later Empire some may have been only that. In 165 BC, at least one ''munus'' was held during April's [[Megalesia]]. In the early Imperial era, ''munera'' in Pompeii and neighbouring towns were dispersed from March through November. They included a provincial magnate's five-day ''munus'' of thirty pairs, plus beast-hunts.<ref>Alison E. Cooley and MGL Cooley, ''Pompeii, A Sourcebook'', Routledge, 2004, p. 218.</ref> A single late primary source, the ''Calendar of Furius Dionysius Philocalus'' for 354, shows how seldom gladiators featured among a multitude of official festivals. Of 176 days reserved for spectacles of various kinds, 102 were for theatrical shows, 64 for [[chariot race]]s and just 10 in December for gladiator games and ''venationes''. A century before this, the emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (r. 222\u2013235) may have intended a more even redistribution of ''munera'' throughout the year; but this would have broken with what had become the traditional positioning of the major gladiator games, at the year's ending.

Later games were held by an ''editor'', either identical with the ''munerator'' or an official employed by him. As time passed, these titles and meanings may have merged.<ref name=\"Kyle 1998 80\">{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=80}}.</ref> In the Republican era, private citizens could own and train gladiators, or lease them from a ''lanista'' (owner of a gladiator training school). From the Principate onwards, private citizens could hold munera and own gladiators only under Imperial permission, and the role of ''editor'' was increasingly tied to state officialdom. Legislation by [[Claudius]] required that [[quaestor]]s, the lowest rank of Roman magistrate, personally subsidise two-thirds of the costs of games for their small-town communities&nbsp;\u2013 in effect, both an advertisement of their personal generosity and a part-purchase of their office. Bigger games were put on by senior magistrates, who could better afford them. The largest and most lavish of all were paid for by the emperor himself.<ref name=\"Futrell, 43\">{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=43}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=440\u2013446}}.</ref>\n\n==The gladiators==\n{{Main|List of Roman gladiator types}}\nThe earliest types of gladiator were named after Rome's enemies of that time: the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]], [[Thraex|Thracian]] and [[List of Roman gladiator types#Gallus|Gaul]]. The Samnite, heavily armed, elegantly helmed and probably the most popular type, was renamed [[secutor]] and the Gaul renamed [[murmillo]], once these former enemies had been conquered then absorbed into Rome's Empire. In the mid-republican ''munus'', each type seems to have fought against a similar or identical type. In the later Republic and early Empire, various \"fantasy\" types were introduced, and were set against dissimilar but complementary types. For example, the bareheaded, nimble [[retiarius]] (\"net-man\"), armoured only at the left arm and shoulder, pitted his net, trident and dagger against the more heavily armoured, helmeted Secutor.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=313}}</ref> Most depictions of gladiators show the most common and popular types. Passing literary references to others has allowed their tentative reconstruction. Other novelties introduced around this time included gladiators who fought from [[Essedarius|chariots or carts]], or from horseback.\n\nThe trade in gladiators was empire-wide, and subjected to official supervision. Rome's military success produced a supply of soldier-prisoners who were redistributed for use in State mines or amphitheatres and for sale on the open market. For example, in the aftermath of the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War|Jewish Revolt]], the gladiator schools received an influx of Jews&nbsp;\u2013 those rejected for training would have been sent straight to the arenas as ''noxii'' (lit.

In Rome's military ethos, enemy soldiers who had surrendered or allowed their own capture and enslavement had been granted an unmerited gift of life.

Most matches employed a senior referee (''summa rudis'') and an assistant, shown in mosaics with long staffs (''rudes'') to caution or separate opponents at some crucial point in the match. Referees were usually retired gladiators whose decisions, judgement and discretion were, for the most part, respected;<ref>Though not always: the gladiator Diodorus blames \"murderous Fate and the cunning treachery of the ''summa rudis''\" for his death, not his own error in not finishing off his opponent when he had the chance: see Robert, Gladiateurs, no. 79 = SgO 11/02/01</ref> they could stop bouts entirely, or pause them to allow the combatants rest, refreshment and a rub-down.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}; based on mosaics and a Pompeian tomb relief.</ref>\n\nLudi and ''munera'' were accompanied by music, played as interludes, or building to a \"frenzied crescendo\" during combats, perhaps to heighten the suspense during a gladiator's appeal; blows may have been accompanied by trumpet-blasts.<ref>The gravestones of several musicians and gladiators mention such modulations; see Fagan, pp. 225 \u2013 226, and footnotes.</ref><ref name=\"Coleman\"/> The [[Zliten mosaic]] in Libya (circa 80\u2013100 AD) shows musicians playing an accompaniment to provincial games (with gladiators, ''bestiarii'', or ''venatores'' and prisoners attacked by beasts).

Victors received the palm branch and an award from the ''editor''. An outstanding fighter might receive a laurel crown and money from an appreciative crowd but for anyone originally condemned ''ad ludum'' the greatest reward was manumission (emancipation), symbolised by the gift of a wooden training sword or staff (''rudis'') from the ''editor''. Martial describes a match between [[Priscus (gladiator)|Priscus]] and [[Verus (gladiator)|Verus]], who fought so evenly and bravely for so long that when both acknowledged defeat at the same instant, [[Titus]] awarded victory and a ''rudis'' to each.<ref>Martial. ''Liber de Spectaculis'', 29.</ref> Flamma was awarded the ''rudis'' four times, but chose to remain a gladiator. His gravestone in [[Sicily]] includes his record: \"Flamma, ''[[secutor]]'', lived 30 years, fought 34 times, won 21 times, fought to a draw 9 times, defeated 4 times, a [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]] by nationality.

During the Imperial era, matches advertised as ''sine missione'' (without remission from the sentence of death) suggest that ''missio'' (the sparing of a defeated gladiator's life) had become common practice. The contract between ''editor'' and his ''lanista'' could include compensation for unexpected deaths;<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=141}}.</ref> this could be \"some fifty times higher than the lease price\" of the gladiator.<ref>M.

When Caligula and Claudius refused to spare defeated but popular fighters, their own popularity suffered.

''Lives'', \"Caligula\", 30.3.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Death and disposal===\nA gladiator who was refused ''missio'' was despatched by his opponent. To die well, a gladiator should never ask for mercy, nor cry out.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=140}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Tuscullan Disputations'', 2.17.</ref> A \"good death\" redeemed the gladiator from the dishonourable weakness and passivity of defeat, and provided a noble example to those who watched:<ref>{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=38\u201339}}.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nFor death, when it stands near us, gives even to inexperienced men the courage not to seek to avoid the inevitable. So the gladiator, no matter how faint-hearted he has been throughout the fight, offers his throat to his opponent and directs the wavering blade to the vital spot. (Seneca. ''Epistles'', 30.8)</blockquote>\n\nSome mosaics show defeated gladiators kneeling in preparation for the moment of death. Seneca's \"vital spot\" seems to have meant the neck.<ref>{{harvnb|Edwards|2007|pp=66\u201367}}.</ref> Gladiator remains from Ephesus confirm this.<ref>{{harvnb|Curry|2008}}.

The Christian author [[Tertullian]], commenting on ''ludi meridiani'' in Roman [[Carthage]] during the peak era of the games, describes a more humiliating method of removal. One arena official, dressed as the \"brother of Jove\", [[Dis Pater]] (god of the underworld) strikes the corpse with a mallet. Another, dressed as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], tests for life-signs with a heated \"wand\"; once confirmed as dead, the body is dragged from the arena.<ref>By Tertullian's time, Mercury was identified with Greek [[Hermes#Epithets of Hermes|Hermes psychopompos]], who led souls into the underworld.  Tertullian describes these events as examples of hollow impiety, in which Rome's false deities are acceptably impersonated by low and murderous persons for the purposes of human sacrifice and evil entertainment. See {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=155\u2013168}}.</ref>\n\nWhether these victims were gladiators or ''noxii'' is unknown. Modern pathological examination confirms the probably fatal use of a mallet on some, but not all the gladiator skulls found in a gladiators' cemetery.<ref>{{harvnb|Grossschmidt|Kanz|2006|pp=207\u2013216}}.</ref> Kyle (1998) proposes that gladiators who disgraced themselves might have been subjected to the same indignities as ''noxii'', denied the relative mercies of a quick death and dragged from the arena as carrion. Whether the corpse of such a gladiator could be redeemed from further ignominy by friends or ''familia'' is not known.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=40, 155\u2013168}}.

Kyle contextualises Juvenal's ''panem et circenses''&nbsp;\u2013 bread and games as a sop to the politically apathetic plebs (Satires, 4.10) &nbsp;\u2013 within an account of the death and ''damnatio'' of [[Sejanus]], whose body was torn to pieces by the crowd and left unburied.</ref> Denial of funeral rites and memorial condemned the shade (''manes'') of the deceased to restless wandering upon the earth as a dreadful ''[[lemures|larva'' or ''lemur]]''.<ref>Suetonius. ''Lives'', \"Tiberius\", 75. Suetonius has the populace wish the same fate on [[Tiberius]]'s body, a form of ''damnatio'': to be thrown in the Tiber, or left unburied, or \"dragged with the hook\".</ref> Ordinary citizens, slaves and freedmen were usually buried beyond the town or city limits, to avoid the ritual and physical pollution of the living; professional gladiators had their own, separate cemeteries. The taint of ''infamia'' was perpetual.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=128\u2013159}}.</ref>\n\n===Remembrance and epitaphs===\nGladiators could subscribe to a union (''collegia''), which ensured their proper burial, and sometimes a pension or compensation for wives and children. Otherwise, the gladiator's ''familia'', which included his ''lanista'', comrades and blood-kin, might fund his funeral and memorial costs, and use the memorial to assert their moral reputation as responsible, respectful colleagues or family members. Some monuments record the gladiator's career in some detail, including the number of appearances, victories\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200asometimes represented by an engraved crown or wreath\u200a\u200a\u2014\u200a\u200adefeats, career duration, and age at death.

According to Cassius Dio, the emperor [[Caracalla]] gave the gladiator Bato a magnificent memorial and State funeral;<ref name=\"Dunkle_2013_p70-71\"/> more typical are the simple gladiator tombs of the Eastern Roman Empire, whose brief inscriptions include the following:\n<blockquote>\n\"The familia set this up in memory of Saturnilos.\"<br />\n\"For Nikepharos, son of Synetos, Lakedaimonian, and for Narcissus the secutor.

Futrell is citing Robert, #12, #24, and #109.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nVery little evidence survives of the religious beliefs of gladiators as a class, or their expectations of an afterlife. Modern scholarship offers little support for the once-prevalent notion that gladiators, ''venatores'' and ''bestiarii'' were personally or professionally dedicated to the cult of the Graeco-Roman goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. Rather, she seems to have represented a kind of \"Imperial [[Fortuna]]\" who dispensed Imperial retribution on the one hand, and Imperially subsidised gifts on the other \u2013 including the ''munera''. One gladiator's tomb dedication clearly states that her decisions are not to be trusted.<ref>Nemesis, her devotees and her place in the Roman world are fully discussed, with examples, in Hornum, Michael B., ''Nemesis, the Roman state and the games'', Brill, 1993.</ref> Many gladiator epitaphs claim Nemesis, fate, deception or treachery as the instrument of their death, never the superior skills of the flesh-and-blood adversary who defeated and killed them.

Few gladiators survived more than 10 contests, though one survived an extraordinary 150 bouts;<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=145}}</ref> and another died at 90 years of age, presumably long after retirement.<ref>{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}</ref> A natural death following retirement is also likely for three individuals who died at 38, 45, and 48 years respectively.<ref name=\"FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY 2000\"/> George Ville, using evidence from 1st century gladiator headstones, calculated an average age at death of 27, and mortality \"among all who entered the arena\" at 19/100.<ref name=\"Futrell 2006 144\">{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}.

In the late Republican era, a fear of similar uprisings, the usefulness of gladiator schools in creating private armies, and the exploitation of ''munera'' for political gain led to increased restrictions on gladiator school ownership, siting and organisation. By [[Domitian]]'s time, many had been more or less absorbed by the State, including those at [[Pergamum]], [[Alexandria]], [[Praeneste]] and Capua.<ref>{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=285\u2013287, 312}}.

Facial ''stigmata'' represented extreme social degradation.</ref>\n\nGladiators were typically accommodated in cells, arranged in barrack formation around a central practice arena.

Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no.

Thus demoralised was Capua.\"<ref>Silius Italicus, 11.51 (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=3}}).</ref> Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.<ref>{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, \"Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics\", p. 185}}.

Having \"neither hope nor illusions\", the gladiator could transcend his own debased nature, and disempower death itself by meeting it face to face. Courage, dignity, altruism and loyalty were morally redemptive; [[Lucian]] idealised this principle in his story of Sisinnes, who voluntarily fought as a gladiator, earned 10,000 drachmas and used it to buy freedom for his friend, Toxaris.<ref>{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=154}}.

Walls in the 2nd century BC \"Italian [[Agora]]\" at [[Delos]] were decorated with paintings of gladiators. Mosaics dating from the 2nd through 4th centuries AD have been invaluable in the reconstruction of combat and its rules, gladiator types and the development of the ''munus''. Throughout the Roman world, ceramics, lamps, gems and jewellery, mosaics, reliefs, wall paintings and statuary offer evidence, sometimes the best evidence, of the clothing, props, equipment, names, events, prevalence and rules of gladiatorial combat. Earlier periods provide only occasional, perhaps exceptional examples.<ref name=\"Brown, 181\">{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, \"Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics\", p. 181}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=2}}.</ref> The [[Gladiator Mosaic]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]] displays several gladiator types, and the [[Bignor Roman Villa]] mosaic from [[Roman Britain|Provincial Britain]] shows [[Cupid]]s as gladiators.

The term ''Derech Eretz'', literally \"the way of the land\", is inherently ambiguous, with a wide range of meanings in [[Rabbinic literature]], referring to earning a livelihood and behaving appropriately, among others.<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/><ref>{{citation | first = Gidon | last = Rothstein | url = http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | title = Maharal on Avot | website = RJConline.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031164210/http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | archivedate = 2010-10-31 }}.</ref>\n\n===Appropriate behaviour and good character===\n{{see|Proper behavior precedes the Torah}}\n[[Image:Virtue.

The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

After all, it is also true that work is a form of [[Gemilut Hasidim]] with benevolent \"intention\" so that someone could live in appropriate manner to have social and individual good civilization. Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]]. Work became a necessity when [[Adam]] ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the [[Tzimtzum|Other Side]]. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\". See.<ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\">[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is \u05d1\u05d0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (\"heretical works\").</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of culture and society===\n[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by [[Robert Lewis Reid]] (1862\u20131929) in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

Work became a necessity when [[Adam]] ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the [[Tzimtzum|Other Side]]. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\". See.<ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\">[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is \u05d1\u05d0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (\"heretical works\").</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of culture and society===\n[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by [[Robert Lewis Reid]] (1862\u20131929) in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

He lives with his brother ([[Sachin Khedekar]]), his sister-in-law ([[Savita Prabhune]]), and their child. He is a violent man, but often performs apparently good deeds, such as beating up sexual harassers.\n\nRadhe falls in love with Nirjara Bhardwaj ([[Bhumika Chawla]]), a student at his former college and the daughter of a poor temple priest. Radhe helps her a few times, and she seems to like him. One day, Radhe proposes to her, and jokingly remarks that he would beat up her father if he doesn't agree to their marriage. Nirjara is too shocked to say much, and utters \"Yes\" when Radhe asks her if she was listening to him. Radhe interprets this as her acceptance of the proposal. Later, he and his friends intimidate Nirjara's fianc\u00e9 Rameshwar ([[Ravi Kishan]]). Next day, Radhe brings her a gift, but she tells him that she does not love him, and calls him a goon. A heartbroken Radhe subsequently tries to talk to her, but she refuses to engage in a conversation.\n\nRadhe's friends suggest that he give up rowdyism and violence to impress Nirjara, but one day, he roughs up a brothel owner who had beaten up one of his friends. As Radhe is about to punch the brother owner, Nirjara arrives at the scene, and Radhe stops the violence, allowing the brothel owner to escape.  Subsequently, Nirjara's elder sister Mamata, who is in need of money, is nearly tricked into prostitution, when she visits the brothel to meet a man who promises her a loan. Radhe, who does not know that she is Nirjara's sister, visits the same brothel to find a man who had harassed a woman. He saves Mamata from being arrested during a police raid. She tells him that her husband Aatmaram has evicted her, and is demanding money to give her the custody of their son. Next day, Radhe beats up Aatmaram, forcing him to take her back and to stop harassing her. Rameshwar sees this, and tells Nirjara that Radhe is a good, selfless man, who truly loves her. Unaware of this conversation, Radhe abducts Nirjara so that she would listen to him express his feelings for her. Nirjara initially feels intimidated, but ultimately falls in love with him.\n\nSubsequently, the brothel owner and his goons attack Radhe. Radhe suffers brain damage during the attack, and loses his mental balance. His family admits him to a religious institution for mental patients, as Nirjara and his friends pray for him. At one point, Radhe's mental state returns to normal, but the wardens do not understand this, and beat him up. Nirjara visits the institution and sees him in a pitiful condition while he is sleeping. Convinced that Radhe is not going to get well, Radhe's brother asks her to forget him and marry Rameshwar. On the day of Nirjara's wedding with Rameshwar, Radhe escapes from the institution, and arrives at her home, only to find that she has committed suicide. Radhe then allows himself to be taken back to the institution despite his family and friends trying to persuade him otherwise. The epilogue shows Radhe, now old and still in the institution, tying peacock feathers in Nirjara's memory.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Actor\n!

He lives with his brother ([[Sachin Khedekar]]), his sister-in-law ([[Savita Prabhune]]), and their child. He is a violent man, but often performs apparently good deeds, such as beating up sexual harassers.\n\nRadhe falls in love with Nirjara Bhardwaj ([[Bhumika Chawla]]), a student at his former college and the daughter of a poor temple priest. Radhe helps her a few times, and she seems to like him. One day, Radhe proposes to her, and jokingly remarks that he would beat up her father if he doesn't agree to their marriage. Nirjara is too shocked to say much, and utters \"Yes\" when Radhe asks her if she was listening to him. Radhe interprets this as her acceptance of the proposal. Later, he and his friends intimidate Nirjara's fianc\u00e9 Rameshwar ([[Ravi Kishan]]). Next day, Radhe brings her a gift, but she tells him that she does not love him, and calls him a goon. A heartbroken Radhe subsequently tries to talk to her, but she refuses to engage in a conversation.\n\nRadhe's friends suggest that he give up rowdyism and violence to impress Nirjara, but one day, he roughs up a brothel owner who had beaten up one of his friends. As Radhe is about to punch the brother owner, Nirjara arrives at the scene, and Radhe stops the violence, allowing the brothel owner to escape.  Subsequently, Nirjara's elder sister Mamata, who is in need of money, is nearly tricked into prostitution, when she visits the brothel to meet a man who promises her a loan. Radhe, who does not know that she is Nirjara's sister, visits the same brothel to find a man who had harassed a woman. He saves Mamata from being arrested during a police raid. She tells him that her husband Aatmaram has evicted her, and is demanding money to give her the custody of their son. Next day, Radhe beats up Aatmaram, forcing him to take her back and to stop harassing her. Rameshwar sees this, and tells Nirjara that Radhe is a good, selfless man, who truly loves her. Unaware of this conversation, Radhe abducts Nirjara so that she would listen to him express his feelings for her. Nirjara initially feels intimidated, but ultimately falls in love with him.\n\nSubsequently, the brothel owner and his goons attack Radhe. Radhe suffers brain damage during the attack, and loses his mental balance. His family admits him to a religious institution for mental patients, as Nirjara and his friends pray for him. At one point, Radhe's mental state returns to normal, but the wardens do not understand this, and beat him up. Nirjara visits the institution and sees him in a pitiful condition while he is sleeping. Convinced that Radhe is not going to get well, Radhe's brother asks her to forget him and marry Rameshwar. On the day of Nirjara's wedding with Rameshwar, Radhe escapes from the institution, and arrives at her home, only to find that she has committed suicide. Radhe then allows himself to be taken back to the institution despite his family and friends trying to persuade him otherwise. The epilogue shows Radhe, now old and still in the institution, tying peacock feathers in Nirjara's memory.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Actor\n!

{"title_page": "Patrol boat", "text_new": "{{short description|Small naval vessel}}\n{{about|the naval vessel|the Australian TV series|Patrol Boat (TV series)}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\nA '''patrol boat''' (also referred to as a patrol craft, patrol ship or patrol vessel) is a relatively small [[naval ship|naval vessel]] generally designed for coastal defence duties. There have been many designs for patrol boats. They may be operated by a nation's [[navy]], [[coast guard]], [[police]] force or [[customs]] and may be intended for marine ([[Maritime geography|blue water]]) or [[estuary|estuarine]] or river (\"[[brown water]]\") environments. They are commonly found engaged in various border protection roles, including anti-[[smuggling]], anti-[[piracy]], [[fisheries]] patrols, and [[immigration law]] [[enforcement]]. They are also often called upon to participate in [[rescue]] operations. Vessels of this type include the original [[yacht]] (from Dutch/Low German ''jacht'' meaning hunting or hunt), a light, fast-sailing vessel used by the [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch navy]] to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into shallow waters.\n\n==Classification==\nThey may be broadly classified as inshore patrol vessels (IPVs) and offshore patrol vessels (OPVs). They are warships typically smaller in size than a [[corvette]] and can include [[fast attack craft]], [[torpedo boat]]s and [[missile boat]]s, although some are as large as a [[frigate]]. The offshore patrol vessels are usually the smallest ship in a navy's fleet that is large and seaworthy enough to patrol off-shore in the open [[ocean]]. In larger militaries, such as in the [[United States armed forces|United States military]], offshore patrol vessels usually serve in the coast guard, but many smaller nations navies operate these type of ships.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Pce-872c.jpg|thumb|left|''PCE-872'', a [[World War II]] patrol craft escort of the [[US Navy]] ]]\nDuring both World Wars in order to rapidly build up numbers, all sides created auxiliary patrol boats by arming [[motorboat]]s and seagoing [[fishing trawler]]s with machine guns and [[Obsolescence|obsolescent]] naval weapons. Some modern patrol vessels are still based on fishing and leisure boats. Seagoing patrol boats are typically around 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) in length and usually carry a single medium caliber [[Naval artillery|artillery gun]] as main armament, and a variety of lighter secondary armament such as machine guns or a [[close-in weapon system]]. Depending on role, vessels in this class may also have more sophisticated sensors and [[Fire-control system|fire control]] systems that would enable them to carry [[torpedo]]es, [[Anti-ship missile|anti-ship]] and [[surface-to-air missile]]s.\n\nMost modern designs are powered by [[gas turbine]] arrangements such as [[Combined diesel and gas|CODAG]], and speeds are generally in the {{convert|25|\u2013|30|kn}} range. They are primarily used for patrol in a country's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]. Common tasks are [[Fisheries management|fisheries inspection]], [[smuggling|anti-smuggling]] (usually [[Prohibition (drugs)|anti-narcotics]]) duties, [[illegal immigration]] patrols, anti-[[piracy]] patrols and [[search and rescue]] (law enforcement-type of work). The largest OPVs might also have a [[flight deck]] and [[helicopter]] embarked. In times of crisis or war, these vessels are expected to support the larger vessels in the navy.\n\nTheir small size and relatively low cost make them one of the most common type of warship in the world. Almost all navies operate at least a few offshore patrol vessels, especially those with only \"[[Green-water navy|green water]]\" capabilities.

Boat (TV series)}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\nA '''patrol boat''' (also referred to as a patrol craft, patrol ship or patrol vessel) is a relatively small [[naval ship|naval vessel]] generally designed for coastal defence duties. There have been many designs for patrol boats. They may be operated by a nation's [[navy]], [[coast guard]], [[police]] force or [[customs]] and may be intended for marine ([[Maritime geography|blue water]]) or [[estuary|estuarine]] or river (\"[[brown water]]\") environments. They are commonly found engaged in various border protection roles, including anti-[[smuggling]], anti-[[piracy]], [[fisheries]] patrols, and [[immigration law]] [[enforcement]]. They are also often called upon to participate in [[rescue]] operations. Vessels of this type include the original [[yacht]] (from Dutch/Low German ''jacht'' meaning hunting or hunt), a light, fast-sailing vessel used by the [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch navy]] to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into shallow waters.\n\n==Classification==\nThey may be broadly classified as inshore patrol vessels (IPVs) and offshore patrol vessels (OPVs). They are warships typically smaller in size than a [[corvette]] and can include [[fast attack craft]], [[torpedo boat]]s and [[missile boat]]s, although some are as large as a [[frigate]]. The offshore patrol vessels are usually the smallest ship in a navy's fleet that is large and seaworthy enough to patrol off-shore in the open [[ocean]]. In larger militaries, such as in the [[United States armed forces|United States military]], offshore patrol vessels usually serve in the coast guard, but many smaller nations navies operate these type of ships.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Pce-872c.jpg|thumb|left|''PCE-872'', a [[World War II]] patrol craft escort of the [[US Navy]] ]]\nDuring both World Wars in order to rapidly build up numbers, all sides created auxiliary patrol boats by arming [[motorboat]]s and seagoing [[fishing trawler]]s with machine guns and [[Obsolescence|obsolescent]] naval weapons. Some modern patrol vessels are still based on fishing and leisure boats. Seagoing patrol boats are typically around 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) in length and usually carry a single medium caliber [[Naval artillery|artillery gun]] as main armament, and a variety of lighter secondary armament such as machine guns or a [[close-in weapon system]]. Depending on role, vessels in this class may also have more sophisticated sensors and [[Fire-control system|fire control]] systems that would enable them to carry [[torpedo]]es, [[Anti-ship missile|anti-ship]] and [[surface-to-air missile]]s.\n\nMost modern designs are powered by [[gas turbine]] arrangements such as [[Combined diesel and gas|CODAG]], and speeds are generally in the {{convert|25|\u2013|30|kn}} range. They are primarily used for patrol in a country's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]]. Common tasks are [[Fisheries management|fisheries inspection]], [[smuggling|anti-smuggling]] (usually [[Prohibition (drugs)|anti-narcotics]]) duties, [[illegal immigration]] patrols, anti-[[piracy]] patrols and [[search and rescue]] (law enforcement-type of work). The largest OPVs might also have a [[flight deck]] and [[helicopter]] embarked. In times of crisis or war, these vessels are expected to support the larger vessels in the navy.\n\nTheir small size and relatively low cost make them one of the most common type of warship in the world. Almost all navies operate at least a few offshore patrol vessels, especially those with only \"[[Green-water navy|green water]]\" capabilities. They are useful in smaller seas such as the [[North Sea]] as well as in open oceans. Similar vessels for exclusively military duties include [[torpedo boat]]s and [[missile boat]]s. The [[United States Navy]] operated the {{sclass-|Pegasus|hydrofoil|4}} of armed hydrofoils for years, in a patrol boat role. The [[Patrol Boat, River|River Patrol Boat]] (PBR, sometimes called \"Riverine\" and \"Pibber\") is a U.S. design of small patrol boat type designed to patrol waters of large rivers.\n\n==Specific nations==\n\n===Albania===\n[[Image:Patrol Boat Iliria.jpg|thumb|{{ship|Albanian patrol vessel|Iliria|P 131|2}}, an example of a modern Patrol boat of the [[Albanian Naval Force]]]]\n*{{ship|Albanian patrol vessel|Iliria|P 131|2}} ([[Albanian Navy Brigade]])\n\n===Argentina===\n[[Image:Rio Uruguay garde cote argentin.jpg|thumb| [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]]'s ''GC67'' patrol vessel]]\n* {{sclass-|Mantilla|patrol vessel|1}}, [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]]\n* Z-28-class patrol vessel, Argentine Naval Prefecture\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:HMAS Armidale Darling Harbour.jpg|thumb|HMAS ''Armidale'' of the [[Royal Australian Navy]]]]\n* {{sclass-|Attack|patrol boat|1}}, ([[Royal Australian Navy]]) \u2013 1967 to 1985\n* {{sclass-|Fremantle|patrol boat|1}}, (Royal Australian Navy) \u2013 1979 to 2007\n* {{sclass2-|Pacific|patrol boat|1}}, (Australian built, gifted by Australian government to 12 [[Pacific Islands Forum|Pacific Island]] countries), 1987\u2013present\n* {{Sclass-|Armidale|patrol boat|1}}, (Royal Australian Navy) \u2013 2005 to present\n* {{sclass-|Arafura|offshore patrol vessel|1}}, ([[Royal Australian Navy]]) \u2013 Expected to enter service in 2021\n* {{sclass2-|Bay|patrol boat|1}}, ([[Customs Marine Unit (Australia)|Australian Border Force Marine Unit]]) \u2013 1999 to present\n* [[RV Triton#Australian Customs|Australian Customs Vessel ''Triton'']], (Australian Border Force Marine Unit) \u2013 2000 to 2016\n* {{sclass2-|Cape|patrol boat|1}}, (Australian Border Force Marine Unit) \u2013 Bay class replacement from 2013\n\n===Bahamas===\n* {{sclass2-|Bahamas|patrol vessel|1}}, ([[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]])\n* {{sclass2-|Protector|patrol boat|1}}\n\n===Bangladesh===\n[[File:BNS Nirmul.jpg|thumb|{{ship|BNS|Nirmul}}, a {{sclass-|Durjoy|patrol craft|1}} of the [[Bangladesh Navy]]]]\n* {{sclass-|Durjoy|patrol craft|1}}\n* {{sclass2-|Island|patrol vessel|1}}\n* [[BNS Madhumati|Sea Dragon-class]] offshore patrol vessel\n* {{sclass-|Padma|patrol vessel|0}} offshore patrol vessel ([[Bangladesh Navy]])\n* {{sclass-|Meghna|patrol boat|1}} ([[Bangladesh Navy]])\n* [[Type 037 corvette|Hainan-class]] submarine chaser\n* [[BNS Karnafuli|Kraljevica-class patrol boat]]\n* [[Type 062 gunboat#Haizhui-class submarine chaser|Barkat (Haizhui)-class patrol boat]]\n* {{sclass-|Ajay|patrol boat|1}}\n* [[Type 062 gunboat|Shaheed (Shanghai II)-class patrol boat]]\n\n===Brazil===\n* [[Brazilian patrol boat Graja\u00fa (P40)|''Graja\u00fa''-class]] offshore patrol vessel\n* ''Bracu\u00ed''-class patrol vessel (ex-{{sclass2-|River|minesweeper|1}})\n* [[Brazilian corvette Caboclo (V19)|''Imperial Marinheiro''-class]] offshore patrol vessel\n* ''Piratini''-class patrol vessel\n* ''J''-class patrol vessel\n* ''Roraima''-class river patrol vessel\n* ''Pedro Teixeira''-class river patrol vessel\n* {{sclass-|Maca\u00e9|patrol vessel|0}} offshore patrol vessel\n* {{sclass-|Amazonas|corvette|1}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Brazil_getting_armored_vehicles_boats_999.html|title=Brazil getting armored vehicles, boats|last=<!--Staff-->|first=|date=10 August 2012|work=Space War|access-date=19 August 2017<!--in archive.is; excluded from archive.org by robots.txt-->|publisher=Space Media Network|agency=UPI|quote=The first-of-class Amazonas was constructed at BAE Systems' Portsmouth facility.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baesystems.com/product/BAES_027244|title=Offshore Patrol Vessels|last=<!--Staff-->|date=n.d.|publisher=BAE Systems|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130117145345/http://www.baesystems.com/product/BAES_027244?_afrLoop=4642021291097000&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null&baeSessionId=yqLmQ4QhyVS3gJm1FF1L2wHGZV8R2MzT7CKnpT11mcyNBQ5PNhby!791695071|archive-date=17 January 2013|url-status=dead|quote=We are supplying three Ocean Patrol Vessels and ancillary support services to the Brazilian Navy, as well as a manufacturing licence to enable further vessels of the same class to be constructed in Brazil.

{"title_page": "Physician supply", "text_new": "'''Physician supply''' refers to the number of trained [[physician]]s working in a [[health care system]] or active in the [[labour market]].<ref name=\"Handbook\">Dal Poz MR et al. [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241547703_eng.pdf ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health.''] Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009.</ref> The supply depends primarily on the number of graduates of [[medical school]]s in a country or jurisdiction, but also on the number who continue to practice [[medicine]] as a [[career]] path and who remain in their country of origin. The number of physicians needed in a given context depends on several different factors, including the [[demographics]] and [[epidemiology]] of the local population, the numbers and types of other [[health care provider#Practitioners and professionals|health care practitioners]] working in the system, as well as the [[health policy|policies]] and goals in place of the health care system.<ref name=\"Models\">World Health Organization.

A '''physician shortage''' is a situation in which there are not enough [[physicians]] to treat all [[patient]]s in need of medical care. This can be observed at the level of a given [[health care provider|health care facility]], a province/state, a country, or worldwide.\n\nGlobally, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses and other [[Health Human Resources|health workers]] worldwide,<ref name=\"WHR2006\">World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 ''The world health report 2006: working together for health.''] Geneva, 2006.</ref> especially in many [[developing countries]]. Developing nations often have physician shortages due to limited numbers and capacity of medical schools and because of international migration: physicians can usually earn much more money and enjoy better working conditions in other countries.  Many developed countries also report doctor shortages, and this traditionally happened in rural and other underserved areas. Reports as recent as January 2019 show that high growth areas like Phoenix, Arizona are experiencing shortages.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Ciaramella | first = Sierra  | title = Health care organizations work to combat the doctor shortage | publisher = Chamber Business News| date = 2019-01-31 | url = http://chamberbusinessnews.com/2019/01/31/health-care-organizations-work-to-combat-the-doctor-shortage/ | accessdate = 2019-02-05}}</ref>  Shortages exist and are growing in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Cauchon | first = Dennis  | title = Medical miscalculation creates doctor shortage | publisher = USATODAY.com | date = 2005-03-02 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-03-02-doctor-shortage_x.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  | last = Ramirez | first = Marc  | title = Rural doctor shortage called \"a crisis\" in Washington | publisher = The Seattle Times | date = 2009-04-18 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/health/2009078934_ruraldocs18m0.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news  | last = Halsey III | first = Ashley  | title = Primary-Care Doctor Shortage May Undermine Reform Efforts | publisher = The Washington Post | date = 2009-06-20 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903583.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Feasby | first = Tom  | title = Medical schools are working hard to help cure the doctor shortage  | publisher = The Globe and Mail | date = 2009-03-30 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/medical-schools-are-working-hard-to-help-cure-the-doctor-shortage/article663115/ | accessdate = 2009-08-20 | location=Toronto}}</ref>\n\nSeveral causes of the current and anticipated shortages have been suggested; however, not everyone agrees that there is a true physician shortage, at least not in the United States. On the [[Kevin Pho|KevinMD]] medical news blog, for example, it has been argued that inefficiencies introduced into the healthcare system, often driven by government initiatives, have reduced the number of patients physicians can see; by forcing physicians to spend much of their time on data entry and public health issues, these initiatives have limited the physicians' time available for direct patient care.<ref>{{cite web | title = A debate on what we need our doctors to do | publisher = KevinMD | date = 2014-05-15 | url = http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/05/debate-doctors.html | accessdate = 2014-05-21}}</ref>\n\n==Determinants==\n\n===Economic theory and trends===\n[[File:Merlin Darfur.jpg|thumb|Patients queue to see a doctor in South Sudan]]\nAnything that changes the number of available physicians or the demand for their services affects the [[supply and demand]] balance. If the number of physicians is decreased, or the demand for their services increases, then an ''under''-supply or shortage can result. If the number of physicians increases, or demand for their services decreases, then an ''over''-supply can result.\n\nSubstitution factors can significantly affect the production of physician services and the availability of physicians to see more patients. For example, an [[accountant]] can replace some of the financial responsibilities for a physician who owns his or her own practice, allowing for more time to treat patients. Disposable supplies can substitute for labor and capital (the time and equipment needed to sterilize instruments). Sound record keeping by physicians can substitute for legal services by avoiding malpractice suits. However, the extent of substitution of physician production is limited by technical and legal factors. Technology cannot replace all skills possessed by physicians, such as surgical skill sets. Legal factors can include only allowing licensed physicians to perform surgeries, but nurses or doctors administering other surgical care.<ref>Charles Phelps, Health Economics (4th edition), (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 2010</ref>\n\nDemand of physicians is also dependent on a country's economic status. Especially in developing nations, health care spending is closely related to growth of their [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP). Theoretically, as GDP increases, the health care labor force expands and in turn, physician supply also increases.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.21.1.140|pmid = 11900066|title = Economic and Demographic Trends Signal an Impending Physician Shortage|journal = Health Affairs|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 140\u2013154|year = 2002|last1 = Cooper|first1 = Richard A.|last2 = Getzen|first2 = Thomas E.|last3 = McKee|first3 = Heather J.|last4 = Laud|first4 = Prakash}}</ref> However, developing countries face additional challenges in retaining competent physicians to higher-income countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullan|first1=Fitzhugh|title=The metrics of the physician brain drain.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=27 October 2005|volume=353|issue=17|pages=1810\u20138|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa050004|pmid=16251537}}{{open access}}</ref> Emigration of physicians from lower-income and developing countries contribute to [[Brain drain]], creating issues on maintaining sufficient physician supply. However, higher-income countries can also experience an outflow of physicians who decide to return to their naturalized countries after receiving extensive education and training, without ever benefiting from their gained medical knowledge and skill set.\n\n===Number of physicians trained===\nIncreasing the number of students enrolled in existing [[medical school]]s is one way to address physician shortage,<ref>{{cite web | last = Burk | first = Jennifer  | title = Medical Schools Look to Grow as Doctor Shortage Looms | publisher = Wisconsin Healthcare Workforce Development | date = 2007-05-14 | url = http://www.dwd.state.wi.us/healthcare/Archive2007/medical_schools_grow_dr_shortage_looms.htm | accessdate = 2009-08-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> or increasing the number of schools,<ref>{{cite news  | last = Beene  | first = Ryan  | title = Medical schools multiplying, but may not solve doctor shortage | pages =  | publisher = Bridging 96 | date = 2009-03-18 | url = http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20090318/BRIDGING96/903169989/1123 | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref> but other factors may also play a role.\n\nBecoming a physician requires either [[Doctor of Medicine|several years of training]] beyond [[undergraduate education]], or a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|professional undergraduate degree]] with a duration longer than that of a typical undergraduate degree. Consequently, physician supply is affected by the number of students eligible for medical training. Students that do not finish earlier levels of education, including [[high school dropout]]s and in some places those that leave university without an [[undergraduate degree|undergraduate]] or [[associate degree]], do not qualify for entrance to [[medical school]]. The more people that fail to complete the prerequisites, the fewer people become eligible for training as physicians.<ref name=\"Handbook\"/><ref>{{cite web | last = Murphy | first = Mike | author2 = Tim Anderson | title = Dropout rates draw attention | publisher = The Midwestern Office of The Council of State Governments | date = October 2008 | url = http://www.csgmidwest.org/memberservices/Publications/SLMW/2008/October/p1.pdf | accessdate = 2009-08-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091008044231/http://www.csgmidwest.org/MemberServices/Publications/SLMW/2008/October/p1.pdf | archive-date = 2009-10-08 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nIn most countries, the number of placements for students in medical schools and [[Internship (medicine)|clinical internships]] is limited, typically according to the number of teachers and other resources, including the amount of funding provided by governments.<ref name=\"Handbook\"/> In many countries that do not charge [[tuition payments]] to prospective physicians, public funding is the only significant limitation on the number of physicians trained. In the United States, the [[American Medical Association]] says that federal funding is the most important limitation in the supply of physicians. The high cost of tuition combined with the cost of supporting oneself during medical school discourages some people from enrolling to become a physician.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Lee | first = Frank  | title = Experts foresee doctor shortage | publisher = sctimes.com | date = 2009-07-26 | url = http://www.sctimes.com/article/20090726/NEWS01/107260024/1009/Experts-foresee-doctor-shortage | accessdate = }}</ref>   Limited [[scholarship]]s and financial aid to medical students may exacerbate this problem,<ref>{{cite news  | last = Rogers | first = Christina  | title = Doctor shortage worsens as student debt rises | publisher = AllBusiness.com | date = 2008-06-18 | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-medical-education/12131282-1.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120716234245/http://www.allbusiness.com/education-training/curricula-medical-education/12131282-1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-07-16 | accessdate = 2009-08-20 }}</ref> while low expected pay for practicing physicians in some countries may convince some that the cost is not appropriate.<ref name=rocons>{{cite web | last = Financiar | first = Ziarul  | title = Doctors can earn over Euro 20,000 per month in private clinics | publisher = Honorary Consulate of Romania | date = 2008-01-24 | url = http://www.roconsulboston.com/Pages/InfoPages/Businesspages/DoctorPrivate08.html | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}</ref>\n\nIt has been speculated that politics and social conditions can sometimes motivate medical student placements.

As of 2010, the WHO proposes a ratio of at least one [[primary care physician]] per 1000 people to sufficiently attend the basic needs of the population in a developed country.<ref name=\"Models\"/>\n\nFor example, [[population ageing]] has been attributed with increased demand for physician services in many countries, as more previously young and healthy people become older with increased likelihood of a variety of [[non-communicable diseases|chronic medical conditions]] associated with ageing, such as [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], [[osteoporosis]], and some types of [[cancer]]s and [[neurodegenerative]] diseases.\n\n====Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (U.S.)====\nIn the United States, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] has expanded health insurance coverage and access to an estimated 32 million United States citizens, increasing the demand of physicians, especially [[primary care physicians]], across the country.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf |title = Summary of the Affordable Care Act|date = 2013-04-25}}</ref> Expanded coverage is predicted to increase the number of annual primary care visits between 15.07 million and 24.26 million by 2019.

Incentives and higher reimbursement rates may have increased the number of physicians accepting Medicaid patients leading up to 2014. With the expansion of Medicaid and a decrease in incentives and reimbursement rates in 2014, the supply of physicians in Medicaid may drop substantially, fluctuating the supply of Medicaid physicians.

On the [[Kevin Pho|KevinMD]] medical news blog, for example, it has been argued that inefficiencies introduced into the healthcare system, often driven by government initiatives, have reduced the number of patients physicians can see; by forcing physicians to spend much of their time on data entry and public health issues, these initiatives have limited the physicians' time available for direct patient care.<ref>{{cite web | title = A debate on what we need our doctors to do | publisher = KevinMD | date = 2014-05-15 | url = http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/05/debate-doctors.html | accessdate = 2014-05-21}}</ref>\n\n==Determinants==\n\n===Economic theory and trends===\n[[File:Merlin Darfur.jpg|thumb|Patients queue to see a doctor in South Sudan]]\nAnything that changes the number of available physicians or the demand for their services affects the [[supply and demand]] balance. If the number of physicians is decreased, or the demand for their services increases, then an ''under''-supply or shortage can result. If the number of physicians increases, or demand for their services decreases, then an ''over''-supply can result.\n\nSubstitution factors can significantly affect the production of physician services and the availability of physicians to see more patients. For example, an [[accountant]] can replace some of the financial responsibilities for a physician who owns his or her own practice, allowing for more time to treat patients. Disposable supplies can substitute for labor and capital (the time and equipment needed to sterilize instruments). Sound record keeping by physicians can substitute for legal services by avoiding malpractice suits. However, the extent of substitution of physician production is limited by technical and legal factors. Technology cannot replace all skills possessed by physicians, such as surgical skill sets. Legal factors can include only allowing licensed physicians to perform surgeries, but nurses or doctors administering other surgical care.<ref>Charles Phelps, Health Economics (4th edition), (Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 2010</ref>\n\nDemand of physicians is also dependent on a country's economic status. Especially in developing nations, health care spending is closely related to growth of their [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP). Theoretically, as GDP increases, the health care labor force expands and in turn, physician supply also increases.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.21.1.140|pmid = 11900066|title = Economic and Demographic Trends Signal an Impending Physician Shortage|journal = Health Affairs|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 140\u2013154|year = 2002|last1 = Cooper|first1 = Richard A.|last2 = Getzen|first2 = Thomas E.|last3 = McKee|first3 = Heather J.|last4 = Laud|first4 = Prakash}}</ref> However, developing countries face additional challenges in retaining competent physicians to higher-income countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], and [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullan|first1=Fitzhugh|title=The metrics of the physician brain drain.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=27 October 2005|volume=353|issue=17|pages=1810\u20138|doi=10.1056/NEJMsa050004|pmid=16251537}}{{open access}}</ref> Emigration of physicians from lower-income and developing countries contribute to [[Brain drain]], creating issues on maintaining sufficient physician supply.

Consequently, physician supply is affected by the number of students eligible for medical training. Students that do not finish earlier levels of education, including [[high school dropout]]s and in some places those that leave university without an [[undergraduate degree|undergraduate]] or [[associate degree]], do not qualify for entrance to [[medical school]].

As of 2010, the WHO proposes a ratio of at least one [[primary care physician]] per 1000 people to sufficiently attend the basic needs of the population in a developed country.<ref name=\"Models\"/>\n\nFor example, [[population ageing]] has been attributed with increased demand for physician services in many countries, as more previously young and healthy people become older with increased likelihood of a variety of [[non-communicable diseases|chronic medical conditions]] associated with ageing, such as [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]], [[osteoporosis]], and some types of [[cancer]]s and [[neurodegenerative]] diseases.\n\n====Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (U.S.)====\nIn the United States, the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] has expanded health insurance coverage and access to an estimated 32 million United States citizens, increasing the demand of physicians, especially [[primary care physicians]], across the country.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.kff.org/healthreform/upload/8061.pdf |title = Summary of the Affordable Care Act|date = 2013-04-25}}</ref> Expanded coverage is predicted to increase the number of annual primary care visits between 15.07 million and 24.26 million by 2019.

Incentives and higher reimbursement rates may have increased the number of physicians accepting Medicaid patients leading up to 2014. With the expansion of Medicaid and a decrease in incentives and reimbursement rates in 2014, the supply of physicians in Medicaid may drop substantially, fluctuating the supply of Medicaid physicians. A study examining variation between states in 2005 showed that average time for Medicaid reimbursements was directly correlated with Medicaid participation, and physicians in states with faster reimbursement times had a higher probability of accepting new Medicaid patients.<ref>http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/28/1/w17.full.pdf+html</ref>\n\n==Effects of physician shortage==\n[[File:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified with critical shortages of physicians and other health care workers]]\nPhysician shortages have been linked to a number of effects, including:\n*Lower quantity of medical care for [[patient]]s, thereby limiting the ability of health systems to meet [[primary health care]] goals, such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=\"WHR2006\"/>\n*Lower quality of medical care for patients, due to shorter doctor visits.<ref>http://www.parents.com/family-life/fitness/mom-health/shrinking-doctors-appointment/ {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n*Increased workload and too many patients per doctor resulting in overworked and sleep-deprived doctors, thereby compromising [[patient safety]].<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/shortage-pushes-doctors-to-limit/2007/04/19/1176697005237.html?page=fullpage ''Shortage pushes doctors to limit''.] Posted by Jill Stark, April 20, 2007.</ref><ref>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/05/070520130105.htm ''Approved Medical Resident Hours Still Resulting In Sleepy Doctors''.] Posted by ''ScienceDaily'' (May 21, 2007).</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1546317/Sleepy-doctors-admit-to-mistakes.html ''\"Sleepy\" doctors admit to mistakes''.] Posted by Celia Hall, ''The Telegraph'', 22 Mar 2007.</ref>\n*Unnecessary patient deaths while waiting for health care.<ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/16/1661 ''Private Health Care in Canada''.] Posted by Robert Steinbrook, ''N Engl J Med'' 2006; 354:1661\u20131664; April 20, 2006.</ref>\n*Higher prices for practicing physicians due to less competition, by the rules of [[supply and demand]] in market-driven [[Health economics|health care economies]].<ref>\n[http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=2671 ''America's reliance on foreign doctors''.] Posted by the National Center for Policy Analysis, December 19, 2005.</ref>\n*Lower medical costs to consumers.
