Her mother was strict and cold-tempered, but her father was joyful and caring. He was from the D\u017eambaz community, known for its horse traders, but worked as a plumber. As a child, Usnija Red\u017eepova was very shy, a personality trait she kept her all life. She soon discovered however that she enjoyed being on stage during folk performances. Around 1963, she took part in a [[karaoke]] contest organised by Radio Skopje. She sang and danced ''Ajde da igramo tvist'' (\"Let's Dance [[Twist (dance)|Twist]]\"), a pop song by [[Radmila Karaklaji\u0107]]. Her performance was acclaimed and officials from the radio station tried to convince her father to let her become a professional singer. At that time, singing was not considered as a reputable career in the Romani community, especially for women. Her father wanted his daughter to finish her secondary studies and become a good wife. Even after she had become famous, he would still be critical of the way his daughter dressed and acted on stage.<ref name=\"Globus2\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== Debut ===\nUsnija Red\u017eepova started performing soon after completing her secondary studies. Although she made come true her father's old dream to study Arabic at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology]], she had to sing in caf\u00e9s to get enough money to live. Most of her friends in Belgrade were from Macedonia and she met Nasko D\u017eorlev, a Macedonian musician who had his own ensemble. She joined them and toured Yugoslavia for 5 years.<ref name=\"Ibarske\">{{Cite journal|title=Indiferentna prema karijeri|author=T.

As [[Esma Red\u017eepova]], another singer from Macedonia, had already signed with Jugoton, the label decided to rename the singer \"Usnija Ja\u0161arova\" to avoid any confusion. \"Ja\u0161arova\" was made up with the forename of Usnija's father, Ja\u0161ar.<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/> The first EP was recorded in duet with another folk singer, Ivanka Jovanovska, while the second only contained songs by Usnija. The main title, ''D\u017eulo, D\u017eulo'', quickly became a hit in Yugoslavia. The two disks where recorded in Serbian but the singer released a third EP in 1968 containing only Romani songs. Together with Vaska Ilieva and An\u0111elka Govedarovi\u0107, two other folk singers, Usnija was sent to Australia in 1969 to perform for the Yugoslav diaspora. She also sang for the army in [[Croatia]] in 1971.<ref name=\"Globus2\"/>\n\n=== ''Ko\u0161tana'' ===\nBy 1973, Usnija Red\u017eepova had experienced success and had started a promising career. However, she was still studying at the university and was feeling very tired. She had not realised that her success was exceptional and had an unassuming approach to it. That year, [[\u017darko Jovanovi\u0107]], a prominent Serbian-Romani artist, wanted her to play in his new adaptation of ''[[Ko\u0161tana]]'', a popular play in Serbia telling the story of a Gypsy girl. As she had almost withdrawn from the scene, he was not able to find her until another Macedonian-Romani singer, [[Muharem Serbezovski]], introduced Red\u017eepova to him.<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/>\n\nAlthough Red\u017eepova was worried about having to play and sing in an academic setting, she joined the [[National Theatre in Belgrade]] to perform ''Ko\u0161tana''. She stayed there for 26 years, until the beginning of the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] in 1999. The play was a large success and Usnija Red\u017eepova described her time there as euphoric. Although she had to give up her studies, she had the opportunity to visit some Arabic countries, including [[Sudan]] where she performed for Yugoslav workers. President [[Josip Broz Tito]] is said to have been an admirer and she performed for him and [[Fidel Castro]] when he was on a visit in the [[Brionian Islands]]. The cultural organisation responsible for her tours abroad, \"Beogradska estrada\", also permitted her to perform in [[Western countries]].<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/> Throughout the 1970s, she released many singles and EPs, including some in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Her first album was released in 1977.\n\n=== Later years ===\nAfter the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], Usnija Red\u017eepova considered putting an end to her career because she was devastated by the death of her country. Nonetheless, she continued to release albums until 2007 but she ended up in a difficult financial situation after her husband's death in 2005.<ref name=\"Globus4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globusmagazin.com.mk/?ItemID=AC15310E6011BE4BA09A9DBE6C228074|title=\u0423\u0421\u041d\u0418\u0408\u0410 \u041d\u0410 \u0421\u041b\u0410\u041c\u041a\u0410 (4): \u0422\u0418\u0422\u041e \u0420\u0415\u0427\u0415 \"\u0408\u0410 \u0417\u0410\u0413\u0423\u0411\u0418\u0412\u041c\u0415 \u041d\u0410\u0428\u0410\u0422\u0410 \u0423\u0421\u041d\u0418\u0408\u0410\"|publisher=Globus|year=2007}}</ref> She received a national pension from the Serbian government on 29 December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u041c\u0438\u0440\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Kultura/EKSKLUZIVNO-Dobitnici-nacionalnih-penzija.sr.html|title=\u0415\u041a\u0421\u041a\u041b\u0423\u0417\u0418\u0412\u041d\u041e: \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430: \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430: \u041f\u041e\u041b\u0418\u0422\u0418\u041a\u0410|publisher=Politika.rs|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nRed\u017eepova died on 1 October 2015 in [[Belgrade]] after a three-year long battle with lung cancer.

Although she made come true her father's old dream to study Arabic at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology]], she had to sing in caf\u00e9s to get enough money to live. Most of her friends in Belgrade where from Macedonia and she met Nasko D\u017eorlev, a Macedonian musician who had his own ensemble. She joined them and toured Yugoslavia for 5 years.<ref name=\"Ibarske\">{{Cite journal|title=Indiferentna prema karijeri|author=T. Radovanovi\u0107|date=19 August 2011|page=20|journal=Ibarske Novine|url=http://issuu.com/novine/docs/ibarske_novosti_2975}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, she released her first disks, two [[extended play|EPs]] produced by [[Jugoton]], one of the largest Yugoslav labels. As [[Esma Red\u017eepova]], another singer from Macedonia, had already signed with Jugoton, the label decided to rename the singer \"Usnija Ja\u0161arova\" to avoid any confusion. \"Ja\u0161arova\" was made up with the forename of Usnija's father, Ja\u0161ar.<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/> The first EP was recorded in duet with another folk singer, Ivanka Jovanovska, while the second only contained songs by Usnija. The main title, ''D\u017eulo, D\u017eulo'', quickly became a hit in Yugoslavia. The two disks where recorded in Serbian but the singer released a third EP in 1968 containing only Romani songs. Together with Vaska Ilieva and An\u0111elka Govedarovi\u0107, two other folk singers, Usnija was sent to Australia in 1969 to perform for the Yugoslav diaspora. She also sang for the army in [[Croatia]] in 1971.<ref name=\"Globus2\"/>\n\n=== ''Ko\u0161tana'' ===\nBy 1973, Usnija Red\u017eepova had experienced success and had started a promising career. However, she was still studying at the university and was feeling very tired. She had not realised that her success was exceptional and had an unassuming approach to it. That year, [[\u017darko Jovanovi\u0107]], a prominent Serbian-Romani artist, wanted her to play in his new adaptation of ''[[Ko\u0161tana]]'', a popular play in Serbia telling the story of a Gypsy girl. As she had almost withdrawn from the scene, he was not able to find her until another Macedonian-Romani singer, [[Muharem Serbezovski]], introduced Red\u017eepova to him.<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/>\n\nAlthough Red\u017eepova was worried about having to play and sing in an academic setting, she joined the [[National Theatre in Belgrade]] to perform ''Ko\u0161tana''. She stayed there for 26 years, until the beginning of the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] in 1999. The play was a large success and Usnija Red\u017eepova described her time there as euphoric. Although she had to give up her studies, she had the opportunity to visit some Arabic countries, including [[Sudan]] where she performed for Yugoslav workers. President [[Josip Broz Tito]] is said to have been an admirer and she performed for him and [[Fidel Castro]] when he was on a visit in the [[Brionian Islands]]. The cultural organisation responsible for her tours abroad, \"Beogradska estrada\", also permitted her to perform in [[Western countries]].<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/> Throughout the 1970s, she released many singles and EPs, including some in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Her first album was released in 1977.\n\n=== Later years ===\nAfter the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], Usnija Red\u017eepova considered putting an end to her career because she was devastated by the death of her country. Nonetheless, she continued to release albums until 2007 but she ended up in a difficult financial situation after her husband's death in 2005.<ref name=\"Globus4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globusmagazin.com.mk/?ItemID=AC15310E6011BE4BA09A9DBE6C228074|title=\u0423\u0421\u041d\u0418\u0408\u0410 \u041d\u0410 \u0421\u041b\u0410\u041c\u041a\u0410 (4): \u0422\u0418\u0422\u041e \u0420\u0415\u0427\u0415 \"\u0408\u0410 \u0417\u0410\u0413\u0423\u0411\u0418\u0412\u041c\u0415 \u041d\u0410\u0428\u0410\u0422\u0410 \u0423\u0421\u041d\u0418\u0408\u0410\"|publisher=Globus|year=2007}}</ref> She received a national pension from the Serbian government on 29 December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u041c\u0438\u0440\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b|url=http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Kultura/EKSKLUZIVNO-Dobitnici-nacionalnih-penzija.sr.html|title=\u0415\u041a\u0421\u041a\u041b\u0423\u0417\u0418\u0412\u041d\u041e: \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430: \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430: \u041f\u041e\u041b\u0418\u0422\u0418\u041a\u0410|publisher=Politika.rs|date=13 January 2012|accessdate=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nRed\u017eepova died on 1 October 2015 in [[Belgrade]] after a three-year long battle with lung cancer.

The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually throughout the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed.\n\nDespite Harry's aunt and uncle's desperate prevention of Harry learning about his abilities,<ref name=\"hp-stories\" /> their efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant, [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who is also his first contact with the wizarding world. Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts as well as some of Harry's history.<ref name=\"hp-stories\" /> Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who subsequently attempted to kill him as well.<ref name=\"hp-stories\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2007-07-19-potter-books_N.htm|title=The Harry Potter stories so far: A quick CliffsNotes review|work=USA Today|accessdate=28 September 2008|first=Carol|last=Memmott|date=19 July 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218023806/http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2007-07-19-potter-books_N.htm|archivedate=18 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Instead, the unexpected happened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack, and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards, gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse.\n\nAs its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a [[Living legend (person)|living legend]] in the wizarding world. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard [[Albus Dumbledore]], the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant [[Muggle]] relatives, the Dursleys, who have kept him safe but treated him poorly, including confining him to a cupboard without meals and treating him as their servant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years, from age eleven to seventeen.\n\nWith Hagrid's help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: [[Ron Weasley]], a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and [[Hermione Granger]], a gifted, bright, and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage.<ref name=\"hp-stories\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|title=J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|date=15 August 2004|publisher=J.K.

He also discovers a talent of flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house's Quidditch team, a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks. The first book concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the [[Sorcerer's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold.<ref name=\"hp-stories\" />\n\nThe series continues with ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', describing Harry's second year at Hogwarts. He and his friends investigate a 50-year-old mystery that appears uncannily related to recent sinister events at the school. Ron's younger sister, [[Ginny Weasley]], enrolls in her first year at Hogwarts, and finds an old notebook in her belongings which turns out to be the diary of a previous student, Tom Marvolo Riddle, later revealed to be Voldemort's younger self, who is bent on ridding the school of \"mudbloods\", a derogatory term describing wizards and witches of non-magical parentage. The memory of Tom Riddle resides inside of the diary and when Ginny begins to confide in the diary, Voldemort is able to possess her.\n\nThrough the diary, Ginny acts on Voldemort's orders and unconsciously opens the \"Chamber of Secrets\", unleashing an ancient monster, later revealed to be a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]], which begins attacking students at Hogwarts. It kills those who make direct eye contact with it and petrifies those who look at it indirectly. The book also introduces a new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], a highly cheerful, self-conceited wizard with a pretentious facade, later turning out to be a fraud. Harry discovers that prejudice exists in the Wizarding World through delving into the school's history, and learns that Voldemort's reign of terror was often directed at wizards and witches who were descended from Muggles.\n\nHarry also learns that his ability to speak the snake language [[Parseltongue]] is rare and often associated with the [[Black magic|Dark Arts]]. When Hermione is attacked and petrified, Harry and Ron finally piece together the puzzles and unlock the Chamber of Secrets, with Harry destroying the diary for good and saving Ginny, and, as they learn later, also destroying a part of Voldemort's soul. The end of the book reveals Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father and rival of Ron and Ginny's father, to be the culprit who slipped the book into Ginny's belongings.\n\nThe third novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', follows Harry in his third year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form. Instead, Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by [[Sirius Black]], his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the [[dementors]] \u2013 dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair \u2013 which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to [[Remus Lupin]], a [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher who is eventually revealed to be a [[werewolf]]. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, [[Scabbers|Peter Pettigrew]], who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.<ref name=\"hp-plot-azkaban\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/books/rowling-azkaban.html|title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|last=Maguire|first=Gregory|date=5 September 1999|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713062301/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/books/rowling-azkaban.html|archivedate=13 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised \u2013 in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.\n\n=== Voldemort returns ===\n[[File:The Elephant House.jpg|thumb|[[The Elephant House (Edinburgh Caf\u00e9)|The Elephant House]] was one of the caf\u00e9s in [[Edinburgh]] where Rowling wrote the first part of ''Harry Potter''.|alt=\"The Elephant House\", a small, painted red caf\u00e9 where Rowling wrote a few chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]\nDuring Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''), Harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous yet exciting contest where three \"champions\", one from each participating school, must compete with each other in three tasks in order to win the Triwizard Cup.

The point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series' shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict. Voldemort's plan to have Crouch use the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds. Although Harry manages to escape, [[Cedric Diggory]], the other Hogwarts champion in the tournament, is killed by Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort re-enters the Wizarding World with a physical body.\n\nIn the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In response to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark family home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the [[Ministry of Magic]] and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned. In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the Wizarding World attempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints [[Dolores Umbridge]] as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/books/review/rowling-phoenix.html |title=Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix |date=13 July 2003 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=28 September 2008 |first=John |last=Leonard |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517174431/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/books/review/rowling-phoenix.html |archivedate=17 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHermione and Ron form \"[[Dumbledore's Army]]\", a secret study group in which Harry agrees to teach his classmates the higher-level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts that he has learned from his previous encounters with Dark wizards. Through those lessons, Harry begins to develop a crush on the popular and attractive [[Cho Chang]]. Juggling schoolwork, Umbridge's incessant and persistent efforts to land him in trouble and the defensive lessons, Harry begins to lose sleep as he constantly receives disturbing dreams about a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic, followed by a burning desire to learn more.

In the novel's climax, Harry is tricked into seeing Sirius tortured and races to the Ministry of Magic. He and his friends face off against Voldemort's followers (nicknamed [[Death Eaters]]) at the [[Ministry of Magic]]. Although the timely arrival of members of the Order of the Phoenix saves the teenagers' lives, [[Sirius Black]] is killed in the conflict.\n\nIn the sixth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Voldemort begins waging open warfare. Harry and his friends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts. They are subject to all the difficulties of adolescence \u2013 Harry eventually begins dating Ginny, Ron establishes a strong infatuation with fellow Hogwarts student [[Lavender Brown]], and Hermione starts to develop romantic feelings towards Ron. Near the beginning of the novel, lacking his own book, Harry is given an old potions textbook filled with many annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer titled; \"the Half-Blood Prince.\" This book is a source of scholastic success and great recognition from their new potions master, [[Horace Slughorn]], but because of the potency of the spells that are written in it, becomes a source of concern.\n\nWith war drawing near, Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore, who shows him various memories concerning the early life of Voldemort in a device called a [[Pensieve]]. These reveal that in order to preserve his life, Voldemort has split his soul into pieces, used to create a series of [[Horcrux]]es \u2013 evil enchanted items hidden in various locations, one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book.<ref name=\"harry-potter-prince\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/16/books/16choc.html |title=Harry Potter Works His Magic Again in a Far Darker Tale |last=Kakutani |first=Michiko |date=16 July 2005 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=28 September 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416015406/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/16/books/16choc.html |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Draco, who has joined with the Death Eaters, attempts to attack Dumbledore upon his return from collecting a Horcrux, and the book culminates in the killing of Dumbledore by [[Professor Snape]], the titular Half-Blood Prince.\n\n''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', the last original novel in the series, begins directly after the events of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease, Harry and the Dursleys separate, and Hermione wipes her parents' memories and sends them abroad.\n\nAs the trio searches for the Horcruxes, they learn details about an ancient prophecy of the Deathly Hallows, three legendary items that when united under one Keeper, would supposedly allow that person to be the Master of Death. Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one of those items, and Voldemort to be searching for another: the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in history. At the end of the book, Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives \u2013 he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Eventually, Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.\n\nThe book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione, in conjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers and students, defend Hogwarts from Voldemort, his Death Eaters, and various dangerous [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]]. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle, including [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Fred Weasley]], Ron's older brother. After learning that he himself is a Horcrux, Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, who casts a killing curse (Avada Kedavra) at him. The defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning of Harry's presumed death and continue to fight on. Harry awakens and faces Voldemort, whose Horcruxes have all been destroyed. In the final battle, Voldemort's killing curse rebounds off Harry's defensive spell (Expelliarmus), killing Voldemort.\n\nAn epilogue \"Nineteen Years Later\" (set on 1 September 2017)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/harry-potter-19-years-later-jk-rowling-hogwarts-kings-cross-deathly-hallows-epilogue-a7923651.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102191419/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/harry-potter-19-years-later-jk-rowling-hogwarts-kings-cross-deathly-hallows-epilogue-a7923651.html |archivedate=2 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> describes the lives of the surviving characters and the effects of Voldemort's death on the Wizarding World.

The novels fall within the genre of [[fantasy literature]], and qualify as a type of fantasy called \"[[urban fantasy]]\", \"contemporary fantasy\", or \"[[low fantasy]]\". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances of [[tragicomedy]] and black humour. In many respects, they are also examples of the ''[[bildungsroman]]'', or [[coming of age]] novel,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0OON/is_1_24/ai_107896944/ |title=Wizards and wainscots: generic structures and genre themes in the Harry Potter series|last=Anne Le Lievre|first= Kerrie |year=2003|publisher=CNET Networks |accessdate=1 September 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and contain elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]], adventure, [[horror fiction|horror]], [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], and [[romance novel|romance]].

Hogwarts resembles a medieval university-cum-castle with several professors who belonging to an Order of Merlin; Old Professor Binns still lectures about the International Warlock Convention of 1289; and a real historical person, a 14th century scribe Sir [[Nicolas Flamel]], is described as a holder of the Philosopher's Stone.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\">{{cite journal|last1=Arden |first1=Heather |last2=Lorenz |first2=Kathryn  |title=The Harry Potter Stories and French Arthurian Romance|journal=Arthuriana|volume=13 |issue=12|pages=54\u201368|date=June 2003|jstor=27870516|doi=10.1353/art.2003.0005 }}</ref> Other medieval elements in Hogwarts include coats-of-arms and medieval weapons on the walls, letters written on parchment and sealed with wax, the Great Hall of Hogwarts which is similar to the Great Hall of Camelot, the use of Latin phrases, the tents put up for Quidditch tournaments are similar to the \"marvellous tents\" put up for knightly tournaments, imaginary animals like dragons and unicorns which exist around Hogwarts, and the banners with heraldic animals for the four Houses of Hogwarts.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nMany of the motifs of the Potter stories such as the hero's quest invoking objects that confer invisibility, magical animals and trees, a forest full of danger and the recognition of a character based upon scars are drawn from medieval French Arthurian romances.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> Other aspects borrowed from French Arthurian romances include the use of owls as messengers, werewolves as characters, and white deer.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> The American scholars Heather Arden and Kathrn Lorenz in particular argue that many aspects of the Potter stories are inspired by a 14th century French Arthurian romance, ''Claris et Laris'', writing of the \"startling\" similarities between the adventures of Potter and the knight Claris.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> Arden and Lorenz noted that Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1986 with a degree in French literature and spent a year living in France afterwards.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nArnden and Lorenz wrote about the similarity between the Arthurian romances, where Camelot is a place of wonder and safety, and from where the heroic knights must venture forth facing various perils, usually in an enchanted forest; and Hogwarts, likewise a wondrous safe place, where Harry Potter and friends must periodically venture forth from to the magical forest that surrounds Hogwarts.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> In the same way that knights in the Arthurian romances usually have a female helper, who is very intelligent and has a connection with nature, Harry has Hermione who plays a similar role.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nLike an Arthurian knight, Harry receives advice and encouragement from his mentor, Albus Dumbledore, who resembles both Merlin and King Arthur, but must vanquish his foes alone.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> Arnden and Lorenz wrote that with Rowling's books, the characters are \"...not a simple reworking of the well-known heroes of romance, but a protean melding of different characters to form new ones...\".<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> However, Lorenz and Arnden argue the main inspiration for Harry Potter was [[Percival|Sir Percival]], one of the Knights of the Round Table who searches for the Holy Grail.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> Both Potter and Sir Percival had an \"orphaned or semi-orphaned youth, with inherent nobility and powers\", being raised by relatives who tried to keep them away from the places where they really belong, Hogwarts and Camelot respectively.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nBoth Percival and Potter are however outsiders in the places that they belong, unfamiliar with the rules of knighthood and magic, but both show extraordinary natural abilities with Percival proving himself an exceptional fighter while Potter is an excellent player of Quidditch.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> And finally, both Percival and Potter found love and acceptance from surrogate families, in the form of the Knights of the Round Table and the Weasley family respectively.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nEach of the seven books is set over the course of one school year. Harry struggles with the problems he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the [[summer term]], near or just after [[Final examination|final exams]], when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either [[Voldemort]] or one of his followers, the [[Death Eaters]], with the stakes a matter of life and death \u2013 a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books.<ref name=\"Harry Potter Last Adventure\" /><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/06/26/rowling-potter-deaths.html | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060630023326/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/06/26/rowling-potter-deaths.html | archivedate=30 June 2006|title=Two characters to die in last 'Harry Potter' book: J.K.

The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually throughout the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed.\n\nDespite Harry's aunt and uncle's desperate prevention of Harry learning about his abilities,<ref name=\"hp-stories\" /> their efforts are in vain. Harry meets a half-giant, [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who is also his first contact with the wizarding world. Hagrid reveals himself to be the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts as well as some of Harry's history.<ref name=\"hp-stories\" /> Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who subsequently attempted to kill him as well.<ref name=\"hp-stories\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2007-07-19-potter-books_N.htm|title=The Harry Potter stories so far: A quick CliffsNotes review|work=USA Today|accessdate=28 September 2008|first=Carol|last=Memmott|date=19 July 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218023806/http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2007-07-19-potter-books_N.htm|archivedate=18 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Instead, the unexpected happened: Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack, and Voldemort disappeared soon afterwards, gravely weakened by his own rebounding curse.\n\nAs its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a [[Living legend (person)|living legend]] in the wizarding world. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard [[Albus Dumbledore]], the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant [[Muggle]] relatives, the Dursleys, who have kept him safe but treated him poorly, including confining him to a cupboard without meals and treating him as their servant. Hagrid then officially invites Harry to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a famous magic school in Scotland that educates young teenagers on their magical development for seven years, from age eleven to seventeen.\n\nWith Hagrid's help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: [[Ron Weasley]], a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and [[Hermione Granger]], a gifted, bright, and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage.<ref name=\"hp-stories\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|title=J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|date=15 August 2004|publisher=J.K.

He also discovers a talent of flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house's Quidditch team, a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks. The first book concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the [[Sorcerer's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold.<ref name=\"hp-stories\" />\n\nThe series continues with ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', describing Harry's second year at Hogwarts. He and his friends investigate a 50-year-old mystery that appears uncannily related to recent sinister events at the school. Ron's younger sister, [[Ginny Weasley]], enrolls in her first year at Hogwarts, and finds an old notebook in her belongings which turns out to be the diary of a previous student, Tom Marvolo Riddle, later revealed to be Voldemort's younger self, who is bent on ridding the school of \"mudbloods\", a derogatory term describing wizards and witches of non-magical parentage. The memory of Tom Riddle resides inside of the diary and when Ginny begins to confide in the diary, Voldemort is able to possess her.\n\nThrough the diary, Ginny acts on Voldemort's orders and unconsciously opens the \"Chamber of Secrets\", unleashing an ancient monster, later revealed to be a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]], which begins attacking students at Hogwarts. It kills those who make direct eye contact with it and petrifies those who look at it indirectly. The book also introduces a new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], a highly cheerful, self-conceited wizard with a pretentious facade, later turning out to be a fraud. Harry discovers that prejudice exists in the Wizarding World through delving into the school's history, and learns that Voldemort's reign of terror was often directed at wizards and witches who were descended from Muggles.\n\nHarry also learns that his ability to speak the snake language [[Parseltongue]] is rare and often associated with the [[Black magic|Dark Arts]]. When Hermione is attacked and petrified, Harry and Ron finally piece together the puzzles and unlock the Chamber of Secrets, with Harry destroying the diary for good and saving Ginny, and, as they learn later, also destroying a part of Voldemort's soul. The end of the book reveals Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father and rival of Ron and Ginny's father, to be the culprit who slipped the book into Ginny's belongings.\n\nThe third novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', follows Harry in his third year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form. Instead, Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by [[Sirius Black]], his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the [[dementors]] \u2013 dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair \u2013 which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to [[Remus Lupin]], a [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher who is eventually revealed to be a [[werewolf]]. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, [[Scabbers|Peter Pettigrew]], who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers.<ref name=\"hp-plot-azkaban\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/books/rowling-azkaban.html|title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|last=Maguire|first=Gregory|date=5 September 1999|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713062301/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/books/rowling-azkaban.html|archivedate=13 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised \u2013 in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.\n\n=== Voldemort returns ===\n[[File:The Elephant House.jpg|thumb|[[The Elephant House (Edinburgh Caf\u00e9)|The Elephant House]] was one of the caf\u00e9s in [[Edinburgh]] where Rowling wrote the first part of ''Harry Potter''.|alt=\"The Elephant House\", a small, painted red caf\u00e9 where Rowling wrote a few chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']]\nDuring Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''), Harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous yet exciting contest where three \"champions\", one from each participating school, must compete with each other in three tasks in order to win the Triwizard Cup.

The point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series' shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict. Voldemort's plan to have Crouch use the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds. Although Harry manages to escape, [[Cedric Diggory]], the other Hogwarts champion in the tournament, is killed by Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort re-enters the Wizarding World with a physical body.\n\nIn the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In response to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark family home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the [[Ministry of Magic]] and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned. In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the Wizarding World attempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints [[Dolores Umbridge]] as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/books/review/rowling-phoenix.html |title=Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix |date=13 July 2003 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=28 September 2008 |first=John |last=Leonard |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517174431/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/books/review/rowling-phoenix.html |archivedate=17 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHermione and Ron form \"[[Dumbledore's Army]]\", a secret study group in which Harry agrees to teach his classmates the higher-level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts that he has learned from his previous encounters with Dark wizards. Through those lessons, Harry begins to develop a crush on the popular and attractive [[Cho Chang]]. Juggling schoolwork, Umbridge's incessant and persistent efforts to land him in trouble and the defensive lessons, Harry begins to lose sleep as he constantly receives disturbing dreams about a dark corridor in the Ministry of Magic, followed by a burning desire to learn more.

In the novel's climax, Harry is tricked into seeing Sirius tortured and races to the Ministry of Magic. He and his friends face off against Voldemort's followers (nicknamed [[Death Eaters]]) at the [[Ministry of Magic]]. Although the timely arrival of members of the Order of the Phoenix saves the teenagers' lives, [[Sirius Black]] is killed in the conflict.\n\nIn the sixth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Voldemort begins waging open warfare. Harry and his friends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts. They are subject to all the difficulties of adolescence \u2013 Harry eventually begins dating Ginny, Ron establishes a strong infatuation with fellow Hogwarts student [[Lavender Brown]], and Hermione starts to develop romantic feelings towards Ron. Near the beginning of the novel, lacking his own book, Harry is given an old potions textbook filled with many annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer titled; \"the Half-Blood Prince.\" This book is a source of scholastic success and great recognition from their new potions master, [[Horace Slughorn]], but because of the potency of the spells that are written in it, becomes a source of concern.\n\nWith war drawing near, Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore, who shows him various memories concerning the early life of Voldemort in a device called a [[Pensieve]]. These reveal that in order to preserve his life, Voldemort has split his soul into pieces, used to create a series of [[Horcrux]]es \u2013 evil enchanted items hidden in various locations, one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book.<ref name=\"harry-potter-prince\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/16/books/16choc.html |title=Harry Potter Works His Magic Again in a Far Darker Tale |last=Kakutani |first=Michiko |date=16 July 2005 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=28 September 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416015406/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/16/books/16choc.html |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Draco, who has joined with the Death Eaters, attempts to attack Dumbledore upon his return from collecting a Horcrux, and the book culminates in the killing of Dumbledore by [[Professor Snape]], the titular Half-Blood Prince.\n\n''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', the last original novel in the series, begins directly after the events of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. A ghoul pretends to be Ron ill with a contagious disease, Harry and the Dursleys separate, and Hermione wipes her parents' memories and sends them abroad.\n\nAs the trio searches for the Horcruxes, they learn details about an ancient prophecy of the Deathly Hallows, three legendary items that when united under one Keeper, would supposedly allow that person to be the Master of Death. Harry discovers his handy Invisibility Cloak to be one of those items, and Voldemort to be searching for another: the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in history. At the end of the book, Harry and his friends learn about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives \u2013 he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Eventually, Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.\n\nThe book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione, in conjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers and students, defend Hogwarts from Voldemort, his Death Eaters, and various dangerous [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]]. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle, including [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Fred Weasley]], Ron's older brother. After learning that he himself is a Horcrux, Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, who casts a killing curse (Avada Kedavra) at him. The defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning of Harry's presumed death and continue to fight on. Harry awakens and faces Voldemort, whose Horcruxes have all been destroyed. In the final battle, Voldemort's killing curse rebounds off Harry's defensive spell (Expelliarmus), killing Voldemort.\n\nAn epilogue \"Nineteen Years Later\" (set on 1 September 2017)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/harry-potter-19-years-later-jk-rowling-hogwarts-kings-cross-deathly-hallows-epilogue-a7923651.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102191419/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/harry-potter-19-years-later-jk-rowling-hogwarts-kings-cross-deathly-hallows-epilogue-a7923651.html |archivedate=2 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> describes the lives of the surviving characters and the effects of Voldemort's death on the Wizarding World.

The novels fall within the genre of [[fantasy literature]], and qualify as a type of fantasy called \"[[urban fantasy]]\", \"contemporary fantasy\", or \"[[low fantasy]]\". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances of [[tragicomedy]] and black humour. In many respects, they are also examples of the ''[[bildungsroman]]'', or [[coming of age]] novel,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0OON/is_1_24/ai_107896944/ |title=Wizards and wainscots: generic structures and genre themes in the Harry Potter series|last=Anne Le Lievre|first= Kerrie |year=2003|publisher=CNET Networks |accessdate=1 September 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and contain elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]], adventure, [[horror fiction|horror]], [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], and [[romance novel|romance]].

Hogwarts resembles a medieval university-cum-castle with several professors who belonging to an Order of Merlin; Old Professor Binns still lectures about the International Warlock Convention of 1289; and a real historical person, a 14th century scribe Sir [[Nicolas Flamel]], is described as a holder of the Philosopher's Stone.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\">{{cite journal|last1=Arden |first1=Heather |last2=Lorenz |first2=Kathryn  |title=The Harry Potter Stories and French Arthurian Romance|journal=Arthuriana|volume=13 |issue=12|pages=54\u201368|date=June 2003|jstor=27870516|doi=10.1353/art.2003.0005 }}</ref> Other medieval elements in Hogwarts include coats-of-arms and medieval weapons on the walls, letters written on parchment and sealed with wax, the Great Hall of Hogwarts which is similar to the Great Hall of Camelot, the use of Latin phrases, the tents put up for Quidditch tournaments are similar to the \"marvellous tents\" put up for knightly tournaments, imaginary animals like dragons and unicorns which exist around Hogwarts, and the banners with heraldic animals for the four Houses of Hogwarts.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nMany of the motifs of the Potter stories such as the hero's quest invoking objects that confer invisibility, magical animals and trees, a forest full of danger and the recognition of a character based upon scars are drawn from medieval French Arthurian romances.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> Other aspects borrowed from French Arthurian romances include the use of owls as messengers, werewolves as characters, and white deer.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> The American scholars Heather Arden and Kathrn Lorenz in particular argue that many aspects of the Potter stories are inspired by a 14th century French Arthurian romance, ''Claris et Laris'', writing of the \"startling\" similarities between the adventures of Potter and the knight Claris.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> Arden and Lorenz noted that Rowling graduated from the University of Exeter in 1986 with a degree in French literature and spent a year living in France afterwards.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nArnden and Lorenz wrote about the similarity between the Arthurian romances, where Camelot is a place of wonder and safety, and from where the heroic knights must venture forth facing various perils, usually in an enchanted forest; and Hogwarts, likewise a wondrous safe place, where Harry Potter and friends must periodically venture forth from to the magical forest that surrounds Hogwarts.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> In the same way that knights in the Arthurian romances usually have a female helper, who is very intelligent and has a connection with nature, Harry has Hermione who plays a similar role.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nLike an Arthurian knight, Harry receives advice and encouragement from his mentor, Albus Dumbledore, who resembles both Merlin and King Arthur, but must vanquish his foes alone.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> Arnden and Lorenz wrote that with Rowling's books, the characters are \"...not a simple reworking of the well-known heroes of romance, but a protean melding of different characters to form new ones...\".<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> However, Lorenz and Arnden argue the main inspiration for Harry Potter was [[Percival|Sir Percival]], one of the Knights of the Round Table who searches for the Holy Grail.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> Both Potter and Sir Percival had an \"orphaned or semi-orphaned youth, with inherent nobility and powers\", being raised by relatives who tried to keep them away from the places where they really belong, Hogwarts and Camelot respectively.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nBoth Percival and Potter are however outsiders in the places that they belong, unfamiliar with the rules of knighthood and magic, but both show extraordinary natural abilities with Percival proving himself an exceptional fighter while Potter is an excellent player of Quidditch.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/> And finally, both Percival and Potter found love and acceptance from surrogate families, in the form of the Knights of the Round Table and the Weasley family respectively.<ref name=\"Scriptorium Press\"/>\n\nEach of the seven books is set over the course of one school year. Harry struggles with the problems he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the [[summer term]], near or just after [[Final examination|final exams]], when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either [[Voldemort]] or one of his followers, the [[Death Eaters]], with the stakes a matter of life and death \u2013 a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books.<ref name=\"Harry Potter Last Adventure\" /><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/06/26/rowling-potter-deaths.html | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060630023326/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/06/26/rowling-potter-deaths.html | archivedate=30 June 2006|title=Two characters to die in last 'Harry Potter' book: J.K.

His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified during the ''Breaking Bad'' series, but are detailed in ''Better Call Saul''. In 2019, he briefly appeared in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a film directed and written by Vince Gilligan, made by Netflix and a continuation of the original show.

He subsequently became an officer on the Philadelphia police force. Mike had one son, Matt, who also became a police officer. Matt married Stacey and they had a daughter, Kaylee. In an extended flashback in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode, \"[[Five-O (Better Call Saul)|Five-O]]\", Mike is revealed as a crooked cop who took bribes. Matt was approached by other corrupt officers and asked Mike for advice; Mike advised Matt that not taking the money would label him a [[whistleblower]], and endanger his life and family, so Matt took it. Matt's partner and another officer killed Matt because his hesitation caused them to think he might turn them in. Stacey and Kaylee left Philadelphia for Albuquerque after Matt's funeral. Mike identified the officers who killed Matt and arranged a similar ambush to kill both of them, after which he left for Albuquerque, allowing him to see Stacey and Kaylee.\n\n===''Better Call Saul''===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nMike works as a parking lot attendant at the courthouse. In his off-hours he engages in security and \"muscle\" jobs to help support Stacey and Kaylee. Jimmy frequently deals with Mike when leaving the parking lot, irritated with Mike's demands for payment or the right number of validation stickers.\n\nPhiladelphia officers involved in the investigation of two murdered cops interrogate Mike, who hires Jimmy to represent him. Mike has Jimmy create a diversion, enabling Mike to steal one detective's notepad to learn what they know. He finds that Stacey contacted them after finding money hidden in the lining of one of her suitcases. Mike admits to her that he was involved in corruption in Philadelphia, and confesses that he \"broke\" his son Matt by persuading him to go along. Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear he would report them, so Mike retaliated by killing the two of them, then moving to Albuquerque to be near his daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Stacey accepts Mike's explanation and consoles him. The detectives have no solid evidence, and leave for Philadelphia without bringing charges. Mike aids Jimmy in proving the Kettlemans staged their own disappearance, then helps Jimmy recover and return the money the Kettlemans embezzled.\n\nOn one of his \"muscle\" jobs, Mike is employed by Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\") to protect him during a drug deal with [[Nacho Varga]]. Mike has no weapon, but remains calm and controlled. When the payment is $20 short, Mike insists that Nacho pay Pryce full. After the deal is complete, Mike explains that he investigated Nacho beforehand and determined he was operating without the knowledge of his bosses in the Salamanca drug cartel, giving him an incentive to ensure that the transaction went smoothly.\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nImpressed by Mike's work for Pryce, Nacho approaches him with a request to kill his boss [[Tuco Salamanca]], Hector's nephew. Nacho fears Tuco may learn about his outside drug deals, and that his erratic behavior will draw unwanted police attention to the Salamanca drug business. Rather than kill Tuco, Mike engineers a public altercation so that Tuco is sentenced to prison for assault. Hector convinces Mike to say that the gun Tuco was carrying was his to reduce Tuco's sentence, but Mike suspects Hector knows the truth.\n\nFearing Hector may exact revenge on Stacey and Kaylee, Mike attempts to disrupt Hector's drug trade by hijacking a Salamanca truck and stealing the $250,000 it carries, but allowing the driver to live. He intended for a \"Good Samaritan\" to free the driver, but learns from Nacho that when someone did stop to help, the truck driver called Hector first, and Hector's crew cleaned up the scene and killed the Good Samaritan.\n\nMike decides to kill Hector and procures a black market sniper rifle. As he prepares to fire at Hector, he is suddenly interrupted by the horn of a car.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike finds his moves have been tracked by [[Gus Fring]], the owner of the Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant chain, which is part of the cartel's drug trafficking chain. Gus meets with Mike and explains that he does not want Hector dead until the time is right. He encourages Mike to continue to disrupt Hector's drug trafficking and attempts to pay him, but Mike does not accept the money. He asks for help to launder the $250,000 he stole, and Gus obliges by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive, the parent company of Los Pollos and a participant in its drug activities, to hire Mike as a contracted security consultant and pay him monthly consulting fees. Mike joins Stacey at group therapy sessions to help her overcome Matt's death.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nMike quits work at the parking lot and conducts actual security consulting at Madrigal. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] informs him the consulting contract was supposed to be a paper transaction, but Mike argues that his inspections provide plausible cover if anyone questions the payments. When Lydia complains to Gus, he tacitly approves of Mike's actions. At the group therapy sessions, Mike confronts another attendee over his lies, which causes a temporary rift between Stacey and Mike.\n\nConflict between the Salamancas and Gus's organization lead to Hector Salamanca suffering a stroke, and Gus discreetly pays for his recovery to the point where he recovers his mental faculties and can move his right index finger. Gus initiates plans for a meth lab to be built under an industrial laundry, which is part of his plan to end reliance on cartel cocaine smuggled from Mexico. Mike arranges for structural engineers to secretly visit and assess the site while Gus silently observes. Gus selects Werner Ziegler to oversee construction of the lab, and Mike arranges for living quarters for Werner and his men during the months-long project. Mike takes to Werner, and tries to cover for him to Gus when Werner inadvertently reveals minimal details of the lab's construction to patrons at a local bar. When construction falls behind schedule, a homesick Werner escapes, intending to meet his wife at a nearby spa. Mike catches up to Werner and realizes that he has inadvertently revealed the existence of a construction project to Hector's nephew [[Lalo Salamanca]], who has arrived to take over management of the Salamanca drug business. Gus orders Werner's death, and offers to send someone to do it, but Mike executes Werner himself.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWerner's death forces Gus to halt construction of the lab. Mike pays Werner's men in full for the half-completed job and sends them home. Gus presents a cover story to Lalo and Juan Bolsa, claiming Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, stole cocaine, and fled, after which Mike tracked him down and killed him. The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, and Lalo and Juan accept Gus's explanation and apology, but Lalo remains suspicious. Mike reacts with disgust at Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner and refuses to accept Gus's offer to continue paying him during the construction delay. Mike continues to struggle with Werner's death and drinks to excess. He becomes alienated from his family when he loses his temper with Kaylee, which leads Stacey to ask Mike to keep his distance. \n\nA gang with whom Mike had a previous altercation beats and stabs him. He awakens at a ranch just inside the Mexico border, which has ties to Gus including a fountain dedicated to Max, where his wounds have been treated by [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]]. He attempts to leave, but in his weakened state Dr. Goodman easily catches up. The doctor re-bandages Mike's wounds and recommends that he stay to recuperate. Mike calls Gus to ask what he intends, but Gus hangs up on him. Gus subsequently arrives to speak with Mike in person and asks for his help. Mike refuses to be Gus's \"[[contract killing|button man]]\", killing only to further Gus's vendetta against the Salamancas. Gus tells Mike he wants Mike with him because Mike understands Gus's need for revenge. After Mike returns to Albuquerque, Gus puts him in charge of dealing with Nacho and his inside information on the Salamancas. Mike secretly points police to Lalo's car and its ties to the murder of the money wire clerk. After Nacho tips him off to Lalo's location, Mike uses a police radio to pretend to be an officer making a check on Lalo's license plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo's location while he is driving and detain him.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is over the recent events that angered him, saying he moved past them by deciding to play the cards he was dealt. Lalo is arrested under an assumed name and remanded. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn Los Pollos Hermanos. Nacho and Gus destroy the interior of one of Gus's restaurants then Gus sets an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike gives Jimmy details about the work he did to investigate to Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling Jimmy to win a motion for Lalo be released on bail.\n\nThe Cousins pick up Lalo's bail money in Mexico and deliver it to Jimmy at a remote pickup site. An informant makes a telephone call to report their activities. As Jimmy begins his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen, who take the cash and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked and killed, but one escapes. The shooter is revealed to be Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. Mike puts the cash and Jimmy back in Jimmy's car and they begin the drive to Albuquerque, but begin to walk cross-country after the car breaks down. They camp overnight and resume their trek the next morning. When they see the surviving gunman is still searching for them, Jimmy attracts his attention and draws him closer so Mike can shoot him. The gunman's vehicle flips and is destroyed, and the gunman is killed. Mike and Jimmy resume walking.\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nBy time of ''Breaking Bad'', Mike still works for Gus, and does occasional work for Jimmy, who continues practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] allows [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane]] to die from a heroin overdose, Saul dispatches Mike to clean [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s apartment. Mike removes all traces of the drugs and provides Jesse advice that enables him to avoid incriminating himself when speaking to police after Mike leaves. When Jesse later goes missing Mike tracks him down and drives Walt to the location.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWith Walt and [[Skyler White]] in the middle of a divorce, Saul has Mike spy on Skyler. Mike sees Walt arrive home, followed soon after by Tuco's cousins, who intend to kill Walt in retaliation for Tuco's death. Mike has Gus call off the cousins, since Walt is central to Gus's meth making scheme, and convinces them to target Hank, the DEA agent who shot Tuco. Gus then anonymously warns Hank, who is able to fight back. He survives the attack and kills one cousin, and Mike kills the other in the hospital.\n\nThe cartel disrupts Gus' meth distribution and he has Mike investigate. Mike kills the four cartel operatives sent to harass Duane Chow, one of Gus' chemical suppliers. He later hides in one of the Los Pollos Hermanos trucks during a drug run so he can learn the cartel's tactics and implement countermeasures that protect future drug shipments.\n\nWhile Walt and Jesse have been cooking meth in the underground superlab, Jesse has become more unstable. He learns that two of Gus's local drug dealers were responsible for the death of his friend Combo and Tom\u00e1s, the younger brother of Jesse's girlfriend Andrea. Knowing Jesse intends to kill the dealers, Walt acts first and runs them down with his car, then tells Jesse to flee.  Gus keeps Walt on, but requires that he work with [[Gale Boetticher|Gale]] again. Walt correctly fears that once Gale knows enough to take over, Gus will have Walt and Jesse killed.  Walt tricks Mike into looking for Jesse in the wrong place, giving Walt time to meet Jesse and tell him to find Gale's address. Mike later escorts Walt back to the lab on the pretense of responding to a chemical spill, but Walt knows Mike is supposed to kill him. Intending to kill Jesse too, Mike instructs Walt to call Jesse and persuade him to come to the lab.  Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale so that Gus will have to keep them alive to continue meth production.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nJesse kills Gale. Victor arrives soon after and brings Jesse back to the lab. Mike and Victor keep watch over Jesse and Walt while waiting for Gus. Knowing he was recognized at Gale's house, and hoping to demonstrate that he can still be useful to Gus, Victor begins producing a batch of meth, revealing that he has learned the process by watching Walt and Jesse. Gus arrives, kills Victor in front of Walt and Jesse, then tells them to get back to work. Mike increases security at the lab, including installing video cameras and personally standing watch over Walt and Jesse while they work.\n\nMike informs Gus they may be able to drive Walter and Jesse apart. Gus agrees, and Mike takes Jesse with him on dead-drop retrievals and other tasks. Jesse foils a prearranged attack on Mike, boosting his confidence and increasing his loyalty to Mike and Gus. After another Los Pollos Hermanos truck is robbed and the meth stolen, Jesse aids Mike in retrieving it. His competence convinces Mike and Gus to continue making use of Jesse, and he goes to Mexico with them for a meeting between Gus and the cartel leaders that is intended to end their dispute. Jesse produces a superior batch of meth on his own, and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico to produce it for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse. During a party at [[Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]'s house to celebrate the rapprochement, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of tequila to kill most of the cartel leaders, including taking the first drink himself to alleviate suspicion. Mike is shot helping Gus escape, and Jesse helps both the ill Gus and injured Mike make their way to pre-planned medical treatment. For the doctor Gus has hired, Mike's wounds are secondary to Gus\u2018s illness, and after Gus recovers, Mike remains in Mexico for several weeks while Gus and Jesse return to Albuquerque. While Mike is recovering, Walt engineers Gus\u2018s death, after which he and Jesse destroy the meth lab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike learns of Gus's death, blames Walt, and intends to kill him. As Mike drives back to Albuquerque, he encounters Walt and Jesse, who explain why they killed Gus. They remind him that the security camera footage from the lab can implicate both Mike and them, and ask for his aid in destroying it.  Mike tells them the recordings were stored on Gus's laptop, which is now in police custody.  He aids Walt and Jesse to build and employ an [[electromagnet]] that wipes the laptop's data. This inadvertently leads the police to discover, elsewhere in Gus's possessions, hidden account numbers and access codes for the money Gus deposited offshore to be used to pay the members of his organization for their silence.  They seize the accounts, making it likely that Gus's former employees will reveal Mike, Jesse, and Walt to the police.\n\nMike joins Walt and Jesse in a new organization, with Jesse and Walt producing meth in a mobile lab operated inside the tented homes of a fumigation company's customers.  When Lydia suspects the DEA is tracking the methylamine Madrigal supplies, she provides Mike, Walt and Jesse with information on a train that includes a tanker car of methylamine. They arrange to steal a large quantity without detection, but Todd, an employee of the fumigation company who aids in the robbery, shoots and kills a young boy who witnessed it. Wanting no part of this type of brutality, Mike and Jesse sell their share of the methylamine to Declan, a drug dealer from Phoenix, while Walt produces the meth Declan distributes.  Mike agrees to continue paying Gus's former employees from his share of the methylamine sale in order to ensure their continued silence.\n\nThe DEA identifies Mike's connection to Gus, but he removes evidence from his home and hides getaway money in a \"go bag\" at the airport, so a police search of his home turns up nothing.  The police identify the attorney Mike has been using to make the payments to Gus's former employees, then locate the money he has been saving for Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike, intending to flee, asks Saul to retrieve his go bag.  Walt retrieves it instead, and meets with Mike. He demands the names of Mike's associates in exchange, so he can have them killed in prison to protect his identity. Mike refuses, and Walt shoots him with the gun from the go bag.  After following a mortally wounded Mike to the edge of a river, Walt comes to the realization that he could have simply asked Lydia for the names. Walt begins to apologize, but Mike stops him, saying \"let me die in peace.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Molloy |first=Tim |title=\"Breaking Bad\" star Jonathan Banks: \"The bad guy's gotta die\" |url=https://news.yahoo.com/breaking-bad-star-jonathan-banks-bad-guys-gotta-201325777.html |website=Yahoo!

Mike says if he was younger, he would go to [[Alaska]], an idea Jesse finds appealing. Jesse expresses a desire to make amends for past wrongdoing, but Mike cautions that starting over will make it impossible.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://etcanada.com/video/f73606ac-dd83-11e9-bfeb-5a25fcbd3cd5/jonathan-banks-confirms-el-camino-role/ |title=Jonathan Banks Confirms 'El Camino' Role |website=[[ET Canada]] |date=September 22, 2019 |access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Jonathan Banks 2012 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Banks]] portrays Mike Ehrmantraut in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul''.]]\nThe ''Breaking Bad'' [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]] episode \"[[Say My Name (Breaking Bad)|Say My Name]]\" received critical acclaim, with many critics singling out Jonathan Banks and [[Bryan Cranston]] for particular praise.

His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified during the ''Breaking Bad'' series, but are detailed in ''Better Call Saul''.

In an extended flashback in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode, \"[[Five-O (Better Call Saul)|Five-O]]\", Mike is revealed as a crooked cop who took bribes. Matt was approached by other corrupt officers and asked Mike for advice; Mike advised Matt that not taking the money would label him a [[whistleblower]], and endanger his life and family, so Matt took it. Matt's partner and another officer killed Matt because his hesitation caused them to think he might turn them in. Stacey and Kaylee left Philadelphia for Albuquerque after Matt's funeral. Mike identified the officers who killed Matt and arranged a similar ambush to kill both of them, after which he left for Albuquerque, allowing him to see Stacey and Kaylee.\n\n===''Better Call Saul''===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nMike works as a parking lot attendant at the courthouse. In his off-hours he engages in security and \"muscle\" jobs to help support Stacey and Kaylee. Jimmy frequently deals with Mike when leaving the parking lot, irritated with Mike's demands for payment or the right number of validation stickers.\n\nPhiladelphia officers involved in the investigation of two murdered cops interrogate Mike, who hires Jimmy to represent him. Mike has Jimmy create a diversion, enabling Mike to steal one detective's notepad to learn what they know. He finds that Stacey contacted them after finding money hidden in the lining of one of her suitcases. Mike admits to her that he was involved in corruption in Philadelphia, and confesses that he \"broke\" his son Matt by persuading him to go along. Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear he would report them, so Mike retaliated by killing the two of them, then moving to Albuquerque to be near his daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Stacey accepts Mike's explanation and consoles him. The detectives have no solid evidence, and leave for Philadelphia without bringing charges. Mike aids Jimmy in proving the Kettlemans staged their own disappearance, then helps Jimmy recover and return the money the Kettlemans embezzled.\n\nOn one of his \"muscle\" jobs, Mike is employed by Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\") to protect him during a drug deal with [[Nacho Varga]]. Mike has no weapon, but remains calm and controlled. When the payment is $20 short, Mike insists that Nacho pay Pryce full. After the deal is complete, Mike explains that he investigated Nacho beforehand and determined he was operating without the knowledge of his bosses in the Salamanca drug cartel, giving him an incentive to ensure that the transaction went smoothly.\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nImpressed by Mike's work for Pryce, Nacho approaches him with a request to kill his boss [[Tuco Salamanca]], Hector's nephew. Nacho fears Tuco may learn about his outside drug deals, and that his erratic behavior will draw unwanted police attention to the Salamanca drug business. Rather than kill Tuco, Mike engineers a public altercation so that Tuco is sentenced to prison for assault. Hector convinces Mike to say that the gun Tuco was carrying was his to reduce Tuco's sentence, but Mike suspects Hector knows the truth.\n\nFearing Hector may exact revenge on Stacey and Kaylee, Mike attempts to disrupt Hector's drug trade by hijacking a Salamanca truck and stealing the $250,000 it carries, but allowing the driver to live. He intended for a \"Good Samaritan\" to free the driver, but learns from Nacho that when someone did stop to help, the truck driver called Hector first, and Hector's crew cleaned up the scene and killed the Good Samaritan.\n\nMike decides to kill Hector and procures a black market sniper rifle. As he prepares to fire at Hector, he is suddenly interrupted by the horn of a car.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike finds his moves have been tracked by [[Gus Fring]], the owner of the Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant chain, which is part of the cartel's drug trafficking chain. Gus meets with Mike and explains that he does not want Hector dead until the time is right. He encourages Mike to continue to disrupt Hector's drug trafficking and attempts to pay him, but Mike does not accept the money. He asks for help to launder the $250,000 he stole, and Gus obliges by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive, the parent company of Los Pollos and a participant in its drug activities, to hire Mike as a contracted security consultant and pay him monthly consulting fees. Mike joins Stacey at group therapy sessions to help her overcome Matt's death.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nMike quits work at the parking lot and conducts actual security consulting at Madrigal. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] informs him the consulting contract was supposed to be a paper transaction, but Mike argues that his inspections provide plausible cover if anyone questions the payments. When Lydia complains to Gus, he tacitly approves of Mike's actions. At the group therapy sessions, Mike confronts another attendee over his lies, which causes a temporary rift between Stacey and Mike.\n\nConflict between the Salamancas and Gus's organization lead to Hector Salamanca suffering a stroke, and Gus discreetly pays for his recovery to the point where he recovers his mental faculties and can move his right finger. Gus initiates plans for a meth lab to be built under an industrial laundry, which is part of his plan to end reliance on cartel cocaine smuggled from Mexico. Mike arranges for structural engineers to secretly visit and assess the site while Gus silently observes. Gus selects Werner Ziegler to oversee construction of the lab, and Mike arranges for living quarters for Werner and his men during the months-long project. Mike takes to Werner, and tries to cover for him to Gus when Werner inadvertently reveals minimal details of the lab's construction to patrons at a local bar. When construction falls behind schedule, a homesick Werner escapes, intending to meet his wife at a nearby spa. Mike catches up to Werner and realizes that he has inadvertently revealed the existence of a construction project to Hector's nephew [[Lalo Salamanca]], who has arrived to take over management of the Salamanca drug business. Gus orders Werner's death, and offers to send someone to do it, but Mike executes Werner himself.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWerner's death forces Gus to halt construction of the lab. Mike pays Werner's men in full for the half-completed job and sends them home. Gus presents a cover story to Lalo and Juan Bolsa, claiming Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, stole cocaine, and fled, after which Mike tracked him down and killed him. The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, and Lalo and Juan accept Gus's explanation and apology, but Lalo remains suspicious. Mike reacts with disgust at Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner and refuses to accept Gus's offer to continue paying him during the construction delay. Mike continues to struggle with Werner's death and drinks to excess. He becomes alienated from his family when he loses his temper with Kaylee, which leads Stacey to ask Mike to keep his distance. \n\nA gang with whom Mike had a previous altercation beats and stabs him. He awakens at a ranch just inside the Mexico border, which has ties to Gus including a fountain dedicated to Max, where his wounds have been treated by [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]]. He attempts to leave, but in his weakened state Dr. Goodman easily catches up. The doctor re-bandages Mike's wounds and recommends that he stay to recuperate. Mike calls Gus to ask what he intends, but Gus hangs up on him. Gus subsequently arrives to speak with Mike in person and asks for his help. Mike refuses to be Gus's \"[[contract killing|button man]]\", killing only to further Gus's vendetta against the Salamancas. Gus tells Mike he wants Mike with him because Mike understands Gus's need for revenge. After Mike returns to Albuquerque, Gus puts him in charge of dealing with Nacho and his inside information on the Salamancas. Mike secretly points police to Lalo's car and its ties to the murder of the money wire clerk. After Nacho tips him off to Lalo's location, Mike uses a police radio to pretend to be an officer making a check on Lalo's license plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo's location while he is driving and detain him.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is over the recent events that angered him, saying he moved past them by deciding to play the cards he was dealt. Lalo is arrested under an assumed name and remanded. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn Los Pollos Hermanos. Nacho and Gus destroy the interior of one of Gus's restaurants then Gus sets an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike gives Jimmy details about the work he did to investigate to Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling Jimmy to win a motion for Lalo be released on bail.\n\nThe Cousins pick up Lalo's bail money in Mexico and deliver it to Jimmy at a remote pickup site. An informant makes a telephone call to report their activities. As Jimmy begins his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen, who take the cash and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked and killed, but one escapes. The shooter is revealed to be Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. Mike puts the cash and Jimmy back in Jimmy's car and they begin the drive to Albuquerque, but begin to walk cross-country after the car breaks down. They camp overnight and resume their trek the next morning. When they see the surviving gunman is still searching for them, Jimmy attracts his attention and draws him closer so Mike can shoot him. The gunman's vehicle flips and is destroyed, and the gunman is killed. Mike and Jimmy resume walking.\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nBy time of ''Breaking Bad'', Mike still works for Gus, and does occasional work for Jimmy, who continues practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] allows [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane]] to die from a heroin overdose, Saul dispatches Mike to clean [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s apartment. Mike removes all traces of the drugs and provides Jesse advice that enables him to avoid incriminating himself when speaking to police after Mike leaves. When Jesse later goes missing Mike tracks him down and drives Walt to the location.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWith Walt and [[Skyler White]] in the middle of a divorce, Saul has Mike spy on Skyler. Mike sees Walt arrive home, followed soon after by Tuco's cousins, who intend to kill Walt in retaliation for Tuco's death. Mike has Gus call off the cousins, since Walt is central to Gus's meth making scheme, and convinces them to target Hank, the DEA agent who shot Tuco. Gus then anonymously warns Hank, who is able to fight back. He survives the attack and kills one cousin, and Mike kills the other in the hospital.\n\nThe cartel disrupts Gus' meth distribution and he has Mike investigate. Mike kills the four cartel operatives sent to harass Duane Chow, one of Gus' chemical suppliers. He later hides in one of the Los Pollos Hermanos trucks during a drug run so he can learn the cartel's tactics and implement countermeasures that protect future drug shipments.\n\nWhile Walt and Jesse have been cooking meth in the underground superlab, Jesse has become more unstable. He learns that two of Gus's local drug dealers were responsible for the death of his friend Combo and Tom\u00e1s, the younger brother of Jesse's girlfriend Andrea. Knowing Jesse intends to kill the dealers, Walt acts first and runs them down with his car, then tells Jesse to flee.  Gus keeps Walt on, but requires that he work with [[Gale Boetticher|Gale]] again. Walt correctly fears that once Gale knows enough to take over, Gus will have Walt and Jesse killed.  Walt tricks Mike into looking for Jesse in the wrong place, giving Walt time to meet Jesse and tell him to find Gale's address. Mike later escorts Walt back to the lab on the pretense of responding to a chemical spill, but Walt knows Mike is supposed to kill him. Intending to kill Jesse too, Mike instructs Walt to call Jesse and persuade him to come to the lab.  Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale so that Gus will have to keep them alive to continue meth production.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nJesse kills Gale. Victor arrives soon after and brings Jesse back to the lab. Mike and Victor keep watch over Jesse and Walt while waiting for Gus. Knowing he was recognized at Gale's house, and hoping to demonstrate that he can still be useful to Gus, Victor begins producing a batch of meth, revealing that he has learned the process by watching Walt and Jesse. Gus arrives, kills Victor in front of Walt and Jesse, then tells them to get back to work. Mike increases security at the lab, including installing video cameras and personally standing watch over Walt and Jesse while they work.\n\nMike informs Gus they may be able to drive Walter and Jesse apart. Gus agrees, and Mike takes Jesse with him on dead-drop retrievals and other tasks. Jesse foils a prearranged attack on Mike, boosting his confidence and increasing his loyalty to Mike and Gus. After another Los Pollos Hermanos truck is robbed and the meth stolen, Jesse aids Mike in retrieving it. His competence convinces Mike and Gus to continue making use of Jesse, and he goes to Mexico with them for a meeting between Gus and the cartel leaders that is intended to end their dispute. Jesse produces a superior batch of meth on his own, and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico to produce it for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse. During a party at [[Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]'s house to celebrate the rapprochement, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of tequila to kill most of the cartel leaders, including taking the first drink himself to alleviate suspicion. Mike is shot helping Gus escape, and Jesse helps both the ill Gus and injured Mike make their way to pre-planned medical treatment. For the doctor Gus has hired, Mike's wounds are secondary to Gus\u2018s illness, and after Gus recovers, Mike remains in Mexico for several weeks while Gus and Jesse return to Albuquerque. While Mike is recovering, Walt engineers Gus\u2018s death, after which he and Jesse destroy the meth lab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike learns of Gus's death, blames Walt, and intends to kill him. As Mike drives back to Albuquerque, he encounters Walt and Jesse, who explain why they killed Gus. They remind him that the security camera footage from the lab can implicate both Mike and them, and ask for his aid in destroying it.  Mike tells them the recordings were stored on Gus's laptop, which is now in police custody.  He aids Walt and Jesse to build and employ an [[electromagnet]] that wipes the laptop's data. This inadvertently leads the police to discover, elsewhere in Gus's possessions, hidden account numbers and access codes for the money Gus deposited offshore to be used to pay the members of his organization for their silence.  They seize the accounts, making it likely that Gus's former employees will reveal Mike, Jesse, and Walt to the police.\n\nMike joins Walt and Jesse in a new organization, with Jesse and Walt producing meth in a mobile lab operated inside the tented homes of a fumigation company's customers.  When Lydia suspects the DEA is tracking the methylamine Madrigal supplies, she provides Mike, Walt and Jesse with information on a train that includes a tanker car of methylamine. They arrange to steal a large quantity without detection, but Todd, an employee of the fumigation company who aids in the robbery, shoots and kills a young boy who witnessed it. Wanting no part of this type of brutality, Mike and Jesse sell their share of the methylamine to Declan, a drug dealer from Phoenix, while Walt produces the meth Declan distributes.  Mike agrees to continue paying Gus's former employees from his share of the methylamine sale in order to ensure their continued silence.\n\nThe DEA identifies Mike's connection to Gus, but he removes evidence from his home and hides getaway money in a \"go bag\" at the airport, so a police search of his home turns up nothing.  The police identify the attorney Mike has been using to make the payments to Gus's former employees, then locate the money he has been saving for Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike, intending to flee, asks Saul to retrieve his go bag.  Walt retrieves it instead, and meets with Mike. He demands the names of Mike's associates in exchange, so he can have them killed in prison to protect his identity. Mike refuses, and Walt shoots him with the gun from the go bag.  After following a mortally wounded Mike to the edge of a river, Walt comes to the realization that he could have simply asked Lydia for the names. Walt begins to apologize, but Mike stops him, saying \"let me die in peace.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Molloy |first=Tim |title=\"Breaking Bad\" star Jonathan Banks: \"The bad guy's gotta die\" |url=https://news.yahoo.com/breaking-bad-star-jonathan-banks-bad-guys-gotta-201325777.html |website=Yahoo!

In a discussion that takes place shortly before Mike and Jesse leave Walt's meth business, Jesse asks Mike where he would go if he could start over.  Mike says if he was younger, he would go to [[Alaska]], an idea Jesse finds appealing. Jesse expresses a desire to make amends for past wrongdoing, but Mike cautions that starting over will make it impossible.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://etcanada.com/video/f73606ac-dd83-11e9-bfeb-5a25fcbd3cd5/jonathan-banks-confirms-el-camino-role/ |title=Jonathan Banks Confirms 'El Camino' Role |website=[[ET Canada]] |date=September 22, 2019 |access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Jonathan Banks 2012 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Banks]] portrays Mike Ehrmantraut in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul''.]]\nThe ''Breaking Bad'' [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]] episode \"[[Say My Name (Breaking Bad)|Say My Name]]\" received critical acclaim, with many critics singling out Jonathan Banks and [[Bryan Cranston]] for particular praise.
