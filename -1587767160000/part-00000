Martin plays a poor waiter. He has many mishaps, including pouring water before placing down the glasses, forcing the couple to repeat their order of \"two martinis\" three times, and subsequently bringing them six martinis. The film culminates with the wife becoming angry that she got dressed up, hired a babysitter and then was brought out to a restaurant with such amazingly bad service.

It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. A series of [[Regional Red List]]s are produced by countries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.\n\nThe IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the [[extinction]] risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction. According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) (1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity, to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.<ref>CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants Committees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7\u20139 December 2000, retrieved 14 November 2012</ref>\n\nMajor species assessors include [[BirdLife International]], the [[Institute of Zoology]] (the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]]), the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], and many Specialist Groups within the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.\n\nThe IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a [[peer review]]ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of [[BirdLife International]], an entire class ([[Bird|Aves]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//about/overview#redlist_authorities |title=Red List Overview |work=IUCN Red List |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630010436/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/overview#redlist_authorities |archivedate=30 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of species included on the Red List has been increasing over time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Thomas E.|author-link=Thomas Lovejoy|date=8 August 2017|title=Extinction tsunami can be avoided|journal=[[PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=32|pages=8840\u20138841|doi=10.1073/pnas.1711074114|pmc=5559057|pmid=28747527|doi-access=free}}</ref> As of 2019, of 105,000 species surveyed, 28,338 are considered at risk of extinction because of human activity, in particular a [[overfishing]], [[hunting]] and [[land development]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5629548/almost-30000-species-face-extinction-new-report|title='The Numbers Are Just Horrendous.'

It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. A series of [[Regional Red List]]s are produced by countries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.\n\nThe IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the [[extinction]] risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction. According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) (1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity, to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.<ref>CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants Committees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7\u20139 December 2000, retrieved 14 November 2012</ref>\n\nMajor species assessors include [[BirdLife International]], the [[Institute of Zoology]] (the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]]), the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], and many Specialist Groups within the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.\n\nThe IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a [[peer review]]ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of [[BirdLife International]], an entire class ([[Bird|Aves]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//about/overview#redlist_authorities |title=Red List Overview |work=IUCN Red List |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630010436/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/overview#redlist_authorities |archivedate=30 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of species included on the Red List has been increasing over time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Thomas E.|author-link=Thomas Lovejoy|date=8 August 2017|title=Extinction tsunami can be avoided|journal=[[PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=32|pages=8840\u20138841|doi=10.1073/pnas.1711074114|pmc=5559057|pmid=28747527|doi-access=free}}</ref> As of 2019, of 105,000 species surveyed, 28,338 are considered at risk of extinction because of human activity, in particular a [[overfishing]], [[hunting]] and [[land development]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5629548/almost-30000-species-face-extinction-new-report|title='The Numbers Are Just Horrendous.'

The soldiers and people of the European Allies had fought and endured for more than four years to uphold the barrier of civilization against the aggressions of armed force. We ourselves had been in the conflict something more than a year and a half.\n\nWith splendid forgetfulness of mere personal concerns, we remodeled our industries, concentrated our financial resources, increased our agricultural output, and assembled a great army, so that at the last our power was a decisive factor in the victory. We were able to bring the vast resources, material and moral, of a great and free people to the assistance of our associates in Europe who had suffered and sacrificed without limit in the cause for which we fought.\n\nOut of this victory there arose new possibilities of political freedom and economic concert. The war showed us the strength of great nations acting together for high purposes, and the victory of arms foretells the enduring conquests which can be made in peace when nations act justly and in furtherance of the common interests of men.\n\nTo us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service, and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of nations.\n\nWOODROW WILSON<ref name = cmh>{{cite web| url =https://books.google.com/?id=WYg_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA8803&lpg=PA8803&dq=%22a+year+ago+today+our+enemies+laid+down+their+arms%22#v=onepage&q=%22a%20year%20ago%20today%20our%20enemies%20laid%20down%20their%20arms%22&f=false| title = Supplement to the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: Covering the Second Term of Woodrow Wilson, March 4, 1917, to March 4, 1921 | date = 11 November 2015| publisher = Bureau of National Literature}}</ref>}}\n\nThe United States Congress adopted a resolution on June 4, 1926, requesting that President [[Calvin Coolidge]] issue annual proclamations calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies.<ref name = cmh/> A Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code, Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made November 11 in each year a legal holiday: \"a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be thereafter celebrated and known as 'Armistice Day'.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Veterans Day History|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetdayhistory.asp|publisher=Veteran's Affairs|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Veterans Day parade in Baltimore, 2016.jpg|thumb|Veterans Day parade in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], 2016]]\nIn 1945, [[World War II]] veteran Raymond Weeks from [[Birmingham, Alabama]], had the idea to expand Armistice Day to celebrate all veterans, not just those who died in [[World War I]].

Major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, when the [[Armistice with Germany]] went into effect. At the urging of major U.S. veteran organizations, Armistice Day was renamed Veterans Day in 1954.\n\nVeterans Day is distinct from [[Memorial Day]], a U.S. public holiday in May.

The soldiers and people of the European Allies had fought and endured for more than four years to uphold the barrier of civilization against the aggressions of armed force. We ourselves had been in the conflict something more than a year and a half.\n\nWith splendid forgetfulness of mere personal concerns, we remodeled our industries, concentrated our financial resources, increased our agricultural output, and assembled a great army, so that at the last our power was a decisive factor in the victory. We were able to bring the vast resources, material and moral, of a great and free people to the assistance of our associates in Europe who had suffered and sacrificed without limit in the cause for which we fought.\n\nOut of this victory there arose new possibilities of political freedom and economic concert. The war showed us the strength of great nations acting together for high purposes, and the victory of arms foretells the enduring conquests which can be made in peace when nations act justly and in furtherance of the common interests of men.\n\nTo us in America the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service, and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of nations.\n\nWOODROW WILSON<ref name = cmh>{{cite web| url =https://books.google.com/?id=WYg_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA8803&lpg=PA8803&dq=%22a+year+ago+today+our+enemies+laid+down+their+arms%22#v=onepage&q=%22a%20year%20ago%20today%20our%20enemies%20laid%20down%20their%20arms%22&f=false| title = Supplement to the Messages and Papers of the Presidents: Covering the Second Term of Woodrow Wilson, March 4, 1917, to March 4, 1921 | date = 11 November 2015| publisher = Bureau of National Literature}}</ref>}}\n\nThe United States Congress adopted a resolution on June 4, 1926, requesting that President [[Calvin Coolidge]] issue annual proclamations calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies.<ref name = cmh/> A Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code, Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made November 11 in each year a legal holiday: \"a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be thereafter celebrated and known as 'Armistice Day'.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Veterans Day History|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/vetsday/vetdayhistory.asp|publisher=Veteran's Affairs|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Veterans Day parade in Baltimore, 2016.jpg|thumb|Veterans Day parade in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], 2016]]\nIn 1945, [[World War II]] veteran Raymond Weeks from [[Birmingham, Alabama]], had the idea to expand Armistice Day to celebrate all veterans, not just those who died in [[World War I]].

When Veterans Day falls on a Saturday then either Saturday or the preceding Friday may be designated as the holiday, whereas if it falls on a Sunday it is typically observed on the following Monday. When it falls on the weekend many private companies offer it as a floating holiday where employee can choose some other day.

But one night, a few party-happy locals, whose [[liquor]] supply was fast dwindling, decided on a quick solution \u2013 a \u201cB & E Party\u201d at a boarded-up old saloon. The bar was fixed up and named Sam's Saloon after one of the previous owners who had been a respected member of the community. The brazen men then got talking about sprucing up the pioneer community to make it a heritage stop for tourists. For the next quarter century, locals restored old homes and businesses and soon visitors were attracted from all parts of Alberta, Canada and the U.S. The highlight of the community's new fame came in 1988 when a cinema production team used Rowley as the set for the hit Canadian movie ''[[Bye Bye Blues (film)|Bye Bye Blues]]''. Part of Rowley's charm is that while locals have spent thousands of dollars fixing up many of the old community's homes and buildings to reflect the town's pioneer days, there are still many others left abandoned, and offer ghost towners wonderful photo opportunities. 1999 also saw the regional train service through Rowley end and locals are worried about the community's future.\" were losing money\", said one '''old-timer''', noting as many as 900 train tourists a week would get off at the Rowley station, which also serves as the town's museum.

In the mid-1970s, Rowley, which once boasted a population of about 500 in the 1920s, was a beat-up dying community, with rows of empty houses and businesses, and inhabited by only a few dozen prairie-hardened souls. But one night, a few party-happy locals, whose [[liquor]] supply was fast dwindling, decided on a quick solution \u2013 a \u201cB & E Party\u201d at a boarded-up old saloon. The bar was fixed up and named Sam's Saloon after one of the previous owners who had been a respected member of the community. The brazen men then got talking about sprucing up the pioneer community to make it a heritage stop for tourists. For the next quarter century, locals restored old homes and businesses and soon visitors were attracted from all parts of Alberta, Canada and the U.S. The highlight of the community's new fame came in 1988 when a cinema production team used Rowley as the set for the hit Canadian movie ''[[Bye Bye Blues (film)|Bye Bye Blues]]''. Part of Rowley's charm is that while locals have spent thousands of dollars fixing up many of the old community's homes and buildings to reflect the town's pioneer days, there are still many others left abandoned, and offer ghost towners wonderful photo opportunities. 1999 also saw the regional train service through Rowley end and locals are worried about the community's future. \"That's really going to hurt our cash flow\", said one old-timer, noting as many as 900 train tourists a week would get off at the Rowley station, which also serves as the town's museum. However, the town, which now has an official population of 10 as of 2019,<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=David|title=Capturing Canada Like You\u2019ve Never Seen It Before|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2013/08/02/naomi_harris_oh_canada_is_a_road_trip_for_a_canadian_photographer_looking.html|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref> is still hoping word-of-mouth will keep tourists coming.

This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Like zinc, it demonstrates [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the [[transition metal]]s in [[group 3 element|groups 3]] through [[group 11 element|11]]. Cadmium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled ''d'' or ''f'' electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by [[Friedrich Stromeyer|Stromeyer]] and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann|Hermann]], both in Germany, as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]].\n\nCadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production.

Two of them are [[radionuclide|radioactive]], and three are expected to [[radioactive decay|decay]] but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are <sup>113</sup>Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is {{val|7.7|e=15|u=y}}) and <sup>116</sup>Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is {{val|2.9|e=19|u=y}}). The other three are <sup>106</sup>Cd, <sup>108</sup>Cd (both [[double electron capture]]), and <sup>114</sup>Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes&nbsp;\u2013 <sup>110</sup>Cd, <sup>111</sup>Cd, and <sup>112</sup>Cd&nbsp;\u2013 are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are <sup>109</sup>Cd with a half-life of 462.6&nbsp;days, and <sup>115</sup>Cd with a half-life of 53.46&nbsp;hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5&nbsp;hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5&nbsp;minutes. Cadmium has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being <sup>113m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 14.1&nbsp;years), <sup>115m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 44.6&nbsp;days), and <sup>117m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 3.36&nbsp;hours).<ref name=\"NUBASE\">{{NUBASE 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>95</sup>Cd) to 131.946&nbsp;u (<sup>132</sup>Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112&nbsp;u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element&nbsp;47 ([[silver]]). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through [[beta emission]] producing element&nbsp;49 ([[indium]]).<ref name=\"NUBASE\"/>\n\nOne isotope of cadmium, <sup>113</sup>Cd, [[neutron capture|absorbs neutrons]] with high selectivity: With very high probability, neutrons with energy below the ''cadmium cut-off'' will be absorbed; those higher than the ''cut-off will be transmitted''.

Thus, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct of mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, [[lead]] and [[copper]]. Small amounts of cadmium, about 10% of consumption, are produced from secondary sources, mainly from dust generated by recycling iron and steel scrap.

This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Like zinc, it demonstrates [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the [[transition metal]]s in [[group 3 element|groups 3]] through [[group 11 element|11]]. Cadmium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled ''d'' or ''f'' electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by [[Friedrich Stromeyer|Stromeyer]] and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann|Hermann]], both in Germany, as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]].\n\nCadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production. Cadmium was used for a long time as a corrosion-resistant plating on [[steel]], and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow [[cadmium pigments|pigment]]s, to color [[colored glass|glass]], and to stabilize [[plastic]].

Two of them are [[radionuclide|radioactive]], and three are expected to [[radioactive decay|decay]] but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are <sup>113</sup>Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is {{val|7.7|e=15|u=y}}) and <sup>116</sup>Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is {{val|2.9|e=19|u=y}}). The other three are <sup>106</sup>Cd, <sup>108</sup>Cd (both [[double electron capture]]), and <sup>114</sup>Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes&nbsp;\u2013 <sup>110</sup>Cd, <sup>111</sup>Cd, and <sup>112</sup>Cd&nbsp;\u2013 are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are <sup>109</sup>Cd with a half-life of 462.6&nbsp;days, and <sup>115</sup>Cd with a half-life of 53.46&nbsp;hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5&nbsp;hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5&nbsp;minutes. Cadmium has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being <sup>113m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 14.1&nbsp;years), <sup>115m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 44.6&nbsp;days), and <sup>117m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 3.36&nbsp;hours).<ref name=\"NUBASE\">{{NUBASE 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>95</sup>Cd) to 131.946&nbsp;u (<sup>132</sup>Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112&nbsp;u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element&nbsp;47 ([[silver]]). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through [[beta emission]] producing element&nbsp;49 ([[indium]]).<ref name=\"NUBASE\"/>\n\nOne isotope of cadmium, <sup>113</sup>Cd, [[neutron capture|absorbs neutrons]] with high selectivity: With very high probability, neutrons with energy below the ''cadmium cut-off'' will be absorbed; those higher than the ''cut-off will be transmitted''. The cadmium cut-off is about 0.5&nbsp;eV, and neutrons below that level are deemed [[slow neutron]]s, distinct from intermediate and [[fast neutron]]s.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last=Knoll |first=G.

The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, because it was found in this zinc ore. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not. He was persistent in studying these results and eventually isolated cadmium metal by [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] and reducing the [[cadmium sulfide|sulfide]]. The potential for cadmium yellow as pigment was recognized in the 1840s, but the lack of cadmium limited this application.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |last1=Waterston |first1=W.\n |last2=Burton |first2=J.
