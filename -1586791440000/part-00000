To define the game's style, Klepacki listened to a number of bands, including [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]],<ref name=\"twistedinterview\" /><ref name=\"behindcc\" /> which would supply the iconic [[industrial music|industrial]] style found in the majority of the songs. He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company's recent shift to 22 [[Hertz|kHz]] audio, Klepacki composed with an ASR-10 sampler, a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] S760 sampler, a Roland JD 990 synth module, and an [[electric guitar]].<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> The first few songs he composed for ''Command & Conquer'' contained voice samples\u2014including the notable pieces ''Act on Instinct'' and ''No Mercy'' (which featured wild declarations from ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''). The samples were later found to interfere with the game's spoken audio, and were replaced with versions lacking the voices, although the original versions (and several other unused pieces) can still be found on the DOS ''C&C'' and ''Covert Operations'' discs. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game's commercial soundtrack.<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> He would continue to sample clips from film and other media throughout his career, using a quote from ''[[The Brain from Planet Arous]]'' in the ''Yuri's Revenge'' soundtrack ''Brainfreeze'', for example. Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces for ''Command & Conquer'', drawing influences from  [[orchestra]]l, [[house music|house]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[hip hop music]]. For the [[credit (creative arts)|credits]], Klepacki wrote ''Airstrike'', featuring a hook later used in ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' for the Global Defense Initiative. Conversely, the Brotherhood of Nod ending used the song ''Destructible Times'' written by Klepacki's local band, [[I Am (American band)|I AM]]. Developers requested the song because it \"reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of Nod's side.\"<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> The ''C&C'' expansion pack ''The Covert Operations'' featured seven new [[ambient music|ambient]] pieces, all of which were also included on the disc in high quality [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CD Audio]] format.<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.<ref name=\"westwoodcatalogue\">{{Cite book | year=2000 | author=Westwood Studios | title=The Westwood Studios Catalog | publisher=Westwood Studios }}</ref>\n\nWhile working on ''Covert Operations'', Klepacki composed ''Hell March'' from the idea of \"a rock tune to marching boots,\" finishing the song in one day after inventing the guitar riff.<ref name=\"gameplaylistinterview\">{{cite web | date=8 November 2008 | title=Interview of Frank Klepacki | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.gameplaylist.org/?p=3| accessdate=15 June 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref> Upon listening, director [[Brett Sperry]] insisted this song be used as the signature theme of ''Command & Conquer: Red Alert.''<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples\u2014including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting orders.

Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like ''Workmen'' and ''Crush'', then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as ''Vector'' and ''Roll Out''. Klepacki scored ''Fogger'' and ''Mud'', one of his personal favorites, before finishing with ''Militant Force'' and ''Radio 2''. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by [[Kane (Command & Conquer)|Kane]] and an Allied commander in the [[cut scene]]s of ''Red Alert''.

Westwood instead wanted ''Tiberian Sun'' to feature darker, more moody music, and ''Stomp'' was shelved in favor of the current sound.

To define the game's style, Klepacki listened to a number of bands, including [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]],<ref name=\"twistedinterview\" /><ref name=\"behindcc\" /> which would supply the iconic [[industrial music|industrial]] style found in the majority of the songs. He combined various elements of this music and added his own touch to create a unique sound. With the company's recent shift to 22 [[Hertz|kHz]] audio, Klepacki composed with an ASR-10 sampler, a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] S760 sampler, a Roland JD 990 synth module, and an [[electric guitar]].<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> The first few songs he composed for ''Command & Conquer'' contained voice samples\u2014including the notable pieces ''Act on Instinct'' and ''No Mercy'' (which featured wild declarations from ''[[Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey]]''). The samples were later found to interfere with the game's spoken audio, and were replaced with versions lacking the voices, although the original versions (and several other unused pieces) can still be found on the DOS ''C&C'' and ''Covert Operations'' discs. Complete versions of the songs later appeared on the game's commercial soundtrack.<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> He would continue to sample clips from film and other media throughout his career, using a quote from ''[[The Brain from Planet Arous]]'' in the ''Yuri's Revenge'' soundtrack ''Brainfreeze'', for example. Klepacki next composed instrumental pieces for ''Command & Conquer'', drawing influences from  [[orchestra]]l, [[house music|house]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[hip hop music]]. For the [[credit (creative arts)|credits]], Klepacki wrote ''Airstrike'', featuring a hook later used in ''[[Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' for the Global Defense Initiative. Conversely, the Brotherhood of Nod ending used the song ''Destructible Times'' written by Klepacki's local band, [[I Am (American band)|I AM]]. Developers requested the song because it \"reflected the war aspect and bad-ass vibe of Nod's side.\"<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> The ''C&C'' expansion pack ''The Covert Operations'' featured seven new [[ambient music|ambient]] pieces, all of which were also included on the disc in high quality [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CD Audio]] format.<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> Though the soundtrack was not released through retail, Westwood sold it by special order through its website and in game catalogues.<ref name=\"westwoodcatalogue\">{{Cite book | year=2000 | author=Westwood Studios | title=The Westwood Studios Catalog | publisher=Westwood Studios }}</ref>\n\nWhile working on ''Covert Operations'', Klepacki composed ''Hell March'' from the idea of \"a rock tune to marching boots,\" finishing the song in one day after inventing the guitar riff.<ref name=\"gameplaylistinterview\">{{cite web | date=8 November 2008 | title=Interview of Frank Klepacki | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.gameplaylist.org/?p=3| accessdate=15 June 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}</ref> Upon listening, director [[Brett Sperry]] insisted this song be used as the signature theme of ''Command & Conquer: Red Alert.''<ref name=\"behindcc\" /> Originally intended for use with the Brotherhood of Nod, it features militaristic samples\u2014including marching, industrial sounds, and a commander shouting orders. Klepacki initially scored ''Red Alert'' with sci-fi camp in mind, but early songs were shelved. He switched gears to write gritty pieces, prompting the ''Red Alert'' team to expand upon the style of ''Command & Conquer''.<ref name=\"behindra\">{{cite web | title=COMMENTARY: Behind the Red Alert Soundtrack | author=Frank Klepacki | url=http://www.frankklepacki.com/ | work=frankklepacki.com | accessdate=27 July 2006}}</ref> In preparing to compose, Klepacki acquired new sample libraries for unique and strange sounds. Particular creative moods would result in a few songs at a time. He first wrote heavy songs like ''Workmen'' and ''Crush'', then composed neutral, synthesizer-laden music, such as ''Vector'' and ''Roll Out''. Klepacki scored ''Fogger'' and ''Mud'', one of his personal favorites, before finishing with ''Militant Force'' and ''Radio 2''. He took breaks from working to make cameo appearances as a Soviet soldier killed by [[Kane (Command & Conquer)|Kane]] and an Allied commander in the [[cut scene]]s of ''Red Alert''.

Westwood instead wanted ''Tiberian Sun'' to feature darker, more moody music, and ''Stomp'' was shelved in favor of the current sound. Bereft of ideas due to the stark change in direction, Klepacki asked Mendelson to collaborate; he regards tracks they both worked on as the best.

Instead of touring the world, I receive fan mail from around the world. Instead of selling millions of albums, my music is on millions of games! And I sell enough of my own albums that allows me to keep releasing them. So in a different way, I kind of got what I wanted after all. And I'm more than happy with that.

{"title_page": "Preston and Wyre Joint Railway", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2017}}\n\nThe '''Preston and Wyre Railway''' was promoted to open up agricultural land in [[the Fylde]] in Lancashire, access a new port at what became [[Fleetwood]] and the [[Lancaster Canal]] at [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]: it opened in 1840. An associated company built the dock leading to the cmpany changing its name to the '''Preston and Wyre Railway, Harbour and Dock Company'''. Passenger business was more buoyant than expected, and the company built branch lines to the nascent resort of [[Blackpool]] and [[Lytham St Annes|Lytham]] that opened in 1846. At that time the line was leased by the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] and later the [[London and North Western Railway]] took a share in the lease which was later converted to outright ownership. The Preston and Wyre Railway continued o be jointly owned as the '''Preston and Wyre Joint Railway'''..\n\nThe '''Blackpool and Lytham Railway''' built a line without making any junction with the Preston and Wyre railway in 1863. In 1871 it was taken into the Preston and Wyre group. Passenger traffic in connection with steamer sailings at Fleetwood continued throughout the 19th century and fishing was important but the huge expansion of Blackpool as a holiday and trippers' destination dominated the P&WR network. There were massive peak flows of traffic on summer Saturdays to and from the industrial towns of Lancashire, Yorkshire and elsewhere. The railway carried local pleasure journeys by holidaymakers during their stay, and Blackpool to Fleetwood was a prominent route, served by a frequent railmotor service in the early 20th century.\n\nAfter 1960 the railways' near monopoly of passenger transport to Blackpool declined steeply, and Blackpool Central station was closed and the site sold for development. A revival started in 2018 when electrification of the Blackpool North line brought through trains to and from London and Manchester Airport.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1840.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1840]]\nThe [[North Union Railway]] opened a line from Parkside on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] to Preston on 31 October 1838. Before that a local line had been authorised to connect agricultural districts in the Fylde to a sea harbour in the north-west and the Lancaster Canal at the eastern end.<ref name = bairstow3>Martin Bairstow, ''Railways of Blackpool and the Fylde'', published by Martin Bairstow, Leeds, 2001, {{ISBN|1 871944 23 6}}, page 3</ref> The Fylde, north of the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] estuary and straddling the [[River Wyre]], had agricultural land with rich potential, but the roads were poor and there was no harbour for shipping.\n\n[[Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood|Peter Hesketh]] succeeded to the [[Rossall]] Hall estate in 1824 and in 1831 acquired Royal authorisation to add Fleetwood to his name. He saw that the estate could be developed if a railway connection could be made to Preston and a harbour created in the sheltered estuary of the River Wyre. The harbour became Fleetwood, although at the time there was no settlement.<ref name = bairstow8>Bairstow, page 8</ref>\n\nOn 3 July 1835 an Act was passed authorising the Preston and Wyre Railway and Harbour Company with authorised capital of \u00a3130,000. Another Act of 5 May 1837 authorised a connection to the [[Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway]] which was authorised on the same day.<ref name = lnw21>Bob Gregson, ''The London and North Western Railway Around Preston'', Atkinson Publications Limited, Preston, 2012, {{ISBN|978 1 909134 02 7}}, page 21</ref> Also authorised was access to the [[North Union Railway]]'s station at Preston. A dock was considered to be essential and the company was authorised to construct docks at Fleetwood with capital of \u00a3100,000.<ref name = marshall81>John Marshall, ''The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway: volume 1'', David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, {{ISBN|0 7153 4352 1}}, pages 81 to 83</ref><ref name = holt203>G O Holt, revised Gordon Biddle, ''A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume X: the North West'', David St John Thomas, Newton Abbot, 1986, {{ISBN|0 946537 34 8}}, pages 203 to 206</ref><ref name = fylde10>Barry McLoughlin, ''Railways of the Fylde'', Carnegie Publishing , Preston, 1992, {{ISBN|0 94878984 0}}, page 10</ref>  The Preston and Wyre Dock Company constructed the dock and the two companies were combined on 1 July 1839, forming the Preston and Wyre Railway, Harbour and Dock Company. Peter Hesketh Fleetwood founded the town of Fleetwood in 1836.<ref name = bairstow8/><ref name = grant461>Donald J Grant, ''Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain'', Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, {{ISBN|978 1785893 537}}, page 461</ref><ref name = fylde6>McLoughlin, page 6</ref>\n\n==Route and opening==\nThe line ran from a terminus at Dock Street on the southern part of the promontory that forms Fleetwood.<ref group = note>There was no dock yet, but the street name existed because Hesketh's plans were already formulated.</ref> It continued south in a straight line for two miles across tidal marshes known as Cold Dubbs where it was to be carried on embankment. The intention was to reclaim the marshes which would be contained by the embankment but engineering difficulties were encountered during construction and several sections of timber trestle viaduct were substituted.\n\n[[File:Kirkham &amp; Wesham 2 Station geograph-2149083.jpg|thumb|Kirkham station in 1962]]\nThe line continued to [[Poulton-le-Fylde|Poulton]] and [[Kirkham, Lancashire|Kirkham]] and arrangements were made on market days to stop trains at [[Salwick]] and [[Lea Road railway station|Lea Road]] between Kirkham and Preston. There seems to have been no stations at these locations. The Preston station was [[Maudlands railway station|Maudlands]] at Leighton Street, a terminus adjacent to the Lancaster Canal.<ref name = marshall81/><ref name = holt203/><ref name = fylde6/> Maudlands was accessed by crossing the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway on the level. The L&PJR line was constructed at a level five feet higher than the P&WR line which had to be lifted to make the level crossing. A connection into the southbound L&PJR was made later enabling Fleetwood trains to use the NUR station. The P&WR ran an omnibus between Maudlands and the NUR station for connecting passenger trains.<ref name = lnw30>Gregson, LNWR, page 30</ref><ref name = marshall81/>\n\nThe dock and railway companies were amalgamated by Act of 1 July 1839 but work on the dock was deferred, although a wharf, pier and lighthouses were constructed. The singe line railway opened on 15 July 1840 for a special train and on 16 July to the public.<ref name = marshall81/><ref name = fylde6/><ref name = holt203/><ref name = greville196>M D Greville, ''Chronological List of the Railways of Lancashire, 1828 - 1939'', Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, vol. 105, 1953, page 196</ref>\n\nTraffic exceeded expectations: 20,000 passengers were carried in the first month, and in the six summer months of 1841 the total was 108,000. The line was worked by North Union Railway locomotives and rolling stock.<ref name = holt214>Holt, page 214</ref><ref name = fylde7>McLoughlin, page 7</ref> The Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway opened on 25 June 1840<ref name = lnw22>Gregson, LNWR, page 22</ref>\n\nThe Fleetwood line carried traffic from London to Scotland as there was no through railway line. Trains to  Fleetwood to and a steamer to [[Ardrossan]] and train for the onward journey took about 27 hours. The route ceased to be significant in 1848 with the opening of the [[Caledonian Railway]], providing a through railway route.<ref name = marshall84/><ref name = holt215>Holt, pages 215 and 216</ref><ref name = fylde8>McLoughlin, page 8</ref>\n\n==Branches==\nIn 1844 seaside excursions were run to Fleetwood from Manchester and it became apparent that the emerging resort of Blackpool was an attraction. Hoteliers arranged road connections to their town from Poulton. The Preston and Wyre Railway decided to build a branch to Blackpool from Poulton and an authorising Act was passed on 21 July 1845. The Blackpool branch (to Blackpool North) was built swiftly. During construction the contractor extended the temporary track used for building the line to the sea front to facilitate tipping spoil into the sea. The line opened on 29 April 1846.<ref name = bairstow13>Bairstow, page 13</ref><ref name = marshall84>Marshall, pages 84 and 85</ref><ref name = holt217>Holt, pages 217 and 218</ref><ref name = fylde14>McLoughlin, page 14</ref>\n\n[[File:Salwick 3 railway station geograph-2163356.jpg|thumb|Salwick railway station]]\nThe company decided that a branch to Lytham where there was a small harbour was worthwhile. It was authorised in the Act of 21 July 1845 to run from a junction three-quarters of a mile west of Kirkham. Construction proceeded swiftly and the branch opened on 17 February 1846. Stations were built at Wrea Green<ref group = note>The railway named the station Wray Green until 1875.</ref> and Moss Side and the line forked to a terminus and a spur to serve the dock. Lytham Junction staion was provided at the junction on the main line but it closed in 1853. Lytham portions of trains were detached and attached there until 1874.<ref name = marshall84/><ref name = holt217/><ref name = fylde16>McLoughlin, page 16</ref>\n\n==Amalgamation==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1851.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1851]]\nThe [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] ran excursions over the line and amalgamation was agreed. The Preston & Wyre Railway was leased by the M&LR from 3 August 1846. The M&LR was renamed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway the following year. The London and North Western Railway, that operated of the main line at Preston was then included in the leasing relationship, and by Act of 28 July 1849, the Preston and Wyre Railway was vested in the two railways, a two-thirds share in the L&YR and one third in the LNWR.<ref name = lnw33>Gregson, LNWR, page 33</ref><ref name = marshall85>Marshall, pages 85 and 86</ref><ref name = holt215/><ref name = bairstow9>Bairstow, page 9</ref> The P&WR continued as a leased company until it was dissolved on 1 July 1888 under an LNWR Act dated 7 August of that year. A joint committee was appointed by the LNWR and the L&YR to manage the P&WR network. The line was now known as the Preston and Wyre Joint Line.<ref name = lnw33/><ref name = bairstow9/>\n\n==Preston and Longridge Railway==\n{{main|Preston and Longridge Railway}}\nThe Preston and Longridge Railway opened in 1840, connecting quarries north east of Preston to a terminal at Deepdale Street, in Preston. The company was taken over by the Fleetwood, Preston and West Riding Junction Railway in 1847<ref group = note>Not \"Joint\" Railway.</ref> which planned to connect the Preston and Wyre line to the Longridge line by building a tunnel through high ground. Its ambitious title was justified by a plan to build eastward from the Longridge line to [[Clitheroe]] and [[Skipton]] that was never built.<ref name = grant206>Grant, page 206</ref><ref name = lnw36>Gregson, LNWR, page 36</ref>\n\nThe new section of line in Preston joining the Preston and Wyre Railway near Maudlands with a level crossing of the Lancaster line opened on 14 January 1850. The FP&WRJR was short of money and suspended operating the Longridge line for three weeks in 1852. The Preston and Longridge company resumed control in 1856, and later that year the FP&WRJR took over again. It opened a station at Maudland Bridge on 1 November 1856.<ref name = lnw36/><ref name = quick332>Michael Quick, ''Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology'', the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, fifth (electronic) edition, 2019, page 332</ref><ref name = greville196/>\n\nFor some time goods and mineral wagons were transferred from the Longridge line to the Preston main line station by crossing from Maudland Bridge to the Preston and Wyre line west of the main line and reversing and using the P&WR connection on to the main line. The Longrdige line built its own connection southwards, opening for passengers and goods on 1 June 1885.<ref name = lnw40>Gregson, LNWR, page 40</ref>\n\n== Developments ==\n[[File:Blackpool Central station.jpg|thumb|Blackpool Central station in 1906]]\nThe main line was doubled as far as Burn Naze by 10 August 1846. The embankment between Burn Naze and Fleetwood was to be retained as the up line and a single line, some distance from the original, following a two-mile deviation around the shore was built as the down line openeing on 13 January 1851.<ref name = marshall85/> Problems with the embankment and timber trestle sections caused the original line's abandonment at the same time. The deviation line was a single line that ran to Dock Street in Fleetwood, but entered the station from the south-west. A goods depot was built beyond the passenger station.<ref name = bairstow9/> The deviation was doubled in 1875.<ref name = holt213>Holt, pages 213 to 215</ref>\n\nThe Blackpool branch was doubled by an Act of 26 May 1865, paid for by the companies in proportion.<ref name = marshall86>Marshall, page 86</ref><ref name = bairstow13/>\n\n==Blackpool and Lytham Railway, and more improvements==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1863.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1863]]\nOn 17 May 1861, an Act was passed authorising the Blackpool and Lytham Railway, the future Blackpool South line. The line was ready by autumn 1862. Leisure traffic was expected to be the main income, and the winter months would be quiet and so the opening was delayed until 6 April 1863. The line did not connect to the Lytham branch of the Preston and Wyre Railway, nor at Blackpool, so the line was isolated. The company operated its own trains and had two locomotives. At least one was delivered by being hauled through the streets of Lytham by horses, because of the lack of a railway connection. An intermediate station was built at South Shore. The resort of St Annes did not yet exist.<ref name = bairstow14>Bairstow, page 14</ref><ref name = marshall86/><ref name = fylde17>McLoughlin, page 17</ref>\n\nIn 1871 the independent status of the line was reviewed because of financial difficulties, and by an Act of 29 June 1871, amalgamation with the Preston and Wyre Railway was authorised, along with provision for a connecting line at Lytham.\n\nThe Lytham branch made a sharp divergence about three-quarters of a mile west of Kirkham. An Act of 1873 authorised a cut-off line, a little under a mile and a half in length and a connecting line was authorised at Lytham, connecting the Blackpool line to the original Lytham branch. Both sections were double track from opening on 1 July 1874. Lytham station on the P&WR was reduced to goods station status. The single line link at Kirkham, now by-passed, was retained for the west-facing connection at what became called Kirkham Old Junction, enabling direct running from Lytham towards Poulton. The east-facing curve at Kirkham was closed in 1874. The Blackpool and Lytham line was doubled in 1876.<ref name = bairstow14/><ref name = marshall86/><ref name = holt218>Holt, page 218</ref><ref name = fylde17/>\n\n==Maudlands closure==\nThe Preston terminus of the Preston and Wyre Railway at Maudlands was close to a canal basin, but a connecting line was built to the North Union Railway's Preston station. Interconnection with other railways was important and so the Maudlands connection was retained for goods purposes but its passenger use ended in 1844. A flat crossing with the West Coast Main Line was built in 1850 when the Preston and Longridge Railway was opened. It's station was at Maudland Bridge and its line continued westwards to join the P&WR, enabling Longridge traffic to reach Fleetwood, and making an additional flat crossing of the WCML. In 1885 the flat crossings were removed, the Longridge line making an ordinary southwards junction, which the P&WR already had made.\n\n==Fleetwood dock traffic==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1876.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1876]]\nFleetwood Dock was authorised at the outset, but work only started in 1869 and was soon stopped. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway took over construction and it opened in 1878. The short branch to Wyre Dock was L&YR property.<ref name =  casserley144>H C Casserley, ''Britain's Joint Lines'', Ian Allan Publishing, Shepperton, 1968, IBSN 0 7110 0024 7, page 144</ref>\n\n[[File:Boat train at Fleetwood.jpg|thumb|A boat train at Fleetwood in 1901]]\nThe L&YR and the LNWR had powers to operate steamer services to [[Belfast]], [[Derry|Londonderry]] and the [[Isle of Man]] and operated through boat trains. On 15 July 1883 a new station opened on the quay at Fleetwood for transfer from boat trains to the steamers, and traffic developed greatly. The old station was closed as the new station better served the promenade for passengers not transferring to the steamers. Some fishing vessels used Fleetwood from 1860, but in 1892 a trawler fishing fleet was established by a [[Grimsby]] firm and the town became the largest fishing port on the west coast and the third largest in Britain, with heavy fish traffic sent by rail.<ref name = holt213/><ref name = bairstow8/>\n\n==Passenger trains==\nIn 1895 the first Club Carriage was run between Blackpool Central and Manchester, membership of the club was restricted to first-class season ticket holders who also paid a membership fee. Elaborately furnished carriages were built and for many years returned from Manchester to Blackpool each evening by the 5.10 pm and 5.55 pm residential expresses. At one time they conveyed slip portions which were detached at Kirkham. A lesser-known L&YR residential train for East Lancashire business men ran non-stop from Lytham to [[Rose Grove railway station|Rose Grove]], slipping the three rear coaches at [[Blackburn]].<ref name = holt219>Holt, pages 219 to 221</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1901 the first L&YR corridor and dining car express was introduced between Fleetwood and Leeds via Manchester, connecting with the Belfast steamer.<ref name = holt213/> Belfast steamer sailings from Fleetwood continued until the improvement of the [[Heysham]] service in 1928. The summer service to [[Douglas, Isle of Man]] lasted until 1961, when heavy repairs were trequired to the quay and the expense could not be justified. Fleetwood terminus and the line from Wyre Dock were closed on 18 April 1966. The former Wyre Dock station was renamed Fleetwood, but the passenger service between here and Poulton ceased on 1 June 1970.<ref name = holt213/>\n\n==Infrastructure improvements==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1903.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1903]]The rapid and huge development of Blackpool as a holiday and trippers' destination continued in the latter decades of the nineteenth century, and the line between Preston and Kirkham was quadrupled, opening in the year 1889.<ref name = bairstow13/><ref name = fylde21>McLoughlin, page 21</ref>\n\nThe Preston & Wyre Railway terminus in Blackpool (Talbot Road) was completely rebuilt and enlarged from 1896. The main platforms had a total length of 3,600 feet and the excursion platforms 6,300 feet; they were fully opened in the Spring of 1898.<ref name = fylde21/>\n\nThe original alignment of the Fleetwood main line passed Poulton at some distance, so that the station was not conveniently located. When the Blackpool branch was opened in 1846, it left the Fleetwood line by a sharp curve, and there was a west curve, enabling Blackpool to Fleetwood direct running.<ref group = note>Shown in contemporary Ordnance Survey plans, but not in Cobb.</ref><ref name = holt219/> The alignment was obviously unsatisfactory, and on 28 March 1896, a new loop line by-passing Poulton by a loop was opened, enabling a station better located for the town.<ref group = note>According to Holt; McLoughlin says 6 April 1896.</ref> The Blackpool branch left by a more gently curved line from the new Poulton station; the approach to the old Poulton station from the Preston direction was retained for goods purposes, as the town had grown towards that station over the years. A west curve on the new line was opened on 1 July 1899, and a platform called Poulton Curve Halt was opened on it on 1 February 1909, used by a [[railmotor]] service between Blackpool and Fleetwood. There were 19 trains each way daily.<ref name = bairstow13/><ref name = holt219/><ref name = fylde21/>\n\n[[File:Blackpool central railway station1818598 f45c256b.jpg|thumb|Blackpool Central station in 1959]]The approach from Kirkham to Blackpool Central was roundabout, running via Lytham, and a new direct line was authorised by Act of 20 July 1896. It opened on 21 April 1903 for goods traffic, and to all trains on 30 May 1903. It saved five miles on the journey: it ran from a grade-separated junction at Kirkham North Junction to a junction near Blackpool South Shore, and it was known as the \"New line\" or the \"Marton line\". In winter ordinary passenger trains used the Lytham route, but in summer the traffic on the New Line was heavy. For some years the slip portion of the 5.10 pm from Manchester ran from Kirkham to Blackpool Central by this route, arriving ahead of the main train. New platforms were opened on the line at Waterloo Road, close to South Shore.<ref name = bairstow17>Bairstow, page 17</ref><ref name = holt219/><ref name = fylde22>McLoughlin, page 22</ref>\n\nAn Act of 1899 authorised a flyover approaching Kirkham for the New Line, providing a grade-separated junction.<ref name = bairstow17/>\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Blackpool Central station was being reconstructed, with 9,000 feet of platforms being provided; the enlarged station was opening for Easter 1901. In 1903 widening from there to the junction at South Shore was ready.\n\nOn 1 October 1913 halts were opened at Burlington Road and Gillett's Crossing when a railmotor service was introduced between Blackpool Central and Lytham. The halts were closed on 1 October 1915 but reopened on 1 March 1920, finally closing on 11 September 1939. In March 1932 Waterloo Road station was renamed Blackpool South and Talbot Road became Blackpool North. By this time the North station had 15 platforms, although eight were set apart for excursion traffic outside the overall roof.<ref name = holt221>Holt, pages 221 and 222</ref>\n\n==Cleveleys over the tramway==\nThe Blackpool tramway system was founded in 1885, and the line to Fleetwood was opened on 14 July 1888, running in a segregated alignment for much of the way.<ref name = trams>Blackpool Tramway, at www.thetrams.co.uk/blackpool</ref><ref name = holt221/>\n\nAs the coastal strip between Blackpool and Fleetwood became developed, the L&YR and LNWR sought powers to build a branch line to Cleveleys, but instead came to an agreement under which the tramway was connected with the railway at Fleetwood. Goods wagons were worked over the tramway to Cleveleys. The arrangement continued until 1949.<ref name = holt221/>\n\n==Diesel train trial==\nIn 1928 a four-car diesel passenger train was installed on the Preston to Blackpool Central via Lytham service, starting on 25 July. The train was a conversion of an electric train that had been used at [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]]. In September 1928 it was withdrawn for installation of a stronger bogie under the power unit. The train was put back into service for the illuminations at the end of 1928 but a crankshaft failed on 9 December and it was out of use until 27 March 1929. It was then in use for three weeks until 18 April when it was finally withdrawn and later scrapped. It had only operated for 30% of available days. Quite apart from the reliability issues, it was calculated that the operating cost savings were not sufficient to justify the capital cost of wider introduction.<ref name = bairstow28>Bairstow, page 28</ref>\n\n==Traffic decline==\n[[File:Site of Blackpool Central railway station.jpg|thumb|The site of Blackpool Central railway station looking south; Blackpool South station can be seen in the background]]Blackpool was an extraordinary phenomenon of British seaside holidays, and for decades the railways had struggled to handle the volume of passengers, and the number of train movements, although this was highly seasonal. Nevertheless, road motor coaches began to handle the traffic in increasing numbers after 1945, as distances from the Lancashire and West Yorkshire industrial towns were not great. The decline in railway business in an era of scepticism about financial loss-making on the railways meant that it was impossible to sustain the former levels of train service, and of infrastructure.<ref name = fylde55>McLoughlin, pages 55 to 57</ref>\n\nBlackpool Central station was closed at the end of the 1964 Illuminations period, on 2 November, and the site was sold; trains on the coast line terminated at Blackpool South, and a few years later they were only shuttle services to and from Kirkham. The Fleetwood to Blackpool passenger service had finished in 1964. On 18 April 1966 the Fleetwood line was cut back to Wyre Dock.\n\nThe New Line from Kirkham closed on 6 September 1965, although it was used for excursion trains until 13 February 1967. In 1970 the Euston-Blackpool services, which had hitherto travelled via Lytham, were diverted to the North station. In January 1974 this station was rebuilt on the site of the former excursion platforms, on a smaller scale to suit modern requirements.<ref name = holt221/><ref name = fylde55/>\n\nThe south to west connection at Kirkham, which used part of the original Lytham branch, was closed in 1967, and the retained connection to Poulton old goods station was closed in 1968; the west curve on the new line at Poulton was closed in 1972.\n\nThe passenger service between Fleetwood and Poulton ceased on 1 June 1970. The line remained open to chemical works at Burn Naze, but beyond that, Fleetwood and the docks were no longer rail-served.<ref name = holt216>Holt, pages 213 \u2013 217</ref> The entire branch from Poulton closed in 1992.\n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s the Blackpool South branch, as it had become, was singled, and the quadruple track between Preston and Kirkham was reduced to double track.<ref name = fylde61>McLoughlin, page 61</ref>\n\n==The present day==\n{{main|Blackpool branch lines}}\n<!---date within body text--->\nDuring a long period of decline, the Blackpool North line became a medium-level branch from Preston, and the Blackpool South line a local shuttle subsidiary of that, from Kirkham. The Fleetwood line is no more. For some time local opinion formers have demanded better services, and electrification of the line from Preston to Blackpool North was implemented. This was commissioned in time for new passenger services to operate from 16 April 2018. There are (2020) three through trains to and from London in the timetable and a half-hourly service to Manchester. The service from Blackpool South is typically hourly.<ref name = elec>''Electrification of the Blackpool Railway Line'' at https://www.liveblackpool.info/about/getting-here/electrification-of-blackpool-railway-line/</ref><ref name = natrail>National Rail publicity</ref>\n\n==Accidents==\n===Poulton 1893===\nThere was a serious accident on 1 July 1893, when a light excursion train returning from Blackpool to Stockport became derailed at speed on Poulton curve.

An associated company built the dock leading to the cmpany changing its name to the '''Preston and Wyre Railway, Harbour and Dock Company'''. Passenger business was more buoyant than expected, and the company built branch lines to the nascent resort of [[Blackpool]] and [[Lytham St Annes|Lytham]] that opened in 1846. At that time the line was leased by the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] and later the [[London and North Western Railway]] took a share in the lease which was later converted to outright ownership. The Preston and Wyre Railway continued o be jointly owned as the '''Preston and Wyre Joint Railway'''..\n\nThe '''Blackpool and Lytham Railway''' built a line without making any junction with the Preston and Wyre railway in 1863. In 1871 it was taken into the Preston and Wyre group. Passenger traffic in connection with steamer sailings at Fleetwood continued throughout the 19th century and fishing was important but the huge expansion of Blackpool as a holiday and trippers' destination dominated the P&WR network. There were massive peak flows of traffic on summer Saturdays to and from the industrial towns of Lancashire, Yorkshire and elsewhere. The railway carried local pleasure journeys by holidaymakers during their stay, and Blackpool to Fleetwood was a prominent route, served by a frequent railmotor service in the early 20th century.\n\nAfter 1960 the railways' near monopoly of passenger transport to Blackpool declined steeply, and Blackpool Central station was closed and the site sold for development. A revival started in 2018 when electrification of the Blackpool North line brought through trains to and from London and Manchester Airport.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1840.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1840]]\nThe [[North Union Railway]] opened a line from Parkside on the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] to Preston on 31 October 1838. Before that a local line had been authorised to connect agricultural districts in the Fylde to a sea harbour in the north-west and the Lancaster Canal at the eastern end.<ref name = bairstow3>Martin Bairstow, ''Railways of Blackpool and the Fylde'', published by Martin Bairstow, Leeds, 2001, {{ISBN|1 871944 23 6}}, page 3</ref> The Fylde, north of the [[River Ribble|Ribble]] estuary and straddling the [[River Wyre]], had agricultural land with rich potential, but the roads were poor and there was no harbour for shipping.\n\n[[Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood|Peter Hesketh]] succeeded to the [[Rossall]] Hall estate in 1824 and in 1831 acquired Royal authorisation to add Fleetwood to his name. He saw that the estate could be developed if a railway connection could be made to Preston and a harbour created in the sheltered estuary of the River Wyre. The harbour became Fleetwood, although at the time there was no settlement.<ref name = bairstow8>Bairstow, page 8</ref>\n\nOn 3 July 1835 an Act was passed authorising the Preston and Wyre Railway and Harbour Company with authorised capital of \u00a3130,000. Another Act of 5 May 1837 authorised a connection to the [[Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway]] which was authorised on the same day.<ref name = lnw21>Bob Gregson, ''The London and North Western Railway Around Preston'', Atkinson Publications Limited, Preston, 2012, {{ISBN|978 1 909134 02 7}}, page 21</ref> Also authorised was access to the [[North Union Railway]]'s station at Preston. A dock was considered to be essential and the company was authorised to construct docks at Fleetwood with capital of \u00a3100,000.<ref name = marshall81>John Marshall, ''The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway: volume 1'', David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, {{ISBN|0 7153 4352 1}}, pages 81 to 83</ref><ref name = holt203>G O Holt, revised Gordon Biddle, ''A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume X: the North West'', David St John Thomas, Newton Abbot, 1986, {{ISBN|0 946537 34 8}}, pages 203 to 206</ref><ref name = fylde10>Barry McLoughlin, ''Railways of the Fylde'', Carnegie Publishing , Preston, 1992, {{ISBN|0 94878984 0}}, page 10</ref>  The Preston and Wyre Dock Company constructed the dock and the two companies were combined on 1 July 1839, forming the Preston and Wyre Railway, Harbour and Dock Company.

The intention was to reclaim the marshes which would be contained by the embankment but engineering difficulties were encountered during consruction and several sections of timber trestle viaduct were substituted.\n\n[[File:Kirkham &amp; Wesham 2 Station geograph-2149083.jpg|thumb|Kirkham station in 1962]]\nThe line continued to [[Poulton-le-Fylde|Poulton]] and [[Kirkham, Lancashire|Kirkham]] and arrangements were made on market days to stop trains at [[Salwick]] and [[Lea Road railway station|Lea Road]] between Kirkham and Preston. There seems to have been no stations at these locations. The Preston station was [[Maudlands railway station|Maudlands]] at Leighton Street, a terminus adjacent to the Lancaster Canal.<ref name = marshall81/><ref name = holt203/><ref name = fylde6/> Maudlands was accessed by crossing the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway on the level. The L&PJR line was constructed at a level five feet higher than the P&WR line which had to be lifted to make the level crossing. A connection into the southbound L&PJR was made later enabling Fleetwood trains to use the NUR station. The P&WR ran an omnibus between Maudlands and the NUR station for connecting passenger trains.<ref name = lnw30>Gregson, LNWR, page 30</ref><ref name = marshall81/>\n\nThe dock and railway companies were amalgamated by Act of 1 July 1839 but work on the dock was deferred, although a wharf, pier and lighthouses were constructed. The singe line railway opened on 15 July 1840 for a special train and on 16 July to the public.<ref name = marshall81/><ref name = fylde6/><ref name = holt203/><ref name = greville196>M D Greville, ''Chronological List of the Railways of Lancashire, 1828 - 1939'', Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, vol. 105, 1953, page 196</ref>\n\nTraffic exceeded expectations: 20,000 passengers were carried in the first month, and in the six summer months of 1841 the total was 108,000. The line was worked by North Union Railway locomotives and rolling stock.<ref name = holt214>Holt, page 214</ref><ref name = fylde7>McLoughlin, page 7</ref> The Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway opened on 25 June 1840<ref name = lnw22>Gregson, LNWR, page 22</ref>\n\nThe Fleetwood line carried traffic from London to Scotland as there was no through railway line. Trains to  Fleetwood to and a steamer to [[Ardrossan]] and train for the onward journey took about 27 hours. The route ceased to be significant in 1848 with the opening of the [[Caledonian Railway]], providing a through railway route.<ref name = marshall84/><ref name = holt215>Holt, pages 215 and 216</ref><ref name = fylde8>McLoughlin, page 8</ref>\n\n==Branches==\nIn 1844 seaside excursions were run to Fleetwood from Manchester and it became apparent that the emerging resort of Blackpool was an attraction. Hoteliers arranged road connections to their town from Poulton. The Preston and Wyre Railway decided to build a branch to Blackpool from Poulton and an authorising Act was passed on 21 July 1845. The Blackpool branch (to Blackpool North) was built swiftly. During construction the contractor extended the temporary track used for building the line to the sea front to facilitate tipping spoil into the sea. The line opened on 29 April 1846.<ref name = bairstow13>Bairstow, page 13</ref><ref name = marshall84>Marshall, pages 84 and 85</ref><ref name = holt217>Holt, pages 217 and 218</ref><ref name = fylde14>McLoughlin, page 14</ref>\n\n[[File:Salwick 3 railway station geograph-2163356.jpg|thumb|Salwick railway station]]\nThe company decided that a branch to Lytham where there was a small harbour was worthwhile. It was authorised in the Act of 21 July 1845 to run from a junction three-quarters of a mile west of Kirkham. Construction proceeded swiftly and the branch opened on 17 February 1846. Stations were built at Wrea Green<ref group = note>The railway named the station Wray Green until 1875.</ref> and Moss Side and the line forked to a terminus and a spur to serve the dock. Lytham Junction staion was provided at the junction on the main line but it closed in 1853. Lytham portions of trains were detached and attached there until 1874.<ref name = marshall84/><ref name = holt217/><ref name = fylde16>McLoughlin, page 16</ref>\n\n==Amalgamation==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1851.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1851]]\nThe [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] ran excursions over the line and amalgamation was agreed. The Preston & Wyre Railway was leased by the M&LR from 3 August 1846. The M&LR was renamed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway the following year. The London and North Western Railway, that operated of the main line at Preston was then included in the leasing relationship, and by Act of 28 July 1849, the Preston and Wyre Railway was vested in the two railways, a two-thirds share in the L&YR and one third in the LNWR.<ref name = lnw33>Gregson, LNWR, page 33</ref><ref name = marshall85>Marshall, pages 85 and 86</ref><ref name = holt215/><ref name = bairstow9>Bairstow, page 9</ref> The P&WR continued as a leased company until it was dissolved on 1 July 1888 under an LNWR Act dated 7 August of that year. A joint committee was appointed by the LNWR and the L&YR to manage the P&WR network. The line was now known as the Preston and Wyre Joint Line.<ref name = lnw33/><ref name = bairstow9/>\n\n==Preston and Longridge Railway==\n{{main|Preston and Longridge Railway}}\nThe Preston and Longridge Railway opened in 1840, connecting quarries north east of Preston to a terminal at Deepdale Street, in Preston. The company was taken over by the Fleetwood, Preston and West Riding Junction Railway in 1847<ref group = note>Not \"Joint\" Railway.</ref> which planned to connect the Preston and Wyre line to the Longridge line by building a tunnel through high ground. Its ambitious title was justified by a plan to build eastward from the Longridge line to [[Clitheroe]] and [[Skipton]] that was never built.<ref name = grant206>Grant, page 206</ref><ref name = lnw36>Gregson, LNWR, page 36</ref>\n\nThe new section of line in Preston joining the Preston and Wyre Railway near Maudlands with a level crossing of the Lancaster line opened on 14 January 1850. The FP&WRJR was short of money and suspended operating the Longridge line for three weeks in 1852. The Preston and Longridge company resumed control in 1856, and later that year the FP&WRJR took over again. It opened a station at Maudland Bridge on 1 November 1856.<ref name = lnw36/><ref name = quick332>Michael Quick, ''Railway Passenger Stations in England, Scotland and Wales: A Chronology'', the Railway and Canal Historical Society, Richmond, Surrey, fifth (electronic) edition, 2019, page 332</ref><ref name = greville196/>\n\nFor some time goods and mineral wagons were transferred from the Longridge line to the Preston main line station by crossing from Maudland Bridge to the Preston and Wyre line west of the main line and reversing and using the P&WR connection on to the main line. The Longrdige line built its own connection southwards, opening for passengers and goods on 1 June 1885.<ref name = lnw40>Gregson, LNWR, page 40</ref>\n\n== Developments ==\n[[File:Blackpool Central station.jpg|thumb|Blackpool Central station in 1906]]\nThe main line was doubled as far as Burn Naze by 10 August 1846. The embankment between Burn Naze and Fleetwood was to be retained as the up line and a single line, some distance from the original, following a two-mile deviation around the shore was built as the down line openeing on 13 January 1851.<ref name = marshall85/> Problems with the embankment and timber trestle sections caused the original line's abandonment at the same time. The deviation line was a single line that ran to Dock Street in Fleetwood, but entered the station from the south-west. A goods depot was built beyond the passenger station.<ref name = bairstow9/> The deviation was doubled in 1875.<ref name = holt213>Holt, pages 213 to 215</ref>\n\nThe Blackpool branch was doubled by an Act of 26 May 1865, paid for by the companies in proportion.<ref name = marshall86>Marshall, page 86</ref><ref name = bairstow13/>\n\n==Blackpool and Lytham Railway, and more improvements==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1863.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1863]]\nOn 17 May 1861, an Act was passed authorising the Blackpool and Lytham Railway, the future Blackpool South line. The line was ready by autumn 1862. Leisure traffic was expected to be the main income, and the winter months would be quiet and so the opening was delayed until 6 April 1863. The line did not connect to the Lytham branch of the Preston and Wyre Railway, nor at Blackpool, so the line was isolated. The company operated its own trains and had two locomotives. At least one was delivered by being hauled through the streets of Lytham by horses, because of the lack of a railway connection. An intermediate station was built at South Shore. The resort of St Annes did not yet exist.<ref name = bairstow14>Bairstow, page 14</ref><ref name = marshall86/><ref name = fylde17>McLoughlin, page 17</ref>\n\nIn 1871 the independent status of the line was reviewed because of financial difficulties, and by an Act of 29 June 1871, amalgamation with the Preston and Wyre Railway was authorised, along with provision for a connecting line at Lytham.\n\nThe Lytham branch made a sharp divergence about three-quarters of a mile west of Kirkham. An Act of 1873 authorised a cut-off line, a little under a mile and a half in length and a connecting line was authorised at Lytham, connecting the Blackpool line to the original Lytham branch. Both sections were double track from opening on 1 July 1874. Lytham station on the P&WR was reduced to goods station status. The single line link at Kirkham, now by-passed, was retained for the west-facing connection at what became called Kirkham Old Junction, enabling direct running from Lytham towards Poulton. The east-facing curve at Kirkham was closed in 1874. The Blackpool and Lytham line was doubled in 1876.<ref name = bairstow14/><ref name = marshall86/><ref name = holt218>Holt, page 218</ref><ref name = fylde17/>\n\n==Maudlands closure==\nThe Preston terminus of the Preston and Wyre Railway at Maudlands was close to a canal basin, but a connecting line was built to the North Union Railway's Preston station. Interconnection with other railways was important and so the Maudlands connection was retained for goods purposes but its passenger use ended in 1844. A flat crossing with the West Coast Main Line was built in 1850 when the Preston and Longridge Railway was opened. It's station was at Maudland Bridge and its line continued westwards to join the P&WR, enabling Longridge traffic to reach Fleetwood, and making an additional flat crossing of the WCML. In 1885 the flat crossings were removed, the Longridge line making an ordinary southwards junction, which the P&WR already had made.\n\n==Fleetwood dock traffic==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1876.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1876]]\nFleetwood Dock was authorised at the outset, but work only started in 1869 and was soon stopped. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway took over construction and it opened in 1878. The short branch to Wyre Dock was L&YR property.<ref name =  casserley144>H C Casserley, ''Britain's Joint Lines'', Ian Allan Publishing, Shepperton, 1968, IBSN 0 7110 0024 7, page 144</ref>\n\n[[File:Boat train at Fleetwood.jpg|thumb|A boat train at Fleetwood in 1901]]\nThe L&YR and the LNWR had powers to operate steamer services to [[Belfast]], [[Derry|Londonderry]] and the [[Isle of Man]] and operated through boat trains. On 15 July 1883 a new station opened on the quay at Fleetwood for transfer from boat trains to the steamers, and traffic developed greatly. The old station was closed as the new station better served the promenade for passengers not transferring to the steamers. Some fishing vessels used Fleetwood from 1860, but in 1892 a trawler fishing fleet was established by a [[Grimsby]] firm and the town became the largest fishing port on the west coast and the third largest in Britain, with heavy fish traffic sent by rail.<ref name = holt213/><ref name = bairstow8/>\n\n==Passenger trains==\nIn 1895 the first Club Carriage was run between Blackpool Central and Manchester, membership of the club was restricted to first-class season ticket holders who also paid a membership fee. Elaborately furnished carriages were built and for many years returned from Manchester to Blackpool each evening by the 5.10 pm and 5.55 pm residential expresses. At one time they conveyed slip portions which were detached at Kirkham. A lesser-known L&YR residential train for East Lancashire business men ran non-stop from Lytham to [[Rose Grove railway station|Rose Grove]], slipping the three rear coaches at [[Blackburn]].<ref name = holt219>Holt, pages 219 to 221</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1901 the first L&YR corridor and dining car express was introduced between Fleetwood and Leeds via Manchester, connecting with the Belfast steamer.<ref name = holt213/> Belfast steamer sailings from Fleetwood continued until the improvement of the [[Heysham]] service in 1928. The summer service to [[Douglas, Isle of Man]] lasted until 1961, when heavy repairs were trequired to the quay and the expense could not be justified. Fleetwood terminus and the line from Wyre Dock were closed on 18 April 1966. The former Wyre Dock station was renamed Fleetwood, but the passenger service between here and Poulton ceased on 1 June 1970.<ref name = holt213/>\n\n==Infrastructure improvements==\n[[File:Preston&amp;wyre1903.png|thumb|The Preston and Wyre Railway in 1903]]The rapid and huge development of Blackpool as a holiday and trippers' destination continued in the latter decades of the nineteenth century, and the line between Preston and Kirkham was quadrupled, opening in the year 1889.<ref name = bairstow13/><ref name = fylde21>McLoughlin, page 21</ref>\n\nThe Preston & Wyre Railway terminus in Blackpool (Talbot Road) was completely rebuilt and enlarged from 1896. The main platforms had a total length of 3,600 feet and the excursion platforms 6,300 feet; they were fully opened in the Spring of 1898.<ref name = fylde21/>\n\nThe original alignment of the Fleetwood main line passed Poulton at some distance, so that the station was not conveniently located. When the Blackpool branch was opened in 1846, it left the Fleetwood line by a sharp curve, and there was a west curve, enabling Blackpool to Fleetwood direct running.<ref group = note>Shown in contemporary Ordnance Survey plans, but not in Cobb.</ref><ref name = holt219/> The alignment was obviously unsatisfactory, and on 28 March 1896, a new loop line by-passing Poulton by a loop was opened, enabling a station better located for the town.<ref group = note>According to Holt; McLoughlin says 6 April 1896.</ref> The Blackpool branch left by a more gently curved line from the new Poulton station; the approach to the old Poulton station from the Preston direction was retained for goods purposes, as the town had grown towards that station over the years. A west curve on the new line was opened on 1 July 1899, and a platform called Poulton Curve Halt was opened on it on 1 February 1909, used by a [[railmotor]] service between Blackpool and Fleetwood. There were 19 trains each way daily.<ref name = bairstow13/><ref name = holt219/><ref name = fylde21/>\n\n[[File:Blackpool central railway station1818598 f45c256b.jpg|thumb|Blackpool Central station in 1959]]The approach from Kirkham to Blackpool Central was roundabout, running via Lytham, and a new direct line was authorised by Act of 20 July 1896. It opened on 21 April 1903 for goods traffic, and to all trains on 30 May 1903. It saved five miles on the journey: it ran from a grade-separated junction at Kirkham North Junction to a junction near Blackpool South Shore, and it was known as the \"New line\" or the \"Marton line\". In winter ordinary passenger trains used the Lytham route, but in summer the traffic on the New Line was heavy. For some years the slip portion of the 5.10 pm from Manchester ran from Kirkham to Blackpool Central by this route, arriving ahead of the main train. New platforms were opened on the line at Waterloo Road, close to South Shore.<ref name = bairstow17>Bairstow, page 17</ref><ref name = holt219/><ref name = fylde22>McLoughlin, page 22</ref>\n\nAn Act of 1899 authorised a flyover approaching Kirkham for the New Line, providing a grade-separated junction.<ref name = bairstow17/>\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Blackpool Central station was being reconstructed, with 9,000 feet of platforms being provided; the enlarged station was opening for Easter 1901. In 1903 widening from there to the junction at South Shore was ready.\n\nOn 1 October 1913 halts were opened at Burlington Road and Gillett's Crossing when a railmotor service was introduced between Blackpool Central and Lytham. The halts were closed on 1 October 1915 but reopened on 1 March 1920, finally closing on 11 September 1939. In March 1932 Waterloo Road station was renamed Blackpool South and Talbot Road became Blackpool North. By this time the North station had 15 platforms, although eight were set apart for excursion traffic outside the overall roof.<ref name = holt221>Holt, pages 221 and 222</ref>\n\n==Cleveleys over the tramway==\nThe Blackpool tramway system was founded in 1885, and the line to Fleetwood was opened on 14 July 1888, running in a segregated alignment for much of the way.<ref name = trams>Blackpool Tramway, at www.thetrams.co.uk/blackpool</ref><ref name = holt221/>\n\nAs the coastal strip between Blackpool and Fleetwood became developed, the L&YR and LNWR sought powers to build a branch line to Cleveleys, but instead came to an agreement under which the tramway was connected with the railway at Fleetwood. Goods wagons were worked over the tramway to Cleveleys. The arrangement continued until 1949.<ref name = holt221/>\n\n==Diesel train trial==\nIn 1928 a four-car diesel passenger train was installed on the Preston to Blackpool Central via Lytham service, starting on 25 July. The train was a conversion of an electric train that had been used at [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]]. In September 1928 it was withdrawn for installation of a stronger bogie under the power unit. The train was put back into service for the illuminations at the end of 1928 but a crankshaft failed on 9 December and it was out of use until 27 March 1929. It was then in use for three weeks until 18 April when it was finally withdrawn and later scrapped. It had only operated for 30% of available days. Quite apart from the reliability issues, it was calculated that the operating cost savings were not sufficient to justify the capital cost of wider introduction.<ref name = bairstow28>Bairstow, page 28</ref>\n\n==Traffic decline==\n[[File:Site of Blackpool Central railway station.jpg|thumb|The site of Blackpool Central railway station looking south; Blackpool South station can be seen in the background]]Blackpool was an extraordinary phenomenon of British seaside holidays, and for decades the railways had struggled to handle the volume of passengers, and the number of train movements, although this was highly seasonal. Nevertheless, road motor coaches began to handle the traffic in increasing numbers after 1945, as distances from the Lancashire and West Yorkshire industrial towns were not great. The decline in railway business in an era of scepticism about financial loss-making on the railways meant that it was impossible to sustain the former levels of train service, and of infrastructure.<ref name = fylde55>McLoughlin, pages 55 to 57</ref>\n\nBlackpool Central station was closed at the end of the 1964 Illuminations period, on 2 November, and the site was sold; trains on the coast line terminated at Blackpool South, and a few years later they were only shuttle services to and from Kirkham. The Fleetwood to Blackpool passenger service had finished in 1964. On 18 April 1966 the Fleetwood line was cut back to Wyre Dock.\n\nThe New Line from Kirkham closed on 6 September 1965, although it was used for excursion trains until 13 February 1967. In 1970 the Euston-Blackpool services, which had hitherto travelled via Lytham, were diverted to the North station. In January 1974 this station was rebuilt on the site of the former excursion platforms, on a smaller scale to suit modern requirements.<ref name = holt221/><ref name = fylde55/>\n\nThe south to west connection at Kirkham, which used part of the original Lytham branch, was closed in 1967, and the retained connection to Poulton old goods station was closed in 1968; the west curve on the new line at Poulton was closed in 1972.\n\nThe passenger service between Fleetwood and Poulton ceased on 1 June 1970. The line remained open to chemical works at Burn Naze, but beyond that, Fleetwood and the docks were no longer rail-served.<ref name = holt216>Holt, pages 213 \u2013 217</ref> The entire branch from Poulton closed in 1992.\n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s the Blackpool South branch, as it had become, was singled, and the quadruple track between Preston and Kirkham was reduced to double track.<ref name = fylde61>McLoughlin, page 61</ref>\n\n==The present day==\n{{main|Blackpool branch lines}}\n<!---date within body text--->\nDuring a long period of decline, the Blackpool North line became a medium-level branch from Preston, and the Blackpool South line a local shuttle subsidiary of that, from Kirkham. The Fleetwood line is no more. For some time local opinion formers have demanded better services, and electrification of the line from Preston to Blackpool North was implemented. This was commissioned in time for new passenger services to operate from 16 April 2018. There are (2020) three through trains to and from London in the timetable and a half-hourly service to Manchester. The service from Blackpool South is typically hourly.<ref name = elec>''Electrification of the Blackpool Railway Line'' at https://www.liveblackpool.info/about/getting-here/electrification-of-blackpool-railway-line/</ref><ref name = natrail>National Rail publicity</ref>\n\n==Accidents==\n===Poulton 1893===\nThere was a serious accident on 1 July 1893, when a light excursion train returning from Blackpool to Stockport became derailed at speed on Poulton curve.

An express passenger train from Colne to Fleetwood struck an engineers' ballast train at about 45&nbsp;mph. The driver and six passengers died in the collision. The ballast train was working in section but irregular operation of single line working arrangements and misunderstandings of telephone messages led to the express train being signalled through the section, so it was running under clear signals.<ref name = weeton>Ministry of Transport, ''Report on the Collision that occurred on 16th July 1961 at Singleton Bank near Weeton in the London Midland Region of British Railways'', Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London 1961</ref>\n\n==Locations==\n{{Blackpool & Fleetwood Branch Lines}}\n\n===Preston to Fleetwood===\n* Preston Maudlands;
