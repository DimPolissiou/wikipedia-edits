They first appeared during the [[Triassic]] [[Geological period|period]], between 243 and 233.23&nbsp;[[annum|million years ago]], although the exact origin and timing of the [[evolution of dinosaurs]] is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s after the [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event]] 201.3&nbsp;million years ago; their dominance continued through the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. The [[fossil]] record demonstrates that [[bird]]s are modern [[feathered dinosaur]]s, having [[Evolution of birds|evolved]] from earlier [[Theropoda|theropods]] during the [[Late Jurassic]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] approximately 66&nbsp;million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into '''avian dinosaurs''', or birds; and '''non-avian dinosaurs''', which are all dinosaurs other than birds.\n\nDinosaurs are a varied group of animals from [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]], [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[ecology|ecological]] standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living [[species]], are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides [[perciformes|perciform]] fish. Using fossil evidence, [[paleontology|paleontologists]] have identified over 500 distinct [[genus|genera]] and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both [[Neontology#Extant taxa vs. extinct taxa|extant]] species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]. Most [[Dinosaur renaissance|research conducted since the 1970s]], however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated [[metabolism]]s and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], others [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were [[Oviparity|egg-laying]]; and that [[nest]]-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.\n\nWhile dinosaurs were ancestrally [[bipedalism|bipedal]], many [[extinction|extinct]] groups included [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed [[skeleton|skeletal]] modifications such as [[Armour (anatomy)|bony armor]] and [[spine (zoology)|spines]]. While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied\u2014the largest [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of {{convert|39.7|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and heights of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and were the largest land animals of all time. Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy [[bone]]s are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small: ''[[Xixianykus]]'', for example, was only about {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nSince the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[taxon]] 'Dinosauria' was formally named in 1842 by [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Richard Owen|Sir Richard Owen]], who used it to refer to the \"distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles\" that were then being recognized in [[England]] and around the world.<ref name=Owen1841/><ref>{{cite Merriam-Webster|Dinosauria|accessdate=2019-11-10}}</ref> The term is derived {{ety|grc|''[[wikt:\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2|\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2]]'' (deinos)|terrible, potent or fearfully great||''[[wikt:\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2]]'' (sauros)|lizard or reptile}}.<ref name=Owen1841/><ref name=LSJ/> Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty.<ref name=FBS97/>\n\nOther prehistoric animals, including [[pterosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]], and ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/09/30/dinosaurs/ |url-status=live |title=Dinosaurs, Pterosaurs And Other Saurs \u2013 Big Differences |last=Chamary |first=JV |date=September 30, 2014 |website=[[Forbes#Forbes.com|Forbes.com]] |publisher=Forbes Media, LLC |location=[[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City, NJ]] |issn=0015-6914 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110172257/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/09/30/dinosaurs/ |archive-date=2014-11-10 |access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref> Pterosaurs are distantly related to dinosaurs, being members of the clade [[Avemetatarsalia|Ornithodira]].

In traditional [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], birds were considered a separate [[class (biology)|class]] that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct [[superorder]]. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |url-status=live |title=Using the tree for classification |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=[[University of California]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831003846/https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |archive-date=2019-08-31 |access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup [[Maniraptora]], which are [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.<ref name=KP04/>\n\nResearch by Matthew G.

Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size.

Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants.

Some of these are also present in [[Silesauridae|silesaurids]], which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.<ref name=MJB04dino/>\n[[File:Skull diapsida 1.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of a typical [[diapsid]] skull<br />j: [[jugal bone]], po: [[postorbital bone]], p: [[parietal bone]], sq: [[squamosal bone]], q: [[quadrate bone]], qj: [[quadratojugal bone]]]]\nA variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as [[diapsid]]s, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of [[Infratemporal fenestra]]e (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group [[Archosaur]]ia, had additional openings in the [[antorbital fenestra|snout]] and lower jaw.<ref name=TRHJ00/> Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups.

In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass [[Pangaea]], and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of [[coelophysoidea|coelophysoid]] carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores.<ref name=HCL04/> [[Gymnosperm]] plants (particularly [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s), a potential food source, [[Evolutionary radiation|radiated]] in the Late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract.<ref name=FS04/> The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of [[ceratosauria]]ns, [[Megalosauroidea|spinosauroids]], and [[carnosauria]]ns, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian [[ornithischia]]ns and large sauropods. Examples of this include the [[Morrison Formation]] of [[North America]] and [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru Beds]] of [[Tanzania]]. Dinosaurs in [[China]] show some differences, with specialized [[Metriacanthosauridae|sinraptorid]] theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.<ref name=HCL04/> Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but [[Plateosauridae|prosauropods]] had become extinct. Conifers and [[pteridophyte]]s were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential [[cheek]]-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food.<ref name=FS04/> Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from [[maniraptora]]n [[coelurosauria]]ns.<ref name=KP04/>\n[[File:Marasuchus.JPG|thumb|Skeleton of ''[[Marasuchus|Marasuchus lilloensis]]'', a dinosaur-like [[Avemetatarsalia|ornithodiran]]]]\nBy the [[Early Cretaceous]] and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, [[iguanodontia]]ns, and [[brachiosauridae|brachiosaurids]] through [[Europe]], North America, and northern [[Africa]]. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and [[carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] theropods, and [[rebbachisauridae|rebbachisaurid]] and [[titanosauria]]n sauropods, also found in [[South America]]. In [[Asia]], maniraptoran coelurosaurians like [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], [[troodontidae|troodontids]], and [[oviraptorosauria]]ns became the common theropods, and [[ankylosauridae|ankylosaurids]] and early ceratopsians like ''Psittacosaurus'' became important herbivores. Meanwhile, [[Australia]] was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, [[hypsilophodont]]s, and iguanodontians.<ref name=HCL04/> The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early [[Late Cretaceous]]. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of [[angiosperm|flowering plants]]. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with [[Dinosaur tooth#Dental batteries|dental batteries]], taken to its extreme in [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurids]].<ref name=FS04/> Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid ''[[Nigersaurus]]''.<ref name=serenoetal07/>\n[[File:Herrerasaurusskeleton.jpg|thumb|alt=Full skeleton of an early carnivorous dinosaur, displayed in a glass case in a museum|The early forms ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'' (large), ''[[Eoraptor]]'' (small) and a ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' skull]]\nThere were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]] and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and [[pachycephalosauria]]ns. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting [[Gondwana]], [[abelisauridae|abelisaurids]] were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores.

There is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in [[crocodile]]s (birds' closest living relatives), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[computer simulation]]s of their [[biomechanics]], and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.<ref name=alexander2006/>\n\nThe first potential evidence for [[herd]]ing or [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31&nbsp;''[[Iguanodon|Iguanodon bernissartensis]]'', ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]], after they fell into a deep, flooded [[sinkhole]] and drowned.<ref name=Yans/> Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-billed (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the [[American bison]] or the African [[Springbok]]. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in [[Oxfordshire]], England,<ref name=Day2002/> although there is no evidence for specific herd structures.<ref name=JLW05/> Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for [[Bird migration|migratory]] purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in [[Inner Mongolia]] that has yielded the remains of over 20 ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'', from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.<ref name=DVetal08sino/> The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as [[pack hunter]]s working together to bring down large prey.<ref name=LG93/><ref name=\"maxwell&ostrom1995\"/> However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.<ref name=RB07/>\n\n[[File:Centrosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of two ''[[Centrosaurus|Centrosaurus apertus]]'' engaged in intra-specific combat]]\nThe crests and [[Neck frill|frills]] of some dinosaurs, like the [[marginocephalia]]ns, theropods and [[Lambeosaurinae|lambeosaurine]]s, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and [[territory (animal)|territorialism]]. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.<ref name=PC98/>\n\nFrom a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in 1971. It included a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' attacking a ''[[Protoceratops]]'',<ref name=AMNH/> providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other.<ref name=carpenter1998/> Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.<ref name=carpenter1998/> [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in [[Madagascar]] in 2003, involving the theropod ''[[Majungasaurus]]''.<ref name=rogersetal2003/>\n\nComparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral rings]] of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], ''[[Juravenator]]'', and ''[[Megapnosaurus]]'' were likely [[nocturnal]]. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and [[omnivore|omnivorous]] dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] may have been [[cathemeral]], active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian ''[[Agilisaurus]]'' was inferred to be [[Diurnality|diurnal]].<ref name=SchmitzMotani2011/>\n\nBased on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as ''[[Oryctodromeus]]'', some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially [[fossorial]] (burrowing) lifestyle.<ref name=VMK07/> Many modern birds are [[arboreal]] (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the [[enantiornithine]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Chiappe|Witmer|2002}}</ref> While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] such as ''Microraptor''<ref name=chatterjee2007/>) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of [[biomechanics]], pioneered by [[Robert McNeill Alexander]], has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run,<ref name=alexander2006/> whether [[diplodocid]]s could create [[sonic boom]]s via [[whip]]-like tail snapping,<ref name=goriely/> and whether sauropods could float.<ref name=Henderson2006/>\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Lambeosaurus magnicristatus DB.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a striking and unusual visual display in a ''[[Lambeosaurus|Lambeosaurus magnicristatus]]'']]\nModern birds are known to [[Animal communication|communicate]] using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology.<ref name=senter2008/> Reconstruction of the plumage color of ''[[Anchiornis huxleyi]]'', suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Li2010\"/> The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the [[larynx]] and the latter through the unique [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]], suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\nThe earliest remains of a syrinx, which has enough mineral content for fossilization, was found in a specimen of the duck-like ''[[Vegavis|Vegavis iaai]]'' dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently.<ref name=\"Clarke2016\"/> A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size.<ref name=\"Tobias2016\"/> The crests of the [[Lambeosaurini]] and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in [[vocal resonance]],<ref name=\"Weishampel981\"/><ref name=\"Witmer\"/> though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\n===Reproductive biology===\n{{see also|Dinosaur egg}}\n[[File:Gniazdo sieweczki RB.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three bluish eggs with black speckling sit atop a layer of white mollusk shell pieces, surrounded by sandy ground and small bits of bluish stone|Nest of a [[plover]] (''[[Charadrius]]'')]]\n\nAll dinosaurs laid [[Amniote|amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Currie|Padian|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/EncyclopediaOfDinosaurs/page/n235 206]|loc=\"Eggs, Eggshells, and Nests\" by Konstantin E.

Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional [[oviduct]] and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as ''[[Troodon]]'', exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying [[Broodiness#Broodiness in non-avian animals|brooding]] until all eggs were laid.<ref name=\"Varrichioetal.02\">{{cite journal |last1=Varricchio |first1=David J. |last2=Horner |first2=John R. |last3=Jackson |first3=Frankie D. |date=September 19, 2002 |title=Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |location=Milton Park, Oxfordshire |publisher=Taylor & Francis for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=564\u2013576 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0272-4634}}</ref>\n\nWhen laying eggs, females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of their limbs.

A discovery of features in a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur ''Allosaurus'' and the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.<ref name=LW08/>\n\n[[File:Citipati IGM 100 979.jpg|thumb|Fossil interpreted as a nesting [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati]]'' at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

It is considered a [[transitional fossil]], in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after [[Charles Darwin]]'s seminal ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[creationism]]. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for ''[[Compsognathus]]''.<ref name=PW88/> Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the [[Lagerst\u00e4tten|lagerst\u00e4tte]] of the Yixian Formation, [[Liaoning]], northeastern China, which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.<ref name=\"Schweitzeretal1999\">{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Mary H. |last2=Watt |first2=J.A. |last3=Avci |first3=R. |last4=Knapp |first4=L. |last5=Chiappe |first5=L. |last6=Norell |first6=M. |last7=Marshall |first7=M. |display-authors=3 |date=August 15, 1999 |title=Beta-keratin specific immunological reactivity in feather-like structures of the Cretaceous Alvarezsaurid, ''Shuvuuia deserti'' |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Zoology|Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=285 |issue=2 |pages=146\u2013157 |pmid=10440726 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(19990815)285:2<146::AID-JEZ7>3.0.CO;2-A |issn=1552-5007}}</ref>\n\nThe description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin,<ref name=TLS03/><ref name=FLH05/><ref name=LSFX07/> and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with dinosaurs.<ref name=AF02/><ref name=FLH05/> However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.<ref name=Prum2003/>\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that a dinosaur tail with feathers had been found enclosed in [[amber]].

Though the consensus is that an [[impact event]] was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.<ref name=ktextinction>{{cite journal |last1=Keller |first1=Gerta |author1-link=Gerta Keller |last2=Adatte |first2=Thierry |last3=Gardin |first3=Silvia |last4=Bartolini |first4=A. |last5=Bajpai |first5=S. |display-authors=3 |date=April 30, 2008 |title=Main Deccan volcanism phase ends near the K\u2013T boundary: Evidence from the Krishna\u2013Godavari Basin, SE India |journal=[[Earth and Planetary Science Letters]] |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |volume=268 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=293\u2013311 |bibcode=2008E&PSL.268..293K |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2008.01.015 |issn=0012-821X}}</ref><ref name=multimpacts>{{cite magazine |last=Mullen |first=Leslie |date=October 20, 2004 |title=Multiple Impacts? |url=https://www.astrobio.net/meteoritescomets-and-asteroids/multiple-impacts/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[Astrobiology Magazine]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[NASA]] |issn=2152-1239 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705201308/https://www.astrobio.net/meteoritescomets-and-asteroids/multiple-impacts/ |archive-date=2017-07-05 |access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref><ref name=MacLeod/>\n\n===Impact event===\n{{Main|Chicxulub crater}}\n[[File:Chicxulub radar topography.jpg|thumb|The [[Chicxulub Crater]] at the tip of the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]; the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur [[extinction]].]]\nThe [[Alvarez hypothesis|asteroid impact hypothesis]], which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by [[Walter Alvarez]] and colleagues, links the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous to a [[bolide]] impact approximately 66&nbsp;million years ago.<ref>{{harvnb|Randall|2015}}</ref> Alvarez ''et al.'' proposed that a sudden increase in [[iridium]] levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact.<ref name=Alvarezetal80/> The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a bolide {{convert|5|to|15|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide hit in the vicinity of the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] (in southeastern [[Mexico]]), creating the approximately {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Chicxulub crater]] and triggering the mass extinction.<ref name=ARHetal91/><ref name=KPetal96/> Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event. Some scientists propose that the meteorite impact caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave. The consensus among scientists who support this [[hypothesis]] is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun). Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid, being down to hours rather than years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robertson |first1=Douglas S. |last2=McKenna |first2=Malcolm C. |author2-link=Malcolm McKenna |last3=Toon |first3=Owen B. |author3-link=Owen Toon |last4=Hope |first4=Sylvia |last5=Lillegraven |first5=Jason A. |display-authors=3 |date=May\u2013June 2004 |title=Survival in the first hours of the Cenozoic |url=http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=[[Geological Society of America Bulletin]] |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=Geological Society of America |volume=116 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=760\u2013768 |bibcode=2004GSAB..116..760R |doi=10.1130/B25402.1 |issn=0016-7606 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918141759/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-18 |access-date=2011-06-15}}</ref> In 2019, scientists drilling into the seafloor off Mexico extracted a unique geologic record of what they believe to be the day a city-sized asteroid smashed into the planet.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hotz |first=Robert Lee |date=September 15, 2019 |title=Details Discovered About the Day the Dinosaurs Died |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |url-status=live |department=News |work=[[MSN|MSN.com]] |location=[[Redmond, Washington|Redmond, WA]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918064400/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |archive-date=2019-09-18 |access-date=2019-11-08}}\n*{{cite news |last=Hotz |first=Robert Lee |author-mask=2 |date=September 9, 2019 |title=Scientists Discover New Evidence of the Asteroid That Killed Off the Dinosaurs |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-discover-new-evidence-of-the-asteroid-that-killed-off-the-dinosaurs-11568055601 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] |issn=0099-9660 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108144546/https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-discover-new-evidence-of-the-asteroid-that-killed-off-the-dinosaurs-11568055601 |archive-date=2019-11-08 |access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Deccan Traps===<!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] -->\n{{Main|Deccan Traps}}\n\nBefore 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&nbsp;million years ago and lasted for over 2&nbsp;million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1&nbsp;million years about 66&nbsp;million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.<ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nThe Deccan Traps in [[India]] could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release into the air of dust and sulfuric aerosols, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions, which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.<ref name=Duncan/> Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es during the formation of the Deccan Traps \"contributed to an apparently massive global warming. Some data point to an average rise in temperature of [{{convert|8|C-change|F-change}}] in the last half-million years before the impact [at Chicxulub].\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=What Really Killed the Dinosaurs? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dino_trans.shtml |access-date=2019-11-11 |series=[[Horizon (British TV series)|Horizon]] |last=Fortune |first=Jack (narrator) |network=[[BBC Television]] |date=October 7, 2004 |series-no=41 |number=4}}</ref><ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nIn the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by [[Signor\u2013Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.<ref name=Alvarez1997/>\n\n===Possible Paleocene survivors===\n{{Main|Paleocene dinosaurs}}\nNon-avian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]]. In 2000, paleontologist [[Spencer G. Lucas]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of a single [[hadrosauridae|hadrosaur]] right femur in the [[San Juan Basin]], [[New Mexico]], and described it as evidence of [[Paleocene dinosaurs]]. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early [[Paleocene]] epoch, approximately 64.5&nbsp;million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that [[stratum]] by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half-million years into the Cenozoic.<ref name=Fassett/> Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] up to {{convert|1.3|m|in|abbr=on}} above the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary, representing {{gaps|40|000}}&nbsp;years of elapsed time. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China.<ref name=Sloan/> Many scientists, however, dismissed the supposed Paleocene dinosaurs as re-worked, that is, washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments.<ref name=FS05/><ref name=Sullivan/> Direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date, with [[uranium\u2013lead dating]] methods resulting in a precise age of 64.8 \u00b1 0.9&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=fassettetall2011/> If correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction.<ref name=FS05/>\n\n==History of study==\n{{Further|History of paleontology}}\nDinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese considered them to be [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] bones and documented them as such.

Part of a bone, now known to have been the femur of a ''Megalosaurus'',<ref name=WAS97/> was recovered from a limestone quarry at [[Cornwell, Oxfordshire|Cornwell]] near [[Chipping Norton]], Oxfordshire, in 1676. The fragment was sent to [[Robert Plot]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Oxford]] and first curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], who published a description in his ''The Natural History of Oxford-shire'' (1677).<ref>{{harvnb|Plot|1677}}</ref> He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal, and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species.

Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern [[iguana]]s. He published his findings in 1825.<ref name=GM25/><ref name=HDS97/>\n\nThe study of these \"great fossil lizards\" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term \"dinosaur\". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, ''Iguanodon'', ''Megalosaurus'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of [[Queen Victoria]], Owen established the [[Natural History Museum, London]], to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.<ref name=owen94>{{harvnb|Rupke|1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1858, [[William Parker Foulke]] discovered the first known American dinosaur, in [[marl]] pits in the small town of [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]]. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named ''[[Hadrosaurus|Hadrosaurus foulkii]]''. It was an extremely important find: ''Hadrosaurus'' was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found ([[Iguanodon#Gideon Mantell, Sir Richard Owen, and the discovery of dinosaurs|the first]] was in 1834, in [[Maidstone|Maidstone, England]]), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of interests in dinosaurs in the United States, known as dinosaur mania.<ref name=weishampel06>{{cite journal |last1=Prieto-Marquez |first1=Albert |last2=Weishampel |first2=David B. |last3=Horner |first3=John R. |date=March 2006 |title=The dinosaur ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'', from the Campanian of the East Coast of North America, with a reevaluation of the genus |url=https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |location=Warsaw |publisher=Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of Sciences |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201398 |issn=0567-7920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622113255/https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |archive-date=2019-06-22 |access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n{{Multiple image\n|width=130\n|image1=Edcope.jpg|caption1=[[Edward Drinker Cope]]\n|image2=OthnielCharlesMarsh.jpg|caption2=[[Othniel Charles Marsh]]}}\n[[File:Stego-marsh-1896-US geological survey.png|thumb|Marsh's 1896 illustration of the bones of ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', a dinosaur he described and named in 1877]]\nDinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the [[Bone Wars]]. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used [[dynamite]] to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling because the explosions from the dynamic would potentially destroy any and all dinosauric evidence). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History, while Marsh's is on display at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] at [[Yale University]].<ref name=Holmes/>\n\nAfter 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent, including Antarctica.

Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano|Natural History Museum of Milan]], Italy]]\nOne of the best examples of soft-tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in the [[Pietraroja Formation|Pietraroia Plattenkalk]] in southern [[Italy]]. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young coelurosaur, ''[[Scipionyx|Scipionyx samniticus]]''. The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur.<ref name=\"softtissue\" />\n\nIn the March 2005 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the paleontologist [[Mary Higby Schweitzer]] and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' leg bone from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[Montana]]. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/> When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone-marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as [[blood vessel]]s, [[Osteon|bone matrix]], and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/>\n\nIn 2009, a team including Schweitzer announced that, using even more careful methodology, they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a [[Hadrosauridae|duck-billed dinosaur]], ''[[Brachylophosaurus|Brachylophosaurus canadensis]]'', found in the [[Judith River Formation]] of [[Montana]]. This included even more detailed tissue, down to preserved bone cells that seem even to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells. Among other materials found in the bone was [[collagen]], as in the ''Tyrannosaurus'' bone. The type of collagen an animal has in its bones varies according to its [[DNA]] and, in both cases, this collagen was of the same type found in modern chickens and ostriches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |url-status=dead |title=Blood, tissue extracted from duck-billed dinosaur bone |last=Evershed |first=Nick |date=May 1, 2009 |website=[[Cosmos (Australian magazine)|Cosmos Online]] |publisher=Cosmos Media Pty Ltd |location=[[Adelaide]] |issn=1832-522X |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215044640/http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |archive-date=2016-02-15 |access-date=2013-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions;<ref name=bone>{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Mary H. |last2=Wenxia |first2=Zheng |last3=Cleland |first3=Timothy P. |last4=Bern |first4=Marshall |display-authors=3 |date=January 2013 |title=Molecular analyses of dinosaur osteocytes support the presence of endogenous molecules |journal=[[Bone (journal)|Bone]] |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=414\u2013423 |doi=10.1016/j.bone.2012.10.010 |issn=8756-3282 |pmid=23085295}}</ref> upon further inspection and [[peer review]], however, neither of these reports could be confirmed.<ref name=Wangetal1997/> However, a functional [[peptide]] involved in the vision of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds.<ref name=changetal2002/> In addition, several [[protein]]s, including [[hemoglobin]],<ref name=Schweitzeretal1997/> have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils.<ref name=Emberyatal2003/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Joseph E. |last2=Lenczewski |first2=Melissa E. |last3=Scherer |first3=Reed P. |date=October 12, 2010 |editor-last=Stepanova |editor-first=Anna |title=Influence of Microbial Biofilms on the Preservation of Primary Soft Tissue in Fossil and Extant Archosaurs |journal=PLOS ONE |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=PLOS |volume=5 |issue=10 |page=e13334 |bibcode=2010PLoSO...513334P |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013334 |doi-access=free |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=2953520 |pmid=20967227}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, researchers reported finding structures similar to blood cells and collagen fibers, preserved in the bone fossils of six Cretaceous dinosaur specimens, which are approximately 75&nbsp;million years old.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bertazzo |first1=Sergio |last2=Maidment |first2=Susannah C.R. |author2-link=Susannah Maidment |last3=Kallepitis |first3=Charalambos |last4=Fearn |first4=Sarah |last5=Stevens |first5=Molly M. |last6=Xie |first6=Hai-nan |display-authors=3 |date=June 9, 2015 |title=Fibres and cellular structures preserved in 75-million-year-old dinosaur specimens |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |location=London |publisher=Nature Research |volume=6 |page=7352 |bibcode=2015NatCo...6.7352B |doi=10.1038/ncomms8352 |issn=2041-1723 |pmc=4468865 |pmid=26056764}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Mortillaro |first=Nicole |date=June 9, 2015 |title=Scientists discover 75-million-year-old dinosaur blood and tissue |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/2044421/scientists-discover-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-blood-and-tissue/ |url-status=live |work=[[Global News]] |location=[[Toronto]] |publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611144652/https://globalnews.ca/news/2044421/scientists-discover-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-blood-and-tissue/ |archive-date=2019-06-11 |access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n{{Main|Cultural depictions of dinosaurs}}\n[[File:Iguanodon Crystal Palace.jpg|thumb|Outdated ''Iguanodon'' statues created by [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] for the Crystal Palace Park in 1853]]\n[[File:Triceratops-vs-T-Rex001.jpg|thumb|The battles that may have occurred between ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'' are a recurring theme in [[popular science]] and dinosaurs' depiction in culture]]\nBy human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word \"dinosaur\" into the common [[vernacular]] reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, \"dinosaur\" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.<ref name=\"m-w\"/>\n\nPublic enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, a menagerie of lifelike [[Crystal Palace dinosaurs|dinosaur sculptures]] was unveiled in [[London]]'s [[Crystal Palace Park]]. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and [[Natural history museum|museums]] around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.<ref name=torrens1993/> Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the Bone Wars of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.<ref name=breithaupt1997/>\n\nThe popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in [[literature]], [[film]], and other [[Media (communication)|media]]. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in [[Charles Dickens]]{{'}} ''[[Bleak House]]'',<ref name=bleakhouse/> dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of [[fiction]]al works. [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 book ''[[The Lost World (Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', the iconic 1933 [[motion picture|film]] ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the 1954 ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] and its 1993 [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]] are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest [[non-fiction]] works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in [[advertising]]; numerous [[Company (law)|companies]] have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted, or obsolete.<ref name=DFGlut1997/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Animal track]]\n* [[Dinosaur diet and feeding]]\n* [[Evolutionary history of life]]\n* [[Lists of dinosaur-bearing stratigraphic units]]\n* [[List of dinosaur genera]]\n* [[List of informally named dinosaurs]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=AF02>{{cite journal |last=Feduccia |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Feduccia |date=October 1, 2002 |title=Birds are Dinosaurs: Simple Answer to a Complex Problem |url=https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/119/4/1187/5562157 |journal=[[The Auk]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[American Ornithological Society|American Ornithologists' Union]] |volume=119 |issue=4 |pages=1187\u20131201 |issn=0004-8038 |jstor=4090252 |access-date=2019-11-03|doi=10.1642/0004-8038(2002)119[1187:BADSAT]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref>\n<ref name=AF04>{{harvnb|Weishampel|Dodson|Osm\u00f3lska|2004|pp=672\u2013684|loc=chpt. 30: \"Dinosaur Extinction\" by J.

They first appeared during the [[Triassic]] [[Geological period|period]], between 243 and 233.23&nbsp;[[annum|million years ago]], although the exact origin and timing of the [[evolution of dinosaurs]] is the subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s after the [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event]] 201.3&nbsp;million years ago; their dominance continued through the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. The [[fossil]] record demonstrates that [[bird]]s are modern [[feathered dinosaur]]s, having [[Evolution of birds|evolved]] from earlier [[Theropoda|theropods]] during the [[Late Jurassic]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]]. As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] approximately 66&nbsp;million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into '''avian dinosaurs''', or birds; and '''non-avian dinosaurs''', which are all dinosaurs other than birds.\n\nDinosaurs are a varied group of animals from [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]], [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[ecology|ecological]] standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living [[species]], are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides [[perciformes|perciform]] fish. Using fossil evidence, [[paleontology|paleontologists]] have identified over 500 distinct [[genus|genera]] and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both [[Neontology#Extant taxa vs. extinct taxa|extant]] species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]. Most [[Dinosaur renaissance|research conducted since the 1970s]], however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated [[metabolism]]s and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were [[Herbivore|herbivorous]], others [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were [[Oviparity|egg-laying]]; and that [[nest]]-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.\n\nWhile dinosaurs were ancestrally [[bipedalism|bipedal]], many [[extinction|extinct]] groups included [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed [[skeleton|skeletal]] modifications such as [[Armour (anatomy)|bony armor]] and [[spine (zoology)|spines]]. While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied\u2014the largest [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of {{convert|39.7|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and heights of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and were the largest land animals of all time. Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy [[bone]]s are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small: ''[[Xixianykus]]'', for example, was only about {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nSince the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[taxon]] 'Dinosauria' was formally named in 1842 by [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Richard Owen|Sir Richard Owen]], who used it to refer to the \"distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles\" that were then being recognized in [[England]] and around the world.<ref name=Owen1841/><ref>{{cite Merriam-Webster|Dinosauria|accessdate=2019-11-10}}</ref> The term is derived {{ety|grc|''[[wikt:\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2|\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2]]'' (deinos)|terrible, potent or fearfully great||''[[wikt:\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2]]'' (sauros)|lizard or reptile}}.<ref name=Owen1841/><ref name=LSJ/> Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty.<ref name=FBS97/>\n\nOther prehistoric animals, including [[pterosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]], and ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', while often popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, are not taxonomically classified as dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/09/30/dinosaurs/ |url-status=live |title=Dinosaurs, Pterosaurs And Other Saurs \u2013 Big Differences |last=Chamary |first=JV |date=September 30, 2014 |website=[[Forbes#Forbes.com|Forbes.com]] |publisher=Forbes Media, LLC |location=[[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City, NJ]] |issn=0015-6914 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110172257/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jvchamary/2014/09/30/dinosaurs/ |archive-date=2014-11-10 |access-date=2018-10-02}}</ref> Pterosaurs are distantly related to dinosaurs, being members of the clade [[Avemetatarsalia|Ornithodira]]. The other groups mentioned are, like dinosaurs and pterosaurs, members of [[Sauropsida]] (the reptile and bird clade), except ''Dimetrodon'' (which is a [[synapsid]]).\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:LA-Triceratops mount-2.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Triceratops]]'' skeleton, [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]]]]\nUnder [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of the [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) of ''[[Triceratops]]'' and [[Bird#Diversification of modern birds|modern birds]] (Neornithes), and all its descendants.<ref name=MJB04dino/> It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the MRCA of ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' and ''[[Iguanodon]]'', because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria.<ref name=olshevsky2000/> Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs: \"Dinosauria = [[Ornithischia]] + [[Saurischia]]\", encompassing [[ankylosauria]]ns (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), [[stegosauria]]ns (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), [[ceratopsia]]ns (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]]s (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including \"[[Hadrosauridae|duck-bills]]\"), theropods (mostly bipedal carnivores and birds), and [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]] (mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails).<ref name=\"Letal05\"/>\n\nBirds are now recognized as being the sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], birds were considered a separate [[class (biology)|class]] that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct [[superorder]]. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |url-status=live |title=Using the tree for classification |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=[[University of California]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831003846/https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |archive-date=2019-08-31 |access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup [[Maniraptora]], which are [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.<ref name=KP04/>\n\nResearch by Matthew G. Baron, [[David B. Norman]], and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis by Baron ''et al.'' recovered the Ornithischia as being closer to the [[Theropoda]] than the [[Sauropodomorpha]], as opposed to the traditional union of theropods with sauropodomorphs. They resurrected the clade [[Ornithoscelida]] to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the last common ancestor of ''[[Triceratops|Triceratops horridus]]'', ''[[house sparrow|Passer domesticus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus|Diplodocus carnegii]]'', and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.<ref name=\"NYT-20170322\">{{cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |author-link=Nicholas Wade |title=Shaking Up the Dinosaur Family Tree |date=March 22, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/science/dinosaur-family-tree.html |url-status=live |url-access=registration |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |issn=0362-4331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407234942/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/science/dinosaur-family-tree.html |archive-date=2018-04-07 |access-date=2019-10-30}} \"A version of this article appears in print on March 28, 2017, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Shaking Up the Dinosaur Family Tree.\"</ref><ref name=\"NAT-20170322\">{{cite journal |last1=Baron |first1=Matthew G. |last2=Norman |first2=David B. |author-link2=David B.

While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as ''[[Anchisaurus]]'' and ''Iguanodon'', could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the [[Early Jurassic]] epoch.<ref name=MacLeod/> Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as ''[[Microraptor]]'') could fly or at least glide, and others, such as [[spinosauridae|spinosaurids]], had [[list of semiaquatic tetrapods|semiaquatic]] habits.<ref name=theropods/>\n\n===Distinguishing anatomical features===\nWhile recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral [[archosaur]]ian skeleton, or are clear descendants of older dinosaurs showing these modifications. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants. Such modifications, originating in the most recent common ancestor of a certain taxonomic group, are called the [[Synapomorphy and apomorphy|synapomorphies]] of such a group.<ref name=\"B012\"/>\n\nA detailed assessment of archosaur interrelations by [[Sterling Nesbitt]]<ref name=nesbitt2011/> confirmed or found the following twelve unambiguous synapomorphies, some previously known:\n* in the [[skull]], a supratemporal fossa (excavation) is present in front of the [[Skull#Structure|supratemporal fenestra]], the main opening in the rear skull roof\n* [[epipophyses]], obliquely backward-pointing processes on the rear top corners, present in the anterior (front) neck [[vertebra]]e behind the [[Atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] and [[Axis (anatomy)|axis]], the first two neck vertebrae\n* apex of deltopectoral crest (a projection on which the [[clavipectoral triangle|deltopectoral]] muscles attach) located at or more than 30% down the length of the [[humerus]] (upper arm bone)\n* [[Radius (bone)|radius]], a lower arm bone, shorter than 80% of humerus length\n* [[fourth trochanter]] (projection where the [[caudofemoralis]] muscle attaches on the inner rear shaft) on the [[femur]] (thigh bone) is a sharp flange\n* fourth trochanter asymmetrical, with distal, lower, margin forming a steeper angle to the shaft\n* on the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] and [[Calcaneus|calcaneum]], upper ankle bones, the proximal articular facet, the top connecting surface, for the [[fibula]] occupies less than 30% of the transverse width of the element\n* exoccipitals (bones at the back of the skull) do not meet along the midline on the floor of the endocranial cavity, the inner space of the braincase\n* in the pelvis, the proximal articular surfaces of the [[ischium]] with the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] and the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]] are separated by a large concave surface (on the upper side of the ischium a part of the open hip joint is located between the contacts with the pubic bone and the ilium)\n* [[cnemial crest]] on the [[tibia]] (protruding part of the top surface of the shinbone) arcs anterolaterally (curves to the front and the outer side)\n* distinct proximodistally oriented (vertical) ridge present on the posterior face of the distal end of the tibia (the rear surface of the lower end of the shinbone)\n* concave articular surface for the fibula of the calcaneum (the top surface of the calcaneum, where it touches the fibula, has a hollow profile)\n\nNesbitt found a number of further potential synapomorphies and discounted a number of synapomorphies previously suggested. Some of these are also present in [[Silesauridae|silesaurids]], which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.<ref name=MJB04dino/>\n[[File:Skull diapsida 1.svg|thumb|left|Diagram of a typical [[diapsid]] skull<br />j: [[jugal bone]], po: [[postorbital bone]], p: [[parietal bone]], sq: [[squamosal bone]], q: [[quadrate bone]], qj: [[quadratojugal bone]]]]\nA variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they are either common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as [[diapsid]]s, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of [[Infratemporal fenestra]]e (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group [[Archosaur]]ia, had additional openings in the [[antorbital fenestra|snout]] and lower jaw.<ref name=TRHJ00/> Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated [[scapula]], or shoulder blade; a [[sacrum]] composed of three or more fused vertebrae (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'');<ref name=MJB04dino/> and a [[Acetabulum#Perforate Acetabulum|perforate acetabulum]], or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in ''[[Saturnalia tupiniquim]]'', for example).<ref name=\"UC Berkeley Journal of Earth Sciences\">{{cite web |url=https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/dinomm.html |last1=Smith |first1=Dave |display-authors=et al. |title=Dinosauria: Morphology |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |location=Berkeley |access-date=2019-10-16}}</ref><ref name=LARB99/> Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the [[Late Triassic]] epoch are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.<ref name=NIP07/>\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|Hip joints and hindlimb postures of: (left to right) typical [[reptile]]s (sprawling), dinosaurs and [[mammal]]s (erect), and [[rauisuchia]]ns (pillar-erect)]]\nDinosaurs stand with their hind limbs erect in a manner similar to [[Evolution of mammals#Erect limbs|most modern mammals]], but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side.<ref name=Holland1909/> This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur.<ref name=MJB00/> Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that [[Carrier's constraint|surpassed those of \"sprawling\" reptiles]].<ref name=RC05/> Erect limbs probably also helped support the [[evolution]] of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs.<ref name=TKMB07/> Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including [[rauisuchia]]ns, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a \"pillar-erect\" configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the [[ilium (bone)|upper pelvic bone]] was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.<ref name=TKMB07/>\n\n==Evolutionary history==\n{{Main|Evolution of dinosaurs}}\n\n===Origins and early evolution===\nDinosaurs diverged from their archosaur ancestors during the Middle to Late Triassic epochs, roughly 20&nbsp;million years after the devastating [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event]] wiped out an estimated 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species approximately 252 million years ago.<ref name=KPA/><ref name=TannerLucas/> [[Radiometric dating]] of the [[List of rock formations|rock formation]] that contained fossils from the early dinosaur [[genus]] ''[[Eoraptor]]'' at 231.4&nbsp;million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time.<ref name=\"OARM2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Alcober |first1=Oscar A.|last2=Martinez |first2=Ricardo N. |date=October 19, 2010 |title=A new herrerasaurid (Dinosauria, Saurischia) from the Upper Triassic Ischigualasto Formation of northwestern Argentina |journal=[[ZooKeys]] |location=[[Sofia]] |publisher=[[Pensoft Publishers]] |issue=63 |pages=55\u201381 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.63.550 |pmc=3088398 |issn=1313-2989 |pmid=21594020}}</ref> Paleontologists think that ''Eoraptor'' resembles the [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of all dinosaurs;<ref name=Sereno1999/> if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal [[predation|predators]].<ref name=SFRM93/> The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as ''[[Marasuchus]]'' and ''[[Lagerpeton]]'' in [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[Middle Triassic]] strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.

In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass [[Pangaea]], and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of [[coelophysoidea|coelophysoid]] carnivores and early sauropodomorph herbivores.<ref name=HCL04/> [[Gymnosperm]] plants (particularly [[Pinophyta|conifer]]s), a potential food source, [[Evolutionary radiation|radiated]] in the Late Triassic. Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract.<ref name=FS04/> The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of [[ceratosauria]]ns, [[Megalosauroidea|spinosauroids]], and [[carnosauria]]ns, and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian [[ornithischia]]ns and large sauropods. Examples of this include the [[Morrison Formation]] of [[North America]] and [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru Beds]] of [[Tanzania]]. Dinosaurs in [[China]] show some differences, with specialized [[Metriacanthosauridae|sinraptorid]] theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.<ref name=HCL04/> Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but [[Plateosauridae|prosauropods]] had become extinct. Conifers and [[pteridophyte]]s were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential [[cheek]]-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food.<ref name=FS04/> Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from [[maniraptora]]n [[coelurosauria]]ns.<ref name=KP04/>\n[[File:Marasuchus.JPG|thumb|Skeleton of ''[[Marasuchus|Marasuchus lilloensis]]'', a dinosaur-like [[Avemetatarsalia|ornithodiran]]]]\nBy the [[Early Cretaceous]] and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, [[iguanodontia]]ns, and [[brachiosauridae|brachiosaurids]] through [[Europe]], North America, and northern [[Africa]]. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and [[carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] theropods, and [[rebbachisauridae|rebbachisaurid]] and [[titanosauria]]n sauropods, also found in [[South America]]. In [[Asia]], maniraptoran coelurosaurians like [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], [[troodontidae|troodontids]], and [[oviraptorosauria]]ns became the common theropods, and [[ankylosauridae|ankylosaurids]] and early ceratopsians like ''Psittacosaurus'' became important herbivores. Meanwhile, [[Australia]] was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, [[hypsilophodont]]s, and iguanodontians.<ref name=HCL04/> The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early [[Late Cretaceous]]. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of [[angiosperm|flowering plants]]. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with [[Dinosaur tooth#Dental batteries|dental batteries]], taken to its extreme in [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurids]].<ref name=FS04/> Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid ''[[Nigersaurus]]''.<ref name=serenoetal07/>\n[[File:Herrerasaurusskeleton.jpg|thumb|alt=Full skeleton of an early carnivorous dinosaur, displayed in a glass case in a museum|The early forms ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'' (large), ''[[Eoraptor]]'' (small) and a ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' skull]]\nThere were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]] and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and [[pachycephalosauria]]ns. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting [[Gondwana]], [[abelisauridae|abelisaurids]] were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores.

There is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in [[crocodile]]s (birds' closest living relatives), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[computer simulation]]s of their [[biomechanics]], and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.<ref name=alexander2006/>\n\nThe first potential evidence for [[herd]]ing or [[flocking (behavior)|flocking]] as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31&nbsp;''[[Iguanodon|Iguanodon bernissartensis]]'', ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]], after they fell into a deep, flooded [[sinkhole]] and drowned.<ref name=Yans/> Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-billed (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the [[American bison]] or the African [[Springbok]]. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in [[Oxfordshire]], England,<ref name=Day2002/> although there is no evidence for specific herd structures.<ref name=JLW05/> Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for [[Bird migration|migratory]] purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in [[Inner Mongolia]] that has yielded the remains of over 20 ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'', from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.<ref name=DVetal08sino/> The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as [[pack hunter]]s working together to bring down large prey.<ref name=LG93/><ref name=\"maxwell&ostrom1995\"/> However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.<ref name=RB07/>\n\n[[File:Centrosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of two ''[[Centrosaurus|Centrosaurus apertus]]'' engaged in intra-specific combat]]\nThe crests and [[Neck frill|frills]] of some dinosaurs, like the [[marginocephalia]]ns, theropods and [[Lambeosaurinae|lambeosaurine]]s, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and [[territory (animal)|territorialism]]. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.<ref name=PC98/>\n\nFrom a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in 1971. It included a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' attacking a ''[[Protoceratops]]'',<ref name=AMNH/> providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other.<ref name=carpenter1998/> Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.<ref name=carpenter1998/> [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in [[Madagascar]] in 2003, involving the theropod ''[[Majungasaurus]]''.<ref name=rogersetal2003/>\n\nComparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral rings]] of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], ''[[Juravenator]]'', and ''[[Megapnosaurus]]'' were likely [[nocturnal]]. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and [[omnivore|omnivorous]] dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] may have been [[cathemeral]], active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian ''[[Agilisaurus]]'' was inferred to be [[Diurnality|diurnal]].<ref name=SchmitzMotani2011/>\n\nBased on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as ''[[Oryctodromeus]]'', some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially [[fossorial]] (burrowing) lifestyle.<ref name=VMK07/> Many modern birds are [[arboreal]] (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the [[enantiornithine]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Chiappe|Witmer|2002}}</ref> While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] such as ''Microraptor''<ref name=chatterjee2007/>) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of [[biomechanics]], pioneered by [[Robert McNeill Alexander]], has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run,<ref name=alexander2006/> whether [[diplodocid]]s could create [[sonic boom]]s via [[whip]]-like tail snapping,<ref name=goriely/> and whether sauropods could float.<ref name=Henderson2006/>\n\n===Communication===\n[[File:Lambeosaurus magnicristatus DB.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a striking and unusual visual display in a ''[[Lambeosaurus|Lambeosaurus magnicristatus]]'']]\nModern birds are known to [[Animal communication|communicate]] using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology.<ref name=senter2008/> Reconstruction of the plumage color of ''[[Anchiornis huxleyi]]'', suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Li2010\"/> The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the [[larynx]] and the latter through the unique [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]], suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\nThe earliest remains of a syrinx, which has enough mineral content for fossilization, was found in a specimen of the duck-like ''[[Vegavis|Vegavis iaai]]'' dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently.<ref name=\"Clarke2016\"/> A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size.<ref name=\"Tobias2016\"/> The crests of the [[Lambeosaurini]] and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in [[vocal resonance]],<ref name=\"Weishampel981\"/><ref name=\"Witmer\"/> though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.<ref name=senter2008/>\n\n===Reproductive biology===\n{{see also|Dinosaur egg}}\n[[File:Gniazdo sieweczki RB.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three bluish eggs with black speckling sit atop a layer of white mollusk shell pieces, surrounded by sandy ground and small bits of bluish stone|Nest of a [[plover]] (''[[Charadrius]]'')]]\n\nAll dinosaurs laid [[Amniote|amniotic egg]]s with hard shells made mostly of [[calcium carbonate]].<ref>{{harvnb|Currie|Padian|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/EncyclopediaOfDinosaurs/page/n235 206]|loc=\"Eggs, Eggshells, and Nests\" by Konstantin E.

Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional [[oviduct]] and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as ''[[Troodon]]'', exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying [[Broodiness#Broodiness in non-avian animals|brooding]] until all eggs were laid.<ref name=\"Varrichioetal.02\">{{cite journal |last1=Varricchio |first1=David J. |last2=Horner |first2=John R. |last3=Jackson |first3=Frankie D. |date=September 19, 2002 |title=Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |location=Milton Park, Oxfordshire |publisher=Taylor & Francis for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=564\u2013576 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0272-4634}}</ref>\n\nWhen laying eggs, females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of their limbs.

Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur ''Allosaurus'' and the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.<ref name=LW08/>\n\n[[File:Citipati IGM 100 979.jpg|thumb|Fossil interpreted as a nesting [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati]]'' at the [[American Museum of Natural History]].

It is considered a [[transitional fossil]], in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after [[Charles Darwin]]'s seminal ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[creationism]]. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for ''[[Compsognathus]]''.<ref name=PW88/> Since the 1990s, a number of additional feathered dinosaurs have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the [[Lagerst\u00e4tten|lagerst\u00e4tte]] of the Yixian Formation, [[Liaoning]], northeastern China, which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record.<ref name=\"Schweitzeretal1999\">{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Mary H. |last2=Watt |first2=J.A. |last3=Avci |first3=R. |last4=Knapp |first4=L. |last5=Chiappe |first5=L. |last6=Norell |first6=M. |last7=Marshall |first7=M. |display-authors=3 |date=August 15, 1999 |title=Beta-keratin specific immunological reactivity in feather-like structures of the Cretaceous Alvarezsaurid, ''Shuvuuia deserti'' |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Zoology|Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=285 |issue=2 |pages=146\u2013157 |pmid=10440726 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(19990815)285:2<146::AID-JEZ7>3.0.CO;2-A |issn=1552-5007}}</ref>\n\nThe description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin,<ref name=TLS03/><ref name=FLH05/><ref name=LSFX07/> and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with dinosaurs.<ref name=AF02/><ref name=FLH05/> However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.<ref name=Prum2003/>\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that a dinosaur tail with feathers had been found enclosed in [[amber]].

Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid, being down to hours rather than years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Robertson |first1=Douglas S. |last2=McKenna |first2=Malcolm C. |author2-link=Malcolm McKenna |last3=Toon |first3=Owen B. |author3-link=Owen Toon |last4=Hope |first4=Sylvia |last5=Lillegraven |first5=Jason A. |display-authors=3 |date=May\u2013June 2004 |title=Survival in the first hours of the Cenozoic |url=http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=[[Geological Society of America Bulletin]] |location=Boulder, CO |publisher=Geological Society of America |volume=116 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=760\u2013768 |bibcode=2004GSAB..116..760R |doi=10.1130/B25402.1 |issn=0016-7606 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918141759/http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-18 |access-date=2011-06-15}}</ref> In 2019, scientists drilling into the seafloor off Mexico extracted a unique geologic record of what they believe to be the day a city-sized asteroid smashed into the planet.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hotz |first=Robert Lee |date=September 15, 2019 |title=Details Discovered About the Day the Dinosaurs Died |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |url-status=live |department=News |work=[[MSN|MSN.com]] |location=[[Redmond, Washington|Redmond, WA]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190918064400/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/details-discovered-about-the-day-the-dinosaurs-died/ar-AAH31aq |archive-date=2019-09-18 |access-date=2019-11-08}}\n*{{cite news |last=Hotz |first=Robert Lee |author-mask=2 |date=September 9, 2019 |title=Scientists Discover New Evidence of the Asteroid That Killed Off the Dinosaurs |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-discover-new-evidence-of-the-asteroid-that-killed-off-the-dinosaurs-11568055601 |url-status=live |url-access=subscription |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] |issn=0099-9660 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108144546/https://www.wsj.com/articles/scientists-discover-new-evidence-of-the-asteroid-that-killed-off-the-dinosaurs-11568055601 |archive-date=2019-11-08 |access-date=2019-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Deccan Traps===<!-- This section is linked from [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] -->\n{{Main|Deccan Traps}}\n\nBefore 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the extinction were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&nbsp;million years ago and lasted for over 2&nbsp;million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1&nbsp;million years about 66&nbsp;million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.<ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nThe Deccan Traps in [[India]] could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release into the air of dust and sulfuric aerosols, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions, which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.<ref name=Duncan/> Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es during the formation of the Deccan Traps \"contributed to an apparently massive global warming. Some data point to an average rise in temperature of [{{convert|8|C-change|F-change}}] in the last half-million years before the impact [at Chicxulub].\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=What Really Killed the Dinosaurs? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dino_trans.shtml |access-date=2019-11-11 |series=[[Horizon (British TV series)|Horizon]] |last=Fortune |first=Jack (narrator) |network=[[BBC Television]] |date=October 7, 2004 |series-no=41 |number=4}}</ref><ref name=wwnjsd/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\nIn the years when the Deccan Traps hypothesis was linked to a slower extinction, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by [[Signor\u2013Lipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.<ref name=Alvarez1997/>\n\n===Possible Paleocene survivors===\n{{Main|Paleocene dinosaurs}}\nNon-avian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary]]. In 2000, paleontologist [[Spencer G. Lucas]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of a single [[hadrosauridae|hadrosaur]] right femur in the [[San Juan Basin]], [[New Mexico]], and described it as evidence of [[Paleocene dinosaurs]]. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early [[Paleocene]] epoch, approximately 64.5&nbsp;million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that [[stratum]] by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half-million years into the Cenozoic.<ref name=Fassett/> Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] up to {{convert|1.3|m|in|abbr=on}} above the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary, representing {{gaps|40|000}}&nbsp;years of elapsed time. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China.<ref name=Sloan/> Many scientists, however, dismissed the supposed Paleocene dinosaurs as re-worked, that is, washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments.<ref name=FS05/><ref name=Sullivan/> Direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date, with [[uranium\u2013lead dating]] methods resulting in a precise age of 64.8 \u00b1 0.9&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=fassettetall2011/> If correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction.<ref name=FS05/>\n\n==History of study==\n{{Further|History of paleontology}}\nDinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese considered them to be [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] bones and documented them as such.

Part of a bone, now known to have been the femur of a ''Megalosaurus'',<ref name=WAS97/> was recovered from a limestone quarry at [[Cornwell, Oxfordshire|Cornwell]] near [[Chipping Norton]], Oxfordshire, in 1676. The fragment was sent to [[Robert Plot]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Oxford]] and first curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], who published a description in his ''The Natural History of Oxford-shire'' (1677).<ref>{{harvnb|Plot|1677}}</ref> He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the femur of a large animal, and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species.

Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between his fossils and the bones of modern [[iguana]]s. He published his findings in 1825.<ref name=GM25/><ref name=HDS97/>\n\nThe study of these \"great fossil lizards\" soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist Richard Owen coined the term \"dinosaur\". He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, ''Iguanodon'', ''Megalosaurus'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the husband of [[Queen Victoria]], Owen established the [[Natural History Museum, London]], to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.<ref name=owen94>{{harvnb|Rupke|1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1858, [[William Parker Foulke]] discovered the first known American dinosaur, in [[marl]] pits in the small town of [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]]. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named ''[[Hadrosaurus|Hadrosaurus foulkii]]''. It was an extremely important find: ''Hadrosaurus'' was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found ([[Iguanodon#Gideon Mantell, Sir Richard Owen, and the discovery of dinosaurs|the first]] was in 1834, in [[Maidstone|Maidstone, England]]), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of interests in dinosaurs in the United States, known as dinosaur mania.<ref name=weishampel06>{{cite journal |last1=Prieto-Marquez |first1=Albert |last2=Weishampel |first2=David B. |last3=Horner |first3=John R. |date=March 2006 |title=The dinosaur ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'', from the Campanian of the East Coast of North America, with a reevaluation of the genus |url=https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |location=Warsaw |publisher=Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of Sciences |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=77\u201398 |issn=0567-7920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622113255/https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |archive-date=2019-06-22 |access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n\n{{Multiple image\n|width=130\n|image1=Edcope.jpg|caption1=[[Edward Drinker Cope]]\n|image2=OthnielCharlesMarsh.jpg|caption2=[[Othniel Charles Marsh]]}}\n[[File:Stego-marsh-1896-US geological survey.png|thumb|Marsh's 1896 illustration of the bones of ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', a dinosaur he described and named in 1877]]\nDinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the [[Bone Wars]]. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used [[dynamite]] to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling because the explosions from the dynamic would potentially destroy any and all dinosauric evidence). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the American Museum of Natural History, while Marsh's is on display at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] at [[Yale University]].<ref name=Holmes/>\n\nAfter 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent, including Antarctica.

[[Vertebrate paleontology]] has become a global [[science]]. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including India, South America, Madagascar, Antarctica, and most significantly China (the well-preserved feathered dinosaurs<ref name=\"NYT-20161208\" /> in China have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of [[cladistics]], which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in classifying dinosaurs.

Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano|Natural History Museum of Milan]], Italy]]\nOne of the best examples of soft-tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in the [[Pietraroja Formation|Pietraroia Plattenkalk]] in southern [[Italy]]. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young coelurosaur, ''[[Scipionyx|Scipionyx samniticus]]''. The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur.<ref name=\"softtissue\" />\n\nIn the March 2005 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the paleontologist [[Mary Higby Schweitzer]] and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' leg bone from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[Montana]]. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/> When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone-marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as [[blood vessel]]s, [[Osteon|bone matrix]], and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear.<ref name=Schweitzer2005/>\n\nIn 2009, a team including Schweitzer announced that, using even more careful methodology, they had duplicated their results by finding similar soft tissue in a [[Hadrosauridae|duck-billed dinosaur]], ''[[Brachylophosaurus|Brachylophosaurus canadensis]]'', found in the [[Judith River Formation]] of [[Montana]]. This included even more detailed tissue, down to preserved bone cells that seem even to have visible remnants of nuclei and what seem to be red blood cells. Among other materials found in the bone was [[collagen]], as in the ''Tyrannosaurus'' bone. The type of collagen an animal has in its bones varies according to its [[DNA]] and, in both cases, this collagen was of the same type found in modern chickens and ostriches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |url-status=dead |title=Blood, tissue extracted from duck-billed dinosaur bone |last=Evershed |first=Nick |date=May 1, 2009 |website=[[Cosmos (Australian magazine)|Cosmos Online]] |publisher=Cosmos Media Pty Ltd |location=[[Adelaide]] |issn=1832-522X |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215044640/http://archive.cosmosmagazine.com/news/blood-and-gristle-found-cretaceous-era-duck-billed-dinosaur/ |archive-date=2016-02-15 |access-date=2013-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions;<ref name=bone>{{cite journal |last1=Schweitzer |first1=Mary H. |last2=Wenxia |first2=Zheng |last3=Cleland |first3=Timothy P. |last4=Bern |first4=Marshall |display-authors=3 |date=January 2013 |title=Molecular analyses of dinosaur osteocytes support the presence of endogenous molecules |journal=[[Bone (journal)|Bone]] |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=414\u2013423 |doi=10.1016/j.bone.2012.10.010 |issn=8756-3282 |pmid=23085295}}</ref> upon further inspection and [[peer review]], however, neither of these reports could be confirmed.<ref name=Wangetal1997/> However, a functional [[peptide]] involved in the vision of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds.<ref name=changetal2002/> In addition, several [[protein]]s, including [[hemoglobin]],<ref name=Schweitzeretal1997/> have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils.<ref name=Emberyatal2003/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Joseph E. |last2=Lenczewski |first2=Melissa E. |last3=Scherer |first3=Reed P. |date=October 12, 2010 |editor-last=Stepanova |editor-first=Anna |title=Influence of Microbial Biofilms on the Preservation of Primary Soft Tissue in Fossil and Extant Archosaurs |journal=PLOS ONE |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=PLOS |volume=5 |issue=10 |page=e13334 |bibcode=2010PLoSO...513334P |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013334 |doi-access=free |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=2953520 |pmid=20967227}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, researchers reported finding structures similar to blood cells and collagen fibers, preserved in the bone fossils of six Cretaceous dinosaur specimens, which are approximately 75&nbsp;million years old.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bertazzo |first1=Sergio |last2=Maidment |first2=Susannah C.R. |author2-link=Susannah Maidment |last3=Kallepitis |first3=Charalambos |last4=Fearn |first4=Sarah |last5=Stevens |first5=Molly M. |last6=Xie |first6=Hai-nan |display-authors=3 |date=June 9, 2015 |title=Fibres and cellular structures preserved in 75-million-year-old dinosaur specimens |journal=[[Nature Communications]] |location=London |publisher=Nature Research |volume=6 |page=7352 |bibcode=2015NatCo...6.7352B |doi=10.1038/ncomms8352 |issn=2041-1723 |pmc=4468865 |pmid=26056764}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Mortillaro |first=Nicole |date=June 9, 2015 |title=Scientists discover 75-million-year-old dinosaur blood and tissue |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/2044421/scientists-discover-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-blood-and-tissue/ |url-status=live |work=[[Global News]] |location=[[Toronto]] |publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611144652/https://globalnews.ca/news/2044421/scientists-discover-75-million-year-old-dinosaur-blood-and-tissue/ |archive-date=2019-06-11 |access-date=2019-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural depictions==\n{{Main|Cultural depictions of dinosaurs}}\n[[File:Iguanodon Crystal Palace.jpg|thumb|Outdated ''Iguanodon'' statues created by [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] for the Crystal Palace Park in 1853]]\n[[File:Triceratops-vs-T-Rex001.jpg|thumb|The battles that may have occurred between ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' and ''[[Triceratops]]'' are a recurring theme in [[popular science]] and dinosaurs' depiction in culture]]\nBy human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word \"dinosaur\" into the common [[vernacular]] reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, \"dinosaur\" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.<ref name=\"m-w\"/>\n\nPublic enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, a menagerie of lifelike [[Crystal Palace dinosaurs|dinosaur sculptures]] was unveiled in [[London]]'s [[Crystal Palace Park]]. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and [[Museum#Natural history museums|museums]] around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.<ref name=torrens1993/> Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the Bone Wars of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.<ref name=breithaupt1997/>\n\nThe popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in [[literature]], [[film]], and other [[Media (communication)|media]]. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in [[Charles Dickens]]{{'}} ''[[Bleak House]]'',<ref name=bleakhouse/> dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of [[fiction]]al works. [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 book ''[[The Lost World (Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', the iconic 1933 [[motion picture|film]] ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the 1954 ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] and its 1993 [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]] are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest [[non-fiction]] works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general.

In a chess game, each player begins with sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in \"check\") and there is no way to remove or defend it from attack, or force the opposing player to forfeit.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Nature of chess==\nChess can be described as all of the following:\n* Form of [[entertainment]] &ndash; form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.\n** Form of [[recreation]] &ndash; activity of leisure, leisure being discretionary time.<ref name=yukic>{{cite book |author=Thomas S. Yukic |title=Fundamentals of Recreation, 2nd edition |publisher=Harpers & Row, 1970, Library of Congress 70-88646 |page=1f}}</ref>\n*** Form of [[play (activity)|play]] &ndash; voluntary, intrinsically motivated activity normally associated with recreational pleasure and enjoyment.<ref>Garvey, C. (1990). ''Play''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref>\n**** [[Game]] &ndash; structured playing, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports/games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).\n***** [[Board game]] &ndash; game in which counters or pieces are placed, removed, or moved on a premarked surface or \"board\" according to a set of rules. Games may be based on pure strategy, chance or a mixture of the two and usually have a goal which a player aims to achieve.\n***** [[Strategy game]] &ndash; game (e.g. computer, video or board game) in which the players' uncoerced, and often autonomous decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome. Almost all strategy games require internal [[decision tree]] style thinking, and typically very high [[situation awareness]].\n***** [[Two-player game]] &ndash; game played by just two players, usually against each other.\n**** Sport &ndash; form of play, but sport is also a category of entertainment in its own right ''(see immediately below for description)''\n** [[Sport]] &ndash; organized, competitive, entertaining, and skillful activity requiring commitment, strategy, and fair play, in which a winner can be defined by objective means. It is governed by a set of rules or customs. Chess is recognized as a sport by the [[International Olympic Committee]].<ref name=\"IOC\">[http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/recognized/index_uk.asp Recognized Sports of the International Olympic Committee]\nInternational Olympic Committee official website. Retrieved 2 May 2008.</ref>\n*** [[Game of skill|Mind sport]] &ndash; game where the outcome is determined mainly by mental skill, rather than by pure chance.\n\n== Chess equipment ==\n\n=== Essential equipment ===\n* [[Chessboard]] &ndash; board with 64 squares (eight rows and eight columns) arranged in two alternating colors (light and dark). The colors are called \"black\" and \"white\", although the actual colors vary: usually they are dark green and buff for boards used in competition, and often natural shades of light and dark woods for home boards. Chess boards can be built into [[chess table]]s, or dispensed with (along with pieces) if playing [[mental chess]], [[computer chess]], [[Internet chess]] and sometimes [[correspondence chess]].\n** {{chessgloss|rank|Rank}} &ndash; horizontal row of squares on the chessboard.\n** {{chessgloss|file|File}} &ndash; vertical (i.e. in the direction from one player to the other) column of squares on the chessboard.\n[[File:ModernStaunton.jpg|right|thumb|A Staunton chess set]]\n* [[Chess set]] &ndash; all the pieces required to play a game of chess. Chess sets come in various materials and styles, and some are considered collectors' items and works of art. The most popular style for competitive play is the [[Staunton chess set]], named after [[Howard Staunton]]. The relative values given are approximate and depend on the game situation.\n** [[Chess piece]]s &ndash; two armies of 16 chess pieces, one army white, the other black. Each player controls one of the armies for the entire game. The pieces in each army include:\n*** 1 [[King (chess)|king]] &ndash; most important piece, and one of the weakest (until the endgame). The object of the game is checkmate, by placing the enemy king in check in a way that it cannot escape capture in the next move. On the top of the piece is a cross.\n*** 1 [[Queen (chess)|queen]] &ndash; most powerful piece in the game, with a relative value of 9 points. The top of the piece is crown-like. Official tournament chess sets have 2 queens of each color, to deal with pawns being promoted <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/in-a-real-tournment-can-you-play-2-queens|title=In a real tournment can you play 2 queens? \u2013 Chess Forums|author=|date=|website=chess.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n*** 2 [[Rook (chess)|rook]]s &ndash; look like castle towers and have a relative value of 5 points each.\n*** 2 [[Bishop (chess)|bishop]]s &ndash; stylized after [[mitre]]s (bishops' hats), and have a relative value of 3 points each.\n*** 2 [[Knight (chess)|knight]]s &ndash; usually look like horse heads and have a relative value of 3 points each.\n*** 8 [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]]s &ndash; smallest pieces in the game, each topped by a ball. Pawns have a relative value of 1 point each.\n\n=== Specialized equipment ===\n[[File:Digitalna sahovska ura2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Digital game clock]]\n* [[Game clock]] &ndash; dual timer used to monitor each player's thinking time. Only the timer of the player who is to move is active. Used for speed chess, and to regulate time in tournament games.\n* {{chessgloss|score sheet|Score sheet}} and writing implement &ndash; Tournament games require scores to be kept, and many players like to record other games for later analysis.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Rules of chess ==\n[[Rules of chess]] &ndash; rules governing the play of the game of chess.\n* [[White and Black in chess]] &ndash; one set of pieces is designated \"white\" and the other is designated \"black\". White moves first. Some older sets had white and red.\n* [[Cheating in chess]] &ndash; methods that have been used to gain an unfair advantage by breaking the rules.\n\n=== Initial set up ===\n* [[Rules of chess#Initial setup|Initial set up]] &ndash; initial placement of the pieces on the chessboard before any moves are made.\n\n=== Moves ===\n* {{chessgloss|capture|Capture}} &ndash; move of a piece to a square occupied by an opposing piece, which is removed from the board and from play.\n* [[Check (chess)|Check]] &ndash; situation in which the king would be subject to capture (but the king is never actually captured).\n* [[Checkmate]] &ndash; a winning move which makes capture of the opposing king inevitable.\n\n==== How each piece moves ====\n* [[Pawn (chess)#Movement|Moving a pawn]] &ndash; pawns move straight forward one space at a time, but capture diagonally (within a one-square range). On its first move, a pawn may move two squares forward instead (with no capturing allowed in a two-square move). Also, pawns are subject to the [[en passant]] and [[promotion (chess)|promotion]] movement rules (see below).\n** [[En passant]] &ndash; on the ''very next move'' after a player moves a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] two squares forward from its starting position, an opposing pawn that is guarding the skipped square may capture the pawn (taking it \"as&nbsp;it&nbsp;passes\"), by moving to the passed square as if the pawn had stopped there.<ref>[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=124&view=article FIDE rules (''En&nbsp;Passant'' is rule 3.7, part d)]</ref>\n** [[Promotion (chess)|Pawn promotion]] &ndash; when a pawn reaches its eighth rank it is exchanged for the player's choice of a queen, rook, bishop or knight (usually a queen, since it is the most powerful piece).\n* [[Knight (chess)#Movement|Moving a knight]] &ndash; knights move two squares horizontally and one square vertically from their original position, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally, jumping directly to the destination while ignoring intervening spaces.\n* [[Bishop (chess)#Movement|Moving a bishop]] &ndash; bishops move any distance in a straight line in either direction along squares connected diagonally. One bishop in each army moves diagonally on white squares only, and the other bishop is restricted to moving along black squares.\n* [[Rook (chess)#Initial placement and movement|Moving a rook]] &ndash; rook may move any distance along a rank or a file (forward, backward, left, or right), and can also be used for [[castling]] (see below).\n** [[Castling]] &ndash; special move available to each player once in the game (with restrictions) where the king is moved two squares to the left or right and the rook on that side is moved to the other side of the king.\n* [[Queen (chess)#Movement|Moving the queen]] &ndash; queen can move like a rook or like a bishop (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), but no castling.\n* [[King (chess)#Movement|Moving the king]] &ndash; king may move one square in any direction, but may not move into check. It may also make a special move called \"castling\" (see above).\n\n=== End of the game ===\n* [[Rules of chess#Resigning|Resigning]] &ndash; a player may end the game by resigning, which cedes victory to the opponent.\n* [[Checkmate]] &ndash; object of the game \u2013 a king is in check and has no move to get out of check, losing the game.\n* [[Draw (chess)|Draw]] &ndash; neither side wins or loses. In competition this usually counts as a half-win for each player.\n** [[Draw by agreement]] &ndash; players may agree that the game is a draw.\n** [[Stalemate]] &ndash; if the player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in [[Check (chess)|check]], the game is a draw by stalemate.\n** [[Fifty-move rule]] &ndash; if within the last fifty moves by both sides, no pawn has moved and there have been no captures, a player may claim a draw.\n** [[Threefold repetition]] &ndash; if the same position has occurred three times with the same player to move, a player may claim a draw.\n*** [[Perpetual check]] &ndash; situation in which one king cannot escape an endless series of checks but cannot be checkmated. This was formerly a rule of chess to result in a draw, and still used informally, but superseded by the threefold repetition rule and fifty-move rule, which make it implicit.\n\n=== Competition rules and other features ===\n* [[Adjournment (games)|Adjournment]] &ndash; play stops, and the game is resumed later. This has become rare since the advent of computer analysis of chess games.\n* [[Chess notation]] &ndash; system of recording chess moves.\n** [[Algebraic chess notation]] &ndash; most common method of recording moves.\n** [[Descriptive chess notation]] &ndash; superseded method of recording moves, it was widely used, especially in English- and Spanish-speaking countries, and is still sometimes seen.\n* [[Draw by agreement]] &ndash; the two players agree to call the game a draw, as neither is likely to win.\n* [[Time control]] &ndash; each player must complete either a specified number of moves or all of his moves before a certain time elapses on his [[game clock]].\n* [[Touch-move rule]] &ndash; if a player touches his own piece, he must move it if it has a legal move. If he touches an opponent's piece, he must capture it if he can legally.\n\n=== Minor variants ===\n* [[Blindfold chess]] &ndash; one or both players play without seeing the board and pieces.\n* [[Chess handicap]] &ndash; one of the players gives a handicap to the other player, usually starting the game without a certain piece.\n* [[Fast chess]] &ndash; chess played with a time control limiting each player to a specified time of 60&nbsp;minutes or less (can be as low as 1&nbsp;minute).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n* [[Blunder (chess)|Blunder]] &ndash; very bad move.\n* [[Candidate move]] &ndash; move that upon initial observation of the position, warrants further analysis. Spotting these moves is the key to higher-level play.\n* [[Compensation (chess)|Compensation]] &ndash; having positional advantages in spite of {{chessgloss|material}} disadvantages.\n* [[Chess handicap]] &ndash; way to enable a weaker player to have a chance of winning against a stronger one. There are a variety of such handicaps, such as material odds (the stronger player surrenders a certain piece or pieces), extra moves (the weaker player has an agreed number of extra moves at the beginning of the game), extra time on the chess clock, and special conditions (such as requiring the odds-giver to deliver checkmate with a specified piece or pawn). Various permutations of these, such as \"pawn and two moves\", are also possible.\n* [[Chess piece relative value]] &ndash; relative value of chess pieces, based on their relative power.\n* [[Premove]] &ndash; used in fast online games, it refers to a player making his next move while his opponent is thinking about his move. After the opponent's move, the premove will be made, if legal, taking only 0.1&nbsp;seconds on the game clock.\n* [[Priyome]] &ndash; typical maneuver or technique in chess.\n* [[Ply (game theory)|Ply]] &ndash; half-turn, that is, one player's portion of a turn.\n* [[Tempo (chess)|Tempo]] &ndash; a \"unit\" similar to time, equal to one chess move, e.g. to lose a tempo is to waste a move or give the opponent the opportunity of an extra move. Sometimes a player may want to lose a tempo.\n\n=== General situations ===\n* [[En prise]] &ndash; when an unguarded piece is in position to be captured.\n* [[Initiative (chess)|Initiative]] &ndash; situational advantage in which a player can make threats that cannot be ignored, forcing the opponent to use his turns to respond to threats rather than make his own.\n* [[Transposition (chess)|Transposition]] &ndash; sequence of moves resulting in a position which may also be reached by another common sequence of moves. Transpositions are particularly common in [[chess opening|openings]], where a given position may be reached by different sequences of moves. Players sometimes use transpositions deliberately in order to avoid variations they dislike, lure opponents into unfamiliar or uncomfortable territory or simply to worry opponents.<ref name=\"AboutDotComIntroTo1d4\">{{cite web |url=http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa03c15_9.htm |title=Chess Opening Tutorial : Introduction to 1.d4 |author=Mark Weeks |publisher=about.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125081835/http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa03c15_9.htm |archivedate=2008-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"SoltisTranspoTricks\">{{cite book |title=Transpo Tricks in Chess |author=[[Andrew Soltis|Soltis, A.]] |publisher=Batsford |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7134-9051-0}} See review at {{cite web |url=http://www.chessville.com/reviews/TranspoTricks.htm |title=Transpo Tricks in Chess \u2013 review |publisher=chessville.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418115252/http://www.chessville.com/reviews/TranspoTricks.htm |archivedate=2008-04-18 }}</ref>\n* [[Time trouble]] &ndash; having little thinking time left in a timed game, thereby increasing the likelihood of making weak or losing moves or overlooking strong or winning moves.\n* [[Zugzwang]] &ndash; situation in which a player would prefer to pass and make no move, because he has no move that does not worsen his position.\n\n=== Pawn structure ===\n[[Pawn structure]] &ndash; describes features of the positions of the pawns. Pawn structure may be used for tactical or strategic effect, or both.\n* [[Backward pawn]] &ndash; pawn that is not supported by other pawns and cannot advance.\n* [[Connected pawns]] &ndash; pawns of the same color on adjacent files so that they can protect each other.\n* [[Doubled pawns]] &ndash; two pawns of the same color on the same file, so that one blocks the other.\n* [[Half-open file]] &ndash; file that has pawns of one color only.\n* [[Isolated pawn]] &ndash; pawn with no pawns of the same color on adjacent files.\n* [[Mar\u00f3czy Bind]] &ndash; formation with white pawns on c4 and e4, after the exchange of White's d-pawn for Black's c-pawn.\n* [[Open file]] &ndash; file void of pawns.\n* [[Passed pawn]] &ndash; pawn that can advance to its eighth rank without being blocked by an opposing pawn and without the possibility of being captured by a pawn on an adjacent file.\n\n=== Chess tactics ===\n[[Chess tactics]] &ndash; a chess tactic is a move or sequence of moves which may result in tangible gain or limits the opponent's options. Tactics are usually contrasted with strategy, in which advantages take longer to be realized, and the opponent is less constrained in responding.\n* [[Anti-computer tactics (gaming)|Anti-computer tactics]] &ndash; tactics used by humans in games against computers that the program cannot handle very well\n* {{chessgloss|capture|Capture}} &ndash; to remove an opposing piece from the board by taking it with one of your own. Except in the case of an en passant capture, the capturing man replaces the captured man on its square. Also, a move that captures. Captures can be executed offensively or defensively.\n* [[Combination (chess)|Combination]] &ndash; series of moves, often with an exchange or sacrifice, to achieve some advantage.\n* [[Exchange (chess)|Exchange]] &ndash; capturing a piece in return for allowing another piece to be captured.\n** [[The exchange (chess)|The exchange]] &ndash; exchange of a bishop or knight for a rook. The rook is generally the stronger piece unless a player obtains other advantages for allowing the exchange.\n* [[Flight square]] &ndash; square that the king can retreat to, if attacked.\n\n==== Fundamental tactics ====\nFundamental tactics include:<ref name = \"Brace\">Edward R.

Opportunities for interference are rare because the defended object must be more valuable than the sacrificed piece, and the interposition must itself represent a threat.\n* [[King walk]] &ndash; several successive movements of the king, usually in the endgame to get it from a safe square (where it was hiding during the middlegame) to a more active position. Not to be confused with \"king hunt\", where a player forces his opponent's king out of safety and chases it across the board with a series of checks.\n* [[Outpost (chess)|Outpost]] &ndash; square where a piece can attack the opponent's position without being attacked by enemy pawns. Knights are good pieces to occupy outposts.\n* [[Overloading (chess)|Overloading]] &ndash; giving a defensive piece an additional defensive assignment which it cannot complete without abandoning its original defensive assignment.\n* [[Promotion (chess)|Pawn promotion]] &ndash; moving a pawn to the back row to be promoted to a knight, a bishop, a rook, or a queen. While this is a rule, it is also a type of move, with tactical significance. Pawn promotion, or the threat of it, often decides the result of a chess endgame.\n** [[Underpromotion]] &ndash; promotion to a knight, bishop, or rook is known as an \"underpromotion\". Although these pieces are less powerful than the queen, there are some situations where it is advantageous to underpromote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/chess-tactics--definitions-and-examples|title=Chess Tactics \u2013 Definitions and Examples|first=Chess com Webmaster|last=(News)|date=|website=Chess.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> For example, since the knight moves in a way which the queen cannot, knight underpromotions can be very useful, and are the most common type of underpromotion.

The reason is to lose a tempo and put the opponent in zugzwang.\n* [[Undermining (chess)|Undermining]] &ndash; capturing a defensive piece, leaving one of the opponent's pieces undefended or underdefended. Also known as \"removal of the guard\".\n* [[Windmill (chess)|Windmill]] &ndash; repeated series of discovered checks which the opponent cannot avoid, winning large amounts of material.\n* [[X-ray (chess)|X-ray attack]] &ndash; indirect attack of a piece through another piece.\n* [[Zwischenzug]] (\"Intermediate move\") &ndash; To make an intermediate move before the expected move to gain an advantage.  \n\n===== Checkmate patterns =====\n[[Checkmate pattern]] &ndash; a particular checkmate. Some checkmate patterns occur sufficiently frequently, or are otherwise of such interest to scholars, that they have acquired specific names in chess commentary. Here are some of the most notorious:\n* [[Back-rank checkmate]] &ndash; checkmate accomplished by a rook or queen on the opponent's first rank, because the king is blocked in by its own pieces.\n* [[Bishop and knight checkmate]] &ndash; fundamental checkmate with a minimum amount of material. It is notoriously difficult to achieve.\n* [[Boden's Mate]] &ndash; checkmate pattern characterized by a king being mated by two bishops on criss-crossing diagonals, with possible flight squares blocked by friendly pieces.\n* [[Fool's mate]] &ndash; shortest possible checkmate, on Black's second move. It is rare in practice.\n* [[Scholar's mate]] &ndash; checkmate in as few as four moves by a player accomplished by a queen supported by a bishop (usually) in an attack on the f7 or f2 square. It is fairly common at the novice level.\n* [[Smothered mate]] &ndash; checkmate accomplished by only a knight because the king's own pieces occupy squares to which it would be able to escape.\n\n==== Defensive tactics ====\n* [[Artificial castling]] (also known as \"castling by hand\") &ndash; taking several moves to get the king to the position it would be in if castling could have been done.\n* [[Block (chess)|Block]] (blocking an attack) &ndash; interposing a piece between another piece and its attacker. When the piece being attacked is the king, this is blocking a check.\n* [[Blockade (chess)|Blockade]] &ndash; to block a passed pawn with a piece.\n* [[Desperado (chess)|Desperado]] &ndash; piece that seems determined to give itself up, typically either (1) to sell itself as dearly as possible in a situation where both sides have hanging pieces or (2) to bring about stalemate if it is captured (or in some instances, to force a draw by threefold repetition if it is not captured).\n* [[Luft]] &ndash; German for \"air\", meaning squares available for the king to escape an attack, typically through a fortress.\n* [[X-ray (chess)|X-ray defense]] &ndash; indirect defense of a piece through another piece.\n\n===== Possible responses to an attack =====\n* Capture the attacking piece\n* Move the attacked piece\n* Block &ndash; interpose another piece in between the two\n* Guard the attacked piece and permit an [[Exchange (chess)|exchange]]\n* [[#Pin|Pin]] the attacking piece so the capture becomes illegal or unprofitable\n* Use a ''[[Zwischenzug|zwischenzug]]''\n* Create a counter-threat\n\n=== Chess strategy ===\n[[Chess strategy]] &ndash; aspect of chess playing concerned with evaluation of chess positions and setting of goals and long-term plans for future play. While evaluating a position strategically, a player must take into account such factors as the relative value of the pieces on the board, pawn structure, king safety, position of pieces, and control of key squares and groups of squares (e.g. diagonals, open files, individual squares). \n* [[Corresponding squares]] &ndash; usually used as a tool in king and pawn endgames, a pair of corresponding squares are such that if one king is on one of them, the opposing king needs to be on the other.\n* [[Fianchetto]] &ndash; moving the pawn in front of the knight and placing the bishop on that square.\n* [[Permanent brain]] &ndash; thinking when it is the opponent's turn to move.\n* [[Prophylaxis (chess)|Prophylaxis]] &ndash; move that prevents some tactical moves by the opponent.\n* [[First-move advantage in chess]] &ndash; theory that White's having the first move gives him an advantage.\n\n====Schools of chess====\n[[School of chess]] &ndash; group of players that share common ideas about the strategy of the game. There have been several schools in the history of modern chess. Today there is less dependence on schools&nbsp;\u2013 players draw on many sources and play according to their personal style. \n*[[Modenese Masters]] \u2013 school of chess thought based on teachings of 18th century Italian masters, it emphasized an attack on the opposing king.\n*[[Hypermodernism (chess)|Hypermodernism]] \u2013 school of thought based on ideas of some early 20th century masters. Rather than occupying the center of the board with pawns in the opening, control the center by attacking it with knights and bishops from the side.\n\n==== Game phases ====\n# [[Chess opening]] \u2013 first phase of the game, where pieces are developed before the main battle begins.\n# [[Chess middlegame]] \u2013 second phase of the game, usually where the main battle is. Many games end in the middlegame.\n# [[Chess endgame]] \u2013 third and final phase of the game, where there are only a few pieces left.\n\n==== Chess openings ====\n[[Chess opening]] &ndash; group of initial moves of a chess game. Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings as finished by White, or defenses as finished by Black, but opening is also used as the general term.\n** [[Fool's mate]] &ndash; also known as the Two-Move Checkmate, it is the quickest possible checkmate in chess.

Most often the checkmated king has castled queenside, and is mated on c8 or c1.\n** [[Epaulette mate]] &ndash; checkmate where two parallel retreat squares for a checked king are occupied by his own pieces, preventing his escape. The most common Epaulette mate involves the king on his back rank, trapped between two rooks.\n** [[L\u00e9gal's mate]] &ndash; chess opening trap, characterized by a queen sacrifice followed by checkmate with minor pieces if Black accepts the sacrifice.

White and Black starting positions must be mirrored and king must start between rooks allowing castling.\n* [[Transcendental Chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 similar to Chess960, except that there is no castling, starting positions are not necessarily mirrored, and bishops must start in opposite color squares. There are 8,294,400 possible starting positions.\n\n=== Variants with different forces ===\n* [[Chess handicap]]&nbsp;\u2013 giving an advantage to a weaker player to allow equal chances of winning. Usually the advantage given is in material, extra moves or extra time.\n* [[Dunsany's Chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 Black starts just as in traditional chess, while White starts with only 32 pawns. Black wins by taking all the pawns while avoiding stalemate, White wins by checkmating the black king.\n\n=== Variants with a different board ===\n* [[Minichess]]&nbsp;\u2013 board has less squares, e.g. 3\u00d73, 5\u00d75, 5\u00d76, etc.\n* [[Los Alamos chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 6\u00d76 variant without bishops.\n* [[Grid chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 8\u00d78 board with a 4\u00d74 grid, dividing the board in 16 spaces of 2\u00d72 squares each.

Knights cannot capture or be captured.\n* [[Andernach chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 after a capture, the capturing piece changes its color.\n* [[Checkless chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 any move resulting in check is not allowed, except checkmate.\n* [[Circe chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 captured pieces instantly return to their starting positions.\n* [[Legan chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 starting positions of pieces are concentrated on opposite corners of the board. Pawn movement becomes diagonal and capturing orthogonal.\n* [[Madrasi chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 whenever a piece is attacked by an enemy piece of the same type, it cannot move.\n* [[Monochromatic chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 a piece may only move to a square of the same color as the one it occupies. Knights follow special rules for movement.\n* [[Patrol chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 capturing and checking are not allowed unless the capturing or checking piece is guarded by a friendly piece.\n* [[PlunderChess]]&nbsp;\u2013 capturing pieces gain a limited ability to move as the captured piece.\n\n=== Variants with incomplete information and elements of chance ===\n* [[Kriegspiel (chess)|Kriegspiel]]&nbsp;\u2013 a player can see his own pieces, but not the enemy pieces.\n* [[Dark chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 a player can only see the squares occupied by his own pieces and squares his pieces could move to.\n* [[Penultima]]&nbsp;\u2013 spectators of the game secretly decide the moving and capturing rules for each piece, which the players gradually find out during the game.\n* [[Dice chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 players roll dice before each move to determine which piece types may be moved.\n* [[Knightmare Chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 fantasy variant published by [[Steve Jackson Games]], including cards that change aspects of the game.\n\n=== Multimove variants ===\n* [[Marseillais chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 each player moves twice per turn. If the first move gives check, the player doesn't make the second move that turn.\n* [[Progressive chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 the number of moves played each turn increases progressively.

(1990). ''Play''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</ref>\n**** [[Game]] &ndash; structured playing, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports/games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).\n***** [[Board game]] &ndash; game in which counters or pieces are placed, removed, or moved on a premarked surface or \"board\" according to a set of rules. Games may be based on pure strategy, chance or a mixture of the two and usually have a goal which a player aims to achieve.\n***** [[Strategy game]] &ndash; game (e.g. computer, video or board game) in which the players' uncoerced, and often autonomous decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome. Almost all strategy games require internal [[decision tree]] style thinking, and typically very high [[situation awareness]].\n***** [[Two-player game]] &ndash; game played by just two players, usually against each other.\n**** Sport &ndash; form of play, but sport is also a category of entertainment in its own right ''(see immediately below for description)''\n** [[Sport]] &ndash; organized, competitive, entertaining, and skillful activity requiring commitment, strategy, and fair play, in which a winner can be defined by objective means.

Also, pawns are subject to the [[en passant]] and [[promotion (chess)|promotion]] movement rules (see below).\n** [[En passant]] &ndash; on the ''very next move'' after a player moves a [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] two squares forward from its starting position, an opposing pawn that is guarding the skipped square may capture the pawn (taking it \"as&nbsp;it&nbsp;passes\"), by moving to the passed square as if the pawn had stopped there.<ref>[http://www.fide.com/fide/handbook?id=124&view=article FIDE rules (''En&nbsp;Passant'' is rule 3.7, part d)]</ref>\n** [[Promotion (chess)|Pawn promotion]] &ndash; when a pawn reaches its eighth rank it is exchanged for the player's choice of a queen, rook, bishop or knight (usually a queen, since it is the most powerful piece).\n* [[Knight (chess)#Movement|Moving a knight]] &ndash; knights move two squares horizontally and one square vertically from their original position, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally, jumping directly to the destination while ignoring intervening spaces.\n* [[Bishop (chess)#Movement|Moving a bishop]] &ndash; bishops move any distance in a straight line in either direction along squares connected diagonally. One bishop in each army moves diagonally on white squares only, and the other bishop is restricted to moving along black squares.\n* [[Rook (chess)#Initial placement and movement|Moving a rook]] &ndash; rook may move any distance along a rank or a file (forward, backward, left, or right), and can also be used for [[castling]] (see below).\n** [[Castling]] &ndash; special move available to each player once in the game (with restrictions) where the king is moved two squares to the left or right and the rook on that side is moved to the other side of the king.\n* [[Queen (chess)#Movement|Moving the queen]] &ndash; queen can move like a rook or like a bishop (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), but no castling.\n* [[King (chess)#Movement|Moving the king]] &ndash; king may move one square in any direction, but may not move into check. It may also make a special move called \"castling\" (see above).\n\n=== End of the game ===\n* [[Rules of chess#Resigning|Resigning]] &ndash; a player may end the game by resigning, which cedes victory to the opponent.\n* [[Checkmate]] &ndash; object of the game \u2013 a king is in check and has no move to get out of check, losing the game.\n* [[Draw (chess)|Draw]] &ndash; neither side wins or loses. In competition this usually counts as a half-win for each player.\n** [[Draw by agreement]] &ndash; players may agree that the game is a draw.\n** [[Stalemate]] &ndash; if the player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in [[Check (chess)|check]], the game is a draw by stalemate.\n** [[Fifty-move rule]] &ndash; if within the last fifty moves by both sides, no pawn has moved and there have been no captures, a player may claim a draw.\n** [[Threefold repetition]] &ndash; if the same position has occurred three times with the same player to move, a player may claim a draw.\n*** [[Perpetual check]] &ndash; situation in which one king cannot escape an endless series of checks but cannot be checkmated. This was formerly a rule of chess to result in a draw, and still used informally, but superseded by the threefold repetition rule and fifty-move rule, which make it implicit.\n\n=== Competition rules and other features ===\n* [[Adjournment (games)|Adjournment]] &ndash; play stops, and the game is resumed later. This has become rare since the advent of computer analysis of chess games.\n* [[Chess notation]] &ndash; system of recording chess moves.\n** [[Algebraic chess notation]] &ndash; most common method of recording moves.\n** [[Descriptive chess notation]] &ndash; superseded method of recording moves, it was widely used, especially in English- and Spanish-speaking countries, and is still sometimes seen.\n* [[Draw by agreement]] &ndash; the two players agree to call the game a draw, as neither is likely to win.\n* [[Time control]] &ndash; each player must complete either a specified number of moves or all of his moves before a certain time elapses on his [[game clock]].\n* [[Touch-move rule]] &ndash; if a player touches his own piece, he must move it if it has a legal move. If he touches an opponent's piece, he must capture it if he can legally.\n\n=== Minor variants ===\n* [[Blindfold chess]] &ndash; one or both players play without seeing the board and pieces.\n* [[Chess handicap]] &ndash; one of the players gives a handicap to the other player, usually starting the game without a certain piece.\n* [[Fast chess]] &ndash; chess played with a time control limiting each player to a specified time of 60&nbsp;minutes or less (can be as low as 1&nbsp;minute).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n* [[Blunder (chess)|Blunder]] &ndash; very bad move.\n* [[Candidate move]] &ndash; move that upon initial observation of the position, warrants further analysis. Spotting these moves is the key to higher-level play.\n* [[Compensation (chess)|Compensation]] &ndash; having positional advantages in spite of {{chessgloss|material}} disadvantages.\n* [[Chess handicap]] &ndash; way to enable a weaker player to have a chance of winning against a stronger one. There are a variety of such handicaps, such as material odds (the stronger player surrenders a certain piece or pieces), extra moves (the weaker player has an agreed number of extra moves at the beginning of the game), extra time on the chess clock, and special conditions (such as requiring the odds-giver to deliver checkmate with a specified piece or pawn). Various permutations of these, such as \"pawn and two moves\", are also possible.\n* [[Chess piece relative value]] &ndash; relative value of chess pieces, based on their relative power.\n* [[Premove]] &ndash; used in fast online games, it refers to a player making his next move while his opponent is thinking about his move. After the opponent's move, the premove will be made, if legal, taking only 0.1&nbsp;seconds on the game clock.\n* [[Priyome]] &ndash; typical maneuver or technique in chess.\n* [[Ply (game theory)|Ply]] &ndash; half-turn, that is, one player's portion of a turn.\n* [[Tempo (chess)|Tempo]] &ndash; a \"unit\" similar to time, equal to one chess move, e.g. to lose a tempo is to waste a move or give the opponent the opportunity of an extra move. Sometimes a player may want to lose a tempo.\n\n=== General situations ===\n* [[En prise]] &ndash; when an unguarded piece is in position to be captured.\n* [[Initiative (chess)|Initiative]] &ndash; situational advantage in which a player can make threats that cannot be ignored, forcing the opponent to use his turns to respond to threats rather than make his own.\n* [[Transposition (chess)|Transposition]] &ndash; sequence of moves resulting in a position which may also be reached by another common sequence of moves. Transpositions are particularly common in [[chess opening|openings]], where a given position may be reached by different sequences of moves. Players sometimes use transpositions deliberately in order to avoid variations they dislike, lure opponents into unfamiliar or uncomfortable territory or simply to worry opponents.<ref name=\"AboutDotComIntroTo1d4\">{{cite web |url=http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa03c15_9.htm |title=Chess Opening Tutorial : Introduction to 1.d4 |author=Mark Weeks |publisher=about.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125081835/http://chess.about.com/od/improveyouropenings/ss/aa03c15_9.htm |archivedate=2008-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"SoltisTranspoTricks\">{{cite book |title=Transpo Tricks in Chess |author=[[Andrew Soltis|Soltis, A.]] |publisher=Batsford |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7134-9051-0}} See review at {{cite web |url=http://www.chessville.com/reviews/TranspoTricks.htm |title=Transpo Tricks in Chess \u2013 review |publisher=chessville.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418115252/http://www.chessville.com/reviews/TranspoTricks.htm |archivedate=2008-04-18 }}</ref>\n* [[Time trouble]] &ndash; having little thinking time left in a timed game, thereby increasing the likelihood of making weak or losing moves or overlooking strong or winning moves.\n* [[Zugzwang]] &ndash; situation in which a player would prefer to pass and make no move, because he has no move that does not worsen his position.\n\n=== Pawn structure ===\n[[Pawn structure]] &ndash; describes features of the positions of the pawns. Pawn structure may be used for tactical or strategic effect, or both.\n* [[Backward pawn]] &ndash; pawn that is not supported by other pawns and cannot advance.\n* [[Connected pawns]] &ndash; pawns of the same color on adjacent files so that they can protect each other.\n* [[Doubled pawns]] &ndash; two pawns of the same color on the same file, so that one blocks the other.\n* [[Half-open file]] &ndash; file that has pawns of one color only.\n* [[Isolated pawn]] &ndash; pawn with no pawns of the same color on adjacent files.\n* [[Mar\u00f3czy Bind]] &ndash; formation with white pawns on c4 and e4, after the exchange of White's d-pawn for Black's c-pawn.\n* [[Open file]] &ndash; file void of pawns.\n* [[Passed pawn]] &ndash; pawn that can advance to its eighth rank without being blocked by an opposing pawn and without the possibility of being captured by a pawn on an adjacent file.\n\n=== Chess tactics ===\n[[Chess tactics]] &ndash; a chess tactic is a move or sequence of moves which may result in tangible gain or limits the opponent's options. Tactics are usually contrasted with strategy, in which advantages take longer to be realized, and the opponent is less constrained in responding.\n* [[Anti-computer tactics (gaming)|Anti-computer tactics]] &ndash; tactics used by humans in games against computers that the program cannot handle very well\n* {{chessgloss|capture|Capture}} &ndash; to remove an opposing piece from the board by taking it with one of your own. Except in the case of an en passant capture, the capturing man replaces the captured man on its square. Also, a move that captures. Captures can be executed offensively or defensively.\n* [[Combination (chess)|Combination]] &ndash; series of moves, often with an exchange or sacrifice, to achieve some advantage.\n* [[Exchange (chess)|Exchange]] &ndash; capturing a piece in return for allowing another piece to be captured.\n** [[The exchange (chess)|The exchange]] &ndash; exchange of a bishop or knight for a rook. The rook is generally the stronger piece unless a player obtains other advantages for allowing the exchange.\n* [[Flight square]] &ndash; square that the king can retreat to, if attacked.\n\n==== Fundamental tactics ====\nFundamental tactics include:<ref name = \"Brace\">Edward R.

When the piece being attacked is the king, this is blocking a check.\n* [[Deflection (chess)|Deflection]] &ndash; tactic that forces an opposing piece to leave the square, rank or file it occupies, thus exposing the king or a valuable piece.\n* [[Discovered attack]] &ndash; moving a piece uncovers an attack by another piece along a straight line\n* [[Fork (chess)|Fork]] &ndash; attack on two or more pieces by one piece\n* [[Interference (chess)|Interference]] &ndash; blocking the line along which an enemy piece is defended, leaving it vulnerable to capture.\n* [[Overloading (chess)|Overloading]] &ndash; giving a defensive piece an additional defensive assignment which it cannot complete without abandoning its original defensive assignment.\n* [[Pin (chess)|Pin]] &ndash; piece is under attack and either cannot legally move because it would put its king in check or should not move because it will allow an attack on a more valuable piece.\n* [[Skewer (chess)|Skewer]] &ndash; if a piece under attack moves it will allow an attack on another piece\n* [[Undermining (chess)|Undermining]] &ndash; capturing a defensive piece, leaving one of the opponent's pieces undefended or underdefended. Also known as \"removal of the guard\".\n* [[X-ray (chess)|X-ray]] &ndash; (1) synonym for skewer.

Opportunities for interference are rare because the defended object must be more valuable than the sacrificed piece, and the interposition must itself represent a threat.\n* [[King walk]] &ndash; several successive movements of the king, usually in the endgame to get it from a safe square (where it was hiding during the middlegame) to a more active position. Not to be confused with \"king hunt\", where a player forces his opponent's king out of safety and chases it across the board with a series of checks.\n* [[Outpost (chess)|Outpost]] &ndash; square where a piece can attack the opponent's position without being attacked by enemy pawns. Knights are good pieces to occupy outposts.\n* [[Overloading (chess)|Overloading]] &ndash; giving a defensive piece an additional defensive assignment which it cannot complete without abandoning its original defensive assignment.\n* [[Promotion (chess)|Pawn promotion]] &ndash; moving a pawn to the back row to be promoted to a knight, a bishop, a rook, or a queen. While this is a rule, it is also a type of move, with tactical significance. Pawn promotion, or the threat of it, often decides the result of a chess endgame.\n** [[Underpromotion]] &ndash; promotion to a knight, bishop, or rook is known as an \"underpromotion\". Although these pieces are less powerful than the queen, there are some situations where it is advantageous to underpromote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/chess-tactics--definitions-and-examples|title=Chess Tactics \u2013 Definitions and Examples|first=Chess com Webmaster|last=(News)|date=|website=Chess.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> For example, since the knight moves in a way which the queen cannot, knight underpromotions can be very useful, and are the most common type of underpromotion. Promoting to a rook or bishop is advantageous in cases where promoting to a queen would result in an immediate stalemate.\n* [[Pawn storm]] &ndash; several pawns are moved in rapid succession toward the opponent's defenses.<ref Name=\"Pandolfini\">{{cite book |title=Chess thinking |last=Pandolfini |first=Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Pandolfini |year=1995 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-79502-3 |page=179 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=S2gI_mExCOoC&pg=PA179&dq=%22Pawn+storm%22#v=onepage&q=%22Pawn%20storm%22&f=false}}</ref>\n* [[Pin (chess)|Pin]] &ndash; piece is under attack and either cannot legally move because it would put its king in check or should not move because it will allow an attack on a more valuable piece.\n** [[Absolute pin]] &ndash; pin against the king is called ''absolute'' since the pinned piece cannot legally move (as moving it would expose the king to check).\n** [[Relative pin]] &ndash; where the piece shielded by the pinned piece is a piece other than the king, but typically more valuable than the pinned piece.\n** [[Partial pin]] &ndash; when a rook or queen is pinned along a file or rank, or a bishop or queen is pinned along a diagonal\n** [[Situational pin]] &ndash; when a pinned piece is shielding a square and moving out of the way will allow the enemy to move there, resulting in a detrimental situation for the player of the pinned piece, such as checkmate.\n* [[Sacrifice (chess)|Sacrifice]] &ndash; move which deliberately allows the loss of material, either because the player can win the material back or deliver checkmate if it is taken (sham sacrifice or pseudosacrifice), or because the player judges he will have positional [[#compensation|compensation]] (true or positional sacrifice).\n** [[Greek gift sacrifice]] &ndash; typical sacrifice of a bishop by White playing Bxh7+ or Black playing Bxh2+.\n** [[Queen sacrifice]] &ndash; sacrifice of the queen, invariably tactical in nature.\n** [[Plachutta]] &ndash; a piece sacrifices itself on a square where it could be captured by two different pieces in order to deflect them both from crucial squares.\n* [[Skewer (chess)|Skewer]] &ndash; attack upon two pieces in a line and is similar to a pin. In fact, a skewer is sometimes described as a \"reverse pin\"; the difference is that in a skewer, the more valuable piece is in front of the piece of lesser or equal value.\n** [[Absolute skewer]] &ndash; when the King is skewered, forcing him to move out of check, exposing the piece behind him in the line of attack.\n** [[Relative skewer]] &ndash; the skewered piece can be moved, but doesn't have to be (because it is not the King in check).\n* [[Swindle (chess)|Swindle]] &ndash; [[deception|ruse]] by which a player in a losing position tricks his opponent, and thereby achieves a win or [[draw (chess)|draw]] instead of the expected loss.<ref>Edward R.

The reason is to lose a tempo and put the opponent in zugzwang.\n* [[Undermining (chess)|Undermining]] &ndash; capturing a defensive piece, leaving one of the opponent's pieces undefended or underdefended. Also known as \"removal of the guard\".\n* [[Windmill (chess)|Windmill]] &ndash; repeated series of discovered checks which the opponent cannot avoid, winning large amounts of material.\n* [[X-ray (chess)|X-ray attack]] &ndash; indirect attack of a piece through another piece.\n* [[Zwischenzug]] (\"Intermediate move\") &ndash; To make an intermediate move before the expected move to gain an advantage.  \n\n===== Checkmate patterns =====\n[[Checkmate pattern]] &ndash; a particular checkmate. Some checkmate patterns occur sufficiently frequently, or are otherwise of such interest to scholars, that they have acquired specific names in chess commentary. Here are some of the most notorious:\n* [[Back-rank checkmate]] &ndash; checkmate accomplished by a rook or queen on the opponent's first rank, because the king is blocked in by its own pieces.\n* [[Bishop and knight checkmate]] &ndash; fundamental checkmate with a minimum amount of material. It is notoriously difficult to achieve.\n* [[Boden's Mate]] &ndash; checkmate pattern characterized by a king being mated by two bishops on criss-crossing diagonals, with possible flight squares blocked by friendly pieces.\n* [[Fool's mate]] &ndash; shortest possible checkmate, on Black's second move. It is rare in practice.\n* [[Scholar's mate]] &ndash; checkmate in as few as four moves by a player accomplished by a queen supported by a bishop (usually) in an attack on the f7 or f2 square. It is fairly common at the novice level.\n* [[Smothered mate]] &ndash; checkmate accomplished by only a knight because the king's own pieces occupy squares to which it would be able to escape.\n\n==== Defensive tactics ====\n* [[Artificial castling]] (also known as \"castling by hand\") &ndash; taking several moves to get the king to the position it would be in if castling could have been done.\n* [[Block (chess)|Block]] (blocking an attack) &ndash; interposing a piece between another piece and its attacker. When the piece being attacked is the king, this is blocking a check.\n* [[Blockade (chess)|Blockade]] &ndash; to block a passed pawn with a piece.\n* [[Desperado (chess)|Desperado]] &ndash; piece that seems determined to give itself up, typically either (1) to sell itself as dearly as possible in a situation where both sides have hanging pieces or (2) to bring about stalemate if it is captured (or in some instances, to force a draw by threefold repetition if it is not captured).\n* [[Luft]] &ndash; German for \"air\", meaning squares available for the king to escape an attack, typically through a fortress.\n* [[X-ray (chess)|X-ray defense]] &ndash; indirect defense of a piece through another piece.\n\n===== Possible responses to an attack =====\n* Capture the attacking piece\n* Move the attacked piece\n* Block &ndash; interpose another piece in between the two\n* Guard the attacked piece and permit an [[Exchange (chess)|exchange]]\n* [[#Pin|Pin]] the attacking piece so the capture becomes illegal or unprofitable\n* Use a ''[[Zwischenzug|zwischenzug]]''\n* Create a counter-threat\n\n=== Chess strategy ===\n[[Chess strategy]] &ndash; aspect of chess playing concerned with evaluation of chess positions and setting of goals and long-term plans for future play. While evaluating a position strategically, a player must take into account such factors as the relative value of the pieces on the board, pawn structure, king safety, position of pieces, and control of key squares and groups of squares (e.g. diagonals, open files, individual squares). \n* [[Corresponding squares]] &ndash; usually used as a tool in king and pawn endgames, a pair of corresponding squares are such that if one king is on one of them, the opposing king needs to be on the other.\n* [[Fianchetto]] &ndash; moving the pawn in front of the knight and placing the bishop on that square.\n* [[Permanent brain]] &ndash; thinking when it is the opponent's turn to move.\n* [[Prophylaxis (chess)|Prophylaxis]] &ndash; move that prevents some tactical moves by the opponent.\n* [[First-move advantage in chess]] &ndash; theory that White's having the first move gives him an advantage.\n\n====Schools of chess====\n[[School of chess]] &ndash; group of players that share common ideas about the strategy of the game. There have been several schools in the history of modern chess. Today there is less dependence on schools&nbsp;\u2013 players draw on many sources and play according to their personal style. \n*[[Modenese Masters]] \u2013 school of chess thought based on teachings of 18th century Italian masters, it emphasized an attack on the opposing king.\n*[[Hypermodernism (chess)|Hypermodernism]] \u2013 school of thought based on ideas of some early 20th century masters. Rather than occupying the center of the board with pawns in the opening, control the center by attacking it with knights and bishops from the side.\n\n==== Game phases ====\n# [[Chess opening]] \u2013 first phase of the game, where pieces are developed before the main battle begins.\n# [[Chess middlegame]] \u2013 second phase of the game, usually where the main battle is. Many games end in the middlegame.\n# [[Chess endgame]] \u2013 third and final phase of the game, where there are only a few pieces left.\n\n==== Chess openings ====\n[[Chess opening]] &ndash; group of initial moves of a chess game. Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings as finished by White, or defenses as finished by Black, but opening is also used as the general term.\n** [[Fool's mate]] &ndash; also known as the Two-Move Checkmate, it is the quickest possible checkmate in chess. A prime example consists of the moves: 1.f3 e5 2.g4 Qh4#\n** [[Scholar's mate]] &ndash; checkmate achieved by the moves: 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6? 4.Qxf7#. The moves might be played in a different order or in slight variation, but the basic idea is the same: the queen and bishop combine in a simple mating attack on f7 (or f2 if Black is performing the mate).\n** [[Smothered mate]] &ndash; checkmate delivered by a knight in which the mated king is unable to move because he is surrounded (or smothered) by his own pieces.\n** [[Back rank checkmate]] &ndash; checkmate delivered by a rook or queen along a back rank (that is, the row on which the pieces (not pawns) stand at the start of the game) in which the mated king is unable to move up the board because the king is blocked by friendly pieces (usually pawns) on the second rank (Burgess 2009:16).\n** [[Boden's mate]] &ndash; checkmating pattern in chess characterized by bishops on two criss-crossing diagonals (for example, bishops on a6 and f4 delivering mate to a king on c8), with possible flight squares for the king being occupied by friendly pieces. Most often the checkmated king has castled queenside, and is mated on c8 or c1.\n** [[Epaulette mate]] &ndash; checkmate where two parallel retreat squares for a checked king are occupied by his own pieces, preventing his escape. The most common Epaulette mate involves the king on his back rank, trapped between two rooks.\n** [[L\u00e9gal's mate]] &ndash; chess opening trap, characterized by a queen sacrifice followed by checkmate with minor pieces if Black accepts the sacrifice. The trap is named after the French player Sire de L\u00e9gal (1702\u20131792).\n* [[Chess Informant]]\n* [[Chess opening theory table]]\n* [[Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings]]\n* [[Gambit]] &ndash;

His peak rating is 2872, the highest in history.\n* '''[[List of chess players|more...]]'''\n\n=== Some influential persons who played chess ===\n* [[Ben Franklin#Chess|Ben Franklin]]\n\n== Chess variants ==\n{{mainarticle|Chess variant|List of chess variants}}\n[[Chess variant]]&nbsp;\u2013 games similar to chess but with different rules or pieces.\n* [[Fairy chess piece]]&nbsp;\u2013 pieces used in chess variants other than the usual pieces.\n\n=== Variants with a different starting position ===\n* [[Displacement chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 starting position is slightly altered to negate players' knowledge of openings.\n* [[Chess960]]&nbsp;\u2013 variant created by Bobby Fischer, in which the starting position of the pieces on the 1st and 8th ranks are random, resulting in 960 possible starting positions. White and Black starting positions must be mirrored and king must start between rooks allowing castling.\n* [[Transcendental Chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 similar to Chess960, except that there is no castling, starting positions are not necessarily mirrored, and bishops must start in opposite color squares. There are 8,294,400 possible starting positions.\n\n=== Variants with different forces ===\n* [[Chess handicap]]&nbsp;\u2013 giving an advantage to a weaker player to allow equal chances of winning. Usually the advantage given is in material, extra moves or extra time.\n* [[Dunsany's Chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 Black starts just as in traditional chess, while White starts with only 32 pawns. Black wins by taking all the pawns while avoiding stalemate, White wins by checkmating the black king.\n\n=== Variants with a different board ===\n* [[Minichess]]&nbsp;\u2013 board has less squares, e.g. 3\u00d73, 5\u00d75, 5\u00d76, etc.\n* [[Los Alamos chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 6\u00d76 variant without bishops.\n* [[Grid chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 8\u00d78 board with a 4\u00d74 grid, dividing the board in 16 spaces of 2\u00d72 squares each. Works just like traditional chess, except that a piece must cross at least one grid line at each move. \n* [[Cylinder chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 played on a cylinder, which results in joining the right and left sides of the board.\n* [[Circular chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 variant played on a circular board.\n* [[Alice Chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 played with two boards, one of which starts empty. After the completion of each move, the piece that moved is transferred to the same square of the other board (after a move on the second board, the piece returns to the first board).\n* [[Hexagonal chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 any of various variants played on a hexagonal board or board with hexagonal cells.\n* [[Three-dimensional chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 any of various variants with multiple boards at different levels, resulting in gameplay in three dimensions.\n** [[Three-dimensional chess#Star Trek Tri-Dimensional Chess|Star Trek Tri-Dimensional Chess]]\n* [[Cubic Chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 pieces are replaced by cubes, with the piece figures on their sides, making easier to shift the piece types under special rules of promotion.\n* [[Flying chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 played with two boards, one of which represents the upper level, the other the lower. Only some pieces are allowed to move on the upper level.\n* [[Dragonchess]]&nbsp;\u2013 created by [[Gary Gygax]], co-creator of the famed [[role-playing game]] [[Dungeons & Dragons]], the pieces are inspired on characters and monsters from the fantasy RPG.\n\n=== Variants with unusual rules ===\n* [[Losing chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 objective of each player is to lose all their pieces instead of checkmating the enemy king. Capturing, as in [[checkers]], is compulsory.\n* [[Atomic chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 whenever a capture occurs, the surrounding pieces are also captured, resembling the idea of an explosion.\n* [[Three checks chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 a player wins by checking the opponent king three times.\n* [[Extinction chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 the objective is to capture all of a particular type of piece of the opponent (e.g., both knights, all pawns, or the queen).\n* [[Crazyhouse]]&nbsp;\u2013 a captured piece can be introduced back to the board by the player who captured it, as a piece of his own.\n* [[Knight relay chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 pieces defended by a knight may move as a knight. Knights cannot capture or be captured.\n* [[Andernach chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 after a capture, the capturing piece changes its color.\n* [[Checkless chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 any move resulting in check is not allowed, except checkmate.\n* [[Circe chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 captured pieces instantly return to their starting positions.\n* [[Legan chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 starting positions of pieces are concentrated on opposite corners of the board. Pawn movement becomes diagonal and capturing orthogonal.\n* [[Madrasi chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 whenever a piece is attacked by an enemy piece of the same type, it cannot move.\n* [[Monochromatic chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 a piece may only move to a square of the same color as the one it occupies. Knights follow special rules for movement.\n* [[Patrol chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 capturing and checking are not allowed unless the capturing or checking piece is guarded by a friendly piece.\n* [[PlunderChess]]&nbsp;\u2013 capturing pieces gain a limited ability to move as the captured piece.\n\n=== Variants with incomplete information and elements of chance ===\n* [[Kriegspiel (chess)|Kriegspiel]]&nbsp;\u2013 a player can see his own pieces, but not the enemy pieces.\n* [[Dark chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 a player can only see the squares occupied by his own pieces and squares his pieces could move to.\n* [[Penultima]]&nbsp;\u2013 spectators of the game secretly decide the moving and capturing rules for each piece, which the players gradually find out during the game.\n* [[Dice chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 players roll dice before each move to determine which piece types may be moved.\n* [[Knightmare Chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 fantasy variant published by [[Steve Jackson Games]], including cards that change aspects of the game.\n\n=== Multimove variants ===\n* [[Marseillais chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 each player moves twice per turn. If the first move gives check, the player doesn't make the second move that turn.\n* [[Progressive chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 the number of moves played each turn increases progressively. White starts with one move, then Black plays two moves, then White plays 3 moves, etc.\n* [[Avalanche chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 after each move, it is obligatory for the player to move an opponent pawn one square towards himself.\n* [[Monster chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 Black plays as in traditional chess, but White has only one king and four pawns, and moves twice a turn.\n* [[Kung-fu chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 a variant with no turns, pieces can be moved freely, each piece having its own delay time between two moves. A [[real-time strategy]] game, played mostly online.\n\n=== Multiplayer variants ===\n* [[Bughouse chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 variant with four players and two boards, 2 vs 2, captured pieces by a player are transferred to his partner, who may introduce them to his board.\n* [[Three-player chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 specially connected three-sided board for three players.\n* [[Four-player chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 extended cross-shaped board for four players.\n* [[Forchess]]&nbsp;\u2013 four player variant inside a regular board, with specific initial configuration.\n* [[Djambi]]&nbsp;\u2013 9\u00d79 variant for four players with special pieces and rules.\n* [[Bosworth (game)|Bosworth]]&nbsp;\u2013 four player variant on a 6\u00d76 board, pieces are put into play gradually as the game progresses.\n* [[Enochian chess]]&nbsp;\u2013 four player variant with complex rules created by [[William Wynn Westcott]], one of the three founders of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]].\n\n=== Variants with unusual pieces ===\n* [[Fairy chess piece]]\n* [[Hippogonal]]\n* [[Grasshopper (chess piece)|Grasshopper]]\n* [[Grasshopper chess]]\n* [[Berolina chess]]\n* [[Maharajah and the Sepoys]]\n* [[Omega Chess]]\n* [[Stealth Chess]]\n* [[Pocket Mutation Chess]]\n* [[Baroque chess]]\n* Butterfly chess\n* [[Chess with different armies]]\n* [[Duell (chess)|Duell]]\n* [[Gess]]\n* [[Wildebeest Chess]]\n\n==== Variants with bishop+knight and rook+knight compounds ====\n* [[Seirawan chess]]\n* [[Janus Chess]]\n* [[Capablanca Chess]]\n* [[Capablanca Random Chess]]\n* [[Embassy Chess]]\n* [[Modern chess]]\n* [[Grand Chess]]\n\n=== Games inspired by chess ===\n* [[Arimaa]]\n* [[Icehouse pieces]]\n* [[Martian chess]]\n\n=== Historical variants ===\n* [[History of chess]]\n* [[Cox\u2013Forbes theory]]\n* [[Liubo]]\n* [[Chaturanga]]\n* [[Chaturaji]]\n* [[Shatranj]]\n* [[Abu Bakr bin Yahya al-Suli]]\n* [[Tamerlane chess]]\n* [[Hiashatar]]\n* [[Senterej]]\n* [[Lewis chessmen]]\n\n=== Xiangqi and variants ===\n* [[Xiangqi]]\n* [[Encyclopedia of Chinese Chess Openings]]\n* [[Banqi]]\n* [[Giog]]\n\n=== Shogi and variants ===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Shogi]]\n* [[Shogi strategy and tactics]]\n* [[History of shogi]]\n* [[Meijin (shogi)|Meijin]]\n* [[Ryu-oh]]\n* [[Computer shogi]]\n* [[Shogi variant]]\n* [[Micro shogi]]\n* [[Minishogi]]\n* [[Kyoto shogi]]\n* [[Judkins shogi]]\n* [[Whale shogi]]\n* [[Tori shogi]]\n* [[Yari shogi]]\n* [[Heian shogi]]\n* [[Sho shogi]]\n* [[Cannon shogi]]\n* [[Hasami shogi]]\n* [[Hand shogi]]\n* [[Annan shogi]]\n* [[Unashogi]]\n* [[Wa shogi]]\n* [[Chu shogi]]\n* [[Heian dai shogi]]\n* [[Akuro]]\n* [[Dai shogi]]\n* [[Tenjiku shogi]]\n* [[Dai dai shogi]]\n* [[Maka dai dai shogi]]\n* [[Ko shogi]]\n* [[Tai shogi]]\n* [[Taikyoku shogi]]\n* [[Sannin shogi]]\n* [[Yonin shogi]]\n* [[Edo-era shogi sources]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Other national variants ===\n* [[Janggi]]\n* [[Makruk]]\n* [[Sittuyin]]\n\n===Chess combined with other sports and pastimes===\n* [[Chess boxing]]\n* [[Human chess]]\n* [[Shot chess]]\n* [[Strip games#Chess|Strip chess]]\n\n=== Chess variants software ===\n* [[ChessV]]\n* [[Fairy-Max]]\n\n===Fictional variants===\n* [[Wizard's chess]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Chess}}\n* ''[[Index of chess articles]]''\n* ''[[Glossary of chess]]''\n** ''[[Glossary of chess problems]]''\n* [[Hippogonal]]\n* [[Morphy number]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|Chess}}\n*[http://www.chesstactics.org ''Predator at the Chessboard \u2013 A Field Guide to Chess Tactics''] \u2013 Learn chess tactics\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16377 ''The Blue Book of Chess''];
