{"title_page": "Pride", "text_new": "Chixken nuggets    pride is called the root of all evil. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul or [[magnanimity]], but when viewed as a vice it is often known to be self-[[idolatry]], sadistic contempt, [[vanity]] or vainglory. Pride can also manifest itself as a high opinion of one's [[nation]] (national pride), [[ethnicity]] (ethnic pride) and sexual identity.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Proud'' comes from late [[Old English]] ''prut'', probably from [[Old French]] ''prud'' \"brave, valiant\" (11th century) (which became ''preux'' in French), from [[Late Latin]] term ''prodis'' \"useful\", which is compared with the Latin ''prodesse'' \"be of use\".<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/proud Article from Free Online Dictionary], accessed 9 Nov. 2008</ref> The sense of \"having a high opinion of oneself\", not in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons' opinion of the Norman knights who called themselves \"proud\".<ref>[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=proud Article from Online Etymology Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606194147/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=proud |date=2014-06-06 }}, accessed 20 June 2014</ref>\n\n== Philosophical views ==\n\n=== Ancient Greek philosophy ===\n[[Aristotle]] identified pride (''megalopsuchia'', variously translated as proper pride, greatness of soul and magnanimity)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBoqmEvavawC&pg=PA93 |title=The Nicomachean Ethics By Aristotle, James Alexander, Kerr Thomson, Hugh Tredennick, Jonathan Barnes translators |accessdate=2012-03-11|isbn=9780140449495 |last1=Aristotle |year=2004 }}</ref> as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and humility, thus:\n{{quote|Now the man is thought to be '''proud''' who thinks himself worthy of great things, being worthy of them; for he who does so beyond his deserts is a fool, but no virtuous man is foolish or silly.

Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge. As for the pleasure in hubris, its cause is this: naive men think that by ill-treating others they make their own superiority the greater.<ref>[[Aristotle]] ''Rhetoric'' 1378b (Greek text and English translation available at the [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0060&layout=&loc=2.2.1 Perseus Project]).</ref>}}\n\nThus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is altogether an entirely different thing from pride.\n\n== Psychological views ==\nSince pride is classified as an emotion or passion, it is pride both cognitive and evaluative and that its object, that which it cognizes and evaluates, is the self and its properties, or something the proud individual identifies with.<ref name=\":1\" /> Like [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[shame]], it is specifically described in the field as a [[Self-conscious emotions|self-conscious emotion]] that results from the evaluations of the self and one's behavior according to internal and external standards.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Environmental Psychology|last=Bechtel|first=Robert|last2=Churchman|first2=Arza|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=978-0471405948|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=547}}</ref> This is further explained by the way pride results from satisfying or conforming to a standard while guilt or shame is an offshoot of defying it.

Individuals may implicitly grant status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies show that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status in a group.<ref name=\"Shariff\"/>\n\nBehaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from the body. This postural display is innate as it is shown in congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see it in others.<ref>Tracy & Matsumoto, 2008.</ref>\n\n=== Positive outcomes ===\nA common understanding of pride is that it results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting the personal goals; for example, Weiner et al. have posited that positive performance outcomes elicit pride in an individual when the event is appraised as having been caused by him alone. Moreover, Oveis et al. conceptualize pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid negotiations of conflict.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Oveis | first1 = C. | last2 = Horberg | first2 = E.

It is related to \"more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where the individual is proud\" (Weiner, 1985). Pride is generally associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and outward promotion. Along with hope, it is also often described as an emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility of the effort expended (Fredrickson, 2001). According to Bagozzi et al., pride can have the positive benefits of enhancing creativity, productivity, and altruism. For instance, it has been found that in terms of school achievement, pride is associated with a higher GPA in low neighborhood socioeconomic environments, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods, pride is associated with a lower GPA.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Byrd | first1 = C.

Lea et al. have examined the role of pride in various economic situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another, but are linked together by the selfhood of the people who take them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lea | first1 = S.

[[Carl Rogers]] observed that most people \"regard themselves as worthless and unlovable.\" Thus, they lack self-esteem.<ref>Terry D. Cooper, ''Sin, Pride & Self-Acceptance: The Problem of Identity in Theology & Psychology'' (InterVar sity, 2003), 40, 87, 95.</ref>\n\nTerry Cooper conceptualized in 2003 excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as an important paradigm in describing the human condition. He examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the experience of women, the [[humanistic psychology]] position that pride does not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front designed to protect an undervalued self.<ref>Cooper, T. D. (2003). Sin, pride & self-acceptance: the problem of identity in theology & psychology. Chicago: InterVarsity Press.</ref>\n\nHe considers that the work of certain neo-Freudian psychoanalysts, namely [[Karen Horney]], offers promise in dealing with what he calls a \"deadlock between the overvalued and undervalued self\" (Cooper, 112\u20133).\nCooper refers to their work in describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:\n<blockquote>\nThe \"idealized self,\" the \"tyranny of the should,\" the \"pride system\" and the nature of self-hate all point toward the intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt. Understanding how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem. (Cooper, 112\u20133).\n</blockquote>\n\nThus, [[hubris]], which is an exaggerated form of self-esteem, is sometimes actually a lie used to cover the lack of self-esteem the committer of pride feels deeply down.\n\nIn the [[King James Bible]], those people exhibiting excess pride are labeled with the somewhat archaic term, [[:wikt:haughty|\"Haughty\"]].\n\n=== Hubris and group pride ===\n{{Main|Hubris}}{{See also|Group narcissism}}\nHubris itself is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility (Tangney, 1999). As one might expect, Hubris is not necessarily associated with high [[self-esteem]] but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of hubris have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions (Rhodwalt, et al.).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSeveral studies by UC Davis psychologist Cynthia Picket about group pride, have shown that groups that boast, gloat or denigrate others tend to become a group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other groups.<ref>Study is currently in revision</ref> Suggesting that \"hubristic, pompous displays of group pride might actually be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of strength,\" she states that those that express pride by being filled with [[humility]] whilst focusing on members' efforts and hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public and personal eyes.\n\n== In different groups ==\n\n=== National ===\n[[File:The Father and Mother.jpg|alt=|thumb|''The Father and Mother'' by [[Boardman Robinson]] depicting War as the offspring of Greed and Pride.]]\n{{Main|Nationalism}}\n\n==== Germany ====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2008}}\nIn [[Germany]], \"national pride\" (\"Nationalstolz\") is often associated with the former [[Nazism|Nazi regime]]. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate about the issue of German [[patriotism]]. The [[FIFA World Cup 2006|World Cup]] in 2006, held in Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years. Although many were hesitant to show such blatant support as the hanging of the national flag from windows, as the [[Germany national football team|team]] progressed through the tournament, so too did the level of support across the nation.<ref>Sullivan, G.

However, it also refers to an excessive or irrational belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness ''in the eyes of others'' and may in so far be compared to pride. The term Vanity originates from the Latin word ''[[vanitas]]'' meaning ''emptiness'', ''untruthfulness'', ''futility'', ''foolishness'' and ''empty pride''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=vanitas|title=William Whitaker's Words|publisher=}}</ref> Here ''empty pride'' means a fake pride, in the sense of vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.\n\nIn many religions, vanity is considered a form of self-[[idolatry]], in which one rejects God for the sake of one's own [[image]], and thereby becomes divorced from the [[Divine grace|grace]]s of [[God]]. The stories of [[Lucifer]] and [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] (who gave us the term [[narcissism]]), and others, attend to a pernicious aspect of vanity. In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a [[peacock]], and in [[Bible|Biblical]] terms, by the [[Whore of Babylon]]. During the [[Renaissance]], vanity was invariably represented as a naked [[woman]], sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with comb and mirror.

Behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to [[Nicolas Tournier]], which hangs in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], is ''An Allegory of Justice and Vanity''. A young woman holds a [[Beam balance|balance]], symbolizing [[justice]]; she does not look at the mirror or the [[human skull|skull]] on the table before her.

While some philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] (and [[George Bernard Shaw]]) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world [[religion]]s consider pride's fraudulent form a [[sin]], such as is expressed in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 11:2 of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In Judaism, pride is called the root of all evil. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul or [[magnanimity]], but when viewed as a vice it is often known to be self-[[idolatry]], sadistic contempt, [[vanity]] or vainglory. Pride can also manifest itself as a high opinion of one's [[nation]] (national pride), [[ethnicity]] (ethnic pride) and sexual identity.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Proud'' comes from late [[Old English]] ''prut'', probably from [[Old French]] ''prud'' \"brave, valiant\" (11th century) (which became ''preux'' in French), from [[Late Latin]] term ''prodis'' \"useful\", which is compared with the Latin ''prodesse'' \"be of use\".<ref>[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/proud Article from Free Online Dictionary], accessed 9 Nov. 2008</ref> The sense of \"having a high opinion of oneself\", not in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons' opinion of the Norman knights who called themselves \"proud\".<ref>[http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=proud Article from Online Etymology Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606194147/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=proud |date=2014-06-06 }}, accessed 20 June 2014</ref>\n\n== Philosophical views ==\n\n=== Ancient Greek philosophy ===\n[[Aristotle]] identified pride (''megalopsuchia'', variously translated as proper pride, greatness of soul and magnanimity)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBoqmEvavawC&pg=PA93 |title=The Nicomachean Ethics By Aristotle, James Alexander, Kerr Thomson, Hugh Tredennick, Jonathan Barnes translators |accessdate=2012-03-11|isbn=9780140449495 |last1=Aristotle |year=2004 }}</ref> as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and humility, thus:\n{{quote|Now the man is thought to be '''proud''' who thinks himself worthy of great things, being worthy of them; for he who does so beyond his deserts is a fool, but no virtuous man is foolish or silly.

Hubris is not the requital of past injuries; this is revenge.

Individuals may implicitly grant status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies show that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status in a group.<ref name=\"Shariff\"/>\n\nBehaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from the body. This postural display is innate as it is shown in congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see it in others.<ref>Tracy & Matsumoto, 2008.</ref>\n\n=== Positive outcomes ===\nA common understanding of pride is that it results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting the personal goals; for example, Weiner et al. have posited that positive performance outcomes elicit pride in an individual when the event is appraised as having been caused by him alone. Moreover, Oveis et al. conceptualize pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid negotiations of conflict.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Oveis | first1 = C. | last2 = Horberg | first2 = E.

It is related to \"more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where the individual is proud\" (Weiner, 1985). Pride is generally associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and outward promotion. Along with hope, it is also often described as an emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility of the effort expended (Fredrickson, 2001). According to Bagozzi et al., pride can have the positive benefits of enhancing creativity, productivity, and altruism. For instance, it has been found that in terms of school achievement, pride is associated with a higher GPA in low neighborhood socioeconomic environments, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods, pride is associated with a lower GPA.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Byrd | first1 = C.

Lea et al. have examined the role of pride in various economic situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another, but are linked together by the selfhood of the people who take them.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lea | first1 = S.

[[Carl Rogers]] observed that most people \"regard themselves as worthless and unlovable.\" Thus, they lack self-esteem.<ref>Terry D. Cooper, ''Sin, Pride & Self-Acceptance: The Problem of Identity in Theology & Psychology'' (InterVar sity, 2003), 40, 87, 95.</ref>\n\nTerry Cooper conceptualized in 2003 excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as an important paradigm in describing the human condition. He examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the experience of women, the [[humanistic psychology]] position that pride does not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front designed to protect an undervalued self.<ref>Cooper, T. D. (2003). Sin, pride & self-acceptance: the problem of identity in theology & psychology. Chicago: InterVarsity Press.</ref>\n\nHe considers that the work of certain neo-Freudian psychoanalysts, namely [[Karen Horney]], offers promise in dealing with what he calls a \"deadlock between the overvalued and undervalued self\" (Cooper, 112\u20133).\nCooper refers to their work in describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:\n<blockquote>\nThe \"idealized self,\" the \"tyranny of the should,\" the \"pride system\" and the nature of self-hate all point toward the intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt. Understanding how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem. (Cooper, 112\u20133).\n</blockquote>\n\nThus, [[hubris]], which is an exaggerated form of self-esteem, is sometimes actually a lie used to cover the lack of self-esteem the committer of pride feels deeply down.\n\nIn the [[King James Bible]], those people exhibiting excess pride are labeled with the somewhat archaic term, [[:wikt:haughty|\"Haughty\"]].\n\n=== Hubris and group pride ===\n{{Main|Hubris}}{{See also|Group narcissism}}\nHubris itself is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility (Tangney, 1999). As one might expect, Hubris is not necessarily associated with high [[self-esteem]] but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of hubris have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions (Rhodwalt, et al.).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSeveral studies by UC Davis psychologist Cynthia Picket about group pride, have shown that groups that boast, gloat or denigrate others tend to become a group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other groups.<ref>Study is currently in revision</ref> Suggesting that \"hubristic, pompous displays of group pride might actually be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of strength,\" she states that those that express pride by being filled with [[humility]] whilst focusing on members' efforts and hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public and personal eyes.\n\n== In different groups ==\n\n=== National ===\n[[File:The Father and Mother.jpg|alt=|thumb|''The Father and Mother'' by [[Boardman Robinson]] depicting War as the offspring of Greed and Pride.]]\n{{Main|Nationalism}}\n\n==== Germany ====\n{{Expand section|date=April 2008}}\nIn [[Germany]], \"national pride\" (\"Nationalstolz\") is often associated with the former [[Nazism|Nazi regime]]. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate about the issue of German [[patriotism]]. The [[FIFA World Cup 2006|World Cup]] in 2006, held in Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years.

However, it also refers to an excessive or irrational belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness ''in the eyes of others'' and may in so far be compared to pride. The term Vanity originates from the Latin word ''[[vanitas]]'' meaning ''emptiness'', ''untruthfulness'', ''futility'', ''foolishness'' and ''empty pride''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=vanitas|title=William Whitaker's Words|publisher=}}</ref> Here ''empty pride'' means a fake pride, in the sense of vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.\n\nIn many religions, vanity is considered a form of self-[[idolatry]], in which one rejects God for the sake of one's own [[image]], and thereby becomes divorced from the [[Divine grace|grace]]s of [[God]]. The stories of [[Lucifer]] and [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] (who gave us the term [[narcissism]]), and others, attend to a pernicious aspect of vanity. In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a [[peacock]], and in [[Bible|Biblical]] terms, by the [[Whore of Babylon]]. During the [[Renaissance]], vanity was invariably represented as a naked [[woman]], sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a [[demon]] or a [[putto]].  Other symbols of vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and often by the figure of [[death]] himself.\n\n[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|upright|left|\"All Is Vanity\" by [[C. Allan Gilbert]], evoking the inevitable decay of life and beauty toward death]]\nOften we find an inscription on a scroll that reads ''Omnia Vanitas'' (\"All is Vanity\"), a quote from the Latin translation of the Book of [[Ecclesiastes]].<ref>James Hall, ''Dictionary of Subjects & Symbols in Art'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1974), 318.</ref>  Although that phrase, itself depicted in a type of still life, [[vanitas]], originally referred not to obsession with one's appearance, but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man's efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture.\n\n\"The artist invites us to pay [[lip service (disambiguation)|lip-service]] to condemning her\", writes [[Edwin Mullins]], \"while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass\u2014a window\u2014through which we peer and secretly desire her.\"<ref>[[Edwin Mullins]], ''The Painted Witch: How Western Artists Have Viewed the Sexuality of Women'' (New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc., 1985), 62\u20133.</ref> The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining [[Venus (god)|Venus]].\n\nIn his table of the [[seven deadly sins]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]] depicts a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil. Behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to [[Nicolas Tournier]], which hangs in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], is ''An Allegory of Justice and Vanity''. A young woman holds a [[Beam balance|balance]], symbolizing [[justice]]; she does not look at the mirror or the [[human skull|skull]] on the table before her. [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer's]] famous painting ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, as the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://essentialvermeer.20m.com/cat_about/necklace.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011175732/http://essentialvermeer.20m.com/cat_about/necklace.htm |archivedate=2007-10-11 }}</ref> ''All is Vanity'', by [[Charles Allan Gilbert]] (1873\u20131929), carries on this theme. An [[optical illusion]], the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror.\nSuch artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of [[death]].\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Philosophy|Psychology}}\n* [[Groupthink]]\n* [[Icarus complex]]\n* [[Selfishness]]\n* [[Seven virtues]]\n* ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]''\n* [[Vanity gallery]]\n* [[Victory disease]]\n* [[Accomplishment]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Cairns | first1 = Douglas L | year = 1996 | title = ''Hybris'', Dishonour, and Thinking Big | url = | journal = Journal of Hellenic Studies | volume = 116 | issue = | pages = 1\u201332 | doi=10.2307/631953| jstor = 631953 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = MacDowell | first1 = Douglas | year = 1976 | title = ''Hybris'' in Athens | url = | journal = Greece and Rome | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 14\u201331 | doi=10.1017/s0017383500018210}}\n* Owen, David (2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071214025850/http://www.politicospublishing.co.uk/titles.php/itemcode/178  ''The Hubris Syndrome: Bush, Blair and the Intoxication of Power''] Politico's, Methuen Publishing Ltd.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Jessica Tracy |title=Take Pride: Why the Deadliest Sin Holds the Secret to Human Success |publisher=\tHoughton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2016 |isbn=978-0544273177}}\n\n{{Emotion-footer}}\n{{Seven Deadly Sins}}\n{{Catholic virtue ethics}}\n{{Subject bar |commons=yes |commons-search=Category:Pride |wikt=yes |wikt-search=pride |q=yes |d=yes |d-search=Q187234}}\n\n[[Category:Emotions]]\n[[Category:Pride| ]]\n[[Category:Psychological attitude]]\n[[Category:Religious belief and doctrine]]\n[[Category:Virtue]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:b42b:9100:ed65:58a7:6af8:29e", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(It did not add a inportant piece of writing)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride"}

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists.

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other, nonfictional literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThe artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist movement grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

Halsman produced the ''Dal\u00ed Atomica'' series (1948)&nbsp;\u2013  inspired by Dal\u00ed's painting ''Leda Atomica''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2013  which in one photograph depicts \"a painter's easel, three cats, a bucket of water, and Dal\u00ed himself floating in the air\".<ref name=designws />\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:Dali museum.jpg|thumb|[[Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]] also holds the crypt where Dal\u00ed is buried]]\nArchitectural achievements include his [[Port Lligat]] house near [[Cadaqu\u00e9s]], as well as his [[Dal\u00ed Theatre and Museum|Theatre and Museum]] in [[Figueres]].

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other, nonfictional literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThe artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist movement grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

It will also serve as a crew work and rest area. ''Nauka'' will be equipped with full guidance and navigation control including engines and an [[attitude control]] system that can be used as a backup by the ISS. It will be docked onto the ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' module's nadir (Earth facing) docking port. Outfitting equipment launched in 2010 with the [[Rassvet (ISS module)|''Rassvet'']] (Mini-Research Module 1) on [[NASA]]'s [[STS-132]] will also be used for ''Nauka'', the spare elbow joint for the European Robotic Arm (launched with ''Nauka''), internal hardware and an experimental airlock will be positioned on one of the side-facing ports at the bottom of the module.

It will also serve as a crew work and rest area. ''Nauka'' will be equipped with full guidance and navigation control including engines and an [[attitude control]] system that can be used as a backup by the ISS. It will be docked onto the ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' module's nadir (Earth facing) docking port. Outfitting equipment launched in 2010 with the [[Rassvet (ISS module)|''Rassvet'']] (Mini-Research Module 1) on [[NASA]]'s [[STS-132]] will also be used for ''Nauka'', the spare elbow joint for the European Robotic Arm (launched with ''Nauka''), internal hardware and an experimental airlock will be positioned on one of the side-facing ports at the bottom of the module. The new module will contain crew quarters with life support equipment including atmospheric processing, galley and toilet.<ref name=\"gazetaru2011\" />\n\n===Primary research module===\n''Nauka'' will be Russia's primary ISS research module. For some time, NASA's official plans included a second research module around the same size as ''Nauka'', listed to be \"under review\", but it was eventually cancelled, leaving ''Nauka'' to be the only [[Russian research module]] besides ''Rassvet'' and [[Poisk (ISS module)|''Poisk'']] (Mini-Research Module 2).{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Specifications==\n*Length: {{convert|13|m|sigfig=4}}\n*Diameter: {{convert|4.11|m}}\n*Mass: {{convert|20300|kg}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Scientific research on the ISS]]\n* [[Russian Orbital Segment]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Nauka module}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080608223447/http://www.khrunichev.ru/khrunichev_eng/live/full_mks.asp?id=13190 Description of MLM (English)] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927002608/http://www.khrunichev.ru/khrunichev/live/full_mks.asp?id=13190 (Russian)] \u2013 Photos of the incomplete FGB-2 at Khrunichev.ru\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030132756/http://www.novosti-kosmonavtiki.ru/content/numbers/262/01.shtml \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u041a\u0421 (Russian)] \u2013 November 2004 article discussing plans for MLM\n*[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss_fgb2.html MLM (FGB-2) module of the ISS] \u2013 RussianSpaceWeb on the history of the module\n*[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/mlm.htm MLM (''Nauka'')] \u2013 from Gunter's Space Page\n\n{{ISS modules}}\n{{TKS spacecraft}}\n{{Unmanned ISS flights}}\n{{Future spaceflights}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nauka (ISS module)}}\n[[Category:Russian components of the International Space Station]]\n[[Category:Proposed spacecraft]]\n[[Category:2021 in spaceflight]]\n[[Category:2021 in Russia]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWork on ''Nauka'' and launch date:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: January of 2021 \u2192 January 2021", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauka_(ISS_module)"}

Aldridge has a mixture of social and private housing, there is a large 1960s built shopping centre which has fairly high occupation rates, and a large number of industrial estates supporting both heavy and light industries.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Aldridge war memorial - 02.JPG|thumb|Aldridge war memorial]]\n\nAldridge was recorded as a settlement in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, though the now much larger settlement of Walsall was not.<ref>[http://www.haughton.net/domesdaybookplaces_a.htm THE DOMESDAY BOOK INDEX 1086 - 'A' Places ( Domesday Book Settlements / Places )<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030248/http://www.haughton.net/domesdaybookplaces_a.htm |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> It was valued at 15 shillings under the name of \"Alrewic\", which may have originated from an abundance of Alder trees in the area.<ref>[http://www.walsall.gov.uk/aldridge_in_history.htm Aldridge in history<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another suggestion is that the name \"Aldbridge\" means \"outlying farm among alder-trees\", from the [[Old English]] ''alor'' and ''w\u012bc''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Place-names of Great Britain and Ireland|last=Field|first=John|date=1980|publisher=David & Charles|isbn=0389201545|location=Newton Abbot, Devon|oclc=6964610|page=23}}</ref>\n\nAldridge began as a small agricultural settlement, with farming being the most common occupation up until the 19th century.\n\nIn the 1800s, Aldridge became an industrial town with [[coal mine]]s and [[lime kiln]]s. The coal and clay in the area prompted many to set up collieries and brickworks. Aldridge clay is especially useful in the manufacture of blue bricks. The 1881 census shows that the mines and brickworks were major employers. Because the coal and clay beneath the eastern side of Aldridge (towards Stonnall) is located much deeper under the surface, extraction of this coal and clay would not have been economically viable. As a result, farms continued to dominate the eastern part, though a sand quarry was set up and still remains on Birch Lane.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070621175821/http://www.btinternet.com/~aldridgelhs/HISTORY.htm A Brief History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, modern shops were built in the centre of Aldridge, as well as council buildings. After the [[Second World War]] Aldridge became a [[dormitory town]], or [[suburb]], of [[Birmingham]]. A small airport called Aldridge Airport was used during the Second World War and after was used for passenger services.\n\nAldridge became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] in [[Staffordshire]] in 1894. Other [[village]]s within the district included [[Pelsall]], [[Walsall Wood]], [[Clayhanger, Walsall|Clayhanger]] and [[Streetly]]. This merged with [[Brownhills]] in 1966 to form [[Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District|Aldridge-Brownhills]], and then became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall in 1974.\n\n==Demography==\nThe recorded population in 2011 in 26,988.<ref>[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/census2001/west_midlands_urban_area.asp National Statistics Online - Census 2001<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nSince 1979, Aldridge's [[Member of Parliament|MP]] was [[Richard Shepherd]] ([[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]), the MP for [[Aldridge-Brownhills (UK Parliament constituency)|Aldridge-Brownhills]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/1997EB.html |title=British Parliamentary Election results 1997-: English Boroughs part 1 |publisher=Election.demon.co.uk |date=1995-03-01 |accessdate=2010-05-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100503052817/http://www.election.demon.co.uk/1997EB.html| archivedate= 3 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/1983EB.html |title=United Kingdom Parliamentary Election results 1983-97: English Boroughs part 1 |publisher=Election.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> He stood down at the 2015 General Election.

The primary schools are Cooper and Jordan (CE), Leighswood, St Mary of the Angels (Catholic) and Whetstone Field (Redhouse primary school was closed in the summer of 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.walsall.gov.uk/CMISWebPublic/Binary.ashx?Document=1118 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-30 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723053233/http://www2.walsall.gov.uk/CMISWebPublic/Binary.ashx?Document=1118 |archivedate=2011-07-23 }}</ref>). The secondary schools are [[Aldridge School]] and [[St Francis of Assisi Catholic Technology College]].\n\n==Industry and commerce==\nIn Aldridge there are a number of factories, mostly located on Empire Industrial Park, but also towards Walsall Wood along the main road, Northgate. Some of the most notable factories include the large [[Ibstock]] brick works,  and the [[GKN Driveline|GKN Driveshafts]] factory, although the latter company closed in recent years due to relocation and cheaper foreign imports. [[Birlec]], a manufacturer of industrial furnaces relocated to Aldridge in the late 1950s, but has since closed. Aldridge Plastics Ltd, a plastics injection moulder, was set up in the town in 1968 and continued trading for almost 40 years before ceasing production in 2007. From January 2011, GFP Engineering Ltd, a Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) moulding company, will commence trading after relocating from nearby Lichfield.{{citation needed|reason=update evidence required|date=November 2014}} There is also a marina, Aldridge Marina, which recently underwent full refurbishment offering facilities for canal boat moorers.\n\nMost of the towns shops are located either on High Street, Anchor Road, or in the shopping area known as \"The Parade\". Well-known shops here include [[WH Smith]], [[Iceland]] supermarket, [[Home Bargains]], and [[Boots The Chemist]]. A purpose-built [[Safeway (UK)]] opened in 1992 and started operating as a [[Morrisons]] from 2004. [[B & M]] took over the former [[Focus DIY]] in Coppice Lane and opened its doors for the first time on 1 August 2015. One of the oldest traders in Aldridge is R.H.N. Riley Insurances on Anchor Rd, they have been trading since 1957 and in Aldridge since about 1970.

The coal and clay in the area prompted many to set up collieries and brickworks. Aldridge clay is especially useful in the manufacture of blue bricks. The 1881 census shows that the mines and brickworks were major employers. Because the coal and clay beneath the eastern side of Aldridge (towards Stonnall) is located much deeper under the surface, extraction of this coal and clay would not have been economically viable. As a result, farms continued to dominate the eastern part, though a sand quarry was set up and still remains on Birch Lane.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070621175821/http://www.btinternet.com/~aldridgelhs/HISTORY.htm A Brief History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, modern shops were built in the centre of Aldridge, as well as council buildings. After the [[Second World War]] Aldridge became a [[dormitory town]], or [[suburb]], of [[Birmingham]]. A small airport called Aldridge Airport was used during the Second World War and after was used for passenger services.\n\nAldridge became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] in [[Staffordshire]] in 1894.

Steven Birch was one of the earliest people who purchased claims in the Kennecott ores when it was first discovered. He persuaded JP Morgan and the Guggenheims to invest in the deposit at Kennecott. The operation and the development of the ores in Kennecott falls in the successions of two organizations: The Alaska Syndicate and the Kennecott Copper Corporation. The two organizations share the same goals across different historical times. They are stability of supply, transportations and markets.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Kennecott: Alaskan Origins of a Copper Empire, 1900-1938|last = Grauman|first = |date = 1978|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nThe Alaska Syndicate, as typical businessmen in the 19th century, used bribes and promises to win business favors in the political system. However, their methods were seriously challenged by James Wickersham who led the Alaskan people against monopolism. The famous Ballinger-Pinchot Affair [14] eventually changed the political landscape across the board.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, it caused the resignation of Ballinger, who was a politician in favor of the Alaska Syndicate. Also, the effects of this anti-syndicate climate caused the failure of President Taft's re-election to the presidency. His successor, president Wilson had a series of political reforms which made the old methods of the Alaska Syndicate to not work in the new times. Consequently, the Alaska Syndicate invited public participation and a new corporation, the Kennecott Copper Corporation, was founded.  Essentially the same people controlled the Corporation, but with different tactics and methods to manage the organization.\n\n== James Wickersham ==\nJames Wickersham was district judge and delegate of the House of Representatives for the Territory of Alaska 1909-1917, 1919, and 1921, 1931-1933.\n\nThe Territory of Alaska had a man who stood up for the area, and this man's name was James Wickersham. James Wickersham was a major opponent of the Alaska Syndicate.\n\n\"An affidavit similar to the one herewith enclosed was submitted by Hon. James Wickersham Delegate from Alaska, on May 24, 1910, together with a copy of a letter which he forwarded to the Attorney General on the same date, with reference to the matter of furnishing coal to military posts at Forts Davis and Liscum, Alaska, and on May 28, 1910, this office informed the Secretary of War that the papers referred to would be held, pending call from the Attorney General for any papers or information that may be on file in this office. As it is understood that the Department of Justice was investigating the matter, no further action was taken by his office.\n\n\"However, on November 26, 1910, Mr. Stuart McNamara, of No. 52 William Street, New York, formerly connected with the Department of Justice, requested, and was furnished, a brief statement of facts as shown by the records of this office, it being understood that fee intended to assist the Department of Justice in the investigation of the matter.\n\n\"No call has yet been received from the Attorney General for any papers or information that may be on file in this office.\"<ref>United States Congressional serial set, issue 6117 pg. 75-79</ref>\n\nEfforts toward self-government were complicated by the influence in Washington of the \"Alaska Syndicate,\" formed in 1906 by the fortunes of J. P. Morgan and Guggenheim. The Syndicate had purchased the large Kennicott-Bonanza copper mine and controlled much of Alaskan steamship and rail transportation, as well as a major part of the salmon canning industry. The Syndicate lobby in Washington had successfully opposed any further extension of Alaskan home rule. James Wickersham, who had been appointed to an Alaskan judgeship in 1900 by President McKinley, became alarmed by the potential influence of incorporated interests in the territory and took up the struggle for Alaskan self-government. Wickersham argued that Alaska's resources should be used for the good of the entire country rather than exploited by a select group of large, absentee-controlled interests\u2014home rule, he claimed, would assure more just utilization of the territory's natural wealth. The 1910 Ballinger-Pinchot affair, which involved the illegal distribution of thirty-three federal government Alaskan coal land claims to the Guggenheim interests, culminated in a Congressional investigation and brought Alaska directly into the national headlines.<ref>Gislason, Eric. A Brief History in Alaska Statehood</ref>\n\nIn the midst of it all, James Wickersham was a big contribution to Alaska becoming a state.\n\n== Kennicott and Kennecott ==\nThe town of [[Kennicott, Alaska|Kennicott]] was home to over 500 miners and their families, which is now a small community. It was a classic \"dry\" company town. Most of the miners lived in company housing and life revolved around the mining operation. The Kennecott Copper Mine was the largest copper mine in the world at some time. (?) The mine operated from 1911 to 1938 in the town that is known now as [[McCarthy, Alaska|McCarthy]] in [[Wrangell\u2013St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell St. Elias National Park]]. In the spring of 1915, Guggenheim and Morgan formed the [[Kennecott Copper Corporation]]. The total production was valued at over $200 million which is now comparable about $3 billion. After all of the rich copper deposits were depleted the mines of Kennecott along with the railroad, ceased operations.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.largestnationalpark.com/history.html|title = McCarthy, Kennecott, & the Kennicott Valley|date = 2009|accessdate = December 10, 2014|website = McCarthy, Kennecott, & the Kennicott Valley|publisher = Largest National Park|last = |first = }}</ref> The Alaska Syndicate was formed to develop the mine which eventually expanded into coal, salmon, and infrastructure throughout the state. Their influence helped to prevent Alaska from becoming a state as early as 1916. While the Kennecott Mining Company was still in operation they had developed other properties that still exist today. The different spelling between ''Kennicott'' and ''Kennecott'' was a simple mistake of one letter that the mine owner accidentally spelled wrong and never changed it.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.trekalaska.com/wrangell-st-elias-national-park/kennicott-alaska|title = Trek Alaska|date = |accessdate = December 10, 2014|website = Trek Alaska Wilderness Adventure|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe Kennicott glacier was named after Robert Kennicott. Robert Kennicott was a part of the [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] and arrived in [[San Francisco]] in April 1865. The group moved north to [[Vancouver]] where Kennicott suffered a period of ill health. After his recovery they moved north again to [[Alaska]] in August 1865. Kennicott died in May 1866, likely of congestive heart failure, while traveling up the [[Yukon River]].\n[[File:Kennicott 01.jpg|thumb|Kennecott Mine]]\nToday{{When|date=July 2016}} the tourism makes up the majority of the local economy. People from all over the world come and visit the remains of the Kennecott mines. Even though Kennicott is not a copper mining town anymore it is still a company town of sorts with it having headquarters to the National Park Service.

They are stability of supply, transportations and markets.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Kennecott: Alaskan Origins of a Copper Empire, 1900-1938|last = Grauman|first = |date = 1978|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nThe Alaska Syndicate, as typical businessmen in the 19th century, used bribes and promises to win business favors in the political system. However, their methods were seriously challenged by James Wickersham who led the Alaskan people against monopolism. The famous Ballinger-Pinchot Affair [14] eventually changed the political landscape across the board.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, it caused the resignation of Ballinger, who was a politician in favor of the Alaska Syndicate. Also, the effects of this anti-syndicate climate caused the failure of President Taft's re-election to the presidency. His successor, president Wilson had a series of political reforms which made the old methods of the Alaska Syndicate to not work in the new times. Consequently, the Alaska Syndicate invited public participation and a new corporation, the Kennecott Copper Corporation, was founded.  Essentially the same people controlled the Corporation, but with different tactics and methods to manage the organization.\n\n== James Wickersham ==\nJames Wickersham was district judge and delegate of the House of Representatives for the Territory of Alaska 1909-1917, 1919, and 1921, 1931-1933.\n\nThe Territory of Alaska had a man who stood up for the area, and this man's name was James Wickersham. James Wickersham was a major opponent of the Alaska Syndicate.\n\n\"An affidavit similar to the one herewith enclosed was submitted by Hon. James Wickersham Delegate from Alaska, on May 24, 1910, together with a copy of a letter which he forwarded to the Attorney General on the same date, with reference to the matter of furnishing coal to military posts at Forts Davis and Liscum, Alaska, and on May 28, 1910, this office informed the Secretary of War that the papers referred to would be held, pending call from the Attorney General for any papers or information that may be on file in this office. As it is understood that the Department of Justice was investigating the matter, no further action was taken by his office.\n\n\"However, on November 26, 1910, Mr. Stuart McNamara, of No. 52 William Street, New York, formerly connected with the Department of Justice, requested, and was furnished, a brief statement of facts as shown by the records of this office, it being understood that fee intended to assist the Department of Justice in the investigation of the matter.\n\n\"No call has yet been received from the Attorney General for any papers or information that may be on file in this office.\"<ref>United States Congressional serial set, issue 6117 pg. 75-79</ref>\n\nEfforts toward self-government were complicated by the influence in Washington of the \"Alaska Syndicate,\" formed in 1906 by the fortunes of J. P. Morgan and Guggenheim. The Syndicate had purchased the large Kennicott-Bonanza copper mine and controlled much of Alaskan steamship and rail transportation, as well as a major part of the salmon canning industry. The Syndicate lobby in Washington had successfully opposed any further extension of Alaskan home rule. James Wickersham, who had been appointed to an Alaskan judgeship in 1900 by President McKinley, became alarmed by the potential influence of incorporated interests in the territory and took up the struggle for Alaskan self-government. Wickersham argued that Alaska's resources should be used for the good of the entire country rather than exploited by a select group of large, absentee-controlled interests\u2014home rule, he claimed, would assure more just utilization of the territory's natural wealth. The 1910 Ballinger-Pinchot affair, which involved the illegal distribution of thirty-three federal government Alaskan coal land claims to the Guggenheim interests, culminated in a Congressional investigation and brought Alaska directly into the national headlines.<ref>Gislason, Eric. A Brief History in Alaska Statehood</ref>\n\nIn the midst of it all, James Wickersham was a big contribution to Alaska becoming a state.\n\n== Kennicott and Kennecott ==\nThe town of [[Kennicott, Alaska|Kennicott]] was home to over 500 miners and their families, which is now a small community. It was a classic \"dry\" company town. Most of the miners lived in company housing and was revolved around the mining operation. The Kennecott Copper Mine was the largest copper mine in the world at some time. (?) The mine operated from 1911 to 1938 in the town that is known now as [[McCarthy, Alaska|McCarthy]] in [[Wrangell\u2013St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell St. Elias National Park]]. In the spring of 1915, Guggenheim and Morgan formed the [[Kennecott Copper Corporation]]. The total production was valued at over $200 million which is now comparable about $3 billion. After all of the rich copper deposits were depleted the mines of Kennecott along with the railroad, ceased operations.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.largestnationalpark.com/history.html|title = McCarthy, Kennecott, & the Kennicott Valley|date = 2009|accessdate = December 10, 2014|website = McCarthy, Kennecott, & the Kennicott Valley|publisher = Largest National Park|last = |first = }}</ref> The Alaska Syndicate was formed to develop the mine which eventually expanded into coal, salmon, and infrastructure throughout the state. Their influence helped to prevent Alaska from becoming a state as early as 1916. While the Kennecott Mining Company was still in operation they had developed other properties that still exist today. The different spelling between ''Kennicott'' and ''Kennecott'' was a simple mistake of one letter that the mine owner accidentally spelled wrong and never changed it.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.trekalaska.com/wrangell-st-elias-national-park/kennicott-alaska|title = Trek Alaska|date = |accessdate = December 10, 2014|website = Trek Alaska Wilderness Adventure|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe Kennicott glacier was named after Robert Kennicott. Robert Kennicott was a part of the [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] and arrived in [[San Francisco]] in April 1865. The group moved north to [[Vancouver]] where Kennicott suffered a period of ill health. After his recovery they moved north again to [[Alaska]] in August 1865. Kennicott died in May 1866, likely of congestive heart failure, while traveling up the [[Yukon River]].\n[[File:Kennicott 01.jpg|thumb|Kennecott Mine]]\nToday{{When|date=July 2016}} the tourism makes up the majority of the local economy. People from all over the world come and visit the remains of the Kennecott mines. Even though Kennicott is not a copper mining town anymore it is still a company town of sorts with it having headquarters to the National Park Service. McCarthy is still able to be accessed by the [[McCarthy Road]] which follows the rail bed of the old Copper River and [[Northwestern Railway (Alaska)|Northwestern Railway]] from [[Chitina]] to McCarthy.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Investment funds]]\n[[Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Defunct transportation companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Mining in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Political history of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Alaska]]\n", "name_user": "Writhing", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eKennicott and Kennecott", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Syndicate"}
{"title_page": "Valuation (geometry)", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], a '''valuation''' is a finitely additive function on a collection of admissible subsets of a fixed set <math>X</math> with values in an abelian [[semigroup]]. \nFor example, the [[Lebesgue measure]] is a valuation on finite unions of convex bodies (i.e. non-empty compact convex sets) of Euclidean space <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>. Other examples of valuations  on finite unions of convex bodies are the surface area, the mean width, and the [[Euler characteristic]].\n\nIn the geometric setting, often continuity (or smoothness) conditions are imposed on valuations, but there are also purely discrete facets of the theory. In fact, the concept of valuation has its origin in the dissection theory of [[polytope]]s and in particular [[Hilbert's third problem]], which has grown into a rich theory, heavily reliant on advanced tools from abstract algebra.\n\n==Definition==\nLet <math>X</math>  be a set and <math>\\mathcal S</math> be a collection of admissible subsets of <math>X</math>.

In particular, any simple valuation is the sum of an <math>n</math>- and an <math>(n-1)</math>-homogeneous valuation. This in turn implies that an <math>i</math>-homogeneous valuation is uniquely determined by its restrictions to all <math>(i+1)</math>-dimensional subspaces.\n\n===Embedding theorems===\nThe Klain embedding is a linear injection of <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^+(V)</math>, the space of even <math>i</math>-homogeneous valuations, into the space of continuous sections of a canonical complex line bundle over the Grassmannian <math>\\operatorname{Gr}_i(V)</math> of <math>i</math>-dimensional linear subspaces of <math>V</math>.

But for degrees <math>1<i<n-1</math> very little was known before the turn of the 21st century. McMullen's conjecture is the statement that the valuations \n<math display=\"block\">\\phi_A(K)=\\operatorname{vol}_n(K+A), \\qquad A\\in\\mathcal K(V),</math>\nspan a dense subspace of <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. McMullen's conjecture was confirmed by [[Semyon Alesker|Alesker]] in a much stronger form, which became known as the Irreducibility Theorem:\n\n'''Theorem''' (Alesker<ref name=\"Alesker:Irred\">S. Alesker, ''Description of translation invariant valuations on convex sets with solution of P. McMullen's conjecture''. Geom. Funct. Anal. '''11''' (2001), no. 2, 244\u2013272.</ref>). For every  <math>0<i<n</math>,  the natural action of <math>GL(V)</math> on the spaces <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^+(V)</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^-(V)</math> is irreducible.\n\nHere the action of the [[general linear group]] <math>GL(V)</math> on <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> is given by \n<math display=\"block\"> (g\\cdot \\phi)(K)= \\phi(g^{-1} K).</math>\nThe proof of the Irreducibility Theorem is based on the embedding theorems of the previous section and [[Beilinson-Bernstein localization]].\n\n===Smooth valuations===\nA valuation <math>\\phi\\in\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> is called ''smooth'' if the map <math>g\\mapsto g\\cdot \\phi</math> from <math>GL(V)</math> to <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> is smooth. In other words, <math>\\phi</math> is smooth if and only if <math>\\phi</math> is a smooth vector of the natural representation of <math>GL(V)</math> on <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. The space of smooth valuations <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)</math> is dense in <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>; it comes equipped with a natural Fr\u00e9chet space topology, which is finer than the one induced from <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>.\n\nFor every smooth function <math>f</math> on <math>\\operatorname{Gr}_i(\\mathbb R^n)</math>,\n<math  display=\"block\" >\\phi(K)=\\int_{\\operatorname{Gr}_i(\\mathbb R^n)} \\operatorname{vol}_i(P_E K) f(E) dE,</math>\nwhere <math>P_E\\colon \\mathbb R^n\\to E</math> denotes the orthogonal projection and <math>dE</math> is the Haar measure, defines a smooth even valuation of degree <math>i</math>. It follows from the Irreducibility Theorem, in combination with the Casselman-Wallach theorem, that any smooth even valuation can be represented in this way. Such a representation is sometimes called a ''Crofton formula''.\n\nFor any smooth [[differential form]] <math>\\omega\\in \\Omega^{n-1}(\\mathbb R^n\\times S^{n-1})</math> that is invariant under all the  translations <math>(x,u)\\mapsto (x+t,u)</math> and every number <math>c\\in \\mathbb C</math>,  integration over the ''normal cycle'' defines a smooth valuation:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math  display=\"block\">  \\phi(K)= c\\operatorname{vol}_n(K) + \\int_{N(K)} \\omega, \\qquad K\\in \\mathcal K(\\mathbb R^n). </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nAs a set, the normal cycle <math>N(K)</math> consists of the outward unit normals to <math>K</math>. The Irreducibility Theorem implies that every smooth valuation  is of this form.\n\n==Operations on translation-invariant valuations==\nThere are several natural operations defined on the subspace of  smooth valuations <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\subset \\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. The most important one is the product of two smooth valuations. Together with pullback and pushforward, this operation extends to valuations on manifolds.\n\n===Exterior product===\nLet <math>V,W</math> be finite-dimensional real vector spaces. \nThere exists a bilinear map, called the exterior product, \n<math  display=\"block\"> \\boxtimes \\colon \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\times \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(W)\\to \\operatorname{Val}(V\\times W) </math>\nwhich is uniquely characterized by the following two properties: \n*it is continuous with respect to the usual topologies on <math>\\operatorname{Val}</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty</math>.\n* if <math>\\phi=\\operatorname{vol}_V(\\bullet + A)</math> and <math>\\psi= \\operatorname{vol}_W(\\bullet + B)</math> where <math>A\\in \\mathcal K(V)</math> and <math>B\\in \\mathcal K(W)</math> are convex bodies with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature, and <math>\\operatorname{vol}_V</math> and <math>\\operatorname{vol}_W</math> are densities on <math>V</math> and <math>W</math>, then \n<math  display=\"block\"> \\phi\\boxtimes \\psi = (\\operatorname{vol}_V\\boxtimes \\operatorname{vol}_W) (\\bullet + A\\times B).</math>\n\n===Product===\nThe product of two smooth valuations <math>\\phi,\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)</math> is defined by \n<math display=\"block\"> (\\phi\\cdot \\psi)(K)= (\\phi\\boxtimes \\psi)(\\Delta(K)),</math>\nwhere <math>\\Delta \\colon V\\to V\\times V</math> is the diagonal embedding. The product is a continuous map \n<math display=\"block\"> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) \\times  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)  \\to  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) .</math>\nEquipped with this product, <math> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) </math> becomes a commutative associative graded algebra with the Euler characteristic as the multiplicative identity.\n\n===Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 duality===\nBy a theorem of Alesker, the restriction of the product \n<math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\times \\operatorname{Val}_{n-k}^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}_n^\\infty(V)=\\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math> is a non-degenerate pairing. This motivates the definition of the <math>k</math>-homogeneous ''generalized valuation'', denoted <math>\\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\\infty}(V)</math>, as <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-k}(V)^*\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math>, topologized with the weak topology. By the Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 duality, there is a natural dense inclusion <math>\\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\hookrightarrow\\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\\infty}(V)</math>.\n\n===Convolution===\nConvolution is a natural product on <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V^*)</math>. For simplicity, we fix a density <math>\\operatorname{vol}</math> on <math>V</math> to trivialize the second factor. Define for fixed <math>A,B\\in\\mathcal K(V)</math> with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature \n<math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)\\ast\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+B)=\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A+B).</math> There is then a unique extension by continuity to a map \n<math display=\"block\"> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) \\times  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)  \\to  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V),</math> called the convolution.\nUnlike the product, convolution respects the co-grading, namely if <math>\\phi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-i}(V)</math>, <math>\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-j}(V)</math>, then <math>\\phi\\ast\\psi\\in \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-i-j}(V)</math>.\n\nFor instance, let <math>V(K_1,\\ldots, K_n)</math> denote the mixed volume of the convex bodies <math>K_1,\\ldots, K_n\\subset \\mathbb R^n</math>. If convex bodies <math>A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i}</math> in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> with  with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature   are fixed, then \n<math> \\phi(K) = V(K[i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i})</math>\ndefines a smooth valuation of degree <math>i</math>. The convolution two such valuations is\n<math display=\"block\">V(\\bullet[i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i})\\ast V(\\bullet[j],B_1,\\dots,B_{n-j})=c_{i,j}V(\\bullet[n-j-i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i},B_1,\\dots,B_{n-j}),</math>\nwhere <math>c_{i,j}</math> is a constant depending only on <math>i,j,n</math>.\n\n===Fourier transform===\nThe Alesker-Fourier transform is a natural, <math>GL(V)</math>-equivariant isomorphism of complex-valued valuations \n<math  display=\"block\">\\mathbb F: \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V^*)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V),</math> discovered by Alesker and enjoying many properties resembling the classical Fourier transform, which explains its name.\n\nIt reverses the grading, namely  <math>\\mathbb F: \\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-k}(V^*)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math>, and maps product to convolution: <math display=\"block\">\\mathbb F(\\phi\\cdot \\psi)=\\mathbb F\\phi\\ast\\mathbb F\\psi.</math>\n\nFixing for simplicity a Euclidean structure to identify <math>V=V^*</math>, <math>\\operatorname{Dens}(V)=\\mathbb C</math>, we have the identity <math display=\"block\">\\mathbb F^2\\phi(K)=\\phi(-K).</math> On even valuations, there is a simple description of the Fourier transform in terms of the Klain embedding: <math>\\operatorname{Kl}_{\\mathbb F\\phi}(E)=\\operatorname{Kl}_\\phi(E^\\perp)</math>. In particular, even real-valued valuations remain real-valued after the Fourier transform.\n\nFor odd valuations, the description of the Fourier transform is substantially more involved. Unlike the even case, it is no longer of purely geometric nature. For instance, the space of real-valued odd valuations is not preserved.\n\n===Pullback and pushforward===\nGiven a linear map <math>f:U\\to V</math>, there are induced operations of pullback <math>f^*:\\operatorname{Val}(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}(U)</math> and pushforward <math>f_*:\\operatorname{Val}(U)\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(U)^*\\to \\operatorname{Val}(V)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V)^*</math>. The pullback is the simpler of the two, given by <math>f^*\\phi(K)=\\phi(f(K))</math>. It evidently preserves the parity and degree of homogeneity of a valuation.  \nNote that the pullback does not preserve smoothness when <math>f</math> is not injective.\n\nThe pushforward is harder to define formally. For simplicity, fix Lebesgue measures on <math>U</math> and <math>V</math>. The pushforward can be uniquely characterized by describing its action on valuations of the form <math>\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)</math>, for all <math>A\\in \\mathcal K(U)</math>, and then extended by continuity to all valuations using the Irreducibility Theorem.

'''181''' (2011), 189\u2013294</ref>\n\n==Valuations on manifolds==\nIn a series of papers beginning in 2006, Alesker laid down the foundations for a theory of valuations on manifolds that extends the theory of valuations on convex bodies.  The key observation leading to this extension is that  via integration over the normal cycle ({{EquationNote|1}}), a smooth translation-invariant valuation may be evaluated on  sets  much more general than convex ones. Also ({{EquationNote|1}}) suggests to define  smooth valuations in general by dropping the requirement that the form <math>\\omega</math> be translation-invariant and by replacing the translation-invariant Lebesgue measure with an arbitrary smooth measure.\n\nLet <math>X</math> be an n-dimensional smooth manifold and let <math>\\mathbb P_X= \\mathbb P_+(T^* X)</math> be the co-sphere bundle of <math>X</math>, i.e., the oriented projectivization of the cotangent bundle. \nLet  <math>\\mathcal P(X)</math> denote the collection of compact differentiable polyhedra in <math>X</math>.  The normal cycle of <math>A\\in \\mathcal P(X)</math> is <math>N(A)\\subset \\mathbb P_X</math>, which consists of the outward co-normals to <math>A</math> and is naturally a Lipschitz submanifold of dimension <math>n-1</math>.\n\nFor ease of presentation we henceforth assume that <math>X</math> is oriented, even though the concept of smooth valuations in fact does not depend on orientability.  The space of smooth valuations <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> on <math>X</math> consists of functions  <math>\\phi\\colon \\mathcal  P(X)\\to \\mathbb C</math> of the form\n<math display=\"block\"> \\phi(A)= \\int_A\\mu + \\int_{N(A)}\\omega,\\qquad A\\in \\mathcal P(X),</math>\nwhere  <math>\\mu\\in\\Omega^n(X)</math> and <math>\\omega\\in \\Omega^{n-1}(\\mathbb P_X)</math>  can be arbitrary. \nIt was shown by Alesker that the smooth valuations on open subsets of <math>X</math> form a soft sheaf over <math>X</math>.\n\n===Examples=== \nThe following are examples of smooth valuations on a smooth manifold <math>X</math>:\n* Smooth measures on <math>X</math>.\n* The [[Euler characteristic]]; this follows from the work of [[Shiing-Shen Chern|Chern]]<ref>S.-S.

As in the translation-invariant case, this duality can be used to define generalized valuations.

Other examples of valuations  on finite unions of convex bodies are the surface area, the mean width, and the [[Euler characteristic]]. \n\nIn the geometric setting, often continuity (or smoothness) conditions are imposed on valuations, but there are also purely discrete facets of the theory.

The space of smooth valuations <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)</math> is dense in <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>; it comes equipped with a natural Fr\u00e9chet space topology, which is finer than the one induced from <math>\\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. \n\nFor every smooth function <math>f</math> on <math>\\operatorname{Gr}_i(\\mathbb R^n)</math>,\n<math  display=\"block\" >\\phi(K)=\\int_{\\operatorname{Gr}_i(\\mathbb R^n)} \\operatorname{vol}_i(P_E K) f(E) dE,</math>\nwhere <math>P_E\\colon \\mathbb R^n\\to E</math> denotes the orthogonal projection and <math>dE</math> is the Haar measure, defines a smooth even valuation of degree <math>i</math>. It follows from the Irreducibility Theorem, in combination with the Casselman-Wallach theorem, that any smooth even valuation can be represented in this way. Such a representation is sometimes called a ''Crofton formula''. \n\nFor any smooth [[differential form]] <math>\\omega\\in \\Omega^{n-1}(\\mathbb R^n\\times S^{n-1})</math> that is invariant under all the  translations <math>(x,u)\\mapsto (x+t,u)</math> and every number <math>c\\in \\mathbb C</math>,  integration over the ''normal cycle'' defines a smooth valuation:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math  display=\"block\">  \\phi(K)= c\\operatorname{vol}_n(K) + \\int_{N(K)} \\omega, \\qquad K\\in \\mathcal K(\\mathbb R^n). </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nAs a set, the normal cycle <math>N(K)</math> consists of the outward unit normals to <math>K</math>. The Irreducibility Theorem implies that every smooth valuation  is of this form.\n\n==Operations on translation-invariant valuations==\nThere are several natural operations defined on the subspace of  smooth valuations <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\subset \\operatorname{Val}(V)</math>. The most important one is the product of two smooth valuations. Together with pullback and pushforward, this operation extends to valuations on manifolds.\n\n===Exterior product===\nLet <math>V,W</math> be finite-dimensional real vector spaces. \nThere exists a bilinear map, called the exterior product, \n<math  display=\"block\"> \\boxtimes \\colon \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\times \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(W)\\to \\operatorname{Val}(V\\times W) </math>\nwhich is uniquely characterized by the following two properties: \n*it is continuous with respect to the usual topologies on <math>\\operatorname{Val}</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty</math>.\n* if <math>\\phi=\\operatorname{vol}_V(\\bullet + A)</math> and <math>\\psi= \\operatorname{vol}_W(\\bullet + B)</math> where <math>A\\in \\mathcal K(V)</math> and <math>B\\in \\mathcal K(W)</math> are convex bodies with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature, and <math>\\operatorname{vol}_V</math> and <math>\\operatorname{vol}_W</math> are densities on <math>V</math> and <math>W</math>, then \n<math  display=\"block\"> \\phi\\boxtimes \\psi = (\\operatorname{vol}_V\\boxtimes \\operatorname{vol}_W) (\\bullet + A\\times B).</math>\n\n===Product===\nThe product of two smooth valuations <math>\\phi,\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)</math> is defined by \n<math display=\"block\"> (\\phi\\cdot \\psi)(K)= (\\phi\\boxtimes \\psi)(\\Delta(K)),</math>\nwhere <math>\\Delta \\colon V\\to V\\times V</math> is the diagonal embedding. The product is a continuous map \n<math display=\"block\"> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) \\times  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)  \\to  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) .</math>\nEquipped with this product, <math> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) </math> becomes a commutative associative graded algebra with the Euler characteristic as the multiplicative identity.\n\n===Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 duality===\nBy a theorem of Alesker, the restriction of the product \n<math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\times \\operatorname{Val}_{n-k}^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}_n^\\infty(V)=\\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math> is a non-degenerate pairing. This motivates the definition of the <math>k</math>-homogeneous ''generalized valuation'', denoted <math>\\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\\infty}(V)</math>, as <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-k}(V)^*\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math>, topologized with the weak topology. By the Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 duality, there is a natural dense inclusion <math>\\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\hookrightarrow\\operatorname{Val}_k^{-\\infty}(V)</math>.\n\n===Convolution===\nConvolution is a natural product on <math>\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V^*)</math>. For simplicity, we fix a density <math>\\operatorname{vol}</math> on <math>V</math> to trivialize the second factor. Define for fixed <math>A,B\\in\\mathcal K(V)</math> with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature \n<math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)\\ast\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+B)=\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A+B).</math> There is then a unique extension by continuity to a map \n<math display=\"block\"> \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V) \\times  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V)  \\to  \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty (V),</math> called the convolution.\nUnlike the product, convolution respects the co-grading, namely if <math>\\phi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-i}(V)</math>, <math>\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-j}(V)</math>, then <math>\\phi\\ast\\psi\\in \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-i-j}(V)</math>.\n\nFor instance, let <math>V(K_1,\\ldots, K_n)</math> denote the mixed volume of the convex bodies <math>K_1,\\ldots, K_n\\subset \\mathbb R^n</math>. If convex bodies <math>A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i}</math> in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> with  with smooth boundary and strictly positive Gauss curvature   are fixed, then \n<math> \\phi(K) = V(K[i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i})</math>\ndefines a smooth valuation of degree <math>i</math>. The convolution two such valuations is\n<math display=\"block\">V(\\bullet[i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i})\\ast V(\\bullet[j],B_1,\\dots,B_{n-j})=c_{i,j}V(\\bullet[n-j-i], A_1,\\dots,A_{n-i},B_1,\\dots,B_{n-j}),</math>\nwhere <math>c_{i,j}</math> is a constant depending only on <math>i,j,n</math>.\n\n===Fourier transform===\nThe Alesker-Fourier transform is a natural, <math>GL(V)</math>-equivariant isomorphism of complex-valued valuations \n<math  display=\"block\">\\mathbb F: \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty(V^*)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V),</math> discovered by Alesker and enjoying many properties resembling the classical Fourier transform, which explains its name.\n\nIt reverses the grading, namely  <math>\\mathbb F: \\operatorname{Val}_k^\\infty(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}^\\infty_{n-k}(V^*)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V)</math>, and maps product to convolution: <math display=\"block\">\\mathbb F(\\phi\\cdot \\psi)=\\mathbb F\\phi\\ast\\mathbb F\\psi.</math> \n\nFixing for simplicity a Euclidean structure to identify <math>V=V^*</math>, <math>\\operatorname{Dens}(V)=\\mathbb C</math>, we have the identity <math display=\"block\">\\mathbb F^2\\phi(K)=\\phi(-K).</math> On even valuations, there is a simple description of the Fourier transform in terms of the Klain embedding: <math>\\operatorname{Kl}_{\\mathbb F\\phi}(E)=\\operatorname{Kl}_\\phi(E^\\perp)</math>. In particular, even real-valued valuations remain real-valued after the Fourier transform. \n\nFor odd valuations, the description of the Fourier transform is substantially more involved. Unlike the even case, it is no longer of purely geometric nature. For instance, the space of real-valued odd valuations is not preserved.\n\n===Pullback and pushforward===\nGiven a linear map <math>f:U\\to V</math>, there are induced operations of pullback <math>f^*:\\operatorname{Val}(V)\\to \\operatorname{Val}(U)</math> and pushforward <math>f_*:\\operatorname{Val}(U)\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(U)^*\\to \\operatorname{Val}(V)\\otimes \\operatorname{Dens}(V)^*</math>. The pullback is the simpler of the two, given by <math>f^*\\phi(K)=\\phi(f(K))</math>. It evidently preserves the parity and degree of homogeneity of a valuation.  \nNote that the pullback does not preserve smoothness when <math>f</math> is not injective.\n\nThe pushforward is harder to define formally. For simplicity, fix Lebesgue measures on <math>U</math> and <math>V</math>. The pushforward can be uniquely characterized by describing its action on valuations of the form <math>\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)</math>, for all <math>A\\in \\mathcal K(U)</math>, and then extended by continuity to all valuations using the Irreducibility Theorem. For a surjective map <math>f</math>, \n<math display=\"block\">f_*\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+A)=\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet+f(A)).</math> For an inclusion <math>f:U\\hookrightarrow V</math>, choose a splitting <math>V=U\\oplus W</math>. Then \n<math display=\"block\"> f_*\\operatorname{vol}(\\bullet + A) (K)= \\int_{W}\\operatorname{vol}(K\\cap (U+w) + A) dw.</math>\nInformally, the pushforward is dual to the pullback with respect to the Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 pairing: for <math>\\phi\\in \\operatorname{Val}(V)</math> and <math>\\psi\\in\\operatorname{Val}(U)\\otimes\\operatorname{Dens}(U)^*</math>, \n<math display=\"block\">\\langle f^*\\phi,\\psi\\rangle =\\langle \\phi, f_*\\psi\\rangle.</math>\nHowever, this identity has to be carefully interpreted since the pairing is only well-defined for smooth valuations. For further details, see <ref name=\"Alesker:Fourier>S. Alesker, ''A Fourier-type transform on translation-invariant valuations on convex sets''. Israel J. Math. '''181''' (2011), 189\u2013294</ref>.\n\n==Valuations on manifolds==\nIn a series of papers beginning in 2006, Alesker laid down the foundations for a theory of valuations on manifolds that extends the theory of valuations on convex bodies.  The key observation leading to this extension is that  via integration over the normal cycle ({{EquationNote|1}}), a smooth translation-invariant valuation may be evaluated on  sets  much more general than convex ones. Also ({{EquationNote|1}}) suggests to define  smooth valuations in general by dropping the requirement that the form <math>\\omega</math> be translation-invariant and by replacing the translation-invariant Lebesgue measure with an arbitrary smooth measure.\n\nLet <math>X</math> be an n-dimensional smooth manifold and let <math>\\mathbb P_X= \\mathbb P_+(T^* X)</math> be the co-sphere bundle of <math>X</math>, i.e., the oriented projectivization of the cotangent bundle. \nLet  <math>\\mathcal P(X)</math> denote the collection of compact differentiable polyhedra in <math>X</math>.  The normal cycle of <math>A\\in \\mathcal P(X)</math> is <math>N(A)\\subset \\mathbb P_X</math>, which consists of the outward co-normals to <math>A</math> and is naturally a Lipschitz submanifold of dimension <math>n-1</math>. \n\nFor ease of presentation we henceforth assume that <math>X</math> is oriented, even though the concept of smooth valuations in fact does not depend on orientability.  The space of smooth valuations <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> on <math>X</math> consists of functions  <math>\\phi\\colon \\mathcal  P(X)\\to \\mathbb C</math> of the form\n<math display=\"block\"> \\phi(A)= \\int_A\\mu + \\int_{N(A)}\\omega,\\qquad A\\in \\mathcal P(X),</math>\nwhere  <math>\\mu\\in\\Omega^n(X)</math> and <math>\\omega\\in \\Omega^{n-1}(\\mathbb P_X)</math>  can be arbitrary. \nIt was shown by Alesker that the smooth valuations on open subsets of <math>X</math> form a soft sheaf over <math>X</math>.\n\n===Examples=== \nThe following are examples of smooth valuations on a smooth manifold <math>X</math>:\n* Smooth measures on <math>X</math>.\n* The [[Euler characteristic]]; this follows from the work of [[Shiing-Shen Chern|Chern]]<ref>S.-S. Chern, ''On the curvatura integra in a Riemannian manifold''.\nAnn. of Math. (2) '''46''' (1945), 674\u2013684.</ref> on the [[Gauss-Bonnet theorem]], where such <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\omega</math>  were constructed to represent the Euler characteristic. In particular, <math>\\mu</math> is then the [[Chern\u2013Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem|Chern-Gauss-Bonnet integrand]], which is the Pfaffian of the Riemannian curvature tensor.\n* If <math>X</math> is Riemannian, then the Lipschitz-Killing valuations or intrinsic volumes  <math>V_0^X=\\chi, V_1^X, \\ldots, V_n^X=\\mathrm{vol}_X</math>  are smooth valuations. If <math>f\\colon X\\to \\mathbb R^m</math> is any [[Embedding|isometric immersion]] into a Euclidean space, then <math> V_i^X= f^* V_i^{\\mathbb R^m},</math>  where <math>V_i^{\\mathbb R^m}</math> denotes the usual intrinsic volumes on <math>\\mathbb R^m</math> (see below for the definition of the pullback).  The existence of these valuations is the essence of Weyl's tube formula<ref>H. Weyl, ''On the Volume of Tubes''. Amer. J. Math. '''61''' (1939), no. 2, 461\u2013472</ref>.\n* Let <math>\\mathbb C P^n</math> be the [[complex projective space]], and let <math>\\mathrm{Gr}_k^\\mathbb C</math> denote the Grassmannian of all complex projective subspaces of fixed dimension <math>k</math>. The function \n<math display=\"block\">\\phi(A) = \\int_{\\mathrm{Gr}_k^\\mathbb C} \\chi(A\\cap E) dE, \\qquad A\\in \\mathcal P (\\mathbb C P^n),</math> where the integration is with respect to the Haar probability measure on <math>\\mathrm{Gr}_k^\\mathbb C</math>, is a smooth valuation. This follows from the work of  Fu<ref name=\"Fu:Kinematic\"> J. H. G. Fu, ''Kinematic formulas in integral geometry''. Indiana Univ. Math. J. '''39''' (1990), no. 4, 1115-1154</ref>.\n\n===Filtration===\nThe space <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> admits no natural grading in general, however it carries a canonical filtration \n<math display=\"block\">\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)= W_0\\supset W_1\\supset \\cdots \\supset W_n.</math> Here <math>W_n</math> consists of the smooth measures on <math>X</math>, and <math>W_j</math> is given by forms <math>\\omega</math> in the ideal generated by <math>\\pi^*\\Omega^j(X)</math>, where <math>\\pi:\\mathbb P_X\\to X</math>.\n\nThe associated graded space <math>\\bigoplus_{i=0}^n W_i/W_{i+1}</math> is canonically isomorphic to the space of smooth sections <math display=\"block\">\\bigoplus_{i=0}^n C^\\infty (X, \\operatorname{Val}_i^\\infty(TX)),</math> where <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^\\infty(TX)</math> denotes the vector bundle over <math>X</math> such that the fiber over a point <math>x\\in X</math> is <math>\\operatorname{Val}_i^\\infty(T_x X)</math>, the space of smooth translation-invariant valuations on the tangent space <math>T_x X</math>.\n\n===Product===\nThe space <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> admits a natural product. This product is continuous, commutative, associative, compatible with the filtration:\n<math display=\"block\"> W_i\\cdot W_j\\subset W_{i+j},</math>\nand has the Euler characteristic as the identity element. It commutes with the restriction to embedded submanifolds, and the diffeomorphism group of <math>X</math> acts on <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(X)</math> by algebra automorphisms. \n\nFor example, if <math>X</math> is Riemannian, the Lipschitz-Killing valuations satisfy \n<math display=\"block\"> V_i^X\\cdot V_j^X= V_{i+j}^X.</math>\n\nThe Alesker-Poincar\u00e9 duality still holds. For compact <math>X</math> it says that the pairing <math> \\mathcal V^\\infty(X)\\times \\mathcal V^\\infty(X)\\to \\mathbb C</math>, <math>(\\phi, \\psi)\\mapsto (\\phi\\cdot\\psi) (X)</math> is non-degenerate. As in the translation-invariant case, this duality can be used to define generalized valuations. Unlike the translation-invariant case, no good definition of continuous valuations exists for valuations on manifolds.\n\nThe product of valuations closely reflects the geometric operation of intersection of subsets.\nInformally, consider the generalized valuation <math>\\chi_A=\\chi(A\\cap\\bullet)</math>. The product is given by <math>\\chi_A\\cdot\\chi_B=\\chi_{A\\cap B}</math>. Now one can obtain smooth valuations by averaging generalized valuations of the form <math>\\chi_A</math>, more precisely <math>\\phi(X)=\\int_S \\chi_{s(A)}ds</math> is a smooth valuation if  <math>S</math> is a sufficiently large measured family of diffeomorphisms. Then one has \n<math display=\"block\">\\int_S \\chi_{s(A)}ds\\cdot \\int_{S'} \\chi_{s'(B)}ds'=\\int_{S\\times S'} \\chi_{s(A)\\cap s'(B)}dsds',</math>\nsee <ref> J. H. G.

If <math>f</math> is an embedding, then \n<math display=\"block\"> (f^* \\phi)(A) = \\phi(f(A)), \\qquad A\\in\\mathcal P (X).</math>\nThe pullback is a morphism of filtered algebras.\nEvery smooth proper submersion <math>f\\colon X\\to Y</math> defines  a pushforward map  <math>f^*\\colon \\mathcal V^\\infty(X) \\to \\mathcal V^\\infty(Y)</math> by \n<math display=\"block\"> (f_* \\phi)(A) = \\phi(f^{-1}(A)), \\qquad A\\in\\mathcal P (Y).</math>  The pushforward is compatible with the filtration as well: <math>f_*:W_i(X)\\to W_{i-(\\dim X-\\dim Y)}(Y)</math>.\nFor general smooth maps, one can define pullback and pushforward for generalized valuations under some restrictions.\n\n==Applications in Integral Geometry==\nLet <math>M</math> be a Riemannian manifold and let <math>G</math> be a Lie group of isometries of <math>M</math> acting transitively on the sphere bundle <math>SM</math>. Under these assumptions the space   <math>\\mathcal V^\\infty(M)^G</math> of <math>G</math>-invariant smooth valuations  on <math>M</math> is finite-dimensional; let <math>\\phi_1, \\ldots, \\phi_m</math> be a basis.  Let <math>A,B\\in \\mathcal P(M)</math> be differentiable polyhedra in <math>M</math>. Then integrals of the form <math>\\int_G \\phi_i(A\\cap gB)dg </math> are expressible as linear combinations of <math>\\phi_k(A)\\phi_l(B)</math> with coefficients <math>c_i^{kl}</math> independent of <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>: {{NumBlk|:|<math display=\"block\"> \\int_G \\phi_i(A\\cap gB)dg =  \\sum_{k,l=1}^m  c_i^{kl}  \\phi_k(A)\\phi_l(B),\\qquad A,B\\in \\mathcal P(M).</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\nFormulas of this type are called ''kinematic formulas''. Their existence in this generality was proved by Fu<ref name=\"Fu:Kinematic/>. For the three simply connected real space forms, i.e., the sphere, Euclidean space, and hyperbolic space, they go back to [[Wilhelm Blaschke|Blaschke]], [[Luis Santal\u00f3|Santal\u00f3]], [[Shiing-Shen Chern|Chern]], and  [[Herbert Federer|Federer]]. \n\nDescribing the kinematic formulas explicitly  is typically a  difficult problem. In fact already in the step from real to complex space forms, considerable difficulties arise and these have  only recently been resolved  by Bernig, Fu, and  Solanes<ref>A. Bernig, J. H. G. Fu, G. Solanes, ''Integral geometry of complex space forms''. Geom. Funct. Anal. '''24''' (2014), no. 2, 403\u2013492.</ref>\n<ref>A. Bernig, J. H. G. Fu, ''Hermitian integral geometry''. Ann. of Math.
