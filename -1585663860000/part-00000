At this moment, soldier rushed in and reported that the enemies were approaching. The chef, knowing he had no time to cook the sheep, cut out ten pieces of thin meat with a knife, and stirred them into boiling water.

There are two versions of how Little Sheep is created in Baotou. One theory is that Zhang Gang developed a method of eating hotpot without cooking, so he opened a hotpot restaurant with a few friends that grew wildly popular. Another theory is that Zhang Gang and a friend had a meal together and found out that the hot pot was delicious and easy to promote, so he spent a lot of money to buy the hot pot base receipt and began to develop the little sheep hot pot. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.795.com.cn/wz/48859.html|title=\u5f20\u94a2\uff0c\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a\u7684\u9910\u996e\u5e1d\u56fd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFinally, Zhang Gang and others worked out a recipe for Little Sheep. Before opening the restaurant, everyone was worried about what to name the restaurant. One day, Zhang Gang casually said \"Little Sheep\", and his daughter-in-law immediately said: \"The name is good, and it is related to mutton lamb. I'm sure I can't forget it after eating, and it's easy to remember.\" And then, \"Little Sheep\" was born.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn August 8, 1999, the first \"Little Sheep\" of the \"Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd.\" was opened at No.22 Wulan Road, Kun District, [[Baotou]]City.

This allows the founders of Little Sheep to see the hope to start the chain-store operation. They started to open more Little Sheep restaurants in out countries in China since April 2000.

In addition, the special smell of raw lamb is not accepted by southerners in China, so lamb mutton was regional. \"Little Sheep\" has made innovations on the basis of traditional\"instant-boiled mutton\", pioneering the method of \"simmering mutton without dipped in ingredients\": a pot-base soup made from dozens of nourishing condiments. By changing cumbersome ingredients, this method removes the special smell of lamb while retaining its delicious flavor.

Xilinguole grassland has become one of the world's four most famous grasslands due to its wide range of types of flora and fauna. Its rich aquatic plants provide sufficient natural food for sheep without supplementary feeding. Xilinguole grassland has high-quality natural grassland area of more than 180,000 square kilometers and a unique geographical position of 45 \u00b0 north latitude, which has created the natural quality of pastures and bred fertile Mongolian sheep, such as well-known \"Wuzhumuqin Sheep(\u4e4c\u73e0\u7a46\u6c81\u7f8a)\", \"Sunite Sheep(\u82cf\u5c3c\u7279\u7f8a)\", and \"Wulatetan Sheep(\u4e4c\u62c9\u7279\u6ee9\u7f8a)\". only six-month-old lamb will be selected, because the meat is fresh and tender, not smelly or stale. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Menu ==\nThe Little Sheep has been serving high-quality lamb, beef, and other specials. Signatures include Lamb-lover Platter, Signature AAA Lamb Rolls, Mongolian Style Roasted Lamb Shank, Premium Beef Cube, Premium Grain Feb Beef New Zealand Origin, Handmade Squid Paste with Fish Caviar, and so on.

Another theory is that Zhang Gang and a friend had a meal together and found out that the hot pot was delicious and easy to promote, so he spent a lot of money to buy the hot pot base receipt and began to develop the little sheep hot pot. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.795.com.cn/wz/48859.html|title=\u5f20\u94a2\uff0c\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a\u7684\u9910\u996e\u5e1d\u56fd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFinally, Zhang Gang and others worked out a recipe for Little Sheep. Before opening the restaurant, everyone was worried about what to name the restaurant. One day, Zhang Gang casually said \"Little Sheep\", and his daughter-in-law immediately said: \"The name is good, and it is related to mutton lamb. I'm sure I can't forget it after eating, and it's easy to remember.\" And then, \"Little Sheep\" was born.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn August 8, 1999, the first \"Little Sheep\" of the \"Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd.\" was opened at No.22 Wulan Road, Kun District, [[Baotou]]City. It is such a small shop. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.795.com.cn/wz/70185.html|title=\u5c0f\u80a5\u7f8a\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b|last=|first=|date=|website=\u77a7\u8fd9\u7f51|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Development ===\nDue to the good operation of the first Little Sheep restaurant, founders successfully opened two Little Sheep Hot Pot restaurants in Qingshan District and Donghe District of Baotou City two months later, and the business was equally well. This allows the founders of Little Sheep to see the hope to start the chain-store operation. They started to open more Little Sheep restaurants in out countries in China since April 2000. In early 2001, the Little Sheep meat product processing base was established.\n\nIn May 2001, [[Shanghai]] branch of Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was established (there are currently 30 direct investment restaurants). \n\nIn January 2002, the [[Beijing]] branch of Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was established (there are currently 15 direct investment restaurants).\n[[File:Little_Sheep_Coquitlam.jpg|thumb|380x380px|Little Sheep in Coquitlam]]\nIn January 2002, [[Shenzhen]] branch of Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was established (there are currently 18 direct investment restaurants). \n\nIn November 2002, Little Sheep Hotpot Store was opened in [[Chengdu]], entered the most competitive hotpot market in China, and challenged Sichuan hotpot brands. It achieved the income record of 170,000 yuan one day. \n\nIn January 2003, the Little Sheep Condiment Base was established.\n\nIn November 2003, Little Sheep's first overseas chain store opened in [[Los Angeles]], USA. \n\nIn September 2004, Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. ranked among the Top 500 Chinese companies.\n\nOn November 12, 2004, \"LITTLE SHEEP\" and its logo were recognized as China Famous [[Trademark|Trade Mark.]]\n\nOn October 12, 2005, the first directly operated store were opened in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]].\n\nIn June 2006, it was again selected as \"China's 500 Most Valuable Brands\" with a brand value of 5.677 billion Yuan.\n\nOn June 22, 2007, Little Sheep was selected for the third time as the \"China's 500 Most Valuable Brands\" and was ranked in 104th place in the Top 500 Chinese companies with a brand value of 5.916 billion Yuan.\n\nOn November 11, 2007, at the fourth annual of Top 100 Chinese Restaurants Awards in [[New York City|New York]], USA, it won three honors: Chinese Best 100 Local Cuisine, Chinese Best 100 New Restaurant, and Chinese Best 100 Healthy Cuisine.\n\nOn June 12, 2008, Inner Mongolia Little Sheep Catering Chain Co., Ltd. was successfully listed in [[Hong Kong]]\n\nUntil January 2010, Little Sheep Company had a total of more than 60,000 employees, drove more than 240,000 people in related employment, and increased more than 200,000 farmers and herdsmen's income.  <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Acquisition by Yum!

By changing cumbersome ingredients, this method removes the special smell of lamb while retaining its delicious flavor.

Xilinguole Grassland(\u9521\u6797\u90ed\u52d2\u8349\u539f) is located in [[Inner Mongolia]]. Xilinguole grassland has become one of the world's four most famous grasslands due to its wide range of types of flora and fauna. Its rich aquatic plants provide sufficient natural food for sheep without supplementary feeding. Xilinguole grassland has high-quality natural grassland area of more than 180,000 square kilometers and a unique geographical position of 45 \u00b0 north latitude, which has created the natural quality of pastures and bred fertile Mongolian sheep, such as well-known \"Wuzhumuqin Sheep(\u4e4c\u73e0\u7a46\u6c81\u7f8a)\", \"Sunite Sheep(\u82cf\u5c3c\u7279\u7f8a)\", and \"Wulatetan Sheep(\u4e4c\u62c9\u7279\u6ee9\u7f8a)\". only six-month-old lamb will be selected, because the meat is fresh and tender, not smelly or stale. <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Menu ==\nThe Little Sheep has been serving high-quality lamb, beef, and other specials. Signatures include Lamb-lover Platter, Signature AAA Lamb Rolls, Mongolian Style Roasted Lamb Shank, Premium Beef Cube, Premium Grain Feb Beef New Zealand Origin, Handmade Squid Paste with Fish Caviar, and so on.

It was recorded and produced by the band and [[Nick Raskulinecz]] at Studio 606 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and was released on August 1, 2006, by [[Roadrunner Records]]. Writing for the album began as early as 2003 when vocalist [[Corey Taylor]] and guitarist [[Jim Root|James Root]] were writing material for their other band, [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]]. In January 2006, Stone Sour began recording their second album, during which time drummer Joel Ekman left the band because of family constraints. He was eventually replaced by ex-[[Soulfly]] drummer [[Roy Mayorga]] who played on all but two tracks on the album.\n\nFollowing the release of the album, Stone Sour promoted it for over a year, releasing five singles and touring in the United States, Canada, Japan and several countries in Europe. The album received generally positive reviews. It was praised for showing a progression in the band's song writing ability and musical style. It was also certified Platinum in the United States and the single \"30/30-150\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 49th Grammy Awards. On June 26, 2007, Stone Sour released a special edition version of the album; it included six previously unreleased tracks and a bonus DVD with three music videos and a complete live performance by the band in [[Moscow]]. It remains their best-selling album to date, mostly due to the success of the single \"[[Through Glass]]\".

It was recorded and produced by the band and [[Nick Raskulinecz]] at Studio 606 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and was released on August 1, 2006, by [[Roadrunner Records]]. Writing for the album began as early as 2003 when vocalist [[Corey Taylor]] and guitarist [[Jim Root|James Root]] were writing material for their other band, [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]]. In January 2006, Stone Sour began recording their second album, during which time drummer Joel Ekman left the band because of family constraints. He was eventually replaced by ex-[[Soulfly]] drummer [[Roy Mayorga]] who played on all but two tracks on the album.\n\nFollowing the release of the album, Stone Sour promoted it for over a year, releasing five singles and touring in the United States, Canada, Japan and several countries in Europe. The album received generally positive reviews. It was praised for showing a progression in the band's song writing ability and musical style. It was also certified Platinum in the United States and the single \"30/30-150\" was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 49th Grammy Awards. On June 26, 2007, Stone Sour released a special edition version of the album; it included six previously unreleased tracks and a bonus DVD with three music videos and a complete live performance by the band in [[Moscow]].

Her husband was Philip of [[House of Ibelin|Ibelin]], seneschal of Cyprus who was sent to prison in Genoa after his murder of Alicia's uncle, King [[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter I]]. She became the mistress of Jean de Moustry, Grand Admiral of Cyprus.\n\n==Family==\nShe was born in Cyprus in 1341, the only child of [[Ferdinand, Viscount of Om\u00e9las]], and Eschive de Lusignan, eldest daughter of King [[Hugh IV of Cyprus]] and [[Alix of Ibelin]]. Her paternal grandfather was [[Ferdinand of Majorca|Ferdinand]], son of King [[James II of Majorca]]. At the time of her birth, her mother was being held in captivity by her grandfather King Hugh as a result of the latter's violent quarrel with Alice's father, Fernando, who had been expelled from the kingdom. The King had accused Ferdinand's mother, Isabella of Ibelin, of having practised [[Witchcraft|sorcery]]. As her father died in exile in Om\u00e9las, sometime between the time of her birth and 1347, Alice never knew him.\n\n==Marriage==\nOn 26 July 1355, she married, as his second wife, one of her kinsmen, Philip of Ibelin, son of Balian. As they were related within the prohibited degrees, a papal dispensation was required for their marriage. Her uncle, who in 1358 had succeeded Hugh IV as King Peter I of Cyprus, was much displeased with Philip's marriage to Alice, who being his niece, was a close member of the Cypriot royal family. The King, in retaliation for Philip's temerity in marrying Alice, banished him from the kingdom. Alice was forcibly detained on the island, and forbidden to follow her husband in exile.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} It is not known whether or not she had any children by Philip.\n\nHer mother had died in 1363 during an outbreak of [[plague (disease)|plague]].

{"title_page": "List of musical symbols", "text_new": "{{short description|none}}\n{{Selfref|For the use of musical symbols on Wikipedia, see [[Help:Musical symbols]].}}\n'''Musical symbols''' are marks and symbols used since about the 13th century in [[musical notation]] of [[sheet music|musical scores]]. Some are used to notate [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[tempo]], [[metre (music)|metre]], [[Duration (music)|duration]] and [[articulation (music)|articulation]] of a [[musical note|note]] or a [[section (music)|passage]] of music. In some cases, symbols provide information about the form of a piece (e.g., how many repeats of a section) or about how to play the note (e.g., with violin family instruments, a note may be bowed or plucked). Some symbols are instrument-specific notation giving the performer information about which finger, hand or foot to use.\n\n==Lines==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px; padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-staff.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staff (music)|Staff]]'''<br />The staff is the fundamental latticework of music notation, on which symbols are placed. The five staff lines and four intervening spaces correspond to pitches of the [[diatonic scale]]; which pitch is meant by a given line or space is defined by the [[clef]]. In British usage, the word \"stave\" is often used.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-ledger.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Ledger line|Ledger or leger lines]]'''<br /> These extend the staff to pitches that fall above or below it. Such ledger lines are placed behind the note heads, and extend a small distance to each side. Multiple ledger lines can be used when necessary to notate pitches even farther above or below the staff.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-bar.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Bar (music)|Bar line]]'''<br />These separate measures (see [[#Time signatures|time signatures]] below for an explanation of ''measures'').

In general contemporary usage the bracket usually connects the staves of separate instruments (e.g., flute and clarinet; two trumpets; etc.) or multiple vocal parts in a choir or ensemble, whereas the ''brace'' connects multiple parts for a ''single'' instrument (e.g., the right-hand and left-hand staves of a piano or harp part).\n|-\n| [[File:Accolade.svg|30px]]\n|'''Brace'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that are played simultaneously in piano, keyboard, harp, or some pitched percussion music.<ref>[https://sites.coloradocollege.edu/musicengraving/engraving-convention/braces-and-bracket/ \"Music Notation and Engraving \u2013 Braces and Bracket], [[Colorado College]] Music Department</ref> Depending on the instruments playing, the brace (occasionally called an '''accolade''' in some old texts) varies in design and style.\n|}\n\n== Clefs ==\n{{main|Clef}}\nClefs define the pitch range, or [[tessitura]], of the staff on which it is placed. A clef is usually the ''leftmost'' symbol on a staff. Additional clefs may appear in the middle of a staff to indicate a change in register for instruments with a wide range. In early music, clefs could be placed on any of several lines on a staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-GClef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[G clef]] ([[Treble clef]])'''<br />The centre of the spiral assigns the second line from the bottom to the pitch G above middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996>{{cite book |page=49 |last1=Gerou |first1=Tom |last2=Lusk |first2=Linda |date=1996 |title=Essential Dictionary of Music Notation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dictionary-Music-Notation-Pocket/dp/0882847309 |publisher=Alfred Music|isbn=0-88284-768-6}}</ref> The treble clef is the most commonly encountered clef in modern notation, and is used for most modern vocal music. Middle C is the first ledger line below the staff here. \n|-\n| [[File:Music-Cclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[C clef]] ([[Alto clef|Alto]], and [[Tenor clef|Tenor]] clefs)'''<br />These clefs point to the line representing middle C. As illustrated here, it makes the ''center line on the staff'' middle C, and is referred to as the \"alto clef\". This clef is used in modern notation for the [[viola]]. While all clefs can be placed anywhere on the staff to indicate various tessitura, the C clef is most often considered a \"movable\" clef: it is frequently seen pointing instead to the fourth line and called a \"tenor clef\". This clef is used very often in music written for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[trombone]], and [[double bass]]; it replaces the bass clef when the number of ledger lines above the bass staff hinders easy reading.<br /> Until the classical era, the C clef was also frequently seen pointing to other lines, mostly in vocal music, but today this has been supplanted by the universal use of the treble and bass clefs. Modern editions of music from such periods generally transpose the original C clef parts to either treble (female voices), octave treble (tenors), or bass clef (tenors and basses). It can be occasionally seen in modern music on the third space (between the third and fourth lines), in which case it has the same function as an octave treble clef. This unusual practice runs the risk of misreading, however, because the traditional function of all clefs is to identify staff lines, not spaces.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-Fclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[F clef]] ([[Bass clef]])'''<br />The line between the dots in this clef denotes F below middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996 /> Positioned here, it makes the ''second line from the top'' of the staff F below middle C, and is called a \"bass clef\". This clef appears nearly as often as the treble clef, especially in choral music, where it represents the bass and baritone voices. Middle C is the first ledger line above the staff here. In old music, particularly vocal scores, this clef is sometimes encountered centered on the third staff line, in which position it is referred to as a ''baritone clef''; this usage has essentially become obsolete.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-unpitchedclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Neutral clef'''<br />Used for pitchless instruments, such as some of those [[percussion notation|used for percussion]]. Each line can represent a specific percussion instrument within a set, such as in a drum set. Two different styles of neutral clefs are pictured here. It may also be drawn with a separate single-line staff for each untuned percussion instrument.\n|-\n| [[File:Octaveclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Octave clef'''<br />Treble and bass clefs can also be modified by octave numbers. An eight or fifteen above a clef raises the intended pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. Similarly, an eight or fifteen below a clef lowers the pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. A treble clef with an eight below is the most commonly used, typically used for guitar and similar instruments, as well as for tenor parts in choral music.\n|-\n| [[File:Tablature.svg|100px]]\n|'''Tablature'''<br />For stringed instruments, such as the guitar, it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB sign is often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the staff is not necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for standard 6-stringed guitars, six lines would be used). Numbers on the lines show which fret to play the string on. This TAB sign, like the percussion clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a clef. Similarly, the horizontal lines do not constitute a staff in the usual sense, because the spaces between the lines in a tablature are never used.\n|}\n\n== Notes and rests ==\n\n{{main|Note value}}\n[[Musical note]] and [[rest (music)|rest]] values are not absolutely defined, but are proportional in duration to all other note and rest values.

In metered music, beams reflect the rhythmic grouping of notes. They may also group short phrases of notes of the same value, regardless of the meter; this is more common in ametrical passages. In older printings of vocal music, beams are often only used when several notes are to be sung on one syllable of the text \u2013 [[melisma]]tic singing; modern notation encourages the use of beaming in a consistent manner with instrumental engraving, and the presence of beams or flags no longer informs the singer about the lyrics. Today, due to the body of music in which traditional metric states are not always assumed, beaming is at the discretion of composers and arrangers, who often use irregular beams to emphasize a particular rhythmic pattern.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dotnote.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Dotted note]]'''<br />Placing a dot to the right of a notehead lengthens the note's duration by one-half. Additional dots lengthen the previous dot instead of the original note, thus a note with one dot is one and one half its original value, a note with two dots is one and three quarters, a note with three dots is one and seven eighths, and so on. Rests can be dotted in the same manner as notes. In other words, ''n'' dots lengthen the note's or rest's original duration ''d'' to {{nowrap|''d'' \u00d7 (2 \u2212 2<sup>''\u2212n''</sup>)}}.\n|-\n| [[File:Ghost note.png]]\n|'''[[Ghost note]]'''<br />A note with a rhythmic value, but no discernible pitch when played. It is represented by a ([[saltire]]) cross (similar to the letter ''x'') for a note head instead of an oval. Composers will primarily use this notation to represent percussive pitches.  This notation is also used in parts where spoken words are used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-measurerest.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Multiple measure rest|Multi-measure rest]]'''<br />Indicates the number of measures in a resting part without a change in meter to conserve space and to simplify notation. Also called ''gathered rest'' or ''multi-bar rest''.\n|}\n\nDurations shorter than the 64th are rare but not unknown. [[Hundred twenty-eighth note|128th notes]] are used by many composers, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]; [[256th note]]s occur in works by Vivaldi, Mozart and Beethoven. An extreme case is the Toccata Grande Cromatica by early-19th-century American composer [[Anthony Philip Heinrich]], which uses note values as short as 2,048ths; however, the context shows clearly that these notes have one beam more than intended, so they should really be 1,024th notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/donbyrd/CMNExtremes.htm|title=Extremes of Conventional Music Notation|last=Byrd|first=Donald|website=donbyrd|date=16 December 2014|access-date=26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe name of very short notes can be formed as {{nowrap|2<sup>''n'' + 2</sup>th}} note, where ''n'' is the number of flags on the note.\n\n== Breaks ==\n{| style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-breath.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Breath mark]]'''<br />This symbol tells the performer to take a breath (or make a slight pause for non-wind instruments).

If no key signature appears, the key is assumed to be C major/A minor, but can also signify a neutral key, employing individual accidentals as required for each note. The key signature examples shown here are described as they would appear on a ''treble'' staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:C-flat-major a-flat-minor.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat key signature'''<br />'''''Lowers''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key.

A common notation for [[quarter tone]]s involves writing the fraction ''{{1/4}}'' next to an arrow pointing up or down. Below are other forms of notation:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-demiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demiflat'''<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by one quarter tone. (Another notation for the demiflat is a flat with a diagonal slash through its stem. In systems where pitches are divided into intervals smaller than a quarter tone, the slashed flat represents a lower note than the reversed flat.)\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat-and-a-half''' (sesquiflat)<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by three [[quarter tone]]s. As with a demiflat, a slashed double-flat symbol is also used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-demisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demisharp'''<br />Raises the pitch of a note by one quarter tone.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Sharp-and-a-half''' (sesquisharp)<br />Raises the pitch of a note by three quarter tones. Occasionally represented with two vertical and three diagonal bars instead.\n|}\n\nA symbol with one vertical and three diagonal bars indicates a sharp with some form of alternate tuning.\n\nIn [[19 equal temperament]], where a whole tone is divided into ''three'' steps instead of two, music is typically notated in a way that flats and sharps are not usually enharmonic (thus a C{{music|#}} represents a third of a step lower than D{{music|b}}); this has the advantage of not requiring any nonstandard notation.\n\n== Time signatures ==\n{{main|Time signature}}\n[[Time signature]]s define the meter of the music. Music is \"marked off\" in uniform sections called bars or measures, and time signatures establish the number of beats in each. This does not necessarily indicate which beats to emphasize, however, so a time signature that conveys information about the way the piece actually sounds is thus chosen. Time signatures tend to ''suggest'' prevailing groupings of beats or pulses.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-timesig.svg|100px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 simple time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 4 represents the crotchet or quarter-note). The top number indicates how many of these note values appear in each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of three crotchets (quarter-notes). For example, {{music|time|3|4}} is pronounced as \"three-four time\" or \"three-quarter time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Compound duple drum pattern.png|200px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 compound time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the ''subdivisions'' of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 8 represents the quaver or eighth-note). The top number indicates how many of these subdivisions appear in each measure. Usually each beat is composed of three subdivisions. To derive the unit of the basic pulse in compound meters, double this value and add a dot, and divide the top number by 3 to determine how many of these pulses there are each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of two dotted crotchets (dotted quarter-notes). This is pronounced as \"Six-Eight Time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Music-commontime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Common time]]'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|4|4}} time. It derives from the broken circle that represented \"imperfect\" duple meter in fourteenth-century [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|mensural time signatures]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-cuttime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Alla breve]] or Cut time'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|2|2}} time, indicating two minim (or half-note) beats per measure. Here, a crotchet (or quarter note) would get half a beat.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-metronome.svg|80px]]\n|'''[[Metronome]] mark'''<br />Written at the start of a score, and at any significant change of tempo, this symbol precisely defines the tempo of the music by assigning absolute durations to all note values within the score. In this particular example, the performer is told that 120 crotchets, or quarter notes, fit into one minute of time. Many publishers precede the marking with letters \"'''M.M.'''\", referring to [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel|Maelzel]]'s [[Metronome]].\n|}\n\n== Note relationships ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tie.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tie (music)|Tie]]'''<br />Indicates that the two (or more) notes joined together are to be played as one note with the time values added together. To be a tie, the notes must be identical \u2013 that is, they must be on the same line or the same space. Otherwise, it is a slur (see below).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-slur.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-legato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Slur (music)|Slur]]'''<br />Indicates to play two or more notes in one physical stroke, one uninterrupted breath, or (on instruments with neither breath nor bow) connected into a phrase as if played in a single breath. In certain contexts, a slur may only indicate to play the notes [[legato]]. In this case, rearticulation is permitted.<br />Slurs and ties are similar in appearance. A tie is distinguishable because it always joins two immediately adjacent notes of the same pitch, whereas a slur may join any number of notes of varying pitches. In vocal music a slur normally indicates that notes grouped together by the slur should be sung to a single syllable.<br />A ''phrase mark'' (or less commonly, ''ligature'') is a mark that is visually identical to a slur, but connects a passage of music over several measures. A phrase mark indicates a musical phrase and may not necessarily require that the music be slurred.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-glissando.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Glissando]]''' or '''[[Portamento]]'''<br />A continuous, unbroken glide from one note to the next that includes the pitches between. Some instruments, such as the trombone, timpani, non-fretted string instruments, electronic instruments, and the human voice can make this glide continuously (portamento), while other instruments such as the piano or mallet instruments blur the discrete pitches between the start and end notes to mimic a continuous slide (glissando).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triplet.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tuplet]]'''<br />A number of notes of irregular duration are performed within the duration of a given number of notes of regular time value; e.g., five notes played in the normal duration of four notes; seven notes played in the normal duration of two; three notes played in the normal duration of four. Tuplets are named according to the number of irregular notes; e.g., duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triad.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Chord (music)|Chord]]'''<br />Several notes sounded simultaneously (\"solid\" or \"block\"), or in succession (\"broken\"). Two-note chords are called a '''[[dyad (music)|dyad]]''' or an [[Interval (music)|'''interval''']]; three-note chords built from generic third intervals are called '''[[triad (music)|triads]]'''. A chord may contain any number of notes.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-arpeggio.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiated]] chord'''<br />A chord with notes played in rapid succession, usually ascending, each note being sustained as the others are played. It is also called a \"broken chord\" or \"rolled chord\".\n|}\n\n== Dynamics ==\n{{main|Dynamics (music)}}\nDynamics are indicators of the relative intensity or volume of a musical line.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music dynamic pianississimo.svg|73px]]\n|'''Pianississimo'''<ref name=ppp group=D>Dynamics with 3 letters (i.e., {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) are often referred to by adding an extra \"iss\" (''pianissimo'' to ''pianississimo'').

For example, \"pianississimo\" (represented as {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}) meaning so softly as to be almost inaudible, and fortississimo, ({{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) meaning extremely loud.  Dynamics are relative, and the meaning of each level is at the discretion of the performer or, in the case of ensembles, the conductor. However, modern legislation to curb high noise levels in the workplace in an effort to prevent damage to musicians' hearing has posed a challenge to the interpretation of very loud dynamics in some large orchestral works, as noise levels within the orchestra itself can easily exceed safe levels when all instruments are playing at full volume<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/arts/music/20noise.html \"No Fortissimo?

Usually applied to quarter notes or shorter. (In the past, this marking\u2019s meaning was more ambiguous: it sometimes was used interchangeably with staccato, and sometimes indicated an accent and not staccato. These usages are now almost defunct, but still appear in some scores.) In string instruments this indicates a bowing technique in which the bow bounces lightly upon the string.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Accent (music)|Accent]] '''<br />Play the note louder, or with a harder attack than surrounding unaccented notes. May appear on notes of any duration.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-tenuto.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tenuto]]'''<br />This symbol indicates ''play the note at its full value, or slightly longer''. It can also indicate a degree of emphasis, especially when combined with dynamic markings to indicate a change in loudness, or combined with a staccato dot to indicate a slight detachment (''[[portato]]'' or ''[[mezzo staccato]]'').\n|-\n| [[File:Music-strong-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Marcato]]'''<br />''Play the note somewhat louder or more forcefully than a note with a regular accent mark'' (open horizontal wedge).

Above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-fermata.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Fermata]] (Pause)'''<br />A note, chord, or rest sustained longer than its customary value. Usually appears over all parts at the same metrical location in a piece, to show a halt in [[tempo]]. It can be placed above or below the note.

When followed by a wavy horizontal line, this symbol indicates an extended, or running, trill. In modern music the trill begins on the main note and ends with the lower [[auxiliary note]] then the main note, which requires a triplet immediately before the turn. In music up to the time of Haydn or Mozart the trill begins on the upper auxiliary note and there is no triplet.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. V,29</ref> In percussion notation, a trill is sometimes used to indicate a tremolo (q.v.).

Placing a vertical line through the turn symbol or inverting it, it indicates an ''inverted turn'', in which the order of the auxiliary notes is reversed.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-appoggiatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Appoggiatura]]'''<br />The first half of the principal note's duration has the pitch of the grace note (the first two-thirds if the principal note is a dotted note).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-acciaccatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Acciaccatura]]'''<br />The acciaccatura is of very brief duration, as though brushed on the way to the principal note, which receives virtually all of its notated duration. In percussion notation, the acciaccatura symbol denotes the [[Flam (drum rudiment)|flam]] rudiment, the miniature note still positioned behind the main note but on the same line or space of the staff. The flam note is usually played just before the natural durational subdivision the main note is played on, with the timing and duration of the main note remaining unchanged. Also known by the English translation of the Italian term, '''crushed note''', and in German as ''Zusammenschlag'' (simultaneous stroke).\n|}\n\n== Octave signs ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-ottavaalta.svg|100px]]\n| '''Ottava'''<br />''8<sup>va</sup>'' (pronounced ''ottava alta'') is placed {{em|above}} the staff (as shown) to tell the musician to play the passage one [[octave]] higher.<br />When this sign (or in recent notation practice, an ''8<sup>vb</sup>'' \u2013 both signs reading ''ottava bassa'') is placed {{em|below}} the staff, it indicates to play the passage one octave lower.<ref>George Heussenstamm, ''The Norton Manual of Music Notation'' (New York and London: W.

If the tremolo is between two notes, then they are played in rapid alternation. The number of slashes through the stem (or number of diagonal bars between two notes) indicates the frequency to repeat (or alternate) the note. As shown here, the note is to be repeated at a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) rate, but it is a common convention for three slashes to be interpreted as \"as fast as possible\", or at any rate at a speed to be left to the player's judgment.<br />In [[percussion notation]], tremolos indicate rolls, [[diddle]]s, and [[Drag (percussion)|drags]]. Typically, a single tremolo line on a sufficiently short note (such as a sixteenth) is played as a drag, and a combination of three stem and tremolo lines indicates a [[double-stroke roll]] (or a [[single-stroke roll]], in the case of [[timpani]], mallet percussions and some untuned percussion instrument such as [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[bass drum]]) for a period equivalent to the duration of the note. In other cases, the interpretation of tremolos is highly variable, and should be examined by the director and performers.<br />The tremolo symbol also represents [[flutter-tonguing]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-repeat.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Repeat sign]]s'''<br />Enclose a passage that is to be played more than once.

On the [[French horn|horn]], this accent indicates a \"stopped note\" (a note played with the stopping hand shoved further into the bell of the horn). In percussion this notation denotes, among many other specific uses, to close the hi-hat by pressing the pedal, or that an instrument is to be \"choked\" (muted with the hand).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-snappizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''Snap pizzicato'''<br />On a stringed instrument, a note played by stretching a string away from the frame of the instrument and letting it go, making it \"snap\" against the frame.

On a valved brass instrument, it means to play the note \"open\" (without lowering any valve, or without mute). In organ notation, this means to play a pedal note with the heel (above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot). In percussion notation this denotes, among many other specific uses, to open the hi-hat by releasing the pedal, or allow an instrument to ring.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-upbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Up bow''' or '''Sull'arco'''<br />On a bowed string instrument, the note is played while drawing the bow upward.

Some are used to notate [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[tempo]], [[metre (music)|metre]], [[Duration (music)|duration]] and [[articulation (music)|articulation]] of a [[musical note|note]] or a [[section (music)|passage]] of music. In some cases, symbols provide information about the form of a piece (e.g., how many repeats of a section) or about how to play the note (e.g., with violin family instruments, a note may be bowed or plucked). Some symbols are instrument-specific notation giving the performer information about which finger, hand or foot to use.\n\n==Lines==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px; padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-staff.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staff (music)|Staff]]'''<br />The staff is the fundamental latticework of music notation, on which symbols are placed. The five staff lines and four intervening spaces correspond to pitches of the [[diatonic scale]]; which pitch is meant by a given line or space is defined by the [[clef]]. In British usage, the word \"stave\" is often used.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-ledger.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Ledger line|Ledger or leger lines]]'''<br /> These extend the staff to pitches that fall above or below it. Such ledger lines are placed behind the note heads, and extend a small distance to each side. Multiple ledger lines can be used when necessary to notate pitches even farther above or below the staff.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-bar.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Bar (music)|Bar line]]'''<br />These separate measures (see [[#Time signatures|time signatures]] below for an explanation of ''measures''). Also used for changes in [[time signature]]. Bar lines are extended to connect multiple staves in certain types of music, such as for keyboard or harp, and in conductor scores, but such extensions are not used for other types of music, such as vocal scores.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-doublebar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Double bar line, Double barline'''<br />These separate two sections of music, or are placed before a change in [[key signature]].\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-endbar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Bold double bar line, Bold double barline'''<br />These indicate the conclusion of a movement or an entire composition.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Music-dottedbar.svg|100px]]\n|'''Dotted bar line, Dotted barline'''<br />Subdivides long measures of complex meter into shorter segments for ease of reading, usually according to natural rhythmic subdivisions.\n|-\n| style=\"padding-bottom:20px;\"|[[File:Staff-bracket.jpg|30px]]\n|'''Bracket'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that sound simultaneously. In general contemporary usage the bracket usually connects the staves of separate instruments (e.g., flute and clarinet; two trumpets; etc.) or multiple vocal parts in a choir or ensemble, whereas the ''brace'' connects multiple parts for a ''single'' instrument (e.g., the right-hand and left-hand staves of a piano or harp part).\n|-\n| [[File:Accolade.svg|30px]]\n|'''Brace'''<br />Connects two or more lines of music that are played simultaneously in piano, keyboard, harp, or some pitched percussion music.<ref>[https://sites.coloradocollege.edu/musicengraving/engraving-convention/braces-and-bracket/ \"Music Notation and Engraving \u2013 Braces and Bracket], [[Colorado College]] Music Department</ref> Depending on the instruments playing, the brace (occasionally called an '''accolade''' in some old texts) varies in design and style.\n|}\n\n== Clefs ==\n{{main|Clef}}\nClefs define the pitch range, or [[tessitura]], of the staff on which it is placed. A clef is usually the ''leftmost'' symbol on a staff. Additional clefs may appear in the middle of a staff to indicate a change in register for instruments with a wide range. In early music, clefs could be placed on any of several lines on a staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-GClef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[G clef]] ([[Treble clef]])'''<br />The centre of the spiral assigns the second line from the bottom to the pitch G above middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996>{{cite book |page=49 |last1=Gerou |first1=Tom |last2=Lusk |first2=Linda |date=1996 |title=Essential Dictionary of Music Notation |url=https://www.amazon.com/Essential-Dictionary-Music-Notation-Pocket/dp/0882847309 |publisher=Alfred Music|isbn=0-88284-768-6}}</ref> The treble clef is the most commonly encountered clef in modern notation, and is used for most modern vocal music. Middle C is the first ledger line below the staff here. \n|-\n| [[File:Music-Cclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[C clef]] ([[Alto clef|Alto]], and [[Tenor clef|Tenor]] clefs)'''<br />These clefs point to the line representing middle C. As illustrated here, it makes the ''center line on the staff'' middle C, and is referred to as the \"alto clef\". This clef is used in modern notation for the [[viola]]. While all clefs can be placed anywhere on the staff to indicate various tessitura, the C clef is most often considered a \"movable\" clef: it is frequently seen pointing instead to the fourth line and called a \"tenor clef\". This clef is used very often in music written for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[trombone]], and [[double bass]]; it replaces the bass clef when the number of ledger lines above the bass staff hinders easy reading.<br /> Until the classical era, the C clef was also frequently seen pointing to other lines, mostly in vocal music, but today this has been supplanted by the universal use of the treble and bass clefs. Modern editions of music from such periods generally transpose the original C clef parts to either treble (female voices), octave treble (tenors), or bass clef (tenors and basses). It can be occasionally seen in modern music on the third space (between the third and fourth lines), in which case it has the same function as an octave treble clef. This unusual practice runs the risk of misreading, however, because the traditional function of all clefs is to identify staff lines, not spaces.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-Fclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[F clef]] ([[Bass clef]])'''<br />The line between the dots in this clef denotes F below middle C.<ref name=Gerou1996 /> Positioned here, it makes the ''second line from the top'' of the staff F below middle C, and is called a \"bass clef\". This clef appears nearly as often as the treble clef, especially in choral music, where it represents the bass and baritone voices. Middle C is the first ledger line above the staff here. In old music, particularly vocal scores, this clef is sometimes encountered centered on the third staff line, in which position it is referred to as a ''baritone clef''; this usage has essentially become obsolete.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-unpitchedclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Neutral clef'''<br />Used for pitchless instruments, such as some of those [[percussion notation|used for percussion]]. Each line can represent a specific percussion instrument within a set, such as in a drum set. Two different styles of neutral clefs are pictured here. It may also be drawn with a separate single-line staff for each untuned percussion instrument.\n|-\n| [[File:Octaveclef.svg|100px]]\n|'''Octave clef'''<br />Treble and bass clefs can also be modified by octave numbers. An eight or fifteen above a clef raises the intended pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. Similarly, an eight or fifteen below a clef lowers the pitch range by one or two octaves respectively. A treble clef with an eight below is the most commonly used, typically used for guitar and similar instruments, as well as for tenor parts in choral music.\n|-\n| [[File:Tablature.svg|100px]]\n|'''Tablature'''<br />For stringed instruments, such as the guitar, it is possible to notate [[tablature]] in place of ordinary notes. In this case, a TAB sign is often written instead of a clef. The number of lines of the staff is not necessarily five: one line is used for each string of the instrument (so, for standard 6-stringed guitars, six lines would be used). Numbers on the lines show which fret to play the string on. This TAB sign, like the percussion clef, is not a clef in the true sense, but rather a symbol employed instead of a clef. Similarly, the horizontal lines do not constitute a staff in the usual sense, because the spaces between the lines in a tablature are never used.\n|}\n\n== Notes and rests ==\n\n{{main|Note value}}\n[[Musical note]] and [[rest (music)|rest]] values are not absolutely defined, but are proportional in duration to all other note and rest values. The whole note is the reference value, and the other notes are named (in American usage) in comparison; i.e., a quarter note is a quarter of the length of a whole note.\n{| style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Note\n!width=*|British name / American name\n! style=\"width:120px;\"|Rest\n|-\n| [[File:Music-octwholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Maxima (music)|Large (Latin: Maxima) / Octuple whole note]]'''<ref name=256th/>\n| [[File:Music-octwholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-quadwholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Longa (music)|Long / Quadruple whole note]]'''<ref name=256th/>\n| [[File:Music-quadwholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-doublewholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Double whole note|Breve / Double whole note]]'''\n| [[File:Music-doublewholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-wholenote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Whole note|Semibreve / Whole note]]'''\n| [[File:Music-wholerest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-halfnote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Half note|Minim / Half note]]'''\n| [[File:Music-halfrest.svg|100px]]\n|-\n| [[File:Music-quarternote.svg|100px]]\n| '''[[Quarter note|Crotchet / Quarter note]]'''<ref>Examples of the older form are found in the work of English music publishers up to the 20th century, e.g., W.

In older printings of vocal music, beams are often only used when several notes are to be sung on one syllable of the text \u2013 [[melisma]]tic singing; modern notation encourages the use of beaming in a consistent manner with instrumental engraving, and the presence of beams or flags no longer informs the singer about the lyrics. Today, due to the body of music in which traditional metric states are not always assumed, beaming is at the discretion of composers and arrangers, who often use irregular beams to emphasize a particular rhythmic pattern.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-dotnote.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Dotted note]]'''<br />Placing a dot to the right of a notehead lengthens the note's duration by one-half. Additional dots lengthen the previous dot instead of the original note, thus a note with one dot is one and one half its original value, a note with two dots is one and three quarters, a note with three dots is one and seven eighths, and so on. Rests can be dotted in the same manner as notes. In other words, ''n'' dots lengthen the note's or rest's original duration ''d'' to {{nowrap|''d'' \u00d7 (2 \u2212 2<sup>''\u2212n''</sup>)}}.\n|-\n| [[File:Ghost note.png]]\n|'''[[Ghost note]]'''<br />A note with a rhythmic value, but no discernible pitch when played. It is represented by a ([[saltire]]) cross (similar to the letter ''x'') for a note head instead of an oval. Composers will primarily use this notation to represent percussive pitches.  This notation is also used in parts where spoken words are used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-measurerest.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Multiple measure rest|Multi-measure rest]]'''<br />Indicates the number of measures in a resting part without a change in meter to conserve space and to simplify notation. Also called ''gathered rest'' or ''multi-bar rest''.\n|}\n\nDurations shorter than the 64th are rare but not unknown. [[Hundred twenty-eighth note|128th notes]] are used by many composers, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]; [[256th note]]s occur in works by Vivaldi, Mozart and Beethoven. An extreme case is the Toccata Grande Cromatica by early-19th-century American composer [[Anthony Philip Heinrich]], which uses note values as short as 2,048ths; however, the context shows clearly that these notes have one beam more than intended, so they should really be 1,024th notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/donbyrd/CMNExtremes.htm|title=Extremes of Conventional Music Notation|last=Byrd|first=Donald|website=donbyrd|date=16 December 2014|access-date=26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe name of very short notes can be formed as {{nowrap|2<sup>''n'' + 2</sup>th}} note, where ''n'' is the number of flags on the note.\n\n== Breaks ==\n{| style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-breath.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Breath mark]]'''<br />This symbol tells the performer to take a breath (or make a slight pause for non-wind instruments).

Usually used when the note to modify is already sharpened by the key signature.\n|}\n\n===Key signatures===\n[[Key signature]]s define the prevailing [[Key (music)|key]] of the music that follows, thus avoiding the use of accidentals for many notes. If no key signature appears, the key is assumed to be C major/A minor, but can also signify a neutral key, employing individual accidentals as required for each note. The key signature examples shown here are described as they would appear on a ''treble'' staff.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:C-flat-major a-flat-minor.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat key signature'''<br />'''''Lowers''''' by a semitone the pitch of notes on the corresponding line or space, and all octaves thereof, thus defining the prevailing major or minor key. Different keys are defined by the number of flats in the key signature, starting with the leftmost, i.e., B{{music|\u266d}}, and proceeding to the right; for example, if only the first two flats are used, the key is B{{music|\u266d}} major/G minor, and all B's and E's are \"flatted\" (US) or \"flattened\" (UK), i.e., lowered to B{{music|\u266d}} and E{{music|\u266d}}.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958.

Different keys are defined by the number of sharps in the key signature, also proceeding from left to right; for example, if only the first four sharps are used, the key is E major/C{{music|\u266f}} minor, and the corresponding pitches are raised.\n|}\n\n=== Quarter tones ===\nThere is no universally accepted notation for [[microtonal music]], with varying systems being used depending on the situation. A common notation for [[quarter tone]]s involves writing the fraction ''{{1/4}}'' next to an arrow pointing up or down. Below are other forms of notation:\n\n{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-demiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demiflat'''<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by one quarter tone. (Another notation for the demiflat is a flat with a diagonal slash through its stem. In systems where pitches are divided into intervals smaller than a quarter tone, the slashed flat represents a lower note than the reversed flat.)\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquiflat.svg|100px]]\n|'''Flat-and-a-half''' (sesquiflat)<br />Lowers the pitch of a note by three [[quarter tone]]s. As with a demiflat, a slashed double-flat symbol is also used.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-demisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Demisharp'''<br />Raises the pitch of a note by one quarter tone.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-sesquisharp.svg|100px]]\n|'''Sharp-and-a-half''' (sesquisharp)<br />Raises the pitch of a note by three quarter tones. Occasionally represented with two vertical and three diagonal bars instead.\n|}\n\nA symbol with one vertical and three diagonal bars indicates a sharp with some form of alternate tuning.\n\nIn [[19 equal temperament]], where a whole tone is divided into ''three'' steps instead of two, music is typically notated in a way that flats and sharps are not usually enharmonic (thus a C{{music|#}} represents a third of a step lower than D{{music|b}}); this has the advantage of not requiring any nonstandard notation.\n\n== Time signatures ==\n{{main|Time signature}}\n[[Time signature]]s define the meter of the music. Music is \"marked off\" in uniform sections called bars or measures, and time signatures establish the number of beats in each. This does not necessarily indicate which beats to emphasize, however, so a time signature that conveys information about the way the piece actually sounds is thus chosen. Time signatures tend to ''suggest'' prevailing groupings of beats or pulses.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-timesig.svg|100px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 simple time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 4 represents the crotchet or quarter-note). The top number indicates how many of these note values appear in each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of three crotchets (quarter-notes). For example, {{music|time|3|4}} is pronounced as \"three-four time\" or \"three-quarter time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Compound duple drum pattern.png|200px]]\n|'''Specific time \u2013 compound time signatures'''<br />The bottom number represents the note value of the ''subdivisions'' of the basic pulse of the music (in this case the 8 represents the quaver or eighth-note). The top number indicates how many of these subdivisions appear in each measure. Usually each beat is composed of three subdivisions. To derive the unit of the basic pulse in compound meters, double this value and add a dot, and divide the top number by 3 to determine how many of these pulses there are each measure. This example announces that each measure is the equivalent length of two dotted crotchets (dotted quarter-notes). This is pronounced as \"Six-Eight Time\".\n|-\n| [[File:Music-commontime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Common time]]'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|4|4}} time. It derives from the broken circle that represented \"imperfect\" duple meter in fourteenth-century [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|mensural time signatures]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-cuttime.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Alla breve]] or Cut time'''<br />This symbol represents {{music|time|2|2}} time, indicating two minim (or half-note) beats per measure. Here, a crotchet (or quarter note) would get half a beat.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-metronome.svg|80px]]\n|'''[[Metronome]] mark'''<br />Written at the start of a score, and at any significant change of tempo, this symbol precisely defines the tempo of the music by assigning absolute durations to all note values within the score. In this particular example, the performer is told that 120 crotchets, or quarter notes, fit into one minute of time. Many publishers precede the marking with letters \"'''M.M.'''\", referring to [[Johann Nepomuk Maelzel|Maelzel]]'s [[Metronome]].\n|}\n\n== Note relationships ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-tie.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tie (music)|Tie]]'''<br />Indicates that the two (or more) notes joined together are to be played as one note with the time values added together. To be a tie, the notes must be identical \u2013 that is, they must be on the same line or the same space. Otherwise, it is a slur (see below).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-slur.svg|100px]]<br />[[File:Music-legato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Slur (music)|Slur]]'''<br />Indicates to play two or more notes in one physical stroke, one uninterrupted breath, or (on instruments with neither breath nor bow) connected into a phrase as if played in a single breath. In certain contexts, a slur may only indicate to play the notes [[legato]]. In this case, rearticulation is permitted.<br />Slurs and ties are similar in appearance. A tie is distinguishable because it always joins two immediately adjacent notes of the same pitch, whereas a slur may join any number of notes of varying pitches. In vocal music a slur normally indicates that notes grouped together by the slur should be sung to a single syllable.<br />A ''phrase mark'' (or less commonly, ''ligature'') is a mark that is visually identical to a slur, but connects a passage of music over several measures. A phrase mark indicates a musical phrase and may not necessarily require that the music be slurred.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-glissando.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Glissando]]''' or '''[[Portamento]]'''<br />A continuous, unbroken glide from one note to the next that includes the pitches between. Some instruments, such as the trombone, timpani, non-fretted string instruments, electronic instruments, and the human voice can make this glide continuously (portamento), while other instruments such as the piano or mallet instruments blur the discrete pitches between the start and end notes to mimic a continuous slide (glissando).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triplet.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tuplet]]'''<br />A number of notes of irregular duration are performed within the duration of a given number of notes of regular time value; e.g., five notes played in the normal duration of four notes; seven notes played in the normal duration of two; three notes played in the normal duration of four. Tuplets are named according to the number of irregular notes; e.g., duplets, triplets, quadruplets, etc.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-triad.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Chord (music)|Chord]]'''<br />Several notes sounded simultaneously (\"solid\" or \"block\"), or in succession (\"broken\"). Two-note chords are called a '''[[dyad (music)|dyad]]''' or an [[Interval (music)|'''interval''']]; three-note chords built from generic third intervals are called '''[[triad (music)|triads]]'''. A chord may contain any number of notes.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-arpeggio.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Arpeggio|Arpeggiated]] chord'''<br />A chord with notes played in rapid succession, usually ascending, each note being sustained as the others are played. It is also called a \"broken chord\" or \"rolled chord\".\n|}\n\n== Dynamics ==\n{{main|Dynamics (music)}}\nDynamics are indicators of the relative intensity or volume of a musical line.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music dynamic pianississimo.svg|73px]]\n|'''Pianississimo'''<ref name=ppp group=D>Dynamics with 3 letters (i.e., {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) are often referred to by adding an extra \"iss\" (''pianissimo'' to ''pianississimo'').

For example, \"pianississimo\" (represented as {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}) meaning so softly as to be almost inaudible, and fortississimo, ({{serif|'''''fff'''''}}) meaning extremely loud.  Dynamics are relative, and the meaning of each level is at the discretion of the performer or, in the case of ensembles, the conductor. However, modern legislation to curb high noise levels in the workplace in an effort to prevent damage to musicians' hearing has posed a challenge to the interpretation of very loud dynamics in some large orchestral works, as noise levels within the orchestra itself can easily exceed safe levels when all instruments are playing at full volume<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/arts/music/20noise.html \"No Fortissimo?

Subito is commonly used with sforzandos, but can appear with all other dynamic notations, most commonly as {{serif|'''''sff'''''}} (subitofortissimo) or {{serif|'''''spp'''''}} (subitopianissimo).\n\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-forte-piano.png|50px]]\n|'''[[Fortepiano (musical dynamic)|Forte-piano]]'''<br />A section of music in which the music should initially be played loudly (forte), then immediately softly (piano).\n|}\n\nAnother value that rarely appears is ''[[niente]]'' or {{serif|'''''n'''''}}, which means \"nothing\". This may be used at the end of a diminuendo to indicate \"fade out to nothing\".\n\n== Articulation marks ==\n[[Articulation (music)|Articulations]] (or [[Accent (music)|accents]]) specify how to perform individual notes within a phrase or passage. They can be fine-tuned by combining more than one such symbol over or under a note. They may also appear in conjunction with phrasing marks listed above.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-staccato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccato]]'''<br />This indicates the musician should ''play the note shorter than notated'', usually half the value; the rest of the metric value is then silent. Staccato marks may appear on notes of any value, shortening their performed duration without speeding the music itself.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-staccatissimo.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Staccatissimo]]''' or '''[[Spiccato]]'''<br />Indicates a ''longer silence after the note'' (as described above), making the note very short. Usually applied to quarter notes or shorter. (In the past, this marking\u2019s meaning was more ambiguous: it sometimes was used interchangeably with staccato, and sometimes indicated an accent and not staccato. These usages are now almost defunct, but still appear in some scores.) In string instruments this indicates a bowing technique in which the bow bounces lightly upon the string.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Accent (music)|Accent]] '''<br />Play the note louder, or with a harder attack than surrounding unaccented notes. May appear on notes of any duration.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-tenuto.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Tenuto]]'''<br />This symbol indicates ''play the note at its full value, or slightly longer''. It can also indicate a degree of emphasis, especially when combined with dynamic markings to indicate a change in loudness, or combined with a staccato dot to indicate a slight detachment (''[[portato]]'' or ''[[mezzo staccato]]'').\n|-\n| [[File:Music-strong-marcato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Marcato]]'''<br />''Play the note somewhat louder or more forcefully than a note with a regular accent mark'' (open horizontal wedge).

Above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-fermata.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Fermata]] (Pause)'''<br />A note, chord, or rest sustained longer than its customary value. Usually appears over all parts at the same metrical location in a piece, to show a halt in [[tempo]]. It can be placed above or below the note. The fermata is held for as long as the performer or conductor desires, but is often set as twice the notes' original value.\n|}\n\n== Ornaments ==\nOrnaments modify the pitch pattern of individual notes.\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| [[File:Music-trill.svg|100px]][[File:Music-pizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Trill (music)|Trill]]'''<br />A rapid alternation between the specified note and the next higher note (according to key signature) within its duration, also called a \"shake\". When followed by a wavy horizontal line, this symbol indicates an extended, or running, trill. In modern music the trill begins on the main note and ends with the lower [[auxiliary note]] then the main note, which requires a triplet immediately before the turn. In music up to the time of Haydn or Mozart the trill begins on the upper auxiliary note and there is no triplet.<ref>''Rudiments and Theory of Music'' Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, London 1958. V,29</ref> In percussion notation, a trill is sometimes used to indicate a tremolo (q.v.).

In most music, the mordent begins on the auxiliary note, and the alternation between the two notes may be extended. In [[handbells]], this symbol is a \"shake\" and indicates the rapid shaking of the bells for the duration of the note.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-inverted-mordent.svg|100px]]\n|'''Lower mordent (inverted)'''<br />Rapidly play the principal note, the note below it, then return to the principal note for the remaining duration.

When placed to the right of the note, the principal note is played first, followed by the above pattern. Placing a vertical line through the turn symbol or inverting it, it indicates an ''inverted turn'', in which the order of the auxiliary notes is reversed.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-appoggiatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Appoggiatura]]'''<br />The first half of the principal note's duration has the pitch of the grace note (the first two-thirds if the principal note is a dotted note).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-acciaccatura.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Acciaccatura]]'''<br />The acciaccatura is of very brief duration, as though brushed on the way to the principal note, which receives virtually all of its notated duration. In percussion notation, the acciaccatura symbol denotes the [[Flam (drum rudiment)|flam]] rudiment, the miniature note still positioned behind the main note but on the same line or space of the staff. The flam note is usually played just before the natural durational subdivision the main note is played on, with the timing and duration of the main note remaining unchanged. Also known by the English translation of the Italian term, '''crushed note''', and in German as ''Zusammenschlag'' (simultaneous stroke).\n|}\n\n== Octave signs ==\n{|\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Music-ottavaalta.svg|100px]]\n| '''Ottava'''<br />''8<sup>va</sup>'' (pronounced ''ottava alta'') is placed {{em|above}} the staff (as shown) to tell the musician to play the passage one [[octave]] higher.<br />When this sign (or in recent notation practice, an ''8<sup>vb</sup>'' \u2013 both signs reading ''ottava bassa'') is placed {{em|below}} the staff, it indicates to play the passage one octave lower.<ref>George Heussenstamm, ''The Norton Manual of Music Notation'' (New York and London: W.

If the tremolo is between two notes, then they are played in rapid alternation. The number of slashes through the stem (or number of diagonal bars between two notes) indicates the frequency to repeat (or alternate) the note. As shown here, the note is to be repeated at a demisemiquaver (thirty-second note) rate, but it is a common convention for three slashes to be interpreted as \"as fast as possible\", or at any rate at a speed to be left to the player's judgment.<br />In [[percussion notation]], tremolos indicate rolls, [[diddle]]s, and [[Drag (percussion)|drags]]. Typically, a single tremolo line on a sufficiently short note (such as a sixteenth) is played as a drag, and a combination of three stem and tremolo lines indicates a [[double-stroke roll]] (or a [[single-stroke roll]], in the case of [[timpani]], mallet percussions and some untuned percussion instrument such as [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[bass drum]]) for a period equivalent to the duration of the note. In other cases, the interpretation of tremolos is highly variable, and should be examined by the director and performers.<br />The tremolo symbol also represents [[flutter-tonguing]].\n|-\n| [[File:Music-repeat.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Repeat sign]]s'''<br />Enclose a passage that is to be played more than once.

In percussion this notation denotes, among many other specific uses, to close the hi-hat by pressing the pedal, or that an instrument is to be \"choked\" (muted with the hand).\n|-\n| [[File:Music-snappizzicato.svg|100px]]\n|'''Snap pizzicato'''<br />On a stringed instrument, a note played by stretching a string away from the frame of the instrument and letting it go, making it \"snap\" against the frame. Also known as a [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|Bart\u00f3k]] pizzicato.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-harmonic.svg|100px]]\n|'''[[Harmonic#Harmonics on stringed instruments|Natural harmonic]]''' or '''Open note'''<br />On a stringed instrument, means to play a natural harmonic (also called '''flageolet'''). On a valved brass instrument, it means to play the note \"open\" (without lowering any valve, or without mute). In organ notation, this means to play a pedal note with the heel (above the note, use the right foot; below the note, use the left foot). In percussion notation this denotes, among many other specific uses, to open the hi-hat by releasing the pedal, or allow an instrument to ring.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-upbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Up bow''' or '''Sull'arco'''<br />On a bowed string instrument, the note is played while drawing the bow upward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with an upstroke.\n|-\n| [[File:Music-downbow.svg|100px]]\n|'''Down bow''' or '''Gi\u00f9 arco'''<br />Like ''sull'arco'', except the bow is drawn downward. On a plucked string instrument played with a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] (such as a [[guitar]] played [[Flatpicking|pickstyle]] or a [[mandolin]]), the note is played with a downstroke.\n|}\n\n=== Guitar ===\n\nThe guitar has a [[fingerpicking]] notation system derived from the names of the fingers in Spanish or Latin.

''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. [[AK Press]]. p. 5</ref> Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be initiated by small cohesive elite group through acts of violence, or \"[[propaganda by the deed]]\", which would inspire the workers to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.<ref name=\"Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54\"/> Workers would be compensated for their work on the basis of the amount of time they contributed to production, rather than goods being distributed \"according to need\" as in anarcho-communism. Although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labor, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.<ref>Bakunin's associate, [[James Guillaume]], put it this way in his essay, ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm Ideas on Social Organization]''(1876): {{quotation|When... production comes to outstrip consumption... [e]veryone will draw what he needs from the abundant social reserve of commodities, without fear of depletion; and the moral sentiment which will be more highly developed among free and equal workers will prevent, or greatly reduce, abuse and waste.}}</ref> Collective anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]], but it opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite Marxism striving for a collectivist stateless society.<ref>Bakunin, Mikhail; ''[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm Statism and Anarchism]'': {{quotation|They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&nbsp;\u2013 their dictatorship, of course&nbsp;\u2013 can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}</ref>\n\nSome collectivist anarchists do not oppose the use of currency. Some support workers being paid based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase commodities in a communal market.<ref>Bakunin, Mikhail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369</ref> This contrasts with [[anarcho-communism]] where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods \"to each according to his need\". Many modern-day collectivist anarchists hold their form of anarchism as a permanent society rather than a carryover to anarcho-communism or a gift economy. Some collectivist anarchists such as proponents of [[participatory economics]] believe in [[remuneration]] and a form of credit but do not believe in money or markets.\n\nAlthough collectivist anarchism shares many similarities with anarchist communism, there are also many key differences between them. For example, collectivist anarchists believe that the economy and most or all property should be collectively owned by society while anarchist communists by contrast believe that the concept of ownership should be rejected by society and replaced with the concept of usage.<ref>Alexander Beckman. What is Anarchism?, p. 217</ref> Also [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchists]] often favor using a form of currency to compensate workers according to the amount of time spent contributing to society and production while anarcho-communists believe that currency and wages should be abolished all together and goods should be distributed \"[[From each according to his ability to each according to his need|to each according to his or her need\"]].\n\n==== Anarcho-communism ====\n{{main|Anarcho-communism}}\n{{anarcho-communism sidebar}}\n[[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter Kropotkin]], who believed that in anarchy workers would spontaneously self-organize to produce goods in common for all society]]\n[[Anarcho-communism]] is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Market (economics)|markets]], [[money]], [[private property]] (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]) and capitalism in favor of [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]],<ref name=Mayne>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&pg=PA131&dq=Communist+anarchism+belives+in+collective+ownership |title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms |first=Alan James |last=Mayne |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=1999 |accessdate=2010-09-20|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jeiudz5sBV4C&pg=PA14 |title=Anarchism for Know-It-Alls|publisher=Filiquarian Publishing|year=2008|accessdate=20 September 2010|isbn=978-1-59986-218-7}}</ref> [[direct democracy]] and a horizontal network of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \"[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]\".<ref>Fabbri, Luigi. \"Anarchism and Communism.\" Northeastern Anarchist No. 4. 1922. 13 October 2002. http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/worldwidemovements/fabbrianarandcom.html</ref><ref>Makhno, Mett, Arshinov, Valevski, Linski (Dielo Trouda). \"The Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists\". 1926.

Anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late 19th century by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles. Anarcha-feminists are especially critical of marriage. For instance, the feminist anarchist Emma Goldman has argued that marriage is a purely economic arrangement and that \"[woman] pays for it with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life\".<ref>Goldman, \"Marriage and Love\", ''Red Emma Speaks'', p. 205</ref>\n\nAnarcha-feminists also often criticize the views of some of the traditional anarchists such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]] who have believed that patriarchy is only a minor problem and is dependent only on the existence of the state and capitalism and will disappear soon after such institutions are abolished. Anarcha-feminists by contrast view patriarchy as a fundamental problem in society and believe that the feminist struggle against sexism and patriarchy is an essential component of the anarchist struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]] and capitalism.

While many anarchists during the 19th century embraced [[propaganda of the deed]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and other anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change. Tolstoy argued that anarchism must by nature be nonviolent, since it is by definition opposition to coercion and force and that since the state is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic.  His philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by Gandhi, an [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] leader and pacifist who self-identified as an anarchist.

By its very nature, post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric.

More heavily focused on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, [[syndicalism]] posits radical trade unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically self-managed by the workers. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions.

Anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to communist or collectivist anarchism. Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution.

Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of the socialism off Karl Marg\".

''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. [[AK Press]]. p. 5</ref> Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. This was to be initiated by small cohesive elite group through acts of violence, or \"[[propaganda by the deed]]\", which would inspire the workers to revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production.<ref name=\"Patsouras, Louis 2005. p. 54\"/> Workers would be compensated for their work on the basis of the amount of time they contributed to production, rather than goods being distributed \"according to need\" as in anarcho-communism. Although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labor, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.<ref>Bakunin's associate, [[James Guillaume]], put it this way in his essay, ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm Ideas on Social Organization]''(1876): {{quotation|When... production comes to outstrip consumption... [e]veryone will draw what he needs from the abundant social reserve of commodities, without fear of depletion; and the moral sentiment which will be more highly developed among free and equal workers will prevent, or greatly reduce, abuse and waste.}}</ref> Collective anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]], but it opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] despite Marxism striving for a collectivist stateless society.<ref>Bakunin, Mikhail; ''[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm Statism and Anarchism]'': {{quotation|They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship&nbsp;\u2013 their dictatorship, of course&nbsp;\u2013 can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up.}}</ref>\n\nSome collectivist anarchists do not oppose the use of currency. Some support workers being paid based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase commodities in a communal market.<ref>Bakunin, Mikhail. Bakunin on Anarchism. Black Rose Books. 1980. p. 369</ref> This contrasts with [[anarcho-communism]] where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods \"to each according to his need\". Many modern-day collectivist anarchists hold their form of anarchism as a permanent society rather than a carryover to anarcho-communism or a gift economy. Some collectivist anarchists such as proponents of [[participatory economics]] believe in [[remuneration]] and a form of credit but do not believe in money or markets.\n\nAlthough collectivist anarchism shares many similarities with anarchist communism, there are also many key differences between them. For example, collectivist anarchists believe that the economy and most or all property should be collectively owned by society while anarchist communists by contrast believe that the concept of ownership should be rejected by society and replaced with the concept of usage.<ref>Alexander Beckman. What is Anarchism?, p. 217</ref> Also [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchists]] often favor using a form of currency to compensate workers according to the amount of time spent contributing to society and production while anarcho-communists believe that currency and wages should be abolished all together and goods should be distributed \"[[From each according to his ability to each according to his need|to each according to his or her need\"]].\n\n==== Anarcho-communism ====\n{{main|Anarcho-communism}}\n{{anarcho-communism sidebar}}\n[[File:Peter Kropotkin circa 1900.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter Kropotkin]], who believed that in anarchy workers would spontaneously self-organize to produce goods in common for all society]]\n[[Anarcho-communism]] is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[Market (economics)|markets]], [[money]], [[private property]] (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]) and capitalism in favor of [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]],<ref name=Mayne>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&pg=PA131&dq=Communist+anarchism+belives+in+collective+ownership |title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms |first=Alan James |last=Mayne |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=1999 |accessdate=2010-09-20|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jeiudz5sBV4C&pg=PA14 |title=Anarchism for Know-It-Alls|publisher=Filiquarian Publishing|year=2008|accessdate=20 September 2010|isbn=978-1-59986-218-7}}</ref> [[direct democracy]] and a horizontal network of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \"[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]\".<ref>Fabbri, Luigi. \"Anarchism and Communism.\" Northeastern Anarchist No. 4. 1922. 13 October 2002. http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/worldwidemovements/fabbrianarandcom.html</ref><ref>Makhno, Mett, Arshinov, Valevski, Linski (Dielo Trouda). \"The Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists\". 1926.

Anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late 19th century by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and gender roles. Anarcha-feminists are especially critical of marriage. For instance, the feminist anarchist Emma Goldman has argued that marriage is a purely economic arrangement and that \"[woman] pays for it with her name, her privacy, her self-respect, her very life\".<ref>Goldman, \"Marriage and Love\", ''Red Emma Speaks'', p. 205</ref>\n\nAnarcha-feminists also often criticize the views of some of the traditional anarchists such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]] who have believed that patriarchy is only a minor problem and is dependent only on the existence of the state and capitalism and will disappear soon after such institutions are abolished. Anarcha-feminists by contrast view patriarchy as a fundamental problem in society and believe that the feminist struggle against sexism and patriarchy is an essential component of the anarchist struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]] and capitalism. As [[L. Susan Brown|Susan Brown]] puts it, \"as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist\".<ref>Brown, Susan. \"Beyond Feminism:  Anarchism and Human Freedom\" 'Anarchist Papers 3' Black Rose Books (1990) p. 208</ref>\n\n=== Anarcho-pacifism ===\n{{main|Anarcho-pacifism}}\n[[File:Benjamin D.

While many anarchists during the 19th century embraced [[propaganda of the deed]], [[Leo Tolstoy]] and other anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change. Tolstoy argued that anarchism must by nature be nonviolent, since it is by definition opposition to coercion and force and that since the state is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic.  His philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by Gandhi, an [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] leader and pacifist who self-identified as an anarchist.

Although it first received popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'', it has taken on a life of its own subsequent to Newman's use of the term and a wide range of ideas including [[post-modernism]], [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[Situationist International|situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and [[Zapatismo]]. By its very nature, post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Lewis Call]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]] and [[Michel Onfray]].\n\n=== Post-left anarchy ===\n{{main|Post-left anarchy}}\n[[File:Bob Black (2011 BAAB).JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Bob Black]], writer associated to post-left anarchism]]\n[[Post-left anarchy]] is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional [[Left-wing politics|leftism]].

More heavily focused on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, [[syndicalism]] posits radical trade unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically self-managed by the workers. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Important principles of syndicalism include workers' solidarity, [[direct action]] (such as [[general strike]]s and [[recovered factory|workplace recuperations]]) and [[workers' self-management]].\n\nAnarcho-syndicalism and other branches of anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to communist or collectivist anarchism. Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution. According to the writers of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'', anarcho-syndicalist economic systems often take the form of either a [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] economic system or an [[Anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] economic system.<ref name=\"faq-social\"/>\n\n[[Rudolf Rocker]] is considered a leading anarcho-syndicalist theorist.<ref name=\"faq-social\"/> He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarchosyndicalism''.<ref>[http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html ''Anarchosyndicalism'' by Rudolph Rocker] '.' Retrieved 7 September 2006.</ref> Although more frequently associated with labor struggles of the early 20th century (particularly in [[Anarchism in France|France]] and [[Anarchism in Spain|Spain]]), many syndicalist organizations are active today, including the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden|SAC]] in Sweden, the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|USI]] in Italy and the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in Spain.
