Ward managed to drive the small Mexican force away and decided to stay the night to rest his men.\n\nOn March 14, 1836, Ward and King were attacked by Urrea and more than 200 Mexican soldiers as they were about to leave. This detachment was part of Urrea's larger force of nearly 1,200 men. The same day, General Houston ordered Fannin to retreat to [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]]. Fannin sent word to the men at Refugio to rendezvous with his command at Victoria.

The column had traveled about 6 miles when Fannin ordered a halt to rest his animals. At about 3 pm, Mexican cavalry appeared. The Texians immediately formed a [[Infantry square|hollow square]] with their wagons and cannon placed in each corner for defense as Gen. Urrea's forces attacked. After a fierce battle, the Mexicans lost about 100 to 200 killed and wounded; Texian losses were seven to nine killed and 60 wounded. Facing overwhelming odds, though, Fannin and his troops surrendered the next day, at the [[Battle of Coleto]].<ref name=hardin173>Hardin (1994), p. 173</ref>\n\n==The Goliad massacre==\n{{Main article|Goliad massacre}}\nThe Mexicans took the Texans back to Goliad, where they were held as prisoners at Fort Defiance. The Texans thought they would likely be set free in a few weeks. General Urrea left Goliad, leaving command to Colonel Jose Nicolas de la Portilla. Urrea wrote to Santa Anna to ask for clemency for the Texans.  Urrea wrote in his diary that he \"... wished to elude these orders as far as possible without compromising my personal responsibility.\" On March 26, 1836, 19:00, Santa Anna ordered Portilla to execute the prisoners.<ref name=hardin173/>\n\nThe next day, [[Palm Sunday]], March 27, 1836, Colonel Portilla had 400 Texans marched out of Fort Defiance into three columns on the Bexar Road, San Patricio Road, and Victoria Road. They were shot point blank, between two rows of Mexican soldiers, and any survivors were clubbed or knifed to death.<ref name=hardin173/>\n\nThe 40 wounded men who could not walk were executed inside the fort compound. Fannin was the last to be executed, after seeing his men killed. He was taken by Mexican soldiers to the courtyard in front of the chapel, blindfolded, and seated in a chair (due to his leg wound from the battle). He made three requests: he asked for his personal possessions to be sent to his family, to be shot in his heart and not his face, and to be given a Christian burial. The soldiers took his belongings, shot him in the face, and burned Fannin's body along with the other Texans who died that day.<ref name=hardin174>Hardin (1994), p. 174</ref><ref>[http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm \"Frequently Asked Questions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309031543/http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm |date=March 9, 2013 }}, Presidio La Bahia</ref>\n\nTwenty-eight Texans escaped by feigning death and other means.

Fannin sent Lieutenant Colonel [[William Ward (Texas)|William Ward]] and about 120 men to King's aid. Ward managed to drive the small Mexican force away and decided to stay the night to rest his men.\n\nOn March 14, 1836, Ward and King were attacked by Urrea and more than 200 Mexican soldiers as they were about to leave. This detachment was part of Urrea's larger force of nearly 1,200 men. The same day, General Houston ordered Fannin to retreat to [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]]. Fannin sent word to the men at Refugio to rendezvous with his command at Victoria.

The column had traveled about 6 miles when Fannin ordered a halt to rest his animals. At about 3 pm, Mexican cavalry appeared. The Texians immediately formed a [[Infantry square|hollow square]] with their wagons and cannon placed in each corner for defense as Gen. Urrea's forces attacked. After a fierce battle, the Mexicans lost about 100 to 200 killed and wounded; Texian losses were seven to nine killed and 60 wounded. Facing overwhelming odds, though, Fannin and his troops surrendered the next day, at the [[Battle of Coleto]].<ref name=hardin173>Hardin (1994), p. 173</ref>\n\n==The Goliad massacre==\n{{Main article|Goliad massacre}}\nThe Mexicans took the Texans back to Goliad, where they were held as prisoners at Fort Defiance. The Texans thought they would likely be set free in a few weeks. General Urrea left Goliad, leaving command to Colonel Jose Nicolas de la Portilla. Urrea wrote to Santa Anna to ask for clemency for the Texans.  Urrea wrote in his diary that he \"... wished to elude these orders as far as possible without compromising my personal responsibility.\" On March 26, 1836, 19:00, Santa Anna ordered Portilla to execute the prisoners.<ref name=hardin173/>\n\nThe next day, [[Palm Sunday]], March 27, 1836, Colonel Portilla had 400 Texans marched out of Fort Defiance into three columns on the Bexar Road, San Patricio Road, and Victoria Road. They were shot point blank, between two rows of Mexican soldiers, and any survivors were clubbed or knifed to death.<ref name=hardin173/>\n\nThe 40 wounded men who could not walk were executed inside the fort compound. Fannin was the last to be executed, after seeing his men killed. He was taken by Mexican soldiers to the courtyard in front of the chapel, blindfolded, and seated in a chair (due to his leg wound from the battle). He made three requests: he asked for his personal possessions to be sent to his family, to be shot in his heart and not his face, and to be given a Christian burial. The soldiers took his belongings, shot him in the face, and burned Fannin's body along with the other Texans who died that day.<ref name=hardin174>Hardin (1994), p. 174</ref><ref>[http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm \"Frequently Asked Questions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309031543/http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm |date=March 9, 2013 }}, Presidio La Bahia</ref>\n\nTwenty-eight Texans escaped by feigning death and other means.

Although the description of the light is similar to that of other visual phenomena witnessed throughout the world, the term \"Spooklight\" when standing alone generally refers to this specific case. Numerous legends exist that attempt to describe the origin of the Spooklight, one of which involves the ghosts of two young [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] lovers looking for each other.\n\n== History ==\nAccording to most accounts, it has appeared continually since the late 19th century,<ref name=unknown>[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071030_1_A4_spanc63203 Spooklights' source is still unknown ], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', October 30, 2007</ref> although it was generally not well known to anyone but locals until after [[World War II]]. Some date the first encounters with the light back to the [[Trail of Tears]] in the 1830s.

The earliest published report was in 1936 in the ''[[Kansas City Star]]''.\n\nIn 1946 the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] supposedly studied the \"Hornet Light\", but could not find a cause for it.

Its color is also not consistent: some eyewitnesses report a greenish glow while others describe it as orange, red, yellow, or even blue. It is almost always said to be in the shape of a ball, although some say it more resembles a camping [[lantern]] traveling a couple of feet off the ground.\n\n== Explanations ==\nExplanations for the light's appearance vary widely from the extraordinary to the mundane. The area of Oklahoma in which the light is seen is very hilly and forested and out to the west of where the light is seen lies [[Interstate 44]].

In [[William Least Heat-Moon]]'s 2008 book ''Roads to Quoz'', the author suggests that the lights seen at the end of E 50 are explained perfectly by the fact that the road aligns directly with [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] across the interstate and the river valley, some ten miles distant. He also claims that earlier sightings of the light from E 40 Road, one mile to the north, are explained by an earlier alignment of Route 66 to the north of the town of [[Quapaw, Oklahoma]], also aligned with E 40 Road. The author suggests that there are no reliable sightings of the light in any location but directly west along the road and therefore explainable by the Route 66 connection. Robert Gannon, writing for Popular Mechanics Magazine, also claims that the Spooklights are headlights from Route 66, citing a test in which he flashed his headlights on Route 66 at a certain time and the Spooklights were reported to flash as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOMDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&lr&rview=1&pg=PA116#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Popular Mechanics|work=google.com|accessdate=2 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther explanations for the light's appearance include atmospheric gases being affected by electrical fields.

The community became a center for whaling, shipping, and fishing, prior to its dominance today by tourism and marine research. At the end of the nineteenth century, Woods Hole was the home of the [[Pacific Guano Company]], which produced [[fertilizer]] from [[guano]] imported from islands in the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean, and the coast of South Carolina. After the firm went bankrupt in 1889, Long Neck\u2013the peninsula on which their factory was located\u2013was renamed Penzance Point and was developed with [[Shingle style architecture|shingle-style]] summer homes for bankers and lawyers from New York and Boston.

Morgan and Company]]; Joseph Lee, a partner in [[Lee, Higginson & Co.]]; and Franklin A. Park, an executive of [[Singer Sewing Machine]]. Other notable businessmen established homes on Gansett Point, Nobska Point, and at Quissett Harbor, further from the village center.

And what we needed to do to make it competitive in the future. And we kept going through bigger and bigger feature lists of what we needed to do to upgrade it, and who could possibly do the work, and it was getting really, really unwieldy. And there was this massive meeting to try and sort it out, and try to cut things and decide what to keep, and plan and...there was this point where I looked at that and said 'you know, everything you're proposing to add to UnrealScript is already in C++. Why don't we just kill UnrealScript and move to pure C++? You know, maximum performance and maximum debuggability.

And what we needed to do to make it competitive in the future. And we kept going through bigger and bigger feature lists of what we needed to do to upgrade it, and who could possibly do the work, and it was getting really, really unwieldy. And there was this massive meeting to try and sort it out, and try to cut things and decide what to keep, and plan and...there was this point where I looked at that and said 'you know, everything you're proposing to add to UnrealScript is already in C++.

various organisations are expected to carry out [[opinion polling]] to gauge voting intention. Results of such polls are displayed in this article. Most of the polling companies listed are members of the [[British Polling Council]] (BPC) and abide by its disclosure rules.\n\nThe date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|previous general election]], held on 12 December 2019, to the present day. Under current [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|fixed-term legislation]], the next general election is scheduled to be held in May 2024,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tufft|first1=Ben|title=When will the next UK General Election be held?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/when-will-the-next-uk-general-election-be-held-10236102.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=29 December 2019|quote=The act specifies that future elections will be held on the first Thursday of May, every five years.|date=8 May 2015}}</ref> though the government has pledged to repeal this law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/12/full-transcript-the-queens-speech/|title=Full transcript: The Queen\u2019s Speech|date=19 December 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|work=The Spectator}}</ref>\n\nMost opinion polls do not cover [[Northern Ireland]], since its major political parties are different to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n== Graphical summary ==\n{{Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election}}\n\n== National poll results==\nPoll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading party's colour. The 'party lead' column shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. In the instance of a tie, no figure is shaded but both are displayed in bold.\n\nThe parties with the largest numbers of votes in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] are listed here.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -
