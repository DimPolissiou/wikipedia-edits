This was the final spin-off to feature [[Alan Reed]] as the voice of Fred Flintstone before Reed's death in 1977.\n\nFor the 1973\u201374 television season, CBS dropped ''The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show'' episodes and repackaged the first half-hour segments of ''The Flintstone Comedy Hour'' for a second season of reruns under the new title ''The Flintstone Comedy Show'' from September 8, 1973, to January 26, 1974.

They performed two songs per episode which included:\n\n# \"Sunshine Man\"\n# \"Summertime Girl\"\n# \"Oh, How I Love You\"\n# \"Keep in Time\"\n# \"It Should Always Be Saturday\"\n# \"Hop, Skip and a Jump\"\n# \"Flying So High\"\n# \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\"\n# \"Shadow, Shadow\"\n# \"Being With You\"\n# \"Singing Song\"\n# \"Song of the Season\"\n# \"What's Your Sign?\"\n# \"Sunny Sun Day\"\n# \"Rock N Roll Circus\"\n\nThe music was written by various [[Screen Gems]] staffers, which at the time included [[David Gates]] (later of [[Bread (band)|Bread]]) penning the popular \"Summertime Girl\" and Tony Dancy (of Tony's Tygers) writing with Craig Fairchild & Jackie Mills on \"Being With You\". Mills would also write \"Sunshine Man\" with Leonard Pettit, and \"Yabba Dabba Doozie\" with Tom Jenkins. The actual group on the recordings were known as [[The Ron Hicklin Singers]] featuring [[Tom Bahler]] on lead (he would later go on to pen the classic [[Michael Jackson]] song \"[[She's Out of My Life]]\"), [[John Bahler]], [[Robin Ward (singer)|Jackie Ward]] and Stan Farber. This lineup would record on hundreds of commercials, TV themes and [[The Partridge Family discography|The Partridge Family]] recordings. Bahler's lead vocals are also prominent with the group [[The Love Generation]] who had a few LPs in the late 1960s as well.\n\n==Episodes==\nEach episode contained two shorts featuring the traditional antics and adventures of '''Fred and Barney''' and one short featuring '''Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm''' with their friends Moonrock, Penny, Wiggy, Schleprock, Cindy and Fabian, and the Bronto Bunch (Bronto, Noodles, Stub and Zonk).\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:20px\"| {{Abbr|N\u00ba|Number}}\n! style=\"background:#FFD700\"| Titles\n! style=\"background:#FFD700; width:135px\"| Air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = Birdbrained / Squawkie Talkies / Bedrock 500\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1972|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary =\n* '''Birdbrained:''' Fred has to birdsit Mr. Slate's pet parrot, Claymore, who causes nothing but trouble for the Flintstones and the Rubbles.\n* '''Squawkie Talkies:''' Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm mistakenly believe that Barney is eaten by a Hipposaurus while using Moonrock's \"squawkie talkie\" gadgets.\n* '''Bedrock 500:''' Bamm-Bamm and Moonrock, Pebbles and her girlfriends participate in the Bedrock 500 car race against the Bronto Bunch.\n| LineColor = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2\n| Title = The Flying Fools / Bedlam in Bedrock / The Stone Ranger Rides Again\n| OriginalAirDate = {{start date|1972|9|16}}\n| ShortSummary =\n* '''The Flying Fools:''' Fred and Barney experience a turbulent afternoon while flying in Moonrock's new self-made airplane.\n* '''Bedlam in Bedrock:''' Pebbles and her friends try to help Radio R.O.C.K.

In a 2015 interview, McGreevey confirmed the rumored friction between McGavin and his co-star [[Burt Reynolds]]: \"They were just two very different personalities. I think that Burt was insecure. It was his first job in Hollywood and Darren was a very polished actor. It was Darren's show really--he was Captain Holden. I think Burt was a little jealous of Darren and they clashed quite a bit. What finally happened was that Burt left the show. But I loved them both. Darren was very much a father figure for me and Burt was like a big brother. He had been a football player at Florida State and I was impressed with that because I was into football. The first football I ever got--in fact, I've still got it--he got me. We used to play catch. I still see Burt every {{sic|once in awhile}}.

However, slate occurs in a variety of colors even from a single locality; for example, slate from [[North Wales]] can be found in many shades of grey, from pale to dark, and may also be [[purple]], [[green]] or [[cyan]]. Slate is not to be confused with [[shale]], from which it may be formed, or [[schist]].\n\nThe word \"slate\" is also used for certain types of object made from slate rock. It may mean a single roofing tile made of slate, or a [[Slate (writing)|writing slate]]. They were traditionally a small, smooth piece of the rock, often framed in wood, used with chalk as a notepad or notice board, and especially for recording charges in pubs and inns. The phrases \"clean slate\" and \"[[tabula rasa|blank slate]]\" come from this usage.\n\n==Historical mining terminology==\nBefore the mid-19th century, the terms ''slate'', ''shale'' and ''schist'' were not sharply distinguished.<ref>R.

Occasionally, as in the purple slates of [[Slate industry in Wales|North Wales]], ferrous reduction spheres form around iron nuclei, leaving a light green spotted texture. These spheres are sometimes deformed by a subsequent applied stress field to ovoids, which appear as ellipses when viewed on a [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage plane]] of the specimen.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:St Fagans Tannery 7.jpg|thumb|Slate roof]]\n\n===Slate in buildings===\n[[File:Kirche wurzbach.jpg|thumb|Slate-faced church and homes in [[Wurzbach]], [[Th\u00fcringen]], Germany]]\n[[File:St.leonhard-ffm002.jpg|thumb|upright|Fine slate tile work, Saint Leonhard's Church, [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany.]]\nSlate can be made into roofing slates, a type of [[roof shingle]], or more specifically a type of [[roof tile]], which are installed by a [[slater]]. Slate has two lines of breakability \u2013 cleavage and grain \u2013 which make it possible to split the stone into thin sheets. When broken, slate retains a natural appearance while remaining relatively flat and easy to stack. A series of \"slate booms\" occurred in Europe from the 1870s until the [[World War I|First World War]] following improvements in railway, road and waterway transportation systems.<ref>Schunck, Eberhard, and Hans Jochen Oster. ''Roof Construction Manual Pitched Roofs''.. Basel: De Gruyter, 2003. 12. Print.</ref>\n\nSlate is particularly suitable as a roofing material as it has an extremely low water absorption index of less than 0.4%, making the material waterproof. In fact, this natural slate, which requires only minimal processing, has the lowest [[embodied energy]] of all roofing materials.\nNatural slate is used by building professionals as a result of its beauty and durability. Slate is incredibly durable and can last several hundred years, often with little or no maintenance. Its low water absorption makes it very resistant to frost damage and breakage due to freezing. Natural slate is also fire resistant and energy efficient.<ref>[http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 Natural Slate, the natural option] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310123813/http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 |date=10 March 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:SlateTremedda.jpg|thumb|left|Slates with holes for fixing, viewed from below. Photographed in [[Tremedda]], [[Cornwall]], a farm in England]]\n\nSlate roof tiles are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is typically with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, although there are modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 80\u2013100 years. \n\nSome mainland European slate suppliers suggest that using hook fixing means that:<ref>[http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp Galician and Spanish Slate website \"Hook Fixing\"].

Tiles are installed and set on mortar and grouted along the edges. Chemical sealants are often used on tiles to improve durability and appearance, increase stain resistance, reduce [[efflorescence]], and increase or reduce surface smoothness. Tiles are often sold gauged, meaning that the back surface is ground for ease of installation. Slate flooring can be slippery when used in external locations subject to rain. Slate tiles were used in 19th century UK building construction (apart from roofs) and in slate quarrying areas such as [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] and [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], [[Wales]] there are still many buildings wholly constructed of slate. Slates can also be set into walls to provide a rudimentary [[damp-proof membrane]]. Small offcuts are used as [[shim (engineering)|shims]] to level floor joists. In areas where slate is plentiful it is also used in pieces of various sizes for building walls and hedges, sometimes combined with other kinds of stone. In modern homes slate is often used as table coasters.\n\n===Other uses===\nBecause it is a good [[electrical insulator]] and [[fireproof]], it was used to construct early-20th-century [[electric switchboard]]s and [[relay]] controls for large [[electric motor]]s. Fine slate can also be used as a [[whetstone (tool)|whetstone]] to hone knives.\n\nDue to its thermal stability and chemical inertness, slate has been used for laboratory bench tops and for [[billiard table]] tops. In 18th- and 19th-century schools, slate was extensively used for [[Chalkboard|blackboards]] and individual [[Slate (writing)|writing slates]], for which slate or chalk pencils were used.\n\nIn areas where it is available, high-quality slate is used for [[tombstones]] and commemorative tablets. In some cases slate was used by the ancient [[Maya civilization]] to fashion [[Maya stelae|stelae]].\n\nSlate was the traditional material of choice for black [[Go (game)|Go]] stones in Japan. It is now considered to be a luxury.\n\n<gallery widths=\"154px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Other uses\">\nFile:DeborahLeavitt.jpg|Slate gravestone in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]]\nFile:Betjeman memorial.JPG|[[John Betjeman]]'s grave with inscription on slate at [[St Enodoc's Church, Trebetherick]], in Cornwall\nFile:Leonard Bramer - Mors Thriumphans.jpg|[[Leonard Bramer]], painting ''Mors Triumphans'' (oil on slate)\nFile:GoldsworthySlateCone.JPG|\"Slate Cone\" in [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]\nFile:Small Slate Serving Tray.jpg|Slate serving tray\n</gallery>\n\n==Slate extraction==\n[[File:bergwerk-fell-hoffnung.jpg|thumb|[[Fell Exhibition Slate Mine|Exhibition Slate mine at Fell, Germany]]]]\n[[File:bergwerk-fell-stollen2.jpg|thumb|Historical Pit ''Vogelsberg 1'' at Fell]]\n[[File:Mules carrying slate.

Parts of [[France]] ([[Anjou]], [[Loire Valley]], [[Ardennes]], [[Brittany]], [[Savoie]]) and [[Belgium]] (Ardennes), [[Liguria]] in northern [[Italy]], especially between the town of [[Lavagna]] (which means ''chalkboard'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) and Fontanabuona valley; [[Portugal]] especially around [[Valongo]] in the north of the country.\n\n[[Germany]]'s [[Moselle River]] region, [[Hunsr\u00fcck]] (with a former mine open as a museum at [[Fell Exhibition Slate Mine|Fell]]), [[Eifel]], [[Westerwald]], [[Thuringia]] and north [[Bavaria]]; and [[Alta, Norway]] (actually [[schist]], not a true slate). Some of the slate from Wales and Cumbria is colored slate (non-blue): purple and formerly green in Wales and green in Cumbria.\n\n===Americas===\nSlate is abundant in [[Brazil]], the world's second-biggest producer of slate, around [[Papagaios]] in [[Minas Gerais]], which extracts 95 percent of Brazil's slate.

Pennsylvania slate is widely used in the manufacture of turkey calls used for hunting turkeys in the U.S.  The tones produced from the slate (when scratched with various species of wood strikers) imitates almost exactly the calls of all four species of [[wild turkey]] in North America: eastern, Rio Grande, Osceola and Merriam's.\n\nA major slating operation existed in [[Monson, Maine]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where the slate is usually dark purple to blackish, and many local structures are still roofed with slate tiles.

Natural slate is also fire resistant and energy efficient.<ref>[http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 Natural Slate, the natural option] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310123813/http://www.insightmag.co.uk/newsarticle.asp?NewsID=286 |date=10 March 2014 }}</ref>\n[[File:SlateTremedda.jpg|thumb|left|Slates with holes for fixing, viewed from below. Photographed in [[Tremedda]], [[Cornwall]], a farm in England]]\n\nSlate roof tiles are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is typically with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber sarking boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, although there are modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 80\u2013100 years. \n\nSome mainland European slate suppliers suggest that using hook fixing means that:<ref>[http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp Galician and Spanish Slate website \"Hook Fixing\"]. Retrieved on 26 January 2010 [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716113747/http://www.spanishslateuk.com/hook_fixing.asp archived]</ref>\n* Areas of weakness on the tile are fewer since no holes have to be drilled\n* Roofing features such as valleys and domes are easier to create since narrow tiles can be used\n* Hook fixing is particularly suitable in regions subject to severe weather conditions, since there is greater resistance to wind uplift, as the lower edge of the slate is secured.\n\nThe metal hooks are, however, visible and may be unsuitable for historic properties.\n\nSlate tiles are often used for interior and exterior flooring, stairs, walkways and wall cladding. Tiles are installed and set on mortar and grouted along the edges. Chemical sealants are often used on tiles to improve durability and appearance, increase stain resistance, reduce [[efflorescence]], and increase or reduce surface smoothness. Tiles are often sold gauged, meaning that the back surface is ground for ease of installation. Slate flooring can be slippery when used in external locations subject to rain. Slate tiles were used in 19th century UK building construction (apart from roofs) and in slate quarrying areas such as [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]] and [[Bethesda, Wales|Bethesda]], [[Wales]] there are still many buildings wholly constructed of slate. Slates can also be set into walls to provide a rudimentary [[damp-proof membrane]]. Small offcuts are used as [[shim (engineering)|shims]] to level floor joists. In areas where slate is plentiful it is also used in pieces of various sizes for building walls and hedges, sometimes combined with other kinds of stone. In modern homes slate is often used as table coasters.\n\n===Other uses===\nBecause it is a good [[electrical insulator]] and [[fireproof]], it was used to construct early-20th-century [[electric switchboard]]s and [[relay]] controls for large [[electric motor]]s. Fine slate can also be used as a [[whetstone (tool)|whetstone]] to hone knives.\n\nDue to its thermal stability and chemical inertness, slate has been used for laboratory bench tops and for [[billiard table]] tops. In 18th- and 19th-century schools, slate was extensively used for [[Chalkboard|blackboards]] and individual [[Slate (writing)|writing slates]], for which slate or chalk pencils were used.\n\nIn areas where it is available, high-quality slate is used for [[tombstones]] and commemorative tablets. In some cases slate was used by the ancient [[Maya civilization]] to fashion [[Maya stelae|stelae]].\n\nSlate was the traditional material of choice for black [[Go (game)|Go]] stones in Japan. It is now considered to be a luxury.\n\n<gallery widths=\"154px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Other uses\">\nFile:DeborahLeavitt.jpg|Slate gravestone in [[Hingham, Massachusetts]]\nFile:Betjeman memorial.JPG|[[John Betjeman]]'s grave with inscription on slate at [[St Enodoc's Church, Trebetherick]], in Cornwall\nFile:Leonard Bramer - Mors Thriumphans.jpg|[[Leonard Bramer]], painting ''Mors Triumphans'' (oil on slate)\nFile:GoldsworthySlateCone.JPG|\"Slate Cone\" in [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh]]\nFile:Small Slate Serving Tray.jpg|Slate serving tray\n</gallery>\n\n==Slate extraction==\n[[File:bergwerk-fell-hoffnung.jpg|thumb|[[Fell Exhibition Slate Mine|Exhibition Slate mine at Fell, Germany]]]]\n[[File:bergwerk-fell-stollen2.jpg|thumb|Historical Pit ''Vogelsberg 1'' at Fell]]\n[[File:Mules carrying slate.

Parts of [[France]] ([[Anjou]], [[Loire Valley]], [[Ardennes]], [[Brittany]], [[Savoie]]) and [[Belgium]] (Ardennes), [[Liguria]] in northern [[Italy]], especially between the town of [[Lavagna]] (which means ''chalkboard'' in [[Italian language|Italian]]) and Fontanabuona valley; [[Portugal]] especially around [[Valongo]] in the north of the country.\n\n[[Germany]]'s [[Moselle River]] region, [[Hunsr\u00fcck]] (with a former mine open as a museum at [[Fell Exhibition Slate Mine|Fell]]), [[Eifel]], [[Westerwald]], [[Thuringia]] and north [[Bavaria]]; and [[Alta, Norway]] (actually [[schist]], not a true slate). Some of the slate from Wales and Cumbria is colored slate (non-blue): purple and formerly green in Wales and green in Cumbria.\n\n===Americas===\nSlate is abundant in [[Brazil]], the world's second-biggest producer of slate, around [[Papagaios]] in [[Minas Gerais]], which extracts 95 percent of Brazil's slate. However, not all \"slate\" products from Brazil are entitled to bear the [[CE mark]].<ref>Fundaci\u00f3n Centro Tecnol\u00f3gico de la Pizarra.

Pennsylvania slate is widely used in the manufacture of turkey calls used for hunting turkeys in the U.S.  The tones produced from the slate (when scratched with various species of wood strikers) imitates almost exactly the calls of all four species of [[wild turkey]] in North America: eastern, Rio Grande, Osceola and Merriam's.\n\nA major slating operation existed in [[Monson, Maine]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where the slate is usually dark purple to blackish, and many local structures are still roofed with slate tiles. The roof of [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]] was made of Monson slate, as is the headstone of [[John F. Kennedy]].<ref>[http://www.granville-ny.com/facts.htm Granville: Facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108054330/http://www.granville-ny.com/facts.htm |date=8 January 2011 }} accessed 23 March 2011</ref>\n\nSlate is found in the [[Arctic]], and was used by [[Inuit]] to make the blades for [[ulu]]s.\n\n=== Asia ===\nChina has vast slate deposits; in recent years its export of finished and unfinished slate has increased.
