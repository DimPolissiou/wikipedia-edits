Furthermore, ''Alegr\u00eda'' took a short respite and was converted to a resident show at [[MGM Resorts International|MGM]]'s [[Beau Rivage (Mississippi)|Beau Rivage]] casino from May 1999 to October 2000 before it continued touring again.

Since it premiered in April 1994, it has been performed over 5,000 times and seen by over 14 million spectators in more than 250 cities around the world.{{cn|date=January 2020}} ''Alegr\u00eda'' originated as a touring big top show. However, beginning with its 2009-2011 North American tour, the show was converted to an arena format, enabling it to visit cities that were previously inaccessible to the big top tour.  Furthermore, ''Alegr\u00eda'' took a short respite and was converted to a resident show at [[MGM Resorts International|MGM]]'s [[Beau Rivage (Mississippi)|Beau Rivage]] casino from May 1999 to October 2000 before it continued touring again. On 29 December 2013, ''Alegr\u00eda'' performed its final show at the Lotto Arena in [[Antwerp]], Belgium.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n''Alegr\u00eda'' takes its name from the Spanish word for \"joy.\"  Cirque du Soleil's literature describes the show as \"an operatic introspection of the struggle for power and the invigorating energy of youth.\"{{cn|date=January 2020}} Dominique Lemieux's costumes evince a [[baroque]] aesthetic of decadence and ornamentation, while Ren\u00e9 Dup\u00e9r\u00e9's musical score features a unique blend of French, Spanish, African, and Mediterranean influences.  The stage and props are characterized by [[Gothic architecture|gothic arches]] and harsh angular designs.\n\nIn 2019, Alegr\u00eda has been remounted in a revamped version. \"ALEGRIA in a new light\", had its launch on 18 April 2019, in Montreal, Quebec.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n[[File:Alegria's Grand Chapiteau.jpg|thumb|Alegria's Grand Chapiteau in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.
