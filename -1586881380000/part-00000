This version was originally hosted by actor [[Tom Wopat]]. He was later replaced with singer/songwriter [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]], who enjoyed relative success with the show until its cancellation in 1999 as part of the network's change of focus.\n\nTNN had two subdivisions focused on specialty programming: TNN Outdoors and [[TNN Motor Sports]].<ref>[http://www.wcsl.org/recent/2000/tnntribute.htm TNN Tribute]</ref> TNN Outdoors was responsible for the programming of hunting and fishing shows, while TNN Motor Sports was responsible for production of all of the network's [[auto racing]] and motorsports coverage. Regarding the latter, [[NASCAR]] races (including those of the then-[[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]], [[Nationwide Series|Busch Grand National Series]], and [[Craftsman Truck Series]]) were the most prominently featured. However, races of other series such as [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]], [[IndyCar|IRL]], [[American Speed Association|ASA]], [[World of Outlaws]], and [[NHRA Full Throttle Drag Racing Series|NHRA]] were also showcased, as were motorcycle and monster truck racing. TNN Outdoors and TNN Motor Sports also were marketed as separate entities, selling a variety of merchandise and being branded onto [[video game]]s such as ''[[TNN Bass Tournament of Champions]]'' and ''[[TNN Outdoors Bass Tournament '96]]''.\n\nIn 1995, the network's motorsports operations were moved into the industrial park located at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]], where TNN had purchased controlling interest in World Sports Enterprises, a motorsports production company. Notable TNN racing personalities included [[Mike Joy]], Steve Evans, [[Eli Gold]], [[Buddy Baker]], [[Neil Bonnett]], Randy Pemberton, [[Ralph Sheheen]], [[Dick Berggren]], [[Matt Yocum]], [[Brock Yates]], [[Paul Page]], [[Don Garlits]], Gary Gerould, Army Armstrong, and [[Rick Benjamin (announcer)|Rick Benjamin]].\n\nThe outdoors and motorsports programs were so successful that, by the early 1990s, only those shows were seen on Sundays, with no musical programming.\n\n===Westinghouse-CBS/Viacom ownership (1997\u20132000)===\n[[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]], who at the time owned the [[CBS]] network and had an existing relationship with TNN through its [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] division, purchased TNN and its sister network [[Country Music Television|CMT]] outright in 1997 to form CBS Cable, along with a short-lived startup network entitled [[Eye On People]].\n\nMost of the original entertainment-oriented programming ceased production during this period, and the network began to rely more on TNN Outdoors and TNN Motor Sports for programming. The network's ties to CBS allowed it to pick up country-themed CBS dramas from the 1980s such as ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', and also allowed it to carry CBS Sports' overruns, which happened during a [[NASCAR Busch Series]] race at [[Texas Motor Speedway]] and also a [[PGA Tour]] event at [[Firestone Country Club]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe late 1990s also saw the network's first attempts to distance itself from its country music/country lifestyle image and court a younger demographic.<ref name=\"where's the country music\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510230531/http://www.usatoday.com:80/life/music/music001.htm|archivedate=May 10, 2000|author=Associated Press|title=Where's the country music on TNN?|work=USA Today|date=April 5, 2000|accessdate=June 23, 2019|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/music001.htm}}</ref> In 1998, the network dropped its \"The Nashville Network\" moniker and shortened its official name to '''TNN''', and ownership shifted to [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] in 2000 after that company's acquisition of Westinghouse's successor, CBS Corporation.<ref>[http://www.countystandardtime.com/d/editorial.asp?xid=102 Goodbye Nashville Network]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''Country Standard Time'', November 2000</ref> TNN subsequently moved from its original Nashville headquarters to [[New York City]] and was folded into Viacom's [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] division; sister network CMT, however, remained in Nashville and began to venture away from 24/7 music videos, in favor of lifestyle programming. 1998 witnessed the premiere of ''[[RollerJam]]'', which brought [[roller derby]] back to television for the first time in almost a decade. The next year, TNN began its relationship with [[professional wrestling]], signing a three-year deal with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW). ''[[ECW on TNN]]'' was the highest-rated show on TNN through 2000, despite limited advertising. ''ECW on TNN'' and ''RollerJam'' formed the core of the network's \"Friday Night Thrill Zone\" [[block programming|program block]], which was responsible for an increase in the network's young male viewership on Friday nights.\n\n===Format change===\n{{main|Paramount Network}}\n\nIn 2000, Viacom sensed redundancy among its TNN and CMT properties and, catalyzed by its acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]) programming, decided to refocus TNN.<ref name=\"where's the country music\"/> The network was renamed '''The National Network''' on September 25 (later '''The New TNN''') and reformatted to compete with [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], and [[USA Network]] by attracting viewers in the 18 to 49-year-old demographic.<ref name=tnn2>[http://www.expressindia.com/news/fe/daily/20001006/fst06024.html New TNN embraces populist culture, hopes to dethrone cable rating kings]</ref> Prior to 2000, over half of TNN's viewers were 55-years old and over. Only one third of them were between the ages of 18 and 49, according to Nielsen Media Research.<ref name=tnn2/>\n\nSome of TNN's programming included off-network sitcoms such as ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' and the failed relaunch of ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' as ''[[Ren & Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\"]]''. Eventually, male-oriented shows, such as ''[[Baywatch]]'', ''[[Miami Vice]]'', ''[[Monster Jam]]'', ''[[Bull Riding]]'', ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' were added to the network's lineup as the demographic was changed to target \"[[young adult (psychology)|young adult]] males\". This change in the target demographic led The New TNN to be relaunched as '''Spike TV''' in August 2003, and then renamed to simply '''[[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]''' in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, Spike was available in 96.1 million American homes, and the average age of its viewers is 42.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080407spiketv02|title='Unsolved Mysteries' Gets a New Look on Spike TV|work=The Futon Critic|date=April 7, 2008|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> The network featured re-runs of popular shows such as ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', ''[[CSI: NY]]'', ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] events, and various original programs and movies.

He was later replaced with singer/songwriter [[Gary Chapman (musician)|Gary Chapman]], who enjoyed relative success with the show until its cancellation in 1999 as part of the network's change of focus.\n\nTNN had two subdivisions focused on specialty programming: TNN Outdoors and [[TNN Motor Sports]].<ref>[http://www.wcsl.org/recent/2000/tnntribute.htm TNN Tribute]</ref> TNN Outdoors was responsible for the programming of hunting and fishing shows, while TNN Motor Sports was responsible for production of all of the network's [[auto racing]] and motorsports coverage. Regarding the latter, [[NASCAR]] races (including those of the then-[[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]], [[Nationwide Series|Busch Grand National Series]], and [[Craftsman Truck Series]]) were the most prominently featured. However, races of other series such as [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]], [[IndyCar|IRL]], [[American Speed Association|ASA]], [[World of Outlaws]], and [[NHRA Full Throttle Drag Racing Series|NHRA]] were also showcased, as were motorcycle and monster truck racing. TNN Outdoors and TNN Motor Sports also were marketed as separate entities, selling a variety of merchandise and being branded onto [[video game]]s such as ''[[TNN Bass Tournament of Champions]]'' and ''[[TNN Outdoors Bass Tournament '96]]''.\n\nIn 1995, the network's motorsports operations were moved into the industrial park located at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]], where TNN had purchased controlling interest in World Sports Enterprises, a motorsports production company. Notable TNN racing personalities included [[Mike Joy]], Steve Evans, [[Eli Gold]], [[Buddy Baker]], [[Neil Bonnett]], Randy Pemberton, [[Ralph Sheheen]], [[Dick Berggren]], [[Matt Yocum]], [[Brock Yates]], [[Paul Page]], [[Don Garlits]], Gary Gerould, Army Armstrong, and [[Rick Benjamin (announcer)|Rick Benjamin]].\n\nThe outdoors and motorsports programs were so successful that, by the early 1990s, only those shows were seen on Sundays, with no musical programming.\n\n===Westinghouse-CBS/Viacom ownership (1997\u20132000)===\n[[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]], who at the time owned the [[CBS]] network and had an existing relationship with TNN through its [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] division, purchased TNN and its sister network [[Country Music Television|CMT]] outright in 1997 to form CBS Cable, along with a short-lived startup network entitled [[Eye On People]].\n\nMost of the original entertainment-oriented programming ceased production during this period, and the network began to rely more on TNN Outdoors and TNN Motor Sports for programming. The network's ties to CBS allowed it to pick up country-themed CBS dramas from the 1980s such as ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', and also allowed it to carry CBS Sports' overruns, which happened during a [[NASCAR Busch Series]] race at [[Texas Motor Speedway]] and also a [[PGA Tour]] event at [[Firestone Country Club]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe late 1990s also saw the network's first attempts to distance itself from its country music/country lifestyle image and court a younger demographic.<ref name=\"where's the country music\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000510230531/http://www.usatoday.com:80/life/music/music001.htm|archivedate=May 10, 2000|author=Associated Press|title=Where's the country music on TNN?|work=USA Today|date=April 5, 2000|accessdate=June 23, 2019|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/music001.htm}}</ref> In 1998, the network dropped its \"The Nashville Network\" moniker and shortened its official name to '''TNN''', and ownership shifted to [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] in 2000 after that company's acquisition of Westinghouse's successor, CBS Corporation.<ref>[http://www.countystandardtime.com/d/editorial.asp?xid=102 Goodbye Nashville Network]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''Country Standard Time'', November 2000</ref> TNN subsequently moved from its original Nashville headquarters to [[New York City]] and was folded into Viacom's [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] division; sister network CMT, however, remained in Nashville and began to venture away from 24/7 music videos, in favor of lifestyle programming. 1998 witnessed the premiere of ''[[RollerJam]]'', which brought [[roller derby]] back to television for the first time in almost a decade. The next year, TNN began its relationship with [[professional wrestling]], signing a three-year deal with [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW). ''[[ECW on TNN]]'' was the highest-rated show on TNN through 2000, despite limited advertising. ''ECW on TNN'' and ''RollerJam'' formed the core of the network's \"Friday Night Thrill Zone\" [[block programming|program block]], which was responsible for an increase in the network's young male viewership on Friday nights.\n\n===Format change===\n{{main|Paramount Network}}\n\nIn 2000, Viacom sensed redundancy among its TNN and CMT properties and, catalyzed by its acquisition of the rights to World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]) programming, decided to refocus TNN.<ref name=\"where's the country music\"/> The network was renamed '''The National Network''' on September 25 (later '''The New TNN''') and reformatted to compete with [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], and [[USA Network]] by attracting viewers in the 18 to 49-year-old demographic.<ref name=tnn2>[http://www.expressindia.com/news/fe/daily/20001006/fst06024.html New TNN embraces populist culture, hopes to dethrone cable rating kings]</ref> Prior to 2000, over half of TNN's viewers were 55-years old and over. Only one third of them were between the ages of 18 and 49, according to Nielsen Media Research.<ref name=tnn2/>\n\nSome of TNN's programming included off-network sitcoms such as ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' and the failed relaunch of ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' as ''[[Ren & Stimpy \"Adult Party Cartoon\"]]''. Eventually, male-oriented shows, such as ''[[Baywatch]]'', ''[[Miami Vice]]'', ''[[Monster Jam]]'', ''[[Bull Riding]]'', ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' were added to the network's lineup as the demographic was changed to target \"[[young adult (psychology)|young adult]] males\". This change in the target demographic led The New TNN to be relaunched as '''Spike TV''' in August 2003, and then renamed to simply '''[[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]''' in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, Spike was available in 96.1 million American homes, and the average age of its viewers is 42.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080407spiketv02|title='Unsolved Mysteries' Gets a New Look on Spike TV|work=The Futon Critic|date=April 7, 2008|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}</ref> The network featured re-runs of popular shows such as ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', ''[[CSI: NY]]'', ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'', ''[[Married... with Children]]'', [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] events, and various original programs and movies.

Pirlo was usually deployed as a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying playmaker]] in [[Midfielder|midfield]] for both his club and national teams and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever exponents of this position due to his vision, ball control, technique, creativity and passing ability, as well as for being a [[Direct free kick|free-kick]] specialist.<ref name=\"Soccerlens.com\">{{cite web |url=http://soccerlens.com/born-again-how-the-deep-lying-midfielder-position-is-reviving-careers/32421/ |title=Born Again: How the Deep-Lying Midfielder Position is Reviving Careers |website=Soccerlens |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Andrea Pirlo Player Profile - ESPN FC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/11888/andrea-pirlo |title=Andrea Pirlo: Player Profile |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"A.C.

His promising performances led to a move to [[Inter Milan]] in 1998, but he struggled to gain playing time at his new club, and was sent on loan in 1999. Despite successful spells with [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] and a return to Brescia, Pirlo was still unable to break into Inter's starting line-up and was sold to cross-city rivals [[A.C. Milan]] in 2001. At Milan, manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] decided to transition Pirlo into a deep-lying playmaker to orchestrate the team's attacks. Pirlo excelled in his new role and soon developed into a world-class midfielder, and won a plethora of trophies, including two [[UEFA Champions League]]s, two [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, two [[Serie A]] titles, a [[FIFA Club World Cup]], a [[Supercoppa Italiana]], and a [[Coppa Italia]].<ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Andrea Pirlo\"/> After joining [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on a free transfer in 2011, who had gone trophyless since 2003, he added four more Serie A titles, which he won consecutively, as well as two Supercoppa Italiana titles, and a Coppa Italia. After playing in Italy for over 20 seasons, Pirlo joined [[Major League Soccer]] franchise [[New York City FC|New York City]] in 2015, helping the team to reach the playoffs in his second and third seasons before retiring in 2017.\n\nAt international level, Pirlo is the [[Italy national football team records#Appearances|fifth-most]] [[Cap (sports)|capped]] player in the history of the Italian national team with [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|116 caps]] between 2002 and 2015. He played for the Italian youth teams at [[Italy national under-15 football team|U15]], [[Italy national under-18 football team|U18]] and [[Italy national under-21 football team|U21]] level, [[Captain (association football)|captaining]] and leading the latter to victory in the [[2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] as the Golden Player and Top Scorer of the tournament. He joined the Italian senior team in September 2002 and captained the Olympic team to a bronze medal in the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2004 Olympics]]. Later, he was instrumental in the senior team's victory in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. He was named [[Man of the Match]] three times, including the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], more than any other player in the tournament, and ultimately won the Bronze Ball (awarded to the third best player of the tournament) also being elected to the [[FIFA World Cup 2006#All-star team|Team of the Tournament]]. He was also elected as part of the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA European Championship Teams of the Tournament#Poland and Ukraine 2012|Team of the Tournament]] after leading Italy to the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|final]], winning three Man of the Match awards in the process, the most of any player along with [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]]. He has also represented the Italian senior team at the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004]] and [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]] [[UEFA European Championships]], the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s and the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup|2009]] and [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013]] [[FIFA Confederations Cup]]s, finishing third in the latter edition in Brazil, where he was also elected to the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup#Awards|Team of the Tournament]].\n\nPirlo came in third, second, fourth and third twice more in the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics]] [[IFFHS World's Best Playmaker|World Playmaker of the Year]] awards in 2006, 2007, 2012, 2013 and 2015, respectively.<ref name=\"iffhs.de\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iffhs.de/?d847e4a95e99a54f84d85fe8f55005fdcdc3bfcdc0aec70aeecf8a3e12 |title=IFFHS |publisher=International Federation of Football History & Statistics |author=Ingo Faulhaber |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> He placed fourth in the [[UEFA Best Player in Europe Award#2011.E2.80.9312|2012 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award]]<ref name=\"uefa.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/uefa-best-player-award/news/newsid=1842518.html |title=Iniesta, Messi, Ronaldo up for Best Player Award |publisher=UEFA |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> and seventh in the [[UEFA Best Player in Europe Award#2014.E2.80.9315|2015]] edition.<ref name=\"Best Player in Europe\">{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2270699.html |title=Best Player in Europe: Messi, Ronaldo or Su\u00e1rez |publisher=UEFA |date=12 August 2015 |accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref> He placed seventh in the [[2007 FIFA World Player of the Year|2007 FIFA World Player]], fifth in the [[2007 Ballon d'Or]] and seventh in the [[2012 FIFA Ballon d'Or]] award.

Although Pirlo was able to set up some goal scoring opportunities and did test the opposition goalkeepers with some dangerous free kicks in the final two group games, his performances were stifled by the defensive pressure of the opposition, and he was much less dominant than he had been in the opening match against England.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> Although he had previously communicated his intention to retire after the World Cup, he stated, upon his return to Italy, that he would still be available to play for the national team.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lastampa.it/2014/06/26/multimedia/sport/speciali/mondiali-di-calcio-2014/pirlo-se-nuovo-ct-vuole-resto-in-azzurro-p4ngsgr3LEONR7gDzvmyyH/pagina.html |title=Pirlo: Se il nuovo ct vuole resto in azzurro |newspaper=La Stampa |language=Italian |date=26 June 2014 |accessdate=26 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627045930/http://lastampa.it/2014/06/26/multimedia/sport/speciali/mondiali-di-calcio-2014/pirlo-se-nuovo-ct-vuole-resto-in-azzurro-p4ngsgr3LEONR7gDzvmyyH/pagina.html |archive-date=27 June 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Euro 2016===\n[[File:20150616 - Portugal - Italie - Gen\u00e8ve - Andra Pirlo.jpg|thumb|right|Pirlo playing for Italy in 2015]]\n\nDespite previously announcing his international retirement following the 2014 World Cup, Pirlo reversed his decision, and under new Italy manager, and Pirlo's former Juventus manager Conte, Pirlo returned to the Italian squad.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2222260-andrea-pirlo-returns-to-italy-squad-following-giacomo-bonaventuras-injury |title=Andrea Pirlo Returns to Italy Squad Following Giacomo Bonaventura's Injury |date=6 October 2014 |website=Bleacher Report |publisher=Turner |accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> On 10 October, Pirlo started in Italy's second [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016 qualifying match]], which ended in a 2\u20131 home win over Azerbaijan, overtaking Zoff with his 113th appearance for Italy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://it.sports.yahoo.com/notizie/qualificazioni-euro-2016-pirlo-supera-zoff-113-presenze-192340449--sow.html |title=Qualificazioni Euro 2016 \u2013 Pirlo supera Zoff: 113 presenze in Nazionale |publisher=Eurosport |language=Italian |date=10 October 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119234823/https://it.sports.yahoo.com/notizie/qualificazioni-euro-2016-pirlo-supera-zoff-113-presenze-192340449--sow.html |archivedate=19 November 2015}}</ref> Pirlo assisted [[Giorgio Chiellini|Chiellini's]] first goal of the match from a corner kick.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/1717/editorial/2014/10/10/5173062/pirlo-shows-he-is-too-good-to-retire-as-chiellini-rescues |title=Pirlo shows he is too good to retire as Chiellini rescues Italy |website=Goal.com |date=10 October 2014 |accessdate=11 October 2014}}</ref> In August 2015, Pirlo was called for Italy's Euro 2016 qualifying matches against Malta and Bulgaria in September; he appeared in Italy's 1\u20130 home victory over [[Malta national football team|Malta]] on 3 September, becoming the first MLS player to represent Italy;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.football-italia.net/72474/verratti-and-pirlo-against-malta |title=Verratti and Pirlo against Malta? |website=Football Italia |publisher=Tiro Media |date=2 September 2015 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/italy-keep-pace-euro-qualification-lackluster-win-malta-1-0-graziano-pelle-match-report-090315 |title=Italy keep pace in Euro Qualifying after lackluster win over Malta |publisher=Fox Sports |date=3 September 2015 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> this was his final international appearance.<ref name=\"Nazionale in Cifre - FIGC: Pirlo, Andrea\"/> In total, Pirlo made four appearances under Conte, as Italy qualified for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] on 10 October in a 3\u20131 win over Azerbaijan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/italy-beats-azerbaijan-to-qualify-for-euro-2016/ |title=Italy beats Azerbaijan to qualify for Euro 2016 |publisher=Sportsnet |date=10 October 2015 |accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref> On 23 May 2016, Pirlo, along with fellow MLS compatriot Giovinco, was left off of Conte's 30-player shortlist for Italy's Euro 2016 squad.

Pirlo was usually deployed as a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker|deep-lying playmaker]] in [[Midfielder|midfield]] for both his club and national teams and he is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever exponents of this position due to his vision, ball control, technique, creativity and passing ability, as well as for being a [[Direct free kick|free-kick]] specialist.<ref name=\"Soccerlens.com\">{{cite web |url=http://soccerlens.com/born-again-how-the-deep-lying-midfielder-position-is-reviving-careers/32421/ |title=Born Again: How the Deep-Lying Midfielder Position is Reviving Careers |website=Soccerlens |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Andrea Pirlo Player Profile - ESPN FC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/11888/andrea-pirlo |title=Andrea Pirlo: Player Profile |website=ESPN FC |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"A.C.

His promising performances led to a move to [[Inter Milan]] in 1998, but he struggled to gain playing time at his new club, and was sent on loan in 1999. Despite successful spells with [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]] and a return to Brescia, Pirlo was still unable to break into Inter's starting line-up and was sold to cross-city rivals [[A.C. Milan]] in 2001. At Milan, manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] decided to transition Pirlo into a deep-lying playmaker to orchestrate the team's attacks. Pirlo excelled in his new role and soon developed into a world-class midfielder, and won a plethora of trophies, including two [[UEFA Champions League]]s, two [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, two [[Serie A]] titles, a [[FIFA Club World Cup]], a [[Supercoppa Italiana]], and a [[Coppa Italia]].<ref name=\"A.C. Milan Hall of Fame: Andrea Pirlo\"/> After joining [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on a free transfer in 2011, who had gone trophyless since 2003, he added four more Serie A titles, which he won consecutively, as well as two Supercoppa Italiana titles, and a Coppa Italia. After playing in Italy for over 20 seasons, Pirlo joined [[Major League Soccer]] franchise [[New York City FC|New York City]] in 2015, helping the team to reach the playoffs in his second and third seasons before retiring in 2017.\n\nAt international level, Pirlo is the [[Italy national football team records#Appearances|fifth-most]] [[Cap (sports)|capped]] player in the history of the Italian national team with [[List of footballers with 100 or more caps|116 caps]] between 2002 and 2015. He played for the Italian youth teams at [[Italy national under-15 football team|U15]], [[Italy national under-18 football team|U18]] and [[Italy national under-21 football team|U21]] level, [[Captain (association football)|captaining]] and leading the latter to victory in the [[2000 UEFA European Under-21 Championship]] as the Golden Player and Top Scorer of the tournament. He joined the Italian senior team in September 2002 and captained the Olympic team to a bronze medal in the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2004 Olympics]]. Later, he was instrumental in the senior team's victory in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. He was named [[Man of the Match]] three times, including the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], more than any other player in the tournament, and ultimately won the Bronze Ball (awarded to the third best player of the tournament) also being elected to the [[FIFA World Cup 2006#All-star team|Team of the Tournament]]. He was also elected as part of the [[UEFA Euro 2012]] [[UEFA European Championship Teams of the Tournament#Poland and Ukraine 2012|Team of the Tournament]] after leading Italy to the [[UEFA Euro 2012 Final|final]], winning three Man of the Match awards in the process, the most of any player along with [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]].

He was sent to scout the city with one of his best friends, but he regarded Zwolle as too beautiful for a full-scale attack, deciding instead to clear it out himself. A firefight broke out in which his friend was killed, and after that, he put the commanders of each group of enemy soldiers he found at gunpoint until he could take the unit prisoner back at base. He repeated this until the entire city was clear of Nazi soldiers.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2009/forces/D12-11-11-3E.pdf|title=Army Biography: Private Leo Major, DCM and BAR|first= T.

Due to a poor relationship with his father, he moved to live with an aunt at age 14. This relationship combined with a lack of available work led Major to join the Canadian army in 1940 to prove to his father that he was \"somebody to be proud of\". \n\n=== World War II ===\nMajor was serving with the [[R\u00e9giment de la Chaudi\u00e8re]] that landed on the beaches in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy Invasion]] on June 6, 1944.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leo-Major|title=Leo Major {{!}} Canadian soldier|newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en}}</ref> During a reconnaissance mission on [[D-Day]], Major captured a German armoured vehicle (a [[Sd.Kfz. 251|Hanomag]]) by himself.

After the resulting explosion, Major lost one eye but he continued to fight. He continued his service as a scout and a sniper by insisting that he needed only one eye to sight his weapon.

As it was raining and cold, Major said to himself, \"I am frozen and wet because of you so you will pay.\"<ref name=\"ottawacitizen\" /> He captured the first German and attempted to use him as bait so he could capture the other. The second attempted to use his gun, but Major quickly killed him. He went on to capture their commanding officer and forced him to surrender. The German garrison surrendered themselves after three more were shot dead by Major. In a nearby village, SS troops who witnessed German soldiers being escorted by a Canadian soldier shot at their own soldiers, killing seven and injuring a few. Major disregarded the enemy fire and kept escorting his prisoners to the Canadian front line. Major then ordered a passing Canadian tank to fire on the SS troops. He marched back to camp with nearly a hundred prisoners. Thus, he was chosen to receive a [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]]. He declined the invitation to be decorated, however, because according to him [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|General Montgomery]] (who was to give the award) was \"incompetent\" and in no position to be giving out medals.<ref name = ottawacitizen/>\n\nIn February 1945, Major was helping a [[military chaplain]] load corpses from a destroyed [[Tiger II|Tiger tank]] into a [[Bren Carrier]]. After they finished, the chaplain and the driver seated themselves in the front whilst Major jumped in the back of the vehicle. The carrier struck a [[land mine]]. Major claims to have remembered a loud blast, followed by his body being thrown into the air and smashing down hard on his back. He lost consciousness and awoke to find two concerned medical officers trying to assess his condition. He simply asked if the chaplain was okay. They did not answer his question, but proceeded to load him onto a truck so he could be transported to a field hospital {{convert|30|mi|km}} away, stopping every 15 minutes to inject [[morphine]] to relieve the pain in his back.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37235 |date=21 August 1945|page=4266|supp=1}}</ref>\n\n=== First Distinguished Conduct Medal ===\n[[File:Leo Majorlaan.jpg|thumb|Leo Majorlaan (L\u00e9o Major Lane) street sign in the Dutch city of [[Zwolle]]. The text reads: Canadian first liberator of Zwolle (1921\u20132008)]]\n\nAt the beginning of April, the ''R\u00e9giment de la Chaudi\u00e8re'' were approaching the city of [[Zwolle]], which was shown to have strong German resistance. The commanding officer asked for two volunteers to [[Reconnaissance|scout]] the German force before the artillery began firing on the city. Private Major and his friend Corporal Willie Arseneault stepped forward to accept the task. To keep the city intact, the pair decided to try to capture Zwolle alone, though they were only supposed to ascertain the German numbers and try to contact the [[Dutch Resistance]].\n\nAround midnight, Arseneault was killed by German fire after accidentally giving away the pair's position. Enraged, Major killed two of the Germans, but the rest of the group fled in a vehicle. He decided to continue his mission alone. He entered Zwolle near Sassenpoort and came upon a staff car. He ambushed and captured the German driver and then led him to a bar where an armed officer was taking a drink. After disarming the officer, he found that they could both speak French (the officer was from [[Alsace]]). Major told him that at 6:00 a.m. Canadian artillery would begin firing on the city, which would cause numerous casualties among both the German troops and the civilians. The officer seemed to understand the situation, so Major took a calculated risk and let the man go, hoping they would spread the news of their hopeless position instead of rallying the troops. As a sign of good faith, he gave the German his gun back. Major then proceeded to run throughout the city firing his sub-machine gun, throwing grenades and making so much noise that he fooled the Germans into thinking that the Canadian Army was storming the city in earnest. As he was doing this, he would attack and capture German troops. About 10 times during the night, he captured groups of 8 to 10 German soldiers, escorted them out of the city and handed them over to French-Canadian troops waiting in the vicinity. After transferring his prisoners, he would return to Zwolle to continue his assault. Four times during the night, he had to force his way into civilians' houses to rest. He eventually located the [[Gestapo]] HQ and set the building on fire. Later stumbling upon the SS HQ, he engaged in a quick but deadly fight with eight Nazi officers: four were killed, the others fled. He noticed that two of the SS men he had just killed were disguised as Resistance members. The Zwolle Resistance had been (or was going to be) infiltrated by the Nazis.\n\nBy 4:30 am, the exhausted Major found out that the Germans had retreated. Zwolle had been liberated,<ref>{{cite news|last=Rae|first=Bob|title=D-Day Chaud Scout, Stubborn Man, Captures Zwolle On His Own Hook|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jcY6AAAAIBAJ&sjid=SyoMAAAAIBAJ&dq=leo-major%20canada&pg=1366%2C13119661|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=The Maple Leaf|date=26 April 1945}}</ref> and the Resistance contacted. Walking in the street, he met four members of the Dutch Resistance. He informed them that the city was now free of Germans. Major found out later that morning that the Germans had fled to the west of the [[Oude IJssel|River IJssel]] and, perhaps more importantly, that the planned shelling of the city would be called off and his ''R\u00e9giment de la Chaudi\u00e8re'' could enter the city unopposed. Major then took his dead friend back to the Van Gerner farm until regimental reinforcements could carry him away. He was back at camp by 9:00 am. For his actions, he received the Distinguished Conduct Medal.\n\n===Second Distinguished Conduct Medal===\nWhen the [[Korean War|war in Korea]] broke out, the Canadian government decided to raise a force to join the United Nations in repelling the communist invasion. Major was called back and ended up in the Scout and Sniper Platoon of 2nd Battalion [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment]] of the [[25th Canadian Infantry Brigade]],<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kvacanada.com/stories_trfleo.htm|title=Leo Major - TRF|website=www.kvacanada.com|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref> [[1st Commonwealth Division]]. Major fought in the [[First Battle of Maryang San]] where he received a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his Distinguished Conduct Medal<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=39467 |date=12 February 1952 |page=866}}</ref> for capturing and holding a key hill in November 1951. \n\nHill 355, nicknamed Little Gibraltar, was a strategic feature, commanding the terrain for twenty miles around, so the Communists were determined to take it before the truce talks came to an agreement which would lock each side into their present positions. Hill 355 was held by the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd US Infantry Division]], who linked up with the Canadian's Royal 22e R\u00e9giment on the Americans' western flank.<ref>National Archives of Canada, RG 24, Vol 18357, R22eR War Diary, Commander's Conference,  19 November  1951.</ref> On November 22, the 64th Chinese Army (around 40,000 men) began their attack: over the course of two days, the Americans were pushed back from Hill 355 by elements of the Chinese 190th and 191st Divisions. The 3rd US Infantry Division tried to recapture the hill, but without any success, and the Chinese had moved to the nearby Hill 227, practically surrounding the Canadian forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvacanada.com/stories_trfleo.htm|title=Leo Major - TRF|website=www.kvacanada.com}}</ref>\n\nTo relieve pressure, an elite scout and sniper team led by L\u00e9o Major was brought up. Armed with [[Sten ]]guns, Major and his 18 men silently crept up Hill 355. At a signal, Major's men opened fire, panicking the Chinese who were trying to understand why the firing was coming from the center of their troops instead of from the outside. By 12:45 am, they had retaken the hill. However, an hour later, two Chinese divisions (the 190th and the 191st, totaling around 14,000 men) counter-attacked. Major was ordered to retreat, but refused and found scant cover for his men.

He was sent to scout the city with one of his best friends, but he regarded Zwolle as too beautiful for a full-scale attack, deciding instead to clear it out himself. A firefight broke out in which his friend was killed, and after that, he put the commanders of each group of enemy soldiers he found at gunpoint until he could take the unit prisoner back at base.

Due to a poor relationship with his father, he moved to live with an aunt at age 14. This relationship combined with a lack of available work led Major to join the Canadian army in 1940 to prove to his father that he was \"somebody to be proud of\". \n\n=== World War II ===\nMajor was serving with the [[R\u00e9giment de la Chaudi\u00e8re]] that landed on the beaches in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy Invasion]] on June 6, 1944.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leo-Major|title=Leo Major {{!}} Canadian soldier|newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en}}</ref> During a reconnaissance mission on [[D-Day]], Major captured a German armoured vehicle (a [[Sd.Kfz. 251|Hanomag]]) by himself.

The second attempted to use his gun, but Major quickly killed him. He went on to capture their commanding officer and forced him to surrender. The German garrison surrendered themselves after three more were shot dead by Major. In a nearby village, SS troops who witnessed German soldiers being escorted by a Canadian soldier shot at their own soldiers, killing seven and injuring a few. Major disregarded the enemy fire and kept escorting his prisoners to the Canadian front line. Major then ordered a passing Canadian tank to fire on the SS troops. He marched back to camp with nearly a hundred prisoners. Thus, he was chosen to receive a [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]]. He declined the invitation to be decorated, however, because according to him [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|General Montgomery]] (who was to give the award) was \"incompetent\" and in no position to be giving out medals.<ref name = ottawacitizen/>\n\nIn February 1945, Major was helping a [[military chaplain]] load corpses from a destroyed [[Tiger II|Tiger tank]] into a [[Bren Carrier]]. After they finished, the chaplain and the driver seated themselves in the front whilst Major jumped in the back of the vehicle. The carrier struck a [[land mine]]. Major claims to have remembered a loud blast, followed by his body being thrown into the air and smashing down hard on his back. He lost consciousness and awoke to find two concerned medical officers trying to assess his condition. He simply asked if the chaplain was okay. They did not answer his question, but proceeded to load him onto a truck so he could be transported to a field hospital {{convert|30|mi|km}} away, stopping every 15 minutes to inject [[morphine]] to relieve the pain in his back.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37235 |date=21 August 1945|page=4266|supp=1}}</ref>\n\n=== First Distinguished Conduct Medal ===\n[[File:Leo Majorlaan.jpg|thumb|Leo Majorlaan (L\u00e9o Major Lane) street sign in the Dutch city of [[Zwolle]]. The text reads: Canadian first liberator of Zwolle (1921\u20132008)]]\n\nAt the beginning of April, the ''R\u00e9giment de la Chaudi\u00e8re'' were approaching the city of [[Zwolle]], which was shown to have strong German resistance. The commanding officer asked for two volunteers to [[Reconnaissance|reconna\u00eetre]] the German force before the artillery began firing on the city. Private Major and his friend Corporal Willie Arseneault stepped forward to accept the task. To keep the city intact, the pair decided to try to capture Zwolle alone, though they were only supposed to ascertain the German numbers and try to contact the [[Dutch Resistance]].\n\nAround midnight, Arseneault was killed by German fire after accidentally giving away the pair's position. Enraged, Major killed two of the Germans, but the rest of the group fled in a vehicle. He decided to continue his mission alone. He entered Zwolle near Sassenpoort and came upon a staff car. He ambushed and captured the German driver and then led him to a bar where an armed officer was taking a drink. After disarming the officer, he found that they could both speak French (the officer was from [[Alsace]]). Major told him that at 6:00 a.m. Canadian artillery would begin firing on the city, which would cause numerous casualties among both the German troops and the civilians. The officer seemed to understand the situation, so Major took a calculated risk and let the man go, hoping they would spread the news of their hopeless position instead of rallying the troops. As a sign of good faith, he gave the German his gun back. Major then proceeded to run throughout the city firing his sub-machine gun, throwing grenades and making so much noise that he fooled the Germans into thinking that the Canadian Army was storming the city in earnest. As he was doing this, he would attack and capture German troops. About 10 times during the night, he captured groups of 8 to 10 German soldiers, escorted them out of the city and handed them over to French-Canadian troops waiting in the vicinity. After transferring his prisoners, he would return to Zwolle to continue his assault. Four times during the night, he had to force his way into civilians' houses to rest. He eventually located the [[Gestapo]] HQ and set the building on fire. Later stumbling upon the SS HQ, he engaged in a quick but deadly fight with eight Nazi officers: four were killed, the others fled. He noticed that two of the SS men he had just killed were disguised as Resistance members. The Zwolle Resistance had been (or was going to be) infiltrated by the Nazis.\n\nBy 4:30 am, the exhausted Major found out that the Germans had retreated. Zwolle had been liberated,<ref>{{cite news|last=Rae|first=Bob|title=D-Day Chaud Scout, Stubborn Man, Captures Zwolle On His Own Hook|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jcY6AAAAIBAJ&sjid=SyoMAAAAIBAJ&dq=leo-major%20canada&pg=1366%2C13119661|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=The Maple Leaf|date=26 April 1945}}</ref> and the Resistance contacted. Walking in the street, he met four members of the Dutch Resistance. He informed them that the city was now free of Germans. Major found out later that morning that the Germans had fled to the west of the [[Oude IJssel|River IJssel]] and, perhaps more importantly, that the planned shelling of the city would be called off and his ''R\u00e9giment de la Chaudi\u00e8re'' could enter the city unopposed. Major then took his dead friend back to the Van Gerner farm until regimental reinforcements could carry him away. He was back at camp by 9:00 am. For his actions, he received the Distinguished Conduct Medal.\n\n===Second Distinguished Conduct Medal===\nWhen the [[Korean War|war in Korea]] broke out, the Canadian government decided to raise a force to join the United Nations in repelling the communist invasion. Major was called back and ended up in the Scout and Sniper Platoon of 2nd Battalion [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment]] of the [[25th Canadian Infantry Brigade]],<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kvacanada.com/stories_trfleo.htm|title=Leo Major - TRF|website=www.kvacanada.com|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref> [[1st Commonwealth Division]].

Hill 355 was held by the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd US Infantry Division]], who linked up with the Canadian's Royal 22e R\u00e9giment on the Americans' western flank.<ref>National Archives of Canada, RG 24, Vol 18357, R22eR War Diary, Commander's Conference,  19 November  1951.</ref> On November 22, the 64th Chinese Army (around 40,000 men) began their attack: over the course of two days, the Americans were pushed back from Hill 355 by elements of the Chinese 190th and 191st Divisions. The 3rd US Infantry Division tried to recapture the hill, but without any success, and the Chinese had moved to the nearby Hill 227, practically surrounding the Canadian forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvacanada.com/stories_trfleo.htm|title=Leo Major - TRF|website=www.kvacanada.com}}</ref>\n\nTo relieve pressure, an elite scout and sniper team led by L\u00e9o Major was brought up. Armed with [[Sten ]]guns, Major and his 18 men silently crept up Hill 355. At a signal, Major's men opened fire, panicking the Chinese who were trying to understand why the firing was coming from the center of their troops instead of from the outside. By 12:45 am, they had retaken the hill. However, an hour later, two Chinese divisions (the 190th and the 191st, totaling around 14,000 men) counter-attacked. Major was ordered to retreat, but refused and found scant cover for his men. He held the enemy off throughout the night, though they were so close to him that Major's own mortar bombs were practically falling on him.

The battle was fought around Ko\u0161are on the border between [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]] and [[Albania]] from 9 April until 10 June during the [[NATO bombing of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe KLA sought to enter [[Kosovo]] from Albania and cut off of the communication routes of the [[Yugoslav Army]], and also take over of the region of [[Metohija]]. After days of heavy fighting, the Yugoslav Army kept the KLA from advancing into Kosovo. KLA insurgents managed to take the Ko\u0161are outpost following a massive artillery barrage by the Albanian Army and NATO airstrikes of Yugoslav strategic sites, but were unable to break the Yugoslav Army's second line of defense.\n\n==Background==\nThe KLA was supported by the Albanian Army and NATO. The Albanian Army supported with artillery and tanks, NATO with air support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/military060299.htm|title=Washingtonpost.com:  NATO Gives Air Support to KLA Forces|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n===9\u201313 April===\n\nOn 9 April 1999, at 03:00, an artillery barrage began from the Albanian side of the border, aimed in the direction of the Ko\u0161are military outpost, which was occupied by the Yugoslav Army. The Albanians attacked in three directions, the first was towards Rrasa e Koshares, the second was towards the well-defended Ko\u0161are outpost and the third was towards Maja Glava.

Then, with massive artillery support, the KLA took Maja Glava and continued to bombard the Ko\u0161are Outpost, which resulted in the Yugoslav soldiers having to abandon their posts. At 19:00, members of the KLA entered the abandoned outpost and [[CNN]] and the British [[BBC News|BBC]] broadcast images of a great number of KLA militants taking the outpost.\n\nMembers of the Yugoslav Forces then retreated towards the second line of defense above the outpost. Those positions were much more easier to defend. The next day, Yugoslav reserve troops arrived to relieve the First Army. One batch of KLA soldiers managed to cut the Yugoslav line of communications, and managed to disable one [[BOV (APC)|BOV]] armoured personnel carrier. During the night, the KLA attacked the Yugoslav Army at Opijaz, trying to shatter the resistance of the Yugoslav soldiers, but all of the attacks were unsuccessful and resulted in the Yugoslav Army inflicting heavy losses on the KLA insurgents. The next day, the KLA tried to break the resistance of the second defensive line of the Yugoslav Army, with little success. Meanwhile, the Yugoslavs managed to bring in their Special Forces and also a few artillery pieces.\n\nOn 13 April, the Yugoslav and Albanian armies [[April 1999 Albania\u2013Yugoslav border incident|clashed at the border]] near [[Krum\u00eb]].\n\n===Reorganization of Yugoslav positions and counterattack===\n\nAlbanian Army and KLA artillery continued to shell the Yugoslav Army's positions from Maja Glava and Rrasa e Koshares. The Yugoslav Army Headquarters decided to launch a sudden attack and surprise the enemy. On April 14, Yugoslav troops attacked Maja Glava. The distance between the two enemy trenches wasn't longer than 50 meters. The Yugoslav Army was unable to take Maja Glava completely, but it prevented the Albanians' artillery from engaging them from their positions. The Maja Glava front was stabilized until the end of the war, without any changes on the lines.\n\nIn April, there weren't any changes on the front lines at Rrasa e Koshares and both sides suffered heavy losses. Many Yugoslav soldiers were killed by the non-stop artillery bombardment, while many KLA soldiers were killed in numerous unsuccessful attempts to break the Yugoslav lines of defense.{{Weasel inline|date=May 2018}}\n\n===May at Ko\u0161are===\nMay began with several unsuccessful attacks by the Yugoslav Army to take back the Ko\u0161are outpost. The attacks were made unsuccessful because of the constant artillery fire aimed at their positions. On the 6th of May, the Yugoslav Army counterattacked at Rrasa e Koshares, in an effort to halt the artillery bombardment. A bloody skirmish ensued, but the Yugoslav Army did not manage to take Rrasa e Koshares. On 10 May, the Yugoslav Army sent two [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks to help stabilize the offensive on Rrasa e Koshares. When the tanks penetrated the KLA's lines, they advanced over 100 meters into insurgent-held territory, but the KLA still managed to retain control of Rrasa e Koshares. During the night of 10/11 May, [[NATO]] bombers dropped dozens of bombs on the Yugoslav troops who had attacked KLA positions around Rrasa e Koshares. At least in two of these instances NATO dropped cluster bombs on Yugoslav army troops. In these attacks, NATO killed eight Yugoslav soldiers and one officer and managed to wound over 40. The KLA seized the opportunity to attack and fought the Yugoslav soldiers out of their positions and forced them back.\n\nDuring the middle of May, many bloody skirmishes were fought at Mrcaj, which was eventually taken by the Yugoslav Army. After the Yugoslavs had inflicted some casualties on the insurgents, the KLA had to retreat from their positions giving the Yugoslavs the chance to take the now undefended position. This development allowed the Yugoslav Army to stabilize their position on the battlefield and to hold the attackers outside of their line of defense. On 22 May, NATO aircraft mistakenly bombed KLA positions, killing 67.<ref name=Chronology>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kosovo/etc/cron.html|title=A Kosovo Chronology - War In Europe - FRONTLINE - PBS|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThroughout May, NATO conducted air operations against Serbian targets in Kosovo and Serbia, some which included collateral damage\u2013death of civilians.{{sfn|Nardulli et al.|2002}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:A street graffiti honoring the fallen soldiers of the Battle of Ko\u0161are.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mural]] honoring the fallen soldiers of the Battle of Ko\u0161are in [[Ni\u0161]]]]\n[[File:Kla members.jpg|thumb|KLA members waiting to turn in their weapons to U.S. Marines, 30 June 1999.]]\nThe Kosovo War lasted until 10 June. The Kumanovo Agreement was signed and the Yugoslav Army, paramilitaries and police-forces had to pull out of Kosovo. The KFOR entered Kosovo as a peacekeeping force. The KLA was, under the terms of the [[Kumanovo Treaty]], disarmed and disbanded, however many of its members left Kosovo and joined Albanian organizations in the [[Insurgency in the Pre\u0161evo Valley]] (Serbia) and [[Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n;Books\n*{{cite book|author=Bahri Muharrem Gashi|title=Kosharja altari i liris\u00eb: dimensionet e luft\u00ebs s\u00eb Koshares dhe format e saj|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Kosharja_altari_i_liris%C3%AB.html?id=xnVUNQAACAAJ|year=2006|publisher=Shtepia Botuese \"Faik Konica\"|isbn=9951061494|ref={{harvid|Gashi}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Smiljani\u0107|first=Spasoje|title=Agresija NATO: ratno vazduhoplovstvo i protivvazdu\u0161na odbrana u odbrani otad\u017ebine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=It3rSAAACAAJ|year=2009|publisher=|isbn=978-86-912285-0-7}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Nardulli, Bruce |author2=Perry, Walter L. |author3=Pirnie, Bruce R. |author4=Gordin, John IV |author5=McGinn, John G. |title=Disjointed War: Military Operations in Kosovo, 1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3n1hNI4XoAC|year=2002|publisher=Rand Corporation|isbn=978-0-8330-3231-7|ref={{harvid|Nardulli et al.}} }}\n*{{cite book|author=|title=Coercive Diplomacy of NATO in Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgznBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA95|year=2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-7668-1|pages=<!--95, 111, 173, 178, 179-->}}\n*{{cite book|last=Hockenos|first=Paul|title=Homeland Calling: Exile Patriotism & the Balkan Wars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4pAs4JYSAMC|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-4158-7|pp=<!--238\u2013239-->}}\n\n== External links ==\n;News articles\n*{{cite web|author=Glas javnosti|title=Ja\u010danje upada iz Albanije|publisher=Glas javnosti|date=11 November 1999|url=http://www.glas-javnosti.rs/clanak/glas-javnosti-09-05-2008/jacanje-upada-iz-albanije}}\n*{{cite web|author=Lazanski, Miroslav|title=\u041a\u041e \u0408\u0415 \u041f\u0420\u0415\u0412\u0410\u0420\u0418\u041e \u0413\u0415\u041d\u0415\u0420\u0410\u041b\u0410|trans-title=Who tricked the general|date=9 January 2009|publisher=Politika|url=http://www.politika.rs/pogledi/Miroslav-Lazanski/KO-JE-PREVARIO-GENERALA.lt.html|ref={{harvid|Lazanski|2009}} }}\n*{{cite news|last=Steele|first=Jonathan|title=Ghost village marks the battle that ended the war|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|date=17 July 1999|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jul/17/balkans|ref={{harvid|Steele|1999}} }}\n*{{cite news|title=Na dana\u0161nji dan po\u010dela bitka na Ko\u0161arama \u2013 poginulo 108 pripadnika VJ|date=9 April 2015|publisher=Gra\u0111anin|url=http://www.gradjanin.rs/na-danasnji-dan-pocela-bitka-na-kosarama-poginulo-108-pripadnika-vj/|ref={{harvid|Gra\u0111anin|2015}} }}\n*{{cite news|author=\u0110orelijevski, Milo\u0161|publisher=Mondo|title=HEROJI KO\u0160ARA: Da li je sve bilo uzalud?|date=14 June 2016|url=http://mondo.rs/a911824/Info/Drustvo/Kosare-Bitka-za-Srbiju.html|ref={{harvid|Mondo|2016}} }}\n*{{cite web|title=Kosovska vlada: Bitka na Ko\u0161arama imala sveti cilj -

The battle was fought around Ko\u0161are on the border between [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FR Yugoslavia]] and [[Albania]] from 9 April until 10 June during the [[NATO bombing of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia]].\n\nThe KLA sought to enter [[Kosovo]] from Albania and cut off of the communication routes of the [[Yugoslav Army]], and also take over of the region of [[Metohija]]. After days of heavy fighting, the Yugoslav Army kept the KLA from advancing into Kosovo. KLA insurgents managed to take the Ko\u0161are outpost following a massive artillery barrage by the Albanian Army and NATO airstrikes of Yugoslav strategic sites, but were unable to break the Yugoslav Army's second line of defense.\n\n==Background==\nThe KLA was supported by the Albanian Army and NATO. The Albanian Army supported with artillery and tanks, NATO with air support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/balkans/stories/military060299.htm|title=Washingtonpost.com:  NATO Gives Air Support to KLA Forces|website=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n===9\u201313 April===\n\nOn 9 April 1999, at 03:00, an artillery barrage began from the Albanian side of the border, aimed in the direction of the Ko\u0161are military outpost, which was occupied by the Yugoslav Army. The Albanians attacked in three directions, the first was towards Rrasa e Koshares, the second was towards the well-defended Ko\u0161are outpost and the third was towards Maja Glava.

Then, with massive artillery support, the KLA took Maja Glava and continued to bombard the Ko\u0161are Outpost, which resulted in the Yugoslav soldiers having to abandon their posts. At 19:00, members of the KLA entered the abandoned outpost and [[CNN]] and the British [[BBC News|BBC]] broadcast images of a great number of KLA militants taking the outpost.\n\nMembers of the Yugoslav Forces then retreated towards the second line of defense above the outpost. Those positions were much more easier to defend. The next day, Yugoslav reserve troops arrived to relieve the First Army. One batch of KLA soldiers managed to cut the Yugoslav line of communications, and managed to disable one [[BOV (APC)|BOV]] armoured personnel carrier. During the night, the KLA attacked the Yugoslav Army at Opijaz, trying to shatter the resistance of the Yugoslav soldiers, but all of the attacks were unsuccessful and resulted in the Yugoslav Army inflicting heavy losses on the KLA insurgents. The next day, the KLA tried to break the resistance of the second defensive line of the Yugoslav Army, with little success. Meanwhile, the Yugoslavs managed to bring in their Special Forces and also a few artillery pieces.\n\nOn 13 April, the Yugoslav and Albanian armies [[April 1999 Albania\u2013Yugoslav border incident|clashed at the border]] near [[Krum\u00eb]].\n\n===Reorganization of Yugoslav positions and counterattack===\n\nAlbanian Army and KLA artillery continued to shell the Yugoslav Army's positions from Maja Glava and Rrasa e Koshares. The Yugoslav Army Headquarters decided to launch a sudden attack and surprise the enemy. On April 14, Yugoslav troops attacked Maja Glava. The distance between the two enemy trenches wasn't longer than 50 meters. The Yugoslav Army was unable to take Maja Glava completely, but it prevented the Albanians' artillery from engaging them from their positions. The Maja Glava front was stabilized until the end of the war, without any changes on the lines.\n\nIn April, there weren't any changes on the front lines at Rrasa e Koshares and both sides suffered heavy losses. Many Yugoslav soldiers were killed by the non-stop artillery bombardment, while many KLA soldiers were killed in numerous unsuccessful attempts to break the Yugoslav lines of defense.{{Weasel inline|date=May 2018}}\n\n===May at Ko\u0161are===\nMay began with several unsuccessful attacks by the Yugoslav Army to take back the Ko\u0161are outpost. The attacks were made unsuccessful because of the constant artillery fire aimed at their positions. On the 6th of May, the Yugoslav Army counterattacked at Rrasa e Koshares, in an effort to halt the artillery bombardment. A bloody skirmish ensued, but the Yugoslav Army did not manage to take Rrasa e Koshares. On 10 May, the Yugoslav Army sent two [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks to help stabilize the offensive on Rrasa e Koshares. When the tanks penetrated the KLA's lines, they advanced over 100 meters into insurgent-held territory, but the KLA still managed to retain control of Rrasa e Koshares. During the night of 10/11 May, [[NATO]] bombers dropped dozens of bombs on the Yugoslav troops who had attacked KLA positions around Rrasa e Koshares. At least in two of these instances NATO dropped cluster bombs on Yugoslav army troops. In these attacks, NATO killed eight Yugoslav soldiers and one officer and managed to wound over 40. The KLA seized the opportunity to attack and fought the Yugoslav soldiers out of their positions and forced them back.\n\nDuring the middle of May, many bloody skirmishes were fought at Mrcaj, which was eventually taken by the Yugoslav Army. After the Yugoslavs had inflicted some casualties on the insurgents, the KLA had to retreat from their positions giving the Yugoslavs the chance to take the now undefended position. This development allowed the Yugoslav Army to stabilize their position on the battlefield and to hold the attackers outside of their line of defense.
