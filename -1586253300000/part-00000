ITA2 is a five bit code with 32 possible code points. Four code points are used for null (BLANK), space (SPACE), carriage return (CR), and line feed (LF). Two code points are used for a letter shift (LTRS) or a figure shift (FIGS). The remaining 26 code points are used for characters in the letters and figures sets. Consequently, ITA2 can represent 52 (2*26) additional characters.<ref>ITA2 does not assign all 52 characters. The figure shift for D is a checked box or iron cross. The figure shifts for F, G, and H are not assigned but should not cause errors. See ITU-R M 625-3 page 5. U.S. teletypes assign all 52. Figure shift for D is \"$\", for F is \"!\", for G is \"&\", and for H is \"#\".
