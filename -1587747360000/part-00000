Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji started his preparations and took possession of the Panhala fort. He arrested the fort commander Vitthal Tryambak and senior minister Janardanpant Hanumante who were involved in the conspiracy. He also asked his father-in-law of Pilajirao Shirke to be ready with his forces at Shringarpur. Both sides were vying for the crucial support of [[Hambirrao Mohite]] the commander-in-chief of Maratha army. He was the brother of [[Soyarabai]] and the maternal uncle of [[Rajaram I|Rajaram]]<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> .

Hambirrao was near [[Karad]] with his army of 20,000. Anaji and Moropant came to meet Hambirrao and asked for his support to arrest Sambhaji. Hambirrao refused and arrested both these ministers.

He stayed at Panhala for some time as condolence letters were coming to him from British, Portuguese, Dutch, French, Adilshahi, Qutbshahi and other neighbouring powers after Shivaji's death. Meanwhile he asked Pilajirao to secure Raigad with a force of 10,000. He was confronted by sardar Malsawant of Soyarabai's side but Pilajirao defeated and arrested him and secured the control of Raigad [[Raigad Fort|fort]]. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his mother [[Soyarabai]], all the senior ministers involved in the conspiracy were put under house arrest. Malsawant still kept on insulting Sambhaji and he was executed by throwing him off the cliff.(Takmak Tok cliff). Sambhaji's coronation took place on 16 January 1681. Sambhaji pardoned and restored all the ministers such as [[Janardanpant]], [[Hiroji Farzand]], Rahuji Somnath in their previously held positions.

In 1681 Aurangzeb's rebel son Akbar along with Rajput chieftain Durgadas Rathore had arrived in Maharashtra to seek help against his father. Sambhaji had appointed Hiroji Farzand to negotiate with Akbar and Durgadas Rathore. The conspirators tried lure Akbar to their side to dethrone Sambhaji. They offered him half of the Maratha kingdom in return for his support to dethrone Sambhaji. The conspirators also tried to poison Sambhaji but the attempt failed. Akbar did not pay heed to their offer and instead informed Sambhaji about this conspiracy. Sambhaji quickly marched to [[Ballaleshwar Pali|Pali]] and arrested the conspirators near Sudhagad fort at Pali.

Sambhaji's positions were spied upon by his own relations, the Shirke family, who had defected to the Mughals. Sambhaji and 25 of his advisors were captured by the Mughal forces of [[Muqarrab Khan]] in a skirmish at [[Sangameshwar]] in February 1689.<ref name=\"Mehta2005\"/>{{rp|47}}\n\nAccounts of Sambhaji's confrontation with the Mughal ruler and following torture, execution and disposal of his body, vary widely depending on the source, though generally all agree that he was tortured and executed on the emperor's orders.<ref name=\"Mehta2005\"/>{{rp|50}}\n\nThe captured Sambhaji and [[Kavi Kalash]] were taken to [[Pedgaon, Ahmednagar|Bahadurgad]] in present-day Ahmednagar district, where Aurangzeb humiliated them by parading them wearing clown's clothes and they were subjected to insults by Mughal soldiers. Accounts vary as to the reasons for what came next: Mughal accounts state that Sambhaji was asked to surrender his forts, treasures and names of Mughal collaborators with the Marathas and that he sealed his fate by insulting both the emperor and the Islamic prophet Muhammad during interrogation and was executed for having killed Muslims.<ref>{{cite book|first=John F. |last=Richards |authorlink=John F.

[[Keshav Pandit]] was employed for Sambhaji's education. Keshav Pandit, alias Keshav Bhatta of Shringarpur, was an erudite scholar in the Nitishastra and Sanskrit language and literature. He seems to have deeper knowledge of the different forms of Sanskrit literature; Hindu jurisprudence and the Puranas. He also seems to have made Sambhaji familiar with the famous works of different sciences and music written by ancient scholars in the Sanskrit language.<ref name=\"Joshi1980\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ngBAAAAMAAJ&q=Keshav+Pandit+Sambhaji&dq=Keshav+Pandit+Sambhaji&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4nJWctqfaAhXMPo8KHa3gDC8Q6AEIJzAA|title=Chhatrapati Sambhaji, 1657\u20131689 A.D.|last=Joshi|first=Pandit Shankar|date=1980|publisher=S.

He spent seven years in the theatre, working in a succession of [[repertory theatre|stock companies]] and intermittently on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Tracy's breakthrough came in 1930, when his [[Leading man|lead]] performance in ''[[The Last Mile (play)|The Last Mile]]'' caught the attention of [[Hollywood]]. After a successful film debut in [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Up the River]]'' starring Tracy (and also featuring [[Humphrey Bogart]]), he was signed to a contract with [[Fox Film Corporation]]. His five years with Fox featured one acting tour de force after another that were usually ignored at the box office, and he remained largely unknown to audiences after 25 films, almost all of them starring Tracy as the leading man. None of them were hits although his performance in ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' (1933) was praised at the time.\n\nIn 1935, Tracy joined [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], then Hollywood's most prestigious studio. His career flourished from ''[[Fury (1936 film)|Fury]]'' (1936) onwards, and in 1937 and 1938 he won consecutive Oscars for ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' and ''[[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]''. He made three box-office successes supporting [[Clark Gable]], the studio's most prominent leading man so that by the early 1940s, Tracy was one of the studio's top stars. In 1942, he appeared with [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[Woman of the Year]]'', beginning another partnership leading to nine movies over 25 years.\n\nTracy left MGM in 1955, and continued to work regularly as a freelance star, despite an increasing weariness as he aged. His personal life was troubled, with a lifelong struggle against severe [[alcoholism]] and guilt over his son's [[Hearing loss|deafness]]. Tracy became estranged from his wife in the 1930s, but the couple never divorced, conducting a long-term relationship with Katharine Hepburn in private. Towards the end of his life, Tracy worked almost exclusively for director [[Stanley Kramer]]. It was for Kramer that he made his last film, ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), completed just 17 days before he died.\n\nDuring his career, Tracy appeared in 75 films and developed a reputation among his peers as one of the screen's greatest actors. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Tracy as the 9th greatest [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|male star]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classic Hollywood Cinema]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Stars |publisher=American Film Institute |date=June 16, 1999 |accessdate=February 20, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113043532/http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |archivedate=January 13, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Spencer Tracy yearbook photo - 1919.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tracy at the [[Northwestern Military and Naval Academy]] in 1919]]\n\nSpencer Bonaventure Tracy was born in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on April 5, 1900,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/spencer-tracy/ |title=Los Angeles Times Hollywood Star Walk \u2013 Spencer Tracy |website=latimes.com |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 20, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507044234/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/spencer-tracy/ |archivedate=May 7, 2016 }}</ref> the second son of Caroline (n\u00e9e Brown; 1874\u20131942) and truck salesman John Edward Tracy (1873\u20131928).

One of the major stars of [[Classic Hollywood cinema|Hollywood's Golden Age]], Tracy won two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] from nine nominations, sharing the record for nominations in the category with [[Laurence Olivier]].\n\nTracy first discovered his talent for acting while attending [[Ripon College (Wisconsin)|Ripon College]], and he later received a scholarship for the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]]. He spent seven years in the theatre, working in a succession of [[repertory theatre|stock companies]] and intermittently on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Tracy's breakthrough came in 1930, when his [[Leading man|lead]] performance in ''[[The Last Mile (play)|The Last Mile]]'' caught the attention of [[Hollywood]]. After a successful film debut in [[John Ford]]'s ''[[Up the River]]'' starring Tracy (and also featuring [[Humphrey Bogart]]), he was signed to a contract with [[Fox Film Corporation]]. His five years with Fox featured one acting tour de force after another that were usually ignored at the box office, and he remained largely unknown to audiences after 25 films, almost all of them starring Tracy as the leading man. None of them were hits although his performance in ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' (1933) was praised at the time.\n\nIn 1935, Tracy joined [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], then Hollywood's most prestigious studio. His career flourished from ''[[Fury (1936 film)|Fury]]'' (1936) onwards, and in 1937 and 1938 he won consecutive Oscars for ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' and ''[[Boys Town (film)|Boys Town]]''. He made three box-office successes supporting [[Clark Gable]], the studio's most prominent leading man so that by the early 1940s, Tracy was one of the studio's top stars. In 1942, he appeared with [[Katharine Hepburn]] in ''[[Woman of the Year]]'', beginning another partnership leading to nine movies over 25 years.\n\nTracy left MGM in 1955, and continued to work regularly as a freelance star, despite an increasing weariness as he aged. His personal life was troubled, with a lifelong struggle against severe [[alcoholism]] and guilt over his son's [[Hearing loss|deafness]]. Tracy became estranged from his wife in the 1930s, but the couple never divorced, conducting a long-term relationship with Katharine Hepburn in private. Towards the end of his life, Tracy worked almost exclusively for director [[Stanley Kramer]]. It was for Kramer that he made his last film, ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), completed just 17 days before he died.\n\nDuring his career, Tracy appeared in 75 films and developed a reputation among his peers as one of the screen's greatest actors. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Tracy as the 9th greatest [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|male star]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classic Hollywood Cinema]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |title=AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Stars |publisher=American Film Institute |date=June 16, 1999 |accessdate=February 20, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113043532/http://www.afi.com/100years/stars.aspx |archivedate=January 13, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Spencer Tracy yearbook photo - 1919.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Tracy at the [[Northwestern Military and Naval Academy]] in 1919]]\n\nSpencer Bonaventure Tracy was born in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on April 5, 1900,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/spencer-tracy/ |title=Los Angeles Times Hollywood Star Walk \u2013 Spencer Tracy |website=latimes.com |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 20, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507044234/http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/spencer-tracy/ |archivedate=May 7, 2016 }}</ref> the second son of Caroline (n\u00e9e Brown; 1874\u20131942) and truck salesman John Edward Tracy (1873\u20131928).

In this case, best practices for getting a good face seal include trying different models or sizes, using a mirror or asking a colleague to check that the respirator is touching the face, and doing multiple user seal checks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGiven that the global supply of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) is insufficient during the pandemic, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends minimizing the need for PPE through [[telemedicine]], physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE [[supply chain]], and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331215/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf|title=Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)|last=|first=|date=2020-02-27|website=World Health Organization|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nWhen it is no longer possible for all healthcare workers to wear N95 respirators when caring for a COVID-19 patient, CDC recommends that respirators be prioritized for workers performing aerosol-generating procedures on symptomatic persons, and those within three feet of an unmasked symptomatic person. Under these conditions, masking of symptomatic patients with a [[surgical mask]] and maintaining distance from the patient are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission.  When no respirators are left, workers who are at higher risk for severe illness may be excluded from caring for patients, and workers who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 may be preferred to care for patients.  Portable fans with [[HEPA]] filters may also be used to increase ventilation in isolation rooms when surgical masks are being used in place of respirators.  If neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, such as [[Cloth face mask|cloth face masks]], though caution should be exercised when considering this option.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Decontamination ====\nDisposable filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 masks are not approved for routine decontamination and reuse as standard of care.

In this case, best practices for getting a good face seal include trying different models or sizes, using a mirror or asking a colleague to check that the respirator is touching the face, and doing multiple user seal checks.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGiven that the global supply of [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE) is insufficient during the pandemic, the [[World Health Organization]] recommends minimizing the need for PPE through [[telemedicine]], physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE [[supply chain]], and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite web|url=https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331215/WHO-2019-nCov-IPCPPE_use-2020.1-eng.pdf|title=Rational use of personal protective equipment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)|last=|first=|date=2020-02-27|website=World Health Organization|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\nWhen it is no longer possible for all healthcare workers to wear N95 respirators when caring for a COVID-19 patient, CDC recommends that respirators be prioritized for workers performing aerosol-generating procedures on symptomatic persons, and those within three feet of an unmasked symptomatic person. Under these conditions, masking of symptomatic patients with a [[surgical mask]] and maintaining distance from the patient are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission.  When no respirators are left, workers who are at higher risk for severe illness may be excluded from caring for patients, and workers who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 may be preferred to care for patients.  Portable fans with [[HEPA]] filters may also be used to increase ventilation in isolation rooms when surgical masks are being used in place of respirators.  If neither respirators nor surgical masks are available, as a last resort, it may be necessary for healthcare workers to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks, such as [[Cloth face mask|cloth face masks]], though caution should be exercised when considering this option.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Decontamination ====\nDisposable filtering facepiece respirators such as N95 masks are not approved for routine decontamination and reuse as standard of care.
