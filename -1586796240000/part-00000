Tramontana is a pure driver's supercar for authentic engine lovers. It is built by [[Atelier Tramontana]], in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]] ([[Spain]]). It was launched as a [[Concept car|concept]] at the 2005 [[Geneva Motor Show]], and subsequently modified for production. It began as a project with the aim of breaking with conventionalisms and creating a new family of [[supercar]]s. Only 6 a year are manufactured and they are all made under special request. In 2009, Tramontana introduced a closed top model named Tramontana R.,<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.km77.com/00/tramontana/r/2009/t01.asp|title=Km77.com article|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/evocarreviews/235370/tramontana_r_edition.html|title=EVO Magazine article}}</ref> and the XTR version in 2012.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.autobild.es/noticias/tramontana-xtr-186646|title=Tramontana XTR, m\u00e1s potencia para el deportivo espa\u00f1ol|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=http://noticias.coches.com/noticias-motor/tramontana-xtr-el-superdeportivo-espanol-sube-a-888-cv/56383|title=Tramontana XTR, el superdeportivo espa\u00f1ol sube a 888 CV}}</ref> The company is focused on the '''Tramontana Car''', which is a [[bespoke]] [[supercar]] fully customizable by the driver.\n\n==Overview==\n\nEach unit requires over 4000 working hours. '''Tramontana''' clients are meticulously chosen. There are no two identical units; once a '''Tramontana''' is produced, there will be no other like it. The vehicle took over ten years of development to get to its current state, an arduous undertaking from the engineering team and the active Formula 1 drivers who took part in the process.\n\n===Engine and Transmission===\nThe most radical models are the Tramontana GT and the Tramontana XTR. The car is fitted with an aluminium [[mid-engined]] 5.500cc [[double overhead cam]] [[V12 engine|V12]] [[Mercedes-Benz]], twin-turbocharged engine that produces up to {{convert|900|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and 980Nm (678lbs of torque). Each [[Mercedes-Benz]] engine is rebuilt, modified and reassembled by Tramontana's racing engineers. Before fitting it into the car, Atelier Tramontana carries out a rigorous test of each engine at their production plant in Barcelona. '''Tramontana''' opted from its beginnings to drastically limit its annual production in order to maintain exhaustive control over each unit produced.\n\nOther models are fitted with a V10 naturally aspirated engine that develops {{convert|660|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.  This, in combination with a 6-speed sequential gearbox, launches the car from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h in under 2.8 seconds,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/02/26/tramontana-r-edition-a-carbon-fiber-v12-monster/|title=Tramontana R Edition - A Carbon Fiber V12 Monster|publisher=Automoblog.net}}</ref> and it gets a top speed of more than {{convert|325|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Exterior and Interior===\n[[Atelier Tramontana]] established that each car has to be different from every other unit produced by the company. They define their product as a [[bespoke]] [[supercar]] where every detail is designed by and for the driver. As with a Formula 1, there are only a few units.\n\nThe Tramontana is made up of the [[carbon fibre]] [[monocoque]] [[chassis]], with a honeycomb-shaped structure that provides minimal density and extremely high resistance. The [[Formula One]] safety cell that cocoons the driver, protecting them from injuries, allows weight reduction for the car. The Tramontana's carbon fiber monocoque was defined under FIA design and security standards. The chassis rigidity is synonymous with high performance, chiefly in the world of high competition, since it is one of the key factors in the dynamics of the vehicle, in addition to the suspension system. The Tramontana chassis is the most rigid in the world, even more than that of an authentic Formula 1. It supports 40G's of force before deforming.\n \nEach curve in the bodywork was meticulously calculated and optimized to generate more than 250&nbsp;kg of [[downforce]], and lateral cornering forces of 1.3 [[g-force|G]] at high speeds. The Tramontana is fully customizable by the client, but the standard package comes with forged aluminum wheels, measuring 20\". Highlights include different aerodynamic options available to be chosen depending on the use of the car, and a single [[canopy door]] that allows access to the [[tandem]] [[cockpit]]. This helps the mass distribution of the vehicle. If the two seat option is chosen, the passenger sits directly behind and slightly higher than the driver, resembling a [[fighter-jet]]s [[tandem]] position. \n\nThe interior is a mix of [[aluminium]], [[carbon fibre]] and [[leather]]. The customer also has the option to decorate the interior with gold and other fine materials. Only one of each car interior is produced and cannot be replicated. The [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] badge is made of solid [[white gold]].\n\n=== Vehicle dynamics ===\nThe car weighs {{convert|1268|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, with a suitable weight distribution and a low center of gravity, which allows it to\u00a0turn curves at higher speeds.\n\nTramontana equips the car with elements of the highest possible performance. The suspension is an adjustable \u00d6hlins [[double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]], a sequential six-speed paddle shift transmission, 380mm carbon-ceramic disc brakes with 6-piston AP Racing caliper. \n\nThe car has a suspension lifting system to adjust ride height depending on the road conditions. Electronic aids like traction control system and ABS are adjustable for different driving modes, from 0 (manual control) to 6.\n\n=== History ===\n\nThe Tramontana was launched as a [[Concept car|concept]] at the 2005 [[Geneva Motor Show]], and was subsequently modified for production. In 2009, Tramontana introduced a closed top model named Tramontana R.,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> and the XTR version in 2012.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nFrom the beginning, this automaker maintains a policy of super-confidentiality and extreme rigor in the sales process while choosing the end customer.\n\nThis inaccessibility of the automaker towards the average customer, even though it has sufficient resources to acquire the vehicle, has resulted in the brand obtaining recognition among collectors. At present there are units in Europe, America, the Arab Emirates and China, but there is no information about their final customers or their exact location. One unit was spotted on an episode of [[Live PD]] during a traffic stop in East Providence, RI, USA on 8/23/2019. <ref>Live PD Rewind, Episode #258, aired 8/23/2019, A&E Network</ref>\n\nThe first vehicle built was the Concept Car fitted with a V10 engine.\n\nTramontana built an exclusive series of eight  Tramontana cars, the GT and XTR. Car No.1 in the series was the factory test vehicle, which was used to perform dynamic improvements of the vehicle. Nowadays it is almost certainly the most improved unit. Cars No.2 and No.3 were sold in Beijing. Car No.4 of was acquired in Abu Dhabi, and car No.5 in Germany. The next two units were destined for the North American market. The last unit, No.8 out of 8, is currently in Spain, at the company's family headquarters. There is no exact record of the price, but the price is set between \u20ac800,000 ($911,000) and \u20ac1,100,000 ($1,253,000)\n\nIn 2019, the company continues developing its models and researching modern technology, chiefly regarding alternative propulsion technologies.\n\nThey have also worked on a 100% electric Tramontana intended for drift competitions.\n\n== Models ==\n[[Tramontana C-Edition|C-Edition]] (V10 600 hp & V12 550 hp)\n\n[[Tramontana S-Edition|S-Edition]] (V10 600 hp & V12 550 hp)\n\n[[Tramontana R-Edition|R-Edition]] (V10 600 hp & V12 550-720 hp)\n\n[[Tramontana XTR|XTR]] (V12 720/888 hp)\n\n== Specifications ==\n\n=== Engines ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Type\n!Layout\n!Displacement\n!Admission\n!Max Power\n!Specific Output\n!Max Torque\n!Compression\n!Fuel\n|-\n|5.2 litre V10 - 90\u00ba, FSI\n|Mid-engine, Longitudinal Alignment Rear Wheel Drive\n|5.204 cm<sup>3</sup> / 317,6 in<sup>3</sup>\n|Naturally Aspirated\n|600 hp / 447kW / at 8.500 rpm\n|115 hp-litre / 86kW-litre / 2,13 hp in<sup>3</sup> / 1,58kW in<sup>3</sup>\n|580 Nm / 428lbs / ft. from 6.500 rpm\n|12,5:1\n|Unleaded 98 octanes\n|-\n|5.5 litre V12 - 60\u00ba, SFI Biturbo\n|Mid-engine, Longitudinal Alignment Rear Wheel Drive\n|5.513 cm<sup>3</sup> / 336,4 in<sup>3</sup> \n|Twin Turbochargers\n|888 hp / 653 kW / at 5.850 rpm\n|130 hp-litre / 96kW-litre / 1,88 hp in<sup>3</sup> / 1,41kW in<sup>3</sup>\n|920 Nm / 678lbs / ft. from 4.000 rpm\n|9:1\n|Unleaded 98 octanes\n|}\n\n==In video games==\nThe Tramontana appears as a playable vehicle in ''[[Asphalt 8: Airborne]]'' and ''[[Asphalt (series)|Asphalt Nitro]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://tramontanacorp.com/ Official Tramontana web site]\n\n{{Automotive industry in Spain}}\n\n[[Category:Cars of Spain]]\n[[Category:Car manufacturers of Spain]]\n[[Category:Sports cars]]\n[[Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:2010s cars]]\n[[Category:Flagship vehicles]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Catalonia]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 2005]]\n[[Category:2005 establishments in Spain]]\n[[Category:Spanish brands]]\n", "text_old": "{{advert|date=August 2018}}<br />{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Tramontana\n| image = 2009 Tramontana R.jpg\n| manufacturer = Atelier Tramontana\n| production = 2007-present\n| assembly = [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]<br />[[Andorra la Vella]], [[Andorra]]\n| designer = \n| class = [[Sports car]] ([[S-segment|S]])\n| body_style = 2-seater [[Formula One]]-inspired\n| layout = [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout]]\n| engine = '''V10 Version:'''<br />{{convert|5.2|L|cuin|abbr=on|0}} [[V10 engine|V10]] [[naturally aspirated]] {{convert|660|PS|kW bhp|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}<br /> '''V12 Version:'''<br />{{convert|5.5|L|cuin|abbr=on|0}} [[V12 engine|V12]] twin-[[turbocharged]] {{convert|900|PS|kW bhp|0|lk=on|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 6-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission|sequential]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|3050|mm|in|1}}\n| length = {{convert|4900|mm|in|1}}\n| width = {{convert|2080|mm|in|1}}\n| height = {{convert|1220-1275|mm|in|1}}\n| weight = {{convert|1268|kg|lb|0}}\n| predecessor = \n| successor = \n| homepage = {{URL|www.tramontanacorp.com}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Tramontana Car''' is a [[mid-engine design|mid-engine]]d [[Spain|Spanish]] [[sports car]] with styling inspired by combining [[Formula One]] racing cars and [[jet-fighters]].

Second, we began expanding PayPal to eBay's international sites. And third, we started to build PayPal's business off eBay.\"<ref name=wallstfolly>{{cite web |url=http://wallstfolly.typepad.com/wallstfolly/2006/01/intel_conferenc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116122051/http://wallstfolly.typepad.com/wallstfolly/2006/01/intel_conferenc.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 16, 2006 |title=Wall Street Folly: eBay: Conference call transcript \u2013 1/18/06 |publisher=Wallstfolly.typepad.com |accessdate=January 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==== Phase 1 ====\n\nIn the first phase, payment volumes were coming mostly from the eBay auction website. The system was very attractive to auction sellers, most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards, and for consumers as well.\nIn fact, many sellers could not qualify for a credit card Merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history. The service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund PayPal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances, without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers. PayPal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth, depositing $10 in new users' PayPal accounts.<ref name=wallstfolly/>\n\n==== Phase 2 ====\n\nUntil 2000, PayPal's strategy was to earn interest on funds in PayPal accounts. However, most recipients of PayPal credits withdrew funds immediately. Also, a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards, which cost PayPal roughly 2% of payment value per transaction.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nTo solve this problem, PayPal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts. Instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds, PayPal started relying on earnings from service charges. They offered seller protection to PayPal account holders, provided that they comply with reimbursement policies. For example, PayPal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over $750.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==== Phase 3 ====\n\nAfter fine-tuning PayPal's business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on eBay, PayPal started its off-eBay strategy. This was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms, despite the slowdown in on-eBay growth and low-single-digit user growth on the eBay site. A late 2003 reorganization created a new business unit within PayPal\u2014Merchant Services\u2014to provide payment solutions to small and large e-commerce merchants outside the eBay auction community. Starting in the second half of 2004, PayPal Merchant Services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants outside the eBay auction community, including:<ref name=wallstfolly/>\n\n* Lowering its transaction fee for high-volume merchants from 2.2% to 1.9% (while increasing the monthly transaction volume required to qualify for the lowest fee to $100,000)\n* Encouraging its users to recruit non-eBay merchants by increasing its referral bonus to a maximum of $1,000 (versus the previous $100 cap)\n* Persuading credit card gateway providers, including CyberSource and Retail Decisions USA, to include PayPal among their offerings to online merchants.\n* Hiring a new sales force to acquire large merchants such as Dell, Apple's iTunes, and Yahoo! Stores, which hosted thousands of online merchants\n* Reducing fees for online music purchases and other \"micropayments\"\n* Launching PayPal Mobile, which allowed users to make payments using text messaging on their cell phones\n\n=== Global reach ===\n\nPayPal can be used in more than 200 countries/regions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.paypal.com/al/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide | title=PayPal Global - All countries and markets - PayPal | publisher=PayPal | date=| accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nDifferent countries have different conditions: ''Send only'' (Package Service allows sending only, valid in 97 countries), ''PayPal Zero'' (package suggests the possibility of enrollment, entry, and withdrawal of funds in foreign currency, but the user can not hold the balance PayPal account, operates in 18 countries), ''SRW Send - Receive - Withdrawal'' (the possibility of enrollment, input-output and the ability to keep your PayPal account balance in the currency and to transfer to the card when the user sees fit, operates in 41 countries) and ''Local Currency'' (SRW plus opportunity to conduct transactions in the local currency, 21 countries).\n\n==== China ====\n\nIn July 2017, PayPal announced a partnership with [[Baidu]], to allow the Chinese firm\u2019s 100 million mobile wallet users to make payments to PayPal\u2019s 17 million merchants through the Baidu service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/baidu-teams-up-with-paypal/|title=Baidu teams up with PayPal to take its Chinese mobile wallet global {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Russell|first=Jon|access-date=2017-07-28}}</ref>\n\n==== Crimea ====\n\nIn January 2015, PayPal ceased operations in [[Crimea]] in compliance with international sanctions against Russia and Crimea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/russia/772897|title=TASS: Russia - PayPal system stops servicing clients in Crimea|work=TASS|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== India ====\n\nAs of March 2011, PayPal has made changes to the User Agreement for Indian users to comply with [[Reserve Bank of India]] regulations.<ref>{{cite news|title=PayPal follows RBI to restrict e-payment to Indian merchants|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-01-29/news/28426592_1_personal-payments-paypal-online-payment|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=Jan 29, 2011}}</ref> The per transaction limit had been set to USD $3,000, since October 14, 2011.

Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the [[Truth in Lending Act]] (TILA) 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z).

The policy includes a list of \"Exclusions\" which itself includes \"Intangible goods\", \"Claims for receipt of goods 'not as described{{'\"}}, and \"Total reversals over the annual limit\".<ref name=ppsafety>{{cite web| url=https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security| title=Buyer Protection & Seller Protection| publisher=PayPal| accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref> There are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself, the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to (simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller Protection Policy is in effect). The PayPal Seller Protection Policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by UK consumer legislation (e.g., Sale of Goods Act) and in addition, it cannot be enforced in the Courts because PayPal operates from Luxembourg, outside all three of the UK legal jurisdictions.<ref name=ppagreement>{{cite web| url=https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full| title=PayPal User Agreement| date=8 October 2014| publisher= PayPal| accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Security==\n\n=== Security token ===\n\n{{main|Security token}}\nIn early 2006, PayPal introduced an optional [[Security token|security key]] as an additional precaution against fraud.<ref name=forbessecurity>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2014/06/25/researchers-discover-vulnerability-in-paypals-two-factor-authentication/| title=Researchers Discover Vulnerability in PayPal's Two-Factor Authentication| author=Kate Vinton| date=25 June 2014| magazine=Forbes| accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref> A user account tied to a security key has a modified login process. Account-holders enter their login ID and password as normal but are then prompted to enter a six-digit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holder's mobile phone. For convenience, users may append the code generated by the hardware key to their password in the login screen. This way they are not prompted for it on another page. This method is required for some services, such as when using PayPal through the eBay application on iPhone.\n\nThis [[two-factor authentication]] is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key, although it does not prevent the so-called [[Man in the Browser]] (MITB) attacks. However, the user (or malicious third party) can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on their account. Thus the PayPal implementation does not offer the security of true two-factor authentication.<ref name=techhivepp>{{cite web| url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2058327/keep-your-paypal-account-safer-with-two-factor-authentication.html| title=Keep your PayPal account safer with two-factor authentication| author=Nick Mediati| date=29 October 2013| publisher=TechHive| accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== MTAN ===\n\nIt is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an [[mTAN]] (Mobile Transaction Authentication Number) via SMS.<ref>{{cite web| title=PayPal Security Key \u2013 PayPal|url=https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=xpt/Marketing_CommandDriven/securitycenter/PayPalSecurityKey-outside| accessdate=August 18, 2009}}</ref> Use of a security code that is sent to the account holder's mobile phone is currently free.<ref>[http://www.moonlightceo.com/paypal-secrets/ MoonlightCEO.com] Moonlight CEO, PayPal Secrets, October 28, 2013</ref>\n\n== Fraud ==\n\nAs early as 2001, PayPal had substantial problems with [[online fraud]], especially international hackers who were hacking into PayPal accounts and transferring small amounts of money out of multiple accounts.

Second, we began expanding PayPal to eBay's international sites. And third, we started to build PayPal's business off eBay.\"<ref name=wallstfolly>{{cite web |url=http://wallstfolly.typepad.com/wallstfolly/2006/01/intel_conferenc.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116122051/http://wallstfolly.typepad.com/wallstfolly/2006/01/intel_conferenc.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 16, 2006 |title=Wall Street Folly: eBay: Conference call transcript \u2013 1/18/06 |publisher=Wallstfolly.typepad.com |accessdate=January 20, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==== Phase 1 ====\n\nIn the first phase, payment volumes were coming mostly from the eBay auction website. The system was very attractive to auction sellers, most of which were individuals or small businesses that were unable to accept credit cards, and for consumers as well.\nIn fact, many sellers could not qualify for a credit card Merchant account because they lacked a commercial credit history. The service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund PayPal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances, without divulging credit card numbers to unknown sellers. PayPal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth, depositing $10 in new users' PayPal accounts.<ref name=wallstfolly/>\n\n==== Phase 2 ====\n\nUntil 2000, PayPal's strategy was to earn interest on funds in PayPal accounts. However, most recipients of PayPal credits withdrew funds immediately. Also, a large majority of senders funded their payments using credit cards, which cost PayPal roughly 2% of payment value per transaction.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nTo solve this problem, PayPal tailored its product to cater more to business accounts. Instead of relying on interests earned from deposited funds, PayPal started relying on earnings from service charges. They offered seller protection to PayPal account holders, provided that they comply with reimbursement policies. For example, PayPal merchants are either required to retain a traceable proof of shipping to a confirmed address or to provide a signed receipt for items valued over $750.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==== Phase 3 ====\n\nAfter fine-tuning PayPal's business model and increasing its domestic and international penetration on eBay, PayPal started its off-eBay strategy. This was based on developing stronger growth in active users by adding users across multiple platforms, despite the slowdown in on-eBay growth and low-single-digit user growth on the eBay site. A late 2003 reorganization created a new business unit within PayPal\u2014Merchant Services\u2014to provide payment solutions to small and large e-commerce merchants outside the eBay auction community. Starting in the second half of 2004, PayPal Merchant Services unveiled several initiatives to enroll online merchants outside the eBay auction community, including:<ref name=wallstfolly/>\n\n* Lowering its transaction fee for high-volume merchants from 2.2% to 1.9% (while increasing the monthly transaction volume required to qualify for the lowest fee to $100,000)\n* Encouraging its users to recruit non-eBay merchants by increasing its referral bonus to a maximum of $1,000 (versus the previous $100 cap)\n* Persuading credit card gateway providers, including CyberSource and Retail Decisions USA, to include PayPal among their offerings to online merchants.\n* Hiring a new sales force to acquire large merchants such as Dell, Apple's iTunes, and Yahoo! Stores, which hosted thousands of online merchants\n* Reducing fees for online music purchases and other \"micropayments\"\n* Launching PayPal Mobile, which allowed users to make payments using text messaging on their cell phones\n\n=== Global reach ===\n\nPayPal can be used in more than 200 countries/regions.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.paypal.com/al/webapps/mpp/country-worldwide | title=PayPal Global - All countries and markets - PayPal | publisher=PayPal | date=| accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nDifferent countries have different conditions: ''Send only'' (Package Service allows sending only, valid in 97 countries), ''PayPal Zero'' (package suggests the possibility of enrollment, entry, and withdrawal of funds in foreign currency, but the user can not hold the balance PayPal account, operates in 18 countries), ''SRW Send - Receive - Withdrawal'' (the possibility of enrollment, input-output and the ability to keep your PayPal account balance in the currency and to transfer to the card when the user sees fit, operates in 41 countries) and ''Local Currency'' (SRW plus opportunity to conduct transactions in the local currency, 21 countries).\n\n==== China ====\n\nIn July 2017, PayPal announced a partnership with [[Baidu]], to allow the Chinese firm\u2019s 100 million mobile wallet users to make payments to PayPal\u2019s 17 million merchants through the Baidu service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/27/baidu-teams-up-with-paypal/|title=Baidu teams up with PayPal to take its Chinese mobile wallet global {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Russell|first=Jon|access-date=2017-07-28}}</ref>\n\n==== Crimea ====\n\nIn January 2015, PayPal ceased operations in [[Crimea]] in compliance with international sanctions against Russia and Crimea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tass.ru/en/russia/772897|title=TASS: Russia - PayPal system stops servicing clients in Crimea|work=TASS|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== India ====\n\nAs of March 2011, PayPal has made changes to the User Agreement for Indian users to comply with [[Reserve Bank of India]] regulations.<ref>{{cite news|title=PayPal follows RBI to restrict e-payment to Indian merchants|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-01-29/news/28426592_1_personal-payments-paypal-online-payment|accessdate=16 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Economic Times]]|date=Jan 29, 2011}}</ref> The per transaction limit had been set to USD $3,000, since October 14, 2011.

Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the [[Truth in Lending Act]] (TILA) 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z).

The customer can open a dispute within 180 days (for registered UK residents 180 days, changed 14 June 2014) from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within 20 days from opening the dispute.  If the buyer used a credit card, he or she might get a refund via [[chargeback]] from his or her credit-card company. However, in the UK, where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections (that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation) under Section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1979, the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via PayPal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kukiewicz |first=Julia |url=http://www.choose.net/money/guide/features/section-75-credit-card-protection-claim.html |title=Choose.net |publisher=Choose.net |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlso, the Financial Ombudsman Service position is that section 75 protection does not apply where PayPal or any eMoney service becomes involved in the credit card transaction. This leaves consumers with no recourse to pursue their complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service. They only have recourse with the courts. However, the key issues which determine the applicability of section 75 are identified very clearly in Office of Fair Trading v Lloyds TSB Bank Plc and others [2006] EWCA Civ 268 7 and the Bank of Scotland v Alfred Truman (a firm) [2005] [EWHC] 583 (QB).

In general, the Seller Protection Policy is intended to protect the seller from certain kinds of chargebacks or complaints if the seller meets certain conditions including proof of delivery to the buyer. PayPal states the Seller Protection Policy is \"designed to protect sellers against claims by buyers of unauthorized payments and against claims of non-receipt of any merchandise\". The policy includes a list of \"Exclusions\" which itself includes \"Intangible goods\", \"Claims for receipt of goods 'not as described{{'\"}}, and \"Total reversals over the annual limit\".<ref name=ppsafety>{{cite web| url=https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security| title=Buyer Protection & Seller Protection| publisher=PayPal| accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref> There are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself, the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to (simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller Protection Policy is in effect).

Talented and intelligent since childhood, Jambhekar became a great scholar and researcher in many subjects on adulthood. He was active only for a very short period, but his exceptional work left a permanent mark on India.\n\n== Establishment of First Newspaper in Marathi Language \u2013 Darpan ==\nBalshastri Jambhekar had grasped correctly the importance and power of the print media in the coming times during British Rule in India. He was sure that if the British was to be overthrown and freedom was to be attained, then it was essential to awaken the masses and the print media was the most useful tool to that end.\n\nThe newspaper Darpan was born out of this patriotism and social awareness. He founded Darpan as the first Marathi newspaper. He was editor of this newspaper during the British rule in India. This turned out to be the beginning of Marathi journalism. Balshastri Jambhekar was only 20 years old then.\n\nHis associates in this phase included people like Govind Kunte and Bhau Mahajan.\n\nThe first issue of Darpan was published on 6 January 1832. The newspaper was printed both in English and Marathi languages in two separate columns. Marathi was meant for the general public and English was meant for the ruling British.

He tried to develop a scientific set of mind in the masses of uneducated India.\n\nThis resulted in a large-scale debate in the society and finally in a movement for the support of widow re-marriage.\n\nHe passionately desired that the knowledge should percolate in the society and Darpan was one of the means to this end. He was aware that the country could only progress with the use of scientific knowledge and a rational outlook towards social problems. He wanted to build a society having a scientific outlook. He was one of those social activists who made continuous effort in generating useful and healthy consciousness amongst the common masses and attempted to educate the uneducated. His never-dying talent and endeavour left a stamp over not only the Maharashtrian public, but across India, as a distinguished social reformer and journalist.\n\n== Other contributions ==\nBalshastri Jambhekar understood the importance of public libraries. He founded 'The Bombay Native General Library'. He also started 'Native Improvement Society', of which 'Student's Literary and Scientific Society' was an offshoot. Intellectual giants like [[Dadabhai Navroji]] and [[Bhau Daji Lad]] drew inspiration through these institutions.\n\nIn 1840 he published first Marathi monthly, Digdarshan (meaning direction in English). He edited this magazine for 5 years. Digdarshan published articles on various subjects including physics, chemistry, geography, history etc.\n\nHe had mastery in many languages including Marathi, Sanskrit, English and Hindi. Apart from that he also had a good grasp of Greek, Latin, French, Gujarati and Bengali.\n\nHe was the first Indian to have published research papers in the quarterly journal of the Asiatic Society. He was the first person to print Dnyaneshwari in 1845. It was known as the first ever-printed version.\n\nHe was also well known as the first professor of Hindi in the Elphinston College, Mumbai. He also worked as Director of the Colaba Observatory. He wrote books like Neetikatha (stories on morality), Encyclopedic History of England, English grammar, History of India and Mathematics based on Zero.\n\nHe was active during the years 1830 to 1846 and worked for the betterment of Maharashtra and India. He had a very short life span of just 34 years. But in those years as well he tried to educate people and develop a scientific mindset. He a stamp of his personality as a social reformer and a journalist during the period 1832 to 1846.\n\n== Recognition ==\nFor these contributions in the form of first Marathi newspaper and first Marathi monthly, he is acknowledged as The Father of Marathi Journalism.

{"title_page": "Medicare Advantage", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=September 2019}}\n\n'''Medicare Advantage''' (sometimes called '''Medicare Part C''' or '''MA''') is a type of [[health insurance]] plan in the [[United States]] that provides [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits through a [[Private sector|private-sector]] health insurer.<ref>\"Medicare & You: 2020\", p. 55.

Typically, the plan also includes [[Medicare_(United_States)#Part_D:_Prescription_drug_plans|prescription drug (\"Part D\") coverage]].<ref>\"Fact Sheet: Medicare Advantage\". Kaiser Family Foundation, June 6, 2019. Accessed January 18, 2020. https://www.kff.org/medicare/fact-sheet/medicare-advantage/.

In 2019, 90% of Medicare Advantage plans offer prescription drug coverage, while most Medicare Advantage enrollees (88%) select this benefit.\")</ref> Many plans also offer additional benefits, such as dental coverage or gym memberships.<ref>\"Medicare & You: 2020\", p. 56.</ref> By contrast, under so-called \"Original Medicare\", a Medicare beneficiary pays a monthly premium to the federal government and receives coverage for Part A and Part B services, but must purchase other coverage (e.g., for prescription drugs) separately.<ref>\"Medicare & You: 2020\", p. 8</ref>\n\nMost such plans are [[health maintenance organization]]s (HMOs) or [[preferred provider organization]]s (PPOs).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Public Medicare Part C plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, finance at a minimum the same medical services as \"Original\" Parts A and B [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] finance via FFS. Public Part C plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, also typically finance additional services, including additional health services; in 2019 extensive non-medical services such as assistance for daily living (ADL) services were added by many plan sponsors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}  A public Part C Medicare Advantage beneficiary must first sign up for both Part A and Part B of Medicare in order to choose Part C. \n\nFrom a beneficiary's point of view, there are several key differences between Original Medicare and Part C. For example, Medicare Advantage plans include an annual out of pocket (OOP) spend limit, critical financial protection against the costs of catastrophic illness or accident. That is, under Part C plans, there is a limit on how much a beneficiary will have to spend annually OOP. That amount is unlimited in Medicare Parts A and B, which can cause financial ruin and incents almost everyone on just Parts A and B to make other financial protection arrangements, typically by adding some kind of private supplemental indemnity insurance (and even those policies often do not provide absolute 100% financial protection because they only cover what Parts A and B cover to the limits of Parts A and B).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOriginal Medicare and Medicare Advantage also handle payments to healthcare providers differently. Under Original Medicare, the Medicare program reimburses healthcare providers with a fee for each service provided to a beneficiary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} This fee is often calculated with a formula (for example, the [[prospective payment system]] for hospital services), and while providers can reject Medicare's reimbursement rates (and thus opt out of the Medicare program), they cannot bargain over the reimbursement rates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} By contrast, most Medicare Advantage plans negotiate payment rates and form networks with healthcare providers, similar to how purely private health insurance plans operate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} In turn, the Medicare program pays Medicare Advantage insurers a monthly fee per enrollee ([[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation]]) to cover the cost of carrying their beneficiaries.<ref name=\"nejm2018\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Neuman P, Jacobson GA |title=Medicare Advantage Checkup| journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|page=2164 |date=November 29, 2018|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhpr1804089 |url-access=limited |doi=10.1056/NEJMhpr1804089 |access-date=January 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nNearly all Medicare beneficiaries (99%{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}) will have access to at least one public Part C health plan in 2020; the average beneficiary will have access to 39{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} plans per county. This number varies yearly as new sponsors apply to CMS and/or old ones drop out (a process that takes place between January and June of the preceding year).\n\n==History==\nIn the 1970s, less than a decade after the beginning of fee for service (FFS) \"Original Medicare,\" Medicare beneficiaries gained the option to receive their Medicare benefits through managed, capitated health plans, mainly HMOs, as an alternative.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} But initially this choice was only available under temporary Medicare demonstration programs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]] formalized the demonstration programs into Medicare Part C, and introduced the term ''Medicare+Choice'' as a pseudo-brand for this option. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nInitially, fewer sponsors participated than expected, leading to less competition than expected by the Democrats{{Citation needed|reason=Who are \"the Democrats\"? Evidence that they expected more competition than what actually took place?|date=January 2020}} who in 1995 conceived what became Part C in 1997.<ref name=\"Biles2015\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Biles B, Casillas G, Guterman S|title=Competition Among Medicare's Private Health Plans: Does It Really Exist?|journal=The Commonwealth Fund|date=August 2015|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/aug/competition-medicare-private-plans-does-it-exist|accessdate=13 May 2016}}</ref> In a 2003 law, the Part C capitated-fee benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process was created effective in 2005 (for the 2006 plan year) to increase sponsor participation. However those changes also made the costs per person of the Part C program variable (whereas during the demonstration projects and under BBA the cost was 95% of the FFS cost per person). This new benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process lead to the costs per person of a beneficiary on Part C being higher than the costs per person of a person on just A and/or B (an unfair comparison given that a Part C beneficiary must be on both A and B but that is the way it was done) each year from 2006 to 2011. In addition it turned out through deeper investigation by MedPAC, the arm of Congress that researches Medicare (see any MedPAC report on Medicare Advantage, 2014-2018) and CMS that the disconnect with the original goal of Part C (to cost the Trust Funds the sames as or less per person) was primarily caused by so-called Private Fee for Service (PFFS) plans (designed primarily for the rural and urban poor) introduced in 2003, special needs plans (SNPs), and Multiple Employer Group plans (which primarily served retired [[Trade union|union members]]). A special situation relative to [[Puerto Rico]] contributed to the imbalance also. And the lack of parity even applied slightly to vanilla HMO and PPO plans nationwide for one year. The actual comparative absolute numbers (although still potentially misleading) can be found in Table II.B.1 of any Annual Medicare Trustees report. \n\nTherefore benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process changes were made in 2010 (effective for the 2012 plan year) to better align the variable per person costs of Part C and the per person costs of people just on Parts A and/or B. As a result, on average counting all the various types of Part C health plans, as reported annually by the Medicare Trustees, over the period 1997-2018 (most recent year available) the cost per person for a person on Part C has been lower on average than the cost per person for a Medicare beneficiary not on Part C (but some years it has been as much as 6% negative and other years it has been as much as 6% positive). However the numbers cannot be completely aligned in any given year without a major change in Medicare law because the benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding for Part C, which happens county by county, for any given year depends on the A and/or B per-person spending in the comparable counties two years prior.\n\nThe [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] of 2003 -- which created the benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process -- also renamed +Choice plans to \"Medicare Advantage\" plans. Other managed Medicare plans include COST plans, dual-eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) plans and PACE plans (which try to keep seniors that need non-medical custodial care in their homes).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} However 97% of the beneficiaries in Part C are in one of the roughly one dozen types of Medicare Advantage plans (HMO, employer group, SNP, regional PPO, etc.), primarily in classic vanilla HMOs.\n\nEnrollment in the public Part C health plan program, including plans called Medicare Advantage since the 2005 marketing period, grew from zero in 1997 (not counting the pre-Part C demonstration projects) to over 24 million projected in 2020. That 20,000,000-plus represents about 35%-40% of the people on Medicare. As of about 2015 over half the people fully signing up for Medicare for the first time are choosing a public Part C plan of some type as opposed to FFS Medicare (as reflected in the 0% to over 35% penetration rate growth in 21 years).\n\nAs noted millions more beneficiaries are on Part C since 2011 than before 2011 and the per-person cost numbers have been at parity or below since 2012. This is good because that was the Part C program's intention from the time in 1995 when Democrats first proposed it. One such change ended the out-of-balance PFFS plan program except for grandfathered beneficiaries. The out-of-balance Employer Group plan program was cut back beginning in 2017. On an absolute basis and even still including these out of balance Part C programs, in 2018 the Medicare Trustees spent 0.1% less on Medicare Advantage and other Part C beneficiaries per person than it did per person on Medicare beneficiaries under FFS Medicare<ref>Table II.B.1 and IV.C.1 of the 2019 Medicare Trustees report</ref>\n\n==Program structure==\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\nPublic Part C health plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, cover the same medical services as \"Original\" Medicare Parts A and B but also typically include an annual physical exam and vision and/or dental coverage of some sort, none of which are covered under Parts A and B. Medicare Part A provides FFS payments for admitted in-patient hospital care, hospice, and skilled nursing services if a person is first admitted inpatient for three days. Part B provides payments for many physician, rehabilitation and surgical services, even some that take place in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities after admittance, as well as for medically necessary outpatient hospital services such as ER, surgical center, laboratory, X-rays and diagnostic tests, certain preventative medical services (but not annual physical exams), and certain durable medical equipment and supplies. Less often, hearing and wellness benefits not found in Medicare Part B are included in a Medicare Advantage or other Part C plan. As of 2019, many additional non Part B services were added to public Part C plans, including Medicare Advantage plans. Examples of these additional services include transport to medical-service appointments, coverage of over the counter drugs, adult day care, and assistance for daily living. Some such additional non-medical services are tailored to beneficiaries with particular chronic conditions. \n\nBeneficiaries can enroll in Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans either by enrolling when they first become Medicare-eligible and first join both Parts A and B or during an annual or special enrollment period as outlined in \"Medicare and You, 2020,\" released in September 2019. There are over a dozen such enrollment periods. In addition, a special Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment period extends from January to March of each year during which the over 20,000,000 people on Medicare Advantage (but not others on Part C) can switch or drop plans. This January-March enrollment period is not to be confused with the annual election period, which was intended initially primarily for Part D of Medicare, because the January-March Open Enrollment applies only to people already on Medicare Advantage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.medicarefaq.com/faqs/medicare-advantage-open-enrollment-period/|title=Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period|last=|first=|date=|website=Medicare FAQ|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Capitation===\nFor each person who chooses to enroll in a Part C Medicare Advantage or other Part C plan, Medicare pays the health plan sponsor a set amount every month (\"capitation\"). The capitated fee associated with a Medicare Advantage and other Part C plan is specific to each county in the United States and is primarily driven by a government-administered benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process that uses that county's average per-beneficiary FFS costs from a previous year as a starting point to determine the benchmark. The fee is then adjusted up or down based on the beneficiary's personal health condition; the intent of this adjustment is that the payments be spending neutral (lower for relatively healthy plan members and higher for those who are not so healthy).\n\n===Private sponsors===\nAll four Parts of Medicare\u2014A, B and C, and D\u2014are administered by private companies under contract to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Almost all these companies are insurance companies, except for those that administer most Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans, which are not -- strictly speaking -- insurance policies. A plurality of Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are administered (CMS uses the term \"sponsored\") by non-profit integrated health delivery systems and their spin offs. Other Part C sponsors include non-profit charities under their respective states' laws, and/or are under union or religious management. However there is no rule against insurance companies sponsoring Part C plans and many do. A more common involvement of insurance companies with Part C is to act as the administrator for the non-profit sponsor (the best example being the relationship between the non-profit AARP and UnitedHealth - a health market conglomerate that began as an insurance company).\n\nPart C sponsors annually submit bids that allow them to participate in the program. All bids that meet the necessary requirements are accepted. The bids are compared to the pre-determined benchmark amounts set, which are the maximum amount Medicare will pay a plan in a given county. If a plan's bid is higher than the benchmark, enrollees pay the difference between the benchmark and the bid in the form of a monthly premium, in addition to the Medicare Part B premium. (Because of the county-specific nature of the framework and the bidding process leading to these differences, the same sponsor might offer the same benefits under the same brand name in adjacent counties at different prices.) If the bid is lower than the benchmark, the plan and Medicare share the difference between the bid and the benchmark; the plan's share of this amount is known as a \"rebate,\" which must be used by the plan's sponsor to provide additional benefits or reduced costs to enrollees. A rebate cannot contribute to \"profit\" (\"profit\" is in quotes because most Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are sponsored by non-profit organizations, primarily integrated health delivery systems).\n\nThis benchmark/bidding/rebate process accounts for from 97% to 100% of the cost of the given Medicare Advantage plan to the Medicare Trust Funds. The individual fee for each Part C beneficiary is also uplifted or downsized slightly (approximately 1%-3% in either direction on average) from the county-specific fee based on a risk-based formula tied to the personal health characteristics of the capitated individual. The theory is that the risk-based formula will not affect spending, but in practice it almost always increases cost per beneficiary by one or two percent, either because the Medicare Advantage plan is diligent in upcoding to a beneficiary's specific risks or because patients on FFS Medicare, where providers have no incentive to code at all, are undercoded.\n\nBased on the 2019 benchmark/bidding/rebate process, the Medicare Advantage average monthly plan premium in 2020 is estimated to decrease 14 percent to $23.00 from an average of $26.87 in 2019. Since 2017, the average monthly Medicare Advantage premium has decreased by an estimated 27.9 percent. This is the lowest that the average monthly premium for a Medicare Advantage plan has been since 2007 right after the second year of the benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process. But these averages mask wide regional and beneficial differences. Just as the most important benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the major determinant of monthly premium differences is the size of that protection. By law, a Part C beneficiary cannot spend more than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical services; it is plans with this limit that have the lowest premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as low as $1500 annually but of course -- for these plans -- the premium is higher.  The average OOP limit in 2018 was around $5000. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is often reported. It is just the opposite of a deductible; it is a financial-protection upper-bound. \n\nIt is rare for a Medicare Advantage beneficiary to reach the annual OOP limit but it provides a stop-loss feature that is also found in most private health insurance but not in \"Original Medicare.\" Medicare Parts A and B provide no similar OOP spending cap and the exposure of a Medicare Part A and/or B beneficiary to a financial catastrophe is unlimited (but also rare). Once the OOP maximum is reached for an individual under a Part C health plan, the plan pays 100% of medical services for the remainder of the calendar year. That protection has no lifetime maximum, another problem with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime limit on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP limit does not apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage (which uses another less beneficial means of addressing catastrophic costs just as with all of Part D).\n\nMedicare beneficiaries will also have more plan choices in 2020, with about 1,200 more Medicare Advantage plans operating than in 2018.\n\n===Benefits===\nPublic Part C health plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, not only cover the same medical services as \"Original Medicare\" Parts A and B but also typically include an annual physical exam and vision and/or dental coverage of some sort, none of which are covered under Medicare Parts A and B. Other examples of these additional non-medical services include transport to medical-service appointments, coverage of over the counter drugs, adult day care, and assistance for daily living. Medicare Part A provides FFS payments for admitted in-patient hospital care, hospice, and skilled nursing services if a person is first admitted inpatient for three days. Part B provides payments for many physician and surgical services, even some that take place in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities after admittance, as well as for medically necessary outpatient hospital services such as ER, surgical center, laboratory, X-rays and diagnostic tests, certain preventative medical services, and certain durable medical equipment and supplies). Less often, hearing and wellness benefits not found in Original Medicare are included in a Medicare Advantage plan. Some Part C plans waive the antiquated \"three-day rule\" of Medicare Part A (since it makes no medical sense and costs less in multiple ways to more quickly move a patient to rehab, the primary reason for admission to a skilled nursing facility under Medicare Part A)\n\nIn addition Medicare Advantage plans may cover benefits in a different way. For example, plans that require higher out-of-pocket costs than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, such as skilled nursing facility care, might offer lower copayments for doctor visits to balance their benefits package. CMS limits the extent to which plans' cost-sharing can vary from that of Medicare Parts A and B. \n\n===Provider networks===\nAs noted Part C plans are required to limit out-of-pocket (OOP) spending by a beneficiary for Parts A and B type services to no more than $6,700 per year for in-network providers. \"In-network\" is the key word in that sentence and has other implications for Part C beneficiaries. The OOP limit may be higher for out of network providers in a PPO (out of network providers are typically not permitted at all in an HMO).\n\nAnd as with all HMOs\u2014no matter whether a person is on Medicare or not\u2014persons who enroll in a Medicare Advantage or other Part C HMO cannot use certain specialist physicians or out-of-network providers without prior authorization from the HMO, except in emergencies. In almost all Medicare Advantage plans\u2014HMO or otherwise\u2014the beneficiary must choose a [[primary care physician]] (PCP) to provide referrals and the beneficiary must confirm that the plan authorizes the visit to which the beneficiary was referred by the PCP. As with all HMOs, this can be a problem for people who want to use out-of-network specialists or who are hospitalized and are forced to use out-of-network doctors while hospitalized. Many Medicare Advantage PPO plans permit a subscriber to use any physician or hospital without prior authorization, but at a somewhat higher expense.\n\nIf a patient's in-network physician orders tests or procedures or refers a patient to a specialty that are not available from an in-network provider, the plan pays for the patient's procedures or services at an out-of-network location and charges in-network rates to the patient, so long as the necessary services are normally covered by the plan (the beneficiary must still obtain authorization).\n\n==Usage==\nAlthough the number of people using public Part C of Medicare has grown dramatically from almost zero since 1998 and is projected to grow dramatically, there are four   groups in particular that tend to stick with Medicare Parts A and/or B only and then add a private arrangement. First, it is increasingly common for people to continue to work after joining Medicare at age 65, and they use both Medicare Parts A and/or B (often just Part A) and employer sponsored insurance, and delay deciding between FFS Medicare and capitated-fee Medicare until the employer sponsored insurance is no longer available. Second, many retired people -- particularly people over age 75 or former government employees -- receive group insurance as a benefit of their former employment and these group policies tend not to be Part C plans (although that is changing). Third, people who live in two different geographical areas of the country at different times of the year (mostly so-called snowbirds) find it difficult to live with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. Fourth, sicker people and people with higher medical expenditures are more likely to switch from Medicare Advantage plans to Medicare Parts A and B only, a statistic primarily driven by people on Medicaid in custodial care at nursing homes; people on both Medicare and Medicaid no longer have need of any Medicare supplement, either a public Part C plan or a private Medigap or group retirement plan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Riley|first1=Gerald|date=2012|title=Impact of Continued Biased Disenrollment from the Medicare Advantage Program to Fee-for-Service|journal=Medicare & Medicaid Research Review|volume=2|issue=4|pages=E1\u2013E17|doi=10.5600/mmrr.002.04.a08|pmid=24800156|pmc=4006478}}</ref>  The Part C [[risk equalization|risk adjusted]] payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it is unclear how effective that equalization program is.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jason|first2=Mark|last2=Duggan|first3=Ilyana|last3=Kuziemko|first4=William|last4=Woolston|year=2014|title=How Does Risk Selection Respond to Risk Adjustment?

Most research suggests that enrollees in Medicare HMOs tend to receive more preventative services than beneficiaries in traditional Medicare; however, beneficiaries, especially those in poorer health, tend to rate the quality and access to care in traditional Medicare more favorably than in Medicare Advantage. In other words, the research on Medicare HMOs is the same as the research on all HMOs. In the case of Medicare Part C, it is difficult to generalize the results of research either way across all plans participating in the program because performance on quality and access metrics varies widely across the types of Medicare Advantage plans and among the hundreds of sponsors of Medicare Advantage plans and those plans' thousands of providers. That is why having choice between types of Medicare and many choices within Part C is so important.\n\n==References==\n\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--see http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/staticpages/rating/planrating-help.aspx? -->\n\n==External links==\n\n===Government links - current===\n*[https://www.cms.gov/ CMS official web site] at cms.gov\n*[https://archive.is/20130918113944/https://opencrs.com/document/M20130326/ Legal Issues Relating to the Secretary\u2019s Authority to Set Payment Rates Under the Medicare Advantage Program] [[Congressional Research Service]]\n*[https://www.medicare.gov/ Medicare.gov] &mdash; the official website for people with Medicare\n\n===Private links===\n*[http://www.agis.com/Eldercare-Basics/Legal-and-Financial/Medicare-and-Medicaid/ Medicare & Medicaid Resources] &mdash; Medicare information site\n*[http://www.kff.org/medicare Kaiser Family Foundation] &mdash; Wide range of free information about the Medicare program and other U.S. health issues including [http://kff.org/state-category/medicare/ state-level data on health care spending and utilization, including Medicare].\n* [http://www.allhealth.org/issues.asp?wi=7 Medicare - Alliance for Health Reform] The nonpartisan, nonprofit Alliance for Health Reform offers information about health reform, in a number of formats, to elected officials and their staffs, journalists, policy analysts and advocates.\n* [http://www.ssdrc.com Social Security and Disability News Resource Center]\n* [http://health.howstuffworks.com/medicare.htm How Stuff Works - Medicare]\n\n[[Category:Managed care]]\n[[Category:Medicare and Medicaid (United States)]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=September 2019}}\n\n'''Medicare Advantage''' (sometimes called '''Medicare Part C''' or '''MA''') is a type of [[health insurance]] plan in the [[United States]] that provides [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits through a [[Private sector|private-sector]] health insurer.<ref>\"Medicare & You: 2020\", p. 55.

Public Part C plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, also typically finance additional services, including additional health services; in 2019 extensive non-medical services such as assistance for daily living (ADL) services were added by many plan sponsors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}  A public Part C Medicare Advantage beneficiary must first sign up for both Part A and Part B of Medicare in order to choose Part C. \n\nFrom a beneficiary's point of view, there are several key differences between Original Medicare and Part C. For example, Medicare Advantage plans include an annual out of pocket (OOP) spend limit, critical financial protection against the costs of catastrophic illness or accident. That is, under Part C plans, there is a limit on how much a beneficiary will have to spend annually OOP. That amount is unlimited in Medicare Parts A and B, which can cause financial ruin and incents almost everyone on just Parts A and B to make other financial protection arrangements, typically by adding some kind of private supplemental indemnity insurance (and even those policies often do not provide absolute 100% financial protection because they only cover what Parts A and B cover to the limits of Parts A and B).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nOriginal Medicare and Medicare Advantage also handle payments to healthcare providers differently. Under Original Medicare, the Medicare program reimburses healthcare providers with a fee for each service provided to a beneficiary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} This fee is often calculated with a formula (for example, the [[prospective payment system]] for hospital services), and while providers can reject Medicare's reimbursement rates (and thus opt out of the Medicare program), they cannot bargain over the reimbursement rates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} By contrast, most Medicare Advantage plans negotiate payment rates and form networks with healthcare providers, similar to how purely private health insurance plans operate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} In turn, the Medicare program pays Medicare Advantage insurers a monthly fee per enrollee ([[Capitation (healthcare)|capitation]]) to cover the cost of carrying their beneficiaries.<ref name=\"nejm2018\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Neuman P, Jacobson GA |title=Medicare Advantage Checkup| journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|page=2164 |date=November 29, 2018|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhpr1804089 |url-access=limited |doi=10.1056/NEJMhpr1804089 |access-date=January 18, 2020}}</ref>\n\nNearly all Medicare beneficiaries (99%{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}) will have access to at least one public Part C health plan in 2020; the average beneficiary will have access to 39{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} plans per county.

However those changes also made the costs per person of the Part C program variable (whereas during the demonstration projects and under BBA the cost was 95% of the FFS cost per person). This new benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process lead to the costs per person of a beneficiary on Part C being higher than the costs per person of a person on just A and/or B (an unfair comparison given that a Part C beneficiary must be on both A and B but that is the way it was done) each year from 2006 to 2011. In addition it turned out through deeper investigation by MedPAC, the arm of Congress that researches Medicare (see any MedPAC report on Medicare Advantage, 2014-2018) and CMS that the disconnect with the original goal of Part C (to cost the Trust Funds the sames as or less per person) was primarily caused by so-called Private Fee for Service (PFFS) plans (designed primarily for the rural and urban poor) introduced in 2003, special needs plans (SNPs), and Multiple Employer Group plans (which primarily served retired [[Trade union|union members]]). A special situation relative to [[Puerto Rico]] contributed to the imbalance also. And the lack of parity even applied slightly to vanilla HMO and PPO plans nationwide for one year. The actual comparative absolute numbers (although still potentially misleading) can be found in Table II.B.1 of any Annual Medicare Trustees report. \n\nTherefore benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process changes were made in 2010 (effective for the 2012 plan year) to better align the variable per person costs of Part C and the per person costs of people just on Parts A and/or B. As a result, on average counting all the various types of Part C health plans, as reported annually by the Medicare Trustees, over the period 1997-2018 (most recent year available) the cost per person for a person on Part C has been lower on average than the cost per person for a Medicare beneficiary not on Part C (but some years it has been as much as 6% negative and other years it has been as much as 6% positive). However the numbers cannot be completely aligned in any given year without a major change in Medicare law because the benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding for Part C, which happens county by county, for any given year depends on the A and/or B per-person spending in the comparable counties two years prior.\n\nThe [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] of 2003 -- which created the benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process -- also renamed +Choice plans to \"Medicare Advantage\" plans. Other managed Medicare plans include COST plans, dual-eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) plans and PACE plans (which try to keep seniors that need non-medical custodial care in their homes).{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} However 97% of the beneficiaries in Part C are in one of the roughly one dozen types of Medicare Advantage plans (HMO, employer group, SNP, regional PPO, etc.), primarily in classic vanilla HMOs.\n\nEnrollment in the public Part C health plan program, including plans called Medicare Advantage since the 2005 marketing period, grew from zero in 1997 (not counting the pre-Part C demonstration projects) to over 24 million projected in 2020. That 20,000,000-plus represents about 35%-40% of the people on Medicare. As of about 2015 over half the people fully signing up for Medicare for the first time are choosing a public Part C plan of some type as opposed to FFS Medicare (as reflected in the 0% to over 35% penetration rate growth in 21 years).\n\nAs noted millions more beneficiaries are on Part C since 2011 than before 2011 and the per-person cost numbers have been at parity or below since 2012. This is good because that was the Part C program's intention from the time in 1995 when Democrats first proposed it. One such change ended the out-of-balance PFFS plan program except for grandfathered beneficiaries. The out-of-balance Employer Group plan program was cut back beginning in 2017. On an absolute basis and even still including these out of balance Part C programs, in 2018 the Medicare Trustees spent 0.1% less on Medicare Advantage and other Part C beneficiaries per person than it did per person on Medicare beneficiaries under FFS Medicare<ref>Table II.B.1 and IV.C.1 of the 2019 Medicare Trustees report</ref>\n\n==Program structure==\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\nPublic Part C health plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, cover the same medical services as \"Original\" Medicare Parts A and B but also typically include an annual physical exam and vision and/or dental coverage of some sort, none of which are covered under Parts A and B.

The capitated fee associated with a Medicare Advantage and other Part C plan is specific to each county in the United States and is primarily driven by a government-administered benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process that uses that county's average per-beneficiary FFS costs from a previous year as a starting point to determine the benchmark. The fee is then adjusted up or down based on the beneficiary's personal health condition; the intent of this adjustment is that the payments be spending neutral (lower for relatively healthy plan members and higher for those who are not so healthy).\n\n===Private sponsors===\nAll four Parts of Medicare\u2014A, B and C, and D\u2014are administered by private companies under contract to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Almost all these companies are insurance companies, except for those that administer most Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans, which are not -- strictly speaking -- insurance policies. A plurality of Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are administered (CMS uses the term \"sponsored\") by non-profit integrated health delivery systems and their spin offs. Other Part C sponsors include non-profit charities under their respective states' laws, and/or are under union or religious management. However there is no rule against insurance companies sponsoring Part C plans and many do. A more common involvement of insurance companies with Part C is to act as the administrator for the non-profit sponsor (the best example being the relationship between the non-profit AARP and UnitedHealth - a health market conglomerate that began as an insurance company).\n\nPart C sponsors annually submit bids that allow them to participate in the program. All bids that meet the necessary requirements are accepted. The bids are compared to the pre-determined benchmark amounts set, which are the maximum amount Medicare will pay a plan in a given county. If a plan's bid is higher than the benchmark, enrollees pay the difference between the benchmark and the bid in the form of a monthly premium, in addition to the Medicare Part B premium. (Because of the county-specific nature of the framework and the bidding process leading to these differences, the same sponsor might offer the same benefits under the same brand name in adjacent counties at different prices.) If the bid is lower than the benchmark, the plan and Medicare share the difference between the bid and the benchmark; the plan's share of this amount is known as a \"rebate,\" which must be used by the plan's sponsor to provide additional benefits or reduced costs to enrollees. A rebate cannot contribute to \"profit\" (\"profit\" is in quotes because most Medicare Advantage and other Part C health plans are sponsored by non-profit organizations, primarily integrated health delivery systems).\n\nThis benchmark/bidding/rebate process accounts for from 97% to 100% of the cost of the given Medicare Advantage plan to the Medicare Trust Funds. The individual fee for each Part C beneficiary is also uplifted or downsized slightly (approximately 1%-3% in either direction on average) from the county-specific fee based on a risk-based formula tied to the personal health characteristics of the capitated individual. The theory is that the risk-based formula will not affect spending, but in practice it almost always increases cost per beneficiary by one or two percent, either because the Medicare Advantage plan is diligent in upcoding to a beneficiary's specific risks or because patients on FFS Medicare, where providers have no incentive to code at all, are undercoded.\n\nBased on the 2019 benchmark/bidding/rebate process, the Medicare Advantage average monthly plan premium in 2020 is estimated to decrease 14 percent to $23.00 from an average of $26.87 in 2019. Since 2017, the average monthly Medicare Advantage premium has decreased by an estimated 27.9 percent. This is the lowest that the average monthly premium for a Medicare Advantage plan has been since 2007 right after the second year of the benchmark/framework/competitive-bidding process. But these averages mask wide regional and beneficial differences. Just as the most important benefit of Part C plans is the annual out of pocket spend protection, the major determinant of monthly premium differences is the size of that protection. By law, a Part C beneficiary cannot spend more than $6700 out of pocket annually on medical services; it is plans with this limit that have the lowest premiums. Conversely, some Part C plans have OOP limits as low as $1500 annually but of course -- for these plans -- the premium is higher.  The average OOP limit in 2018 was around $5000. Note that an OOP limit is not a deductible as is often reported. It is just the opposite of a deductible; it is a financial-protection upper-bound. \n\nIt is rare for a Medicare Advantage beneficiary to reach the annual OOP limit but it provides a stop-loss feature that is also found in most private health insurance but not in \"Original Medicare.\" Medicare Parts A and B provide no similar OOP spending cap and the exposure of a Medicare Part A and/or B beneficiary to a financial catastrophe is unlimited (but also rare). Once the OOP maximum is reached for an individual under a Part C health plan, the plan pays 100% of medical services for the remainder of the calendar year. That protection has no lifetime maximum, another problem with Medicare Part A which has a lifetime limit on inpatient hospitalization coverage. But the Part C OOP limit does not apply to a Part C plan's Part-D-like self-administered drug coverage (which uses another less beneficial means of addressing catastrophic costs just as with all of Part D).\n\nMedicare beneficiaries will also have more plan choices in 2020, with about 1,200 more Medicare Advantage plans operating than in 2018.\n\n===Benefits===\nPublic Part C health plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, not only cover the same medical services as \"Original Medicare\" Parts A and B but also typically include an annual physical exam and vision and/or dental coverage of some sort, none of which are covered under Medicare Parts A and B. Other examples of these additional non-medical services include transport to medical-service appointments, coverage of over the counter drugs, adult day care, and assistance for daily living. Medicare Part A provides FFS payments for admitted in-patient hospital care, hospice, and skilled nursing services if a person is first admitted inpatient for three days. Part B provides payments for many physician and surgical services, even some that take place in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities after admittance, as well as for medically necessary outpatient hospital services such as ER, surgical center, laboratory, X-rays and diagnostic tests, certain preventative medical services, and certain durable medical equipment and supplies). Less often, hearing and wellness benefits not found in Original Medicare are included in a Medicare Advantage plan. Some Part C plans waive the antiquated \"three-day rule\" of Medicare Part A (since it makes no medical sense and costs less in multiple ways to more quickly move a patient to rehab, the primary reason for admission to a skilled nursing facility under Medicare Part A)\n\nIn addition Medicare Advantage plans may cover benefits in a different way. For example, plans that require higher out-of-pocket costs than Medicare Parts A or B for some benefits, such as skilled nursing facility care, might offer lower copayments for doctor visits to balance their benefits package. CMS limits the extent to which plans' cost-sharing can vary from that of Medicare Parts A and B. \n\n===Provider networks===\nAs noted Part C plans are required to limit out-of-pocket (OOP) spending by a beneficiary for Parts A and B type services to no more than $6,700 per year for in-network providers. \"In-network\" is the key word in that sentence and has other implications for Part C beneficiaries. The OOP limit may be higher for out of network providers in a PPO (out of network providers are typically not permitted at all in an HMO).\n\nAnd as with all HMOs\u2014no matter whether a person is on Medicare or not\u2014persons who enroll in a Medicare Advantage or other Part C HMO cannot use certain specialist physicians or out-of-network providers without prior authorization from the HMO, except in emergencies. In almost all Medicare Advantage plans\u2014HMO or otherwise\u2014the beneficiary must choose a [[primary care physician]] (PCP) to provide referrals and the beneficiary must confirm that the plan authorizes the visit to which the beneficiary was referred by the PCP. As with all HMOs, this can be a problem for people who want to use out-of-network specialists or who are hospitalized and are forced to use out-of-network doctors while hospitalized. Many Medicare Advantage PPO plans permit a subscriber to use any physician or hospital without prior authorization, but at a somewhat higher expense.\n\nIf a patient's in-network physician orders tests or procedures or refers a patient to a specialty that are not available from an in-network provider, the plan pays for the patient's procedures or services at an out-of-network location and charges in-network rates to the patient, so long as the necessary services are normally covered by the plan (the beneficiary must still obtain authorization).\n\n==Usage==\nAlthough the number of people using public Part C of Medicare has grown dramatically from almost zero since 1998 and is projected to grow dramatically, there are four   groups in particular that tend to stick with Medicare Parts A and/or B only and then add a private arrangement. First, it is increasingly common for people to continue to work after joining Medicare at age 65, and they use both Medicare Parts A and/or B (often just Part A) and employer sponsored insurance, and delay deciding between FFS Medicare and capitated-fee Medicare until the employer sponsored insurance is no longer available. Second, many retired people -- particularly people over age 75 or former government employees -- receive group insurance as a benefit of their former employment and these group policies tend not to be Part C plans (although that is changing). Third, people who live in two different geographical areas of the country at different times of the year (mostly so-called snowbirds) find it difficult to live with the geographic restrictions of most public Part C plans. Fourth, sicker people and people with higher medical expenditures are more likely to switch from Medicare Advantage plans to Medicare Parts A and B only, a statistic primarily driven by people on Medicaid in custodial care at nursing homes; people on both Medicare and Medicaid no longer have need of any Medicare supplement, either a public Part C plan or a private Medigap or group retirement plan.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Riley|first1=Gerald|date=2012|title=Impact of Continued Biased Disenrollment from the Medicare Advantage Program to Fee-for-Service|journal=Medicare & Medicaid Research Review|volume=2|issue=4|pages=E1\u2013E17|doi=10.5600/mmrr.002.04.a08|pmid=24800156|pmc=4006478}}</ref>  The Part C [[risk equalization|risk adjusted]] payments to Medicare Advantage plans are designed to limit this churn between types of Medicare (managed vs. FFS), but it is unclear how effective that equalization program is.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Jason|first2=Mark|last2=Duggan|first3=Ilyana|last3=Kuziemko|first4=William|last4=Woolston|year=2014|title=How Does Risk Selection Respond to Risk Adjustment?

Most research suggests that enrollees in Medicare HMOs tend to receive more preventative services than beneficiaries in traditional Medicare; however, beneficiaries, especially those in poorer health, tend to rate the quality and access to care in traditional Medicare more favorably than in Medicare Advantage. In other words, the research on Medicare HMOs is the same as the research on all HMOs. In the case of Medicare Part C, it is difficult to generalize the results of research either way across all plans participating in the program because performance on quality and access metrics varies widely across the types of Medicare Advantage plans and among the hundreds of sponsors of Medicare Advantage plans and those plans' thousands of providers. That is why having choice between types of Medicare and many choices within Part C is so important.\n\n==References==\n\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{Reflist}}\n<!--see http://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/staticpages/rating/planrating-help.aspx? -->\n\n==External links==\n\n===Government links - current===\n*[http://cms.hhs.gov CMS official web site] at cms.hhs.gov\n*[https://archive.is/20130918113944/https://opencrs.com/document/M20130326/ Legal Issues Relating to the Secretary\u2019s Authority to Set Payment Rates Under the Medicare Advantage Program] [[Congressional Research Service]]\n*[http://www.medicare.gov/ Medicare.gov] &mdash; the official website for people with Medicare\n\n===Private links===\n*[http://www.agis.com/Eldercare-Basics/Legal-and-Financial/Medicare-and-Medicaid/ Medicare & Medicaid Resources] &mdash; Medicare information site\n*[http://www.kff.org/medicare Kaiser Family Foundation] &mdash; Wide range of free information about the Medicare program and other U.S. health issues including [http://kff.org/state-category/medicare/ state-level data on health care spending and utilization, including Medicare].\n* [http://www.allhealth.org/issues.asp?wi=7 Medicare - Alliance for Health Reform] The nonpartisan, nonprofit Alliance for Health Reform offers information about health reform, in a number of formats, to elected officials and their staffs, journalists, policy analysts and advocates.\n* [http://www.ssdrc.com Social Security and Disability News Resource Center]\n* [http://health.howstuffworks.com/medicare.htm How Stuff Works - Medicare]\n\n[[Category:Managed care]]\n[[Category:Medicare and Medicaid (United States)]]\n", "name_user": "Mfunderburk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGovernment links - current:Two updates: 1) CMS official website link was redirecting to https://www.cms.gov/ so it was updated.  2) The Medicare.gov link updated to https://www.medicare.gov/ since the site is in HTTPS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Advantage"}

The site grew very rapidly after the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway]] (Rock Island) built a line from [[Liberal, Kansas]] to [[Texhoma, Texas]] in 1901. A community, first named '''Sanford''' by the U.S. Post Office Department, was situated along the line. It was renamed '''Guymon''' a month later by postal officials to avoid confusion with the town of [[Stratford, Texas]], which was further down the line.  Guymon incorporated in 1901. The town [[plat]] was filed in Beaver County, Oklahoma Territory, in 1904.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nGuymon's growth was helped when most of the businesses moved there from the nearby town of [[Hardesty, Oklahoma|Hardesty]]. One of these was the newspaper, ''Hardesty Herald'', which owner Richard B. Quinn quickly renamed as the ''Guymon Herald''. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, Guymon claimed 839 residents, and was named county seat of the newly created Texas County. By the 1910 U.S. census, the town had 1,342 residents. It also had three banks, three hotels, four doctors,  a flour mill, a grain company and several retail establishments. A second newspaper, the ''Guymon Democrat'', was in business. Agriculture became the basis of Guymon's economy. The 1920 census recorded 1,507 residents, which grew to 2,181 in 1930.  By 1932, the town had two cream stations and five grain elevators.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s had a negative effect on Guymon. Some old-time residents remember \"[[Black Sunday (storm)|Black Sunday]]\", April 14, 1935, as the day of the worst dust storm in the area's history. However, discovery of the nearby [[Hugoton Gas Field|Hugoton-Panhandle gas field]] created many new jobs, and brought Guymon's population to 2,290 in 1940.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nThe Guymon Pioneer Days Rodeo has offered tributes to the community's pioneer spirit every May since 1933.  In 2014 the rodeo was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame of the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA).

It was renamed '''Guymon''' a month later by postal officials to avoid confusion with the town of [[Stratford, Texas]], which was further down the line.  Guymon incorporated in 1901. The town [[plat]] was filed in Beaver County, Oklahoma Territory, in 1904.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nGuymon's growth was helped when most of the businesses moved there from the nearby town of [[Hardesty, Oklahoma|Hardesty]]. One of these was the newspaper, ''Hardesty Herald'', which owner Richard B. Quinn quickly renamed as the ''Guymon Herald''. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, Guymon claimed 839 residents, and was named county seat of the newly created Texas County. By the 1910 U.S. census, the town had 1,342 residents. It also had three banks, three hotels, four doctors,  a flour mill, a grain company and several retail establishments. A second newspaper, the ''Guymon Democrat'', was in business. Agriculture became the basis of Guymon's economy. The 1920 census recorded 1,507 residents, which grew to 2,181 in 1930.  By 1932, the town had two cream stations and five grain elevators.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s had a negative effect on Guymon. Some old-time residents remember \"[[Black Sunday (storm)|Black Sunday]]\", April 14, 1935, as the day of the worst dust storm in the area's history. However, discovery of the nearby [[Hugoton Gas Field|Hugoton-Panhandle gas field]] created many new jobs, and brought Guymon's population to 2,290 in 1940.<ref name=\"EOHC-Guymon\"/>\n\nThe Guymon Pioneer Days Rodeo has offered tributes to the community's pioneer spirit every May since 1933.  In 2014 the rodeo was inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame of the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA).  In 2006, the rodeo had over 900 contestants with over $385,000 in prize money.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guymonrodeo.com|title= Guymon Pioneer Days Rodeo|accessdate=2008-04-23 |date= |work= |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated on the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] of the central [[Oklahoma Panhandle]] Guymon sits {{convert|122|mi|km|0}} north of [[Amarillo, Texas]] and {{convert|120|mi|km|0}} west-northwest of [[Woodward, Oklahoma]].

CBC said that tobacco money had paid for Singer's research and for his promotion of it, and that it was organized by [[APCO Worldwide#The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition controversy|APCO]]. Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. \"They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'\" he said. \"In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming.

The Kyoto Protocol was the result of an international convention held in Kyoto, Japan, during which several industrialized nations agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Singer's declaration read: \"Energy is essential for economic growth ... We understand the motivation to eliminate what are perceived to be the driving forces behind a potential climate change; but we believe the Kyoto Protocol\u2014to curtail carbon dioxide emissions from only a part of the world community\u2014is dangerously simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive to jobs and standards-of-living.\"<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" />\n\nScheuering writes that Singer circulated this in the United States and Europe and gathered 100 signatories, though she says some of the signatories' credentials were questioned.

''Intelligent Life in the Universe'', San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1966.</ref> that the orbit of the [[Mars|Martian]] moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] suggests that it is hollow, which implies it is of artificial origin. Singer wrote: \"My conclusion there is, and here I back Shklovsky, that if the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them.\"<ref>S. F. Singer, \"More on the Moons of Mars\", ''Astronautics'', February 1960, American Astronautical Society, page 16.</ref> Later measurements confirmed Singer's ''big \"if\"'' caveat: Shklovsky overestimated Phobos' rate of altitude loss due to bad early data.<ref>E.

Singer told CBC it made no difference where the money came from. \"They don't carry a note on a dollar bill saying 'This comes from the tobacco industry,'\" he said. \"In any case I was not aware of it, and I didn't ask APCO where they get their money.

After the 1991 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the [[Earth Summit]], Singer started writing and speaking out to cast doubt on the science. He predicted disastrous economic damage from any restrictions on fossil fuel use, and argued that the natural world and its weather patterns are complex and ill-understood, and that little is known about the dynamics of heat exchange from the oceans to the atmosphere, or the role of clouds. As the scientific consensus grew, he continued to argue from a skeptical position.<ref name = \"scheuering2004\" /> He has repeatedly criticized the climate models that predict global warming. In 1994 he compared model results to observed temperatures and found that the predicted temperatures for 1950\u20131980 deviated from the temperatures that had actually occurred, from which he concluded in his regular column in ''The Washington Times''\u2014with the headline that day \"Climate Claims Wither under the Luminous Lights of Science\"\u2014that climate models are faulty.

The British Indian government had never included this area under their government's jurisdiction. Thereby, no government development work or activity were done, nor any tax levied from the hills including Karbi Anglong.

Then again from 1986 through the leadership of Autonomous State Demand Committee (ASDC), demanded Autonomous statehood of Karbi Anglong & Dima Hasao under Article 244(A). In 2002, the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council passed another resolution to press for the demand of statehood. Several other memoranda were submitted at different times by several organisations. The demand for a separate state turned violent on 31 July 2013 when student demonstrators set government buildings on fire. Following the incident, the elected leaders of Karbi Anglong jointly submitted a memorandum to the [[Prime Minister of India]] demanding a separate State.\n\n===Dimaraji===\n[[File:Dimaraji map.jpeg|thumb|350px|Map of Dimaraji state]]\nThe [[Dimasa people]] of northeast India have been demanding a separate state called [[Dimaraji]] or \"Dimaland\" for several decades.

The main reason behind a separate state is cultural and geographical distance from Gandhinagar.

Culturally and socially, the Mahakoshal region differs greatly from the neighbouring Vindhya Pradesh. One of the key reasons for this is said to be that large parts of Mahakoshal were under direct British rule from the nineteenth century onwards, turning it into a relatively progressive, modern and liberal area and infusing democratic values into its body politic. Casteism and feudalism are said to be not as deeply rooted in this region as they are in Vindhya Pradesh.<ref name=\"freepressjournal.in\">http://freepressjournal.in/mahakaushal-no-cakewalk-for-either-contender/</ref>\n\nA parallel demand for a state of [[Gondwana (India)|Gondwana]] from the same [[Mahakoshal]] region of [[Madhya Pradesh]] has arisen owing to the fact that vast areas of Mahakoshal were ruled by Gond kings and even today, Mandla, Chinndwara, Dindori, Seoni and Balaghat have a predominantly [[Gondi people|Gond]] tribal population. Tribals constitute 64 per cent of the total population of Dindori district. For Mandla, the corresponding figure is 57 per cent. The Gondwana Gantantra party (GGP) was established in 1991, with the objective to struggle for the creation of a separate Gondwana State comprising regions that were ruled by Gonds.

This Indo-European language is subclassified as Indo-Aryan. The language is sometimes referred to as Malavi or Ujjaini. Malvi is part of the [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] branch of languages; ''Nimadi'' is spoken in the [[Nimar]] region of Madhya Pradesh and in Rajasthan. The dialects of Malvi are, in alphabetical order, ''Bachadi'', ''Bhoyari'', ''Dholewari'', ''Hoshangabadi'', ''Jamral'', ''Katiyai'', Malvi Proper, ''Patvi'', ''Rangari'', ''Rangri'' and ''Sondwari''. A survey in 2001 found only four dialects: Ujjaini (in the districts of Ujjain, Indore, Dewas and Sehore), ''Rajawari'' (Ratlam, Mandsaur and Neemuch), ''Umadwari'' (Rajgarh) and ''Sondhwari'' (Jhalawar, in Rajasthan).

[[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] started. The Khandesh state was founded and ruled by the [[Faruqi dynasty]] with its capital at [[Burhanpur]] (now in Madhya Pradesh). The state covered the area of the today's [[Jalgaon]], [[Dhule]], [[Nandurbar]] districts of Maharashtra state and [[Burhanpur]] district of Madhya Pradesh state. The terms \"Khandesh\" and \"Deccan\" thus connote historical and political affiliations, as well as geographical zones. Khandesh lies on the Northwestern corner of the Deccan plateau, in the valley of the [[Tapti River|Tapi River]], and is bound to the north by the [[Satpura Range]], to the east by the [[Berar Division|Berar]] ([[Vidarbha]]) region, to the south by the Hills of Ajanta, belonging to the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, and to the west by the northernmost ranges of the [[Western Ghats]], and beyond them the coastal plain of [[Gujarat]].\n\nAfter India's independence in 1947, [[Bombay]] [[province]] became Bombay [[States of India|state]], which in 1960 was divided into the linguistic states of [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]].

Subsequently, through [[Operation Polo]], a \"police action\" on 17 September 1948, the Indian army annexed Hyderabad to India and on 1 November 1956, Marathwada was transferred from [[Hyderabad State]] to [[Bombay State]]. On 1 May 1960, Bombay state was divided into [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]] states, Marathwada becoming a part of the former.\n\n===Vidarbha===\n[[Vidarbha]] is a region that comprises the [[Amravati]] and [[Nagpur]] divisions of eastern [[Maharashtra]]. The State Reorganisation Act of 1956 placed Vidarbha in Bombay State. Shortly after this, the [[States Reorganisation Commission]] recommended the creation of Vidarbha state with Nagpur as the capital, but instead it was included in Maharashtra state, which was formed on 1 May 1960. Support for a separate state of Vidarbha had been expressed by Loknayak Bapuji Aney and Brijlal Biyani Vidarbha. The demand for the creation of a separate state are based on allegations of neglect by the Maharashtra state government. [[Jambuwantrao Dhote]] led a popular struggle for Vidarbha statehood in the 1970s. Two politicians, [[N. K. P.

Rajmala authenticates the fact that Ratna Manikya (1464-1468) was the first to \u2018settle 4000 Bengalis in four places\u2019 in Tripura. During [[Noakhali riots]] in 1946 many Bengali Hindu survivors referred to as [[East Bengali refugees|East Bengali Refugees]] were sheltered in temporary relief camps in Comilla, Chandpur, Agartala the present capital of Tripura and other places. A large migration of Bengali Hindus and Muslims took place in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and other places during [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] on 1971.\n\nThe indigenous Tipra people demanded an [[autonomous]] district, which they finally achieved on 23 March 1979 which is known as [[Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council]] (TTAADC). The politically important TTAADC constitutes two-thirds of Tripura's 10,491&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> area, which has 12,16,465 (mostly tribals) of the state's 37 lakh population residing in it.

Culturally and socially, the Mahakoshal region differs greatly from the neighbouring Vindhya Pradesh. One of the key reasons for this is said to be that large parts of Mahakoshal were under direct British rule from the nineteenth century onwards, turning it into a relatively progressive, modern and liberal area and infusing democratic values into its body politic.

Tribals constitute 64 per cent of the total population of Dindori district. For Mandla, the corresponding figure is 57 per cent.

The dialects of Malvi are, in alphabetical order, ''Bachadi'', ''Bhoyari'', ''Dholewari'', ''Hoshangabadi'', ''Jamral'', ''Katiyai'', Malvi Proper, ''Patvi'', ''Rangari'', ''Rangri'' and ''Sondwari''. A survey in 2001 found only four dialects: Ujjaini (in the districts of Ujjain, Indore, Dewas and Sehore), ''Rajawari'' (Ratlam, Mandsaur and Neemuch), ''Umadwari'' (Rajgarh) and ''Sondhwari'' (Jhalawar, in Rajasthan).

The state covered the area of the today's [[Jalgaon]], [[Dhule]], [[Nandurbar]] districts of Maharashtra state and [[Burhanpur]] district of Madhya Pradesh state. The terms \"Khandesh\" and \"Deccan\" thus connote historical and political affiliations, as well as geographical zones.
