The resulting [[European debt crisis|European sovereign-debt crisis]] became more pronounced early in the decade and continued to affect the possibility of a global economic recovery. Economic issues, such as austerity, inflation, and an increase in [[commodity]] prices, led to unrest in many countries, including the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M]] and [[Occupy movement]]s. Unrest in some countries \u2013 particularly in the [[Arab world]] \u2013 evolved into [[socioeconomic]] crises triggering revolutions in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], and [[Bahraini uprising (2011\u2013present)|Bahrain]] as well as civil wars in [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libya]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemen]] in a widespread phenomenon commonly referred to as the [[Arab Spring]]. Shifting social attitudes saw [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and [[Women in government|female representation]] make substantial progress during the decade, particularly in the West and parts of Asia and Africa.\n\n<!-- Politics and conflicts -->\nThe [[United States]] continued to retain its [[Superpower|global superpower]] status while an [[Chinese Dream|assertive]] [[China]], along with launching vast [[Belt and Road Initiative|economic initiatives]] and [[2015 People's Republic of China military reform|military reforms]], sought to expand its [[South China Sea#Territorial claims|influence]] in the [[South China Sea]] and in [[Africa\u2013China relations|Africa]], solidifying its position as a [[Potential superpowers#China|potential superpower]]; global competition between China and the U.S. coalesced into a \"[[China containment policy|containment]]\" effort and a [[China\u2013United States trade war|trade war]]. Elsewhere in Asia, the [[Korea]]s [[2018\u201319 Korean peace process|improved their relations]] after a [[2017\u201318 North Korea crisis|prolonged crisis]] and the [[War on Terror]] continued as [[Osama bin Laden]] was [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassinated]] by U.S. forces in a raid on his [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|compound]] in [[Pakistan]] as a part of the U.S.'s continued [[Foreign interventions by the United States|military involvement]] in many parts of the world. The rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] extremist organization in 2014 [[ISIL territorial claims|erased]] the borders between Syria and Iraq, resulting in a [[International military intervention against ISIL|multinational intervention]] that also saw the [[Barisha raid|demise]] of its leader. In Africa, [[South Sudan]] [[2011 South Sudanese independence referendum|broke away]] from [[Sudan]] and [[2018\u201319 Arab protests|mass protests]] and various coups d'\u00e9tat saw longtime strongmen deposed. Meanwhile, the [[European Union]] experienced a [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]] and historic United Kingdom [[Brexit]] referendum, and Russia [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed Crimea]].\n\n<!-- Internet and privacy -->\nInformation technology progressed, with [[smartphone]]s becoming widespread. The [[Internet of things]] saw substantial growth during the 2010s due to advancements in wireless networking devices, mobile telephony, and [[cloud computing]]. Advancements in [[data processing]] and the rollout of [[4G|4G broadband]] allowed [[Big data|data]] and information to disperse among domains at paces never before seen while online resources such as [[social media]] facilitated phenomena such as the [[Me Too movement]] and the rise of [[slacktivism]] and online [[call-out culture]]. Online nonprofit organization [[WikiLeaks]] gained international attention for publishing classified information on topics including [[Guantanamo Bay files leak|Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Syria Files|Syria]], the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan]] and [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq]] wars, and [[United States diplomatic cables leak|United States diplomacy]]. [[Edward Snowden]] blew the whistle on [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|global surveillance]], raising awareness on the role governments and private entities have in [[mass surveillance]] and [[information privacy]].\n\n<!-- Climate change and natural disasters -->\nGlobal warming became increasingly noticeable through [[Global temperature record|new record temperatures in different years]] and [[Effects of global warming|extreme weather events on all continents]]. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO<sub>2</sub> concentration rose from 390 to 410 PPM]] over the decade. At the same time, combating pollution and climate change continued to be major concerns, as concerns as protests, initiatives, and legislation garnered substantial media attention. Particularly, the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015) was adopted and a [[School strike for the climate|global climate youth movement]] was formed. Major natural disasters included the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal earthquake]] of 2015, the [[2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami]], and the devastating hurricanes [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]], [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]], [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]], [[Typhoon Haiyan|Haiyan]] (Yolanda), [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]], and [[Hurricane Dorian|Dorian]].\n\n<!-- Entertainment industry -->\n[[Superhero film]]s became box office leaders, with ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]], grossing [[List of box office records set by Avengers: Endgame|over $2.7 billion worldwide]]. [[Cable television|Cable providers]] saw a decline in subscriber numbers as [[Cord-cutting|cord cutters]] switched to lower cost [[online streaming]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Prime Video|Amazon Prime]] and [[Hulu]]. Globalism and an increased demand for variety and personalization in the face of [[music streaming service]]s such as [[Spotify]] created many subgenres. Dance, hip-hop, and pop music surged into the 2010s, with [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] achieving mass commercial success. Digital music sales topped CD sales in 2012. The video game industry continued to be dominated by [[Nintendo]], [[Sony]], and [[Microsoft]]; ''[[Minecraft]]'' became the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling game]] of all time.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Politics and conflicts==\n{{Main|2010s political history}}\n\n===Major conflicts===\n{{Main|List of wars: 2003\u2013present}}\nThe prominent wars of the decade include:\n\n====International wars====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n! style=\"width:130px;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Start date\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| End date\n!

was increasingly called a [[superpower]] in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between President [[Hu Jintao]] and United States President [[Barack Obama]]. China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest trading nation, filing the [[World Intellectual Property Indicators|most patents]], expanding its [[List of countries by level of military equipment|military]], landing its lunar rover ''[[Yutu (rover)|Yutu]]'' on the moon (ending a four-decade lack of lunar exploration) and creating China's [[Oriental Movie Metropolis]] as a major film and cultural center. China was projected to have the world's largest economy by 2018 with an estimated [[GDP per capita]] equal to the U.S. by the late 2050s.<ref>[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/5/20110119/twl-superpower-talks-china-faces-tough-u-3fd0ae9.html] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2018, [[List of countries by military expenditures|global military spending]] reached the highest it has been since 1988, late [[Cold War]] levels, largely fueled by increased [[Military budget|defense spending]] by China and the United States, whose budgets together accounted for half of the world's total military spending.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.trust.org/item/20190429105059-m8xz0|title=Global military spending at new post-Cold War high, fueled by US, China \u2013 think-tank|date=29 April 2019|work=Reuters}}</ref> In 2019, the [[Lowy Institute|Lowy Institute Asia Power Index]], which measures the projections of power in the Indo-Pacific, called both China and the United States the superpowers of the 21st century, citing immense influence in almost all eight indexes of power.<ref>{{Cite website|title=Lowy Institute Asia Power Index: China 2019|url=https://power.lowyinstitute.org/countries.php?profile=CN]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite website|title=Lowy Institute Asia Power Index: United States 2019|url=https://power.lowyinstitute.org/countries.php?profile=US]]}}</ref>\n\nAlong with China, a [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|Vladimir Putin-led]] [[Russia]] also steadily increased its defense spending and continued to [[2008 Russian military reform|modernize]] its military capabilities throughout the decade, including the development of the [[T-14 Armata]] main battle tank and the fifth-generation [[Sukhoi Su-57]] jet fighter. Russia also flexed its [[power projection]] capabilities, particularly demonstrated during the 2014 [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of [[Crimea]] and its interventions in [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014-present)|eastern Ukraine]] and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Syrian Civil War]]; [[Wagner Group]] had a significant presence in both conflicts. Russia also notably waged [[information warfare]] campaigns against its geopolitical foes, including [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interfering]] in the 2016 U.S. elections via [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|hacking and leaking emails]] of U.S. political party leadership and by spreading disinformation via the [[Internet Research Agency]]. Other alleged Russian intelligence operations included the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|Skripal poisonings]] and the [[Montenegrin coup plot]], both of which were attributed by some to the [[Unit 29155]] organization. Collectively, these activities\u2014and the Western-led efforts to combat the influence of Russian [[Russian oligarch|oligarchs]] and political interests\u2014have been referred to as the [[Second Cold War]].\n\nThe [[European Union]] went through several crises. The [[European debt crisis]] caused severe economic problems to several [[eurozone]] member states, most severely [[Greece]]. The [[European migrant crisis|2015 migration crisis]] led to several million people entering the EU illegally in a short period of time. There was a significant rise in the vote shares of several [[eurosceptic]] parties, including the [[Lega Nord|League]] in Italy, [[Alternative for Germany]], and the [[Finns Party]] in [[Finland]]. As a result of a [[referendum]], the [[United Kingdom]] became the first member state in the EU's history to initiate proceedings for [[Brexit|leaving the Union]].\n\n====Polarization====\nSocio-political polarization increased as conservatives and social liberals clashed over the role and size of government and other social, economic and environmental issues in the [[Western world|West]]. In the [[United States]], polls showed a divided electorate regarding healthcare reform, immigration, gun rights, taxation, job creation, and debt reduction.<ref name=\"rasmussenreports.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/generic_congressional_ballot|title=Generic Congressional Ballot \u2013 Rasmussen Reports\u2122|publisher=Rasmussenreports.com|accessdate=10 November 2011}}\n*Jamrisko, Michelle.

In Europe, [[pasokification]] described the loss of vote share experienced by traditional [[center-left]] or [[social democratic]] parties. In France, specifically, the collapse of traditional parties was especially notable, with [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s ''[[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]'' winning a majority in its first election in 2017.\n\n[[Center-left]] and traditional [[social democratic]] parties often lost their vote share to more [[socialist]] or [[democratic socialist]] alternatives, especially in [[Europe]]. This happened most completely in [[Greece]], where [[PASOK]] was replaced by [[Syriza]] as the main left-wing party. Other [[far-left]] parties which rose in prominence included [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in [[Spain]] and [[La France Insoumise]] in [[France]]. In the [[two-party system]]s of the [[English-speaking world]], these challenges mainly came from within the established parties of the left, with [[Bernie Sanders]] in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] pushing for more left-wing policies.\n\nThe political establishment was also challenged in many countries by protest movements, often organised through new [[social media]] platforms. These included the various [[Arab Spring]] protests, the [[Occupy movement]], and the [[yellow vests movement]].

The resulting [[European debt crisis|European sovereign-debt crisis]] became more pronounced early in the decade and continued to affect the possibility of a global economic recovery. Economic issues, such as austerity, inflation, and an increase in [[commodity]] prices, led to unrest in many countries, including the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M]] and [[Occupy movement]]s. Unrest in some countries \u2013 particularly in the [[Arab world]] \u2013 evolved into [[socioeconomic]] crises triggering revolutions in [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], and [[Bahraini uprising (2011\u2013present)|Bahrain]] as well as civil wars in [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libya]], [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemen]] in a widespread phenomenon commonly referred to as the [[Arab Spring]]. Shifting social attitudes saw [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and [[Women in government|female representation]] make substantial progress during the decade, particularly in the West and parts of Asia and Africa.\n\n<!-- Politics and conflicts -->\nThe [[United States]] continued to retain its [[Superpower|global superpower]] status while an [[Chinese Dream|assertive]] [[China]], along with launching vast [[Belt and Road Initiative|economic initiatives]] and [[2015 People's Republic of China military reform|military reforms]], sought to expand its [[South China Sea#Territorial claims|influence]] in the [[South China Sea]] and in [[Africa\u2013China relations|Africa]], solidifying its position as a [[Potential superpowers#China|potential superpower]]; global competition between China and the U.S. coalesced into a \"[[China containment policy|containment]]\" effort and a [[China\u2013United States trade war|trade war]]. Elsewhere in Asia, the [[Korea]]s [[2018\u201319 Korean peace process|improved their relations]] after a [[2017\u201318 North Korea crisis|prolonged crisis]] and the [[War on Terror]] continued as [[Osama bin Laden]] was [[Death of Osama bin Laden|assassinated]] by U.S. forces in a raid on his [[Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad|compound]] in [[Pakistan]] as a part of the U.S.'s continued [[Foreign interventions by the United States|military involvement]] in many parts of the world. The rise of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] extremist organization in 2014 [[ISIL territorial claims|erased]] the borders between Syria and Iraq, resulting in a [[International military intervention against ISIL|multinational intervention]] that also saw the [[Barisha raid|demise]] of its leader. In Africa, [[South Sudan]] [[2011 South Sudanese independence referendum|broke away]] from [[Sudan]] and [[2018\u201319 Arab protests|mass protests]] and various coups d'\u00e9tat saw longtime strongmen deposed. Meanwhile, the [[European Union]] experienced a [[European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]] and historic United Kingdom [[Brexit]] referendum, and Russia [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexed Crimea]].\n\n<!-- Internet and privacy -->\nInformation technology progressed, with [[smartphone]]s becoming widespread. The [[Internet of things]] saw substantial growth during the 2010s due to advancements in wireless networking devices, mobile telephony, and [[cloud computing]]. Advancements in [[data processing]] and the rollout of [[4G|4G broadband]] allowed [[Big data|data]] and information to disperse among domains at paces never before seen while online resources such as [[social media]] facilitated phenomena such as the [[Me Too movement]] and the rise of [[slacktivism]] and online [[call-out culture]]. Online nonprofit organization [[WikiLeaks]] gained international attention for publishing classified information on topics including [[Guantanamo Bay files leak|Guant\u00e1namo Bay]], [[Syria Files|Syria]], the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan]] and [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq]] wars, and [[United States diplomatic cables leak|United States diplomacy]]. [[Edward Snowden]] blew the whistle on [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present)|global surveillance]], raising awareness on the role governments and private entities have in [[mass surveillance]] and [[information privacy]].\n\n<!-- Climate change and natural disasters -->\nGlobal warming became increasingly noticeable through [[Global temperature record|new record temperatures in different years]] and [[Effects of global warming|extreme weather events on all continents]]. The [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|CO<sub>2</sub> concentration rose from 390 to 410 PPM]] over the decade. At the same time, combating pollution and climate change continued to be major concerns, as concerns as protests, initiatives, and legislation garnered substantial media attention. Particularly, the [[Paris Agreement]] (2015) was adopted and a [[School strike for the climate|global climate youth movement]] was formed. Major natural disasters included the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal earthquake]] of 2015, the [[2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami]], and the devastating hurricanes [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]], [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]], [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]], [[Typhoon Haiyan|Haiyan]] (Yolanda), [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]], and [[Hurricane Dorian|Dorian]].\n\n<!-- Entertainment industry -->\n[[Superhero film]]s became box office leaders, with ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' becoming the [[List of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of all time]], grossing [[List of box office records set by Avengers: Endgame|over $2.7 billion worldwide]]. [[Cable television|Cable providers]] saw a decline in subscriber numbers as [[Cord-cutting|cord cutters]] switched to lower cost [[online streaming]] services such as [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Prime Video|Amazon Prime]] and [[Hulu]]. Globalism and an increased demand for variety and personalization in the face of [[music streaming service]]s such as [[Spotify]] created many subgenres. Dance, hip-hop, and pop music surged into the 2010s, with [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] achieving mass commercial success. Digital music sales topped CD sales in 2012. The video game industry continued to be dominated by [[Nintendo]], [[Sony]], and [[Microsoft]]; ''[[Minecraft]]'' became the [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling game]] of all time.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Politics and conflicts==\n{{Main|2010s political history}}\n\n===Major conflicts===\n{{Main|List of wars: 2003\u2013present}}\nThe prominent wars of the decade include:\n\n====International wars====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n! style=\"width:130px;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Start date\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| End date\n!

was increasingly called a [[superpower]] in the early 2010s, including at the 2011 meeting between President [[Hu Jintao]] and United States President [[Barack Obama]]. China overtook the U.S. as the world's largest trading nation, filing the [[World Intellectual Property Indicators|most patents]], expanding its [[List of countries by level of military equipment|military]], landing its lunar rover ''[[Yutu (rover)|Yutu]]'' on the moon (ending a four-decade lack of lunar exploration) and creating China's [[Oriental Movie Metropolis]] as a major film and cultural center. China was projected to have the world's largest economy by 2018 with an estimated [[GDP per capita]] equal to the U.S. by the late 2050s.<ref>[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/5/20110119/twl-superpower-talks-china-faces-tough-u-3fd0ae9.html] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2018, [[List of countries by military expenditures|global military spending]] reached the highest it has been since 1988, late [[Cold War]] levels, largely fueled by increased [[Military budget|defense spending]] by China and the United States, whose budgets together accounted for half of the world's total military spending.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.trust.org/item/20190429105059-m8xz0|title=Global military spending at new post-Cold War high, fueled by US, China \u2013 think-tank|date=29 April 2019|work=Reuters}}</ref> In 2019, the [[Lowy Institute|Lowy Institute Asia Power Index]], which measures the projections of power in the Indo-Pacific, called both China and the United States the superpowers of the 21st century, citing immense influence in almost all eight indexes of power.<ref>{{Cite website|title=Lowy Institute Asia Power Index: China 2019|url=https://power.lowyinstitute.org/countries.php?profile=CN]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite website|title=Lowy Institute Asia Power Index: United States 2019|url=https://power.lowyinstitute.org/countries.php?profile=US]]}}</ref>\n\nAlong with China, a [[Russia under Vladimir Putin|Vladimir Putin-led]] [[Russia]] also steadily increased its defense spending and continued to [[2008 Russian military reform|modernize]] its military capabilities throughout the decade, including the development of the [[T-14 Armata]] main battle tank and the fifth-generation [[Sukhoi Su-57]] jet fighter. Russia also flexed its [[power projection]] capabilities, particularly demonstrated during the 2014 [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] of [[Crimea]] and its interventions in [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014-present)|eastern Ukraine]] and the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Syrian Civil War]]; [[Wagner Group]] had a significant presence in both conflicts. Russia also notably waged [[information warfare]] campaigns against its geopolitical foes, including [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interfering]] in the 2016 U.S. elections via [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|hacking and leaking emails]] of U.S. political party leadership and by spreading disinformation via the [[Internet Research Agency]]. Other alleged Russian intelligence operations included the [[Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal|Skripal poisonings]] and the [[Montenegrin coup plot]], both of which were attributed by some to the [[Unit 29155]] organization. Collectively, these activities\u2014and the Western-led efforts to combat the influence of Russian [[Russian oligarch|oligarchs]] and political interests\u2014have been referred to as the [[Second Cold War]].\n\nThe [[European Union]] went through several crises. The [[European debt crisis]] caused severe economic problems to several [[eurozone]] member states, most severely [[Greece]]. The [[European migrant crisis|2015 migration crisis]] led to several million people entering the EU illegally in a short period of time. There was a significant rise in the vote shares of several [[eurosceptic]] parties, including the [[Lega Nord|League]] in Italy, [[Alternative for Germany]], and the [[Finns Party]] in [[Finland]]. As a result of a [[referendum]], the [[United Kingdom]] became the first member state in the EU's history to initiate proceedings for [[Brexit|leaving the Union]].\n\n====Polarization====\nSocio-political polarization increased as conservatives and social liberals clashed over the role and size of government and other social, economic and environmental issues in the [[Western world|West]].

In Europe, [[pasokification]] described the loss of vote share experienced by traditional [[center-left]] or [[social democratic]] parties. In France, specifically, the collapse of traditional parties was especially notable, with [[Emmanuel Macron]]'s ''[[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]]'' winning a majority in its first election in 2017.\n\n[[Center-left]] and traditional [[social democratic]] parties often lost their vote share to more [[socialist]] or [[democratic socialist]] alternatives, especially in [[Europe]]. This happened most completely in [[Greece]], where [[PASOK]] was replaced by [[Syriza]] as the main left-wing party. Other [[far-left]] parties which rose in prominence included [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] in [[Spain]] and [[La France Insoumise]] in [[France]].

Having been the only [[Hollywood]] filmmaker to continue to make [[silent film]]s well into the period of [[sound film]]s, Chaplin made this his first true sound film.\n\nChaplin's film advanced a stirring condemnation of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[fascism]], [[antisemitism]], and the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. At the time of its first release, the United States was still formally at peace with [[Nazi Germany]]. Chaplin plays both leading roles: a ruthless fascist dictator and a persecuted Jewish barber.\n\n''The Great Dictator'' was popular with audiences, becoming Chaplin's most commercially successful film.<ref name=\"trampdict\"/> Modern critics have also praised it as an historically significant film and an important work of [[satire]], and in 1997, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=\":0\"/> ''The Great Dictator'' was nominated for five [[Academy Awards]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Jack Oakie]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Original Score)]].\n\nIn his 1964 autobiography, Chaplin stated that he could not have made the film if he had known about the true extent of the horrors of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] at the time.<ref name=\"ChaplinLager\">{{cite book |last=Chaplin|first=Charlie|authorlink=Charlie Chaplin|date=1964|title=My Autobiography|url=https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/myautobiography00chaprich/page/392 392]|quote=Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made ''The Great Dictator'', I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nOn the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918, a Jewish Private ([[Charlie Chaplin]]) fighting for the [[Central Powers]] nation of Tomainia<ref>The spelling of the country's name is derived from the numerous local newspapers flashed onscreen between 14 and 15 minutes into the film that indicate the end of World War I, such as ''The Tomainian past'', thus establishing the proper spelling.</ref> valiantly saves the life of a wounded pilot, Commander Schultz ([[Reginald Gardiner]]), who carries valuable documents that could secure a Tomainian victory. However, their plane crashes mid-flight, and the Private subsequently suffers memory loss. Upon being rescued, Schultz is informed that Tomainia has officially surrendered to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]], while the Private is carried off to a hospital.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie2.jpg|thumb|left|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel.]]\nTwenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the Private leaves the hospital to return to his previous profession as a [[barber]] in the [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghetto]]. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin).\n\nThe Barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah ([[Paulette Goddard]]), and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The troops capture the Barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of World War I, Schultz helps the Barber regain his memory.\n\nMeanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his ever-growing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy and is sent to a [[Internment|concentration camp]]. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the Barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a [[suicide attack]], but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the Barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of Osterlich.\n\nHynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Benzino Napaloni ([[Jack Oakie]]), over which country should invade Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of \"English Mustard\". The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers. The squad leader strikes Hannah to the ground, stands over her, and cruelly eats her basket of grapes.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|right|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel with [[Jack Oakie]] as Benzino Napaloni.]]\nEscaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the Barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the Barber while out [[Waterfowl hunting|duck hunting]] in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the Barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlich's capital. The Barber has never given a public speech in his life, but he has no other choice.\n\nThe terrified Barber mounts the steps but is inspired to seize the initiative. Announcing that he (as Hynkel) has had a change of heart, he makes an impassioned plea for brotherhood and goodwill.\n\n<blockquote>\"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible. Jew\u2014Gentile\u2014Black Man, White. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness. Not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men\u2014cries out for universal brotherhood\u2014for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world\u2014millions of despairing men, women, and little children\u2014victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say\u2014do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed\u2014the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...\n\nSoldiers!-don't give yourselves to brutes\u2014men who despise you\u2014enslave you\u2014who regiment your lives\u2014tell you what to do\u2014what to think and what to feel!

Only the unloved hate\u2014the unloved and the unnatural!\n\nSoldiers!-Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of [[Gospel of Luke|St Luke]] it is written: \"the Kingdom of God is within man\"\u2014not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you!

Filmmaker [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] reports that Clair was horrified by the power of the film, crying out that this should never be shown or the West was lost. Chaplin, on the other hand, laughed uproariously at the film. He used it to inspire many elements of ''The Great Dictator'', and by repeatedly viewing this film, Chaplin could closely mimic Hitler's mannerisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/27605-the-great-dictator|title=The Great Dictator|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\nTrimborn suggests that Chaplin decided to proceed with making ''The Great Dictator'' after viewing Riefenstahl's film.<ref>{{cite book |title=Leni Riefenstahl: A Life |last=Trimborn |first=J\u00fcrgen |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-374-18493-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/leniriefenstahll00trim/page/123 123\u2013124] |url=https://archive.org/details/leniriefenstahll00trim/page/123 |accessdate= }}</ref> Hynkel's rally speech near the beginning of the film, delivered in German-sounding [[gibberish]], is a caricature of Hitler's oratory style, which Chaplin also studied carefully in newsreels.<ref>R.

Chaplin and [[Meredith Willson]] composed the music. Filming began in September 1939 (coincidentally soon after Germany invaded Poland, triggering World War II) and finished six months later.\n\nChaplin wanted to address the escalating violence and repression of Jews by the Nazis throughout the late 1930s, the magnitude of which was conveyed to him personally by his European Jewish friends and fellow artists. The [[Third Reich]]'s repressive nature and [[militarist]] tendencies were well-known at the time. [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s 1942 ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not To Be]]'' dealt with similar themes, and also used a mistaken-identity Hitler figure. But Chaplin later said that he would not have made the film had he known of the true extent of the Nazis' crimes.<ref name=\"trampdict\">[[Branagh, Kenneth]] (Narrator).

He was mobbed by fans on a 1931 trip to [[Berlin]], which annoyed the Nazis. Resenting his style of comedy, they published a book titled ''The Jews Are Looking at You'' (1934), describing the comedian as \"a disgusting Jewish acrobat\" (although Chaplin was not Jewish). [[Ivor Montagu]], a close friend of Chaplin, relates that he sent the comedian a copy of the book and always believed that Chaplin decided to retaliate with making ''Dictator''.<ref>Stratton, David (February 21, 2002).

He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nTheir destinies were poles apart. One was to make millions weep, while the other was to set the whole world laughing.

Willson's task was to re-record it with the full studio orchestra, fitting the music to the action. They had planned to do it painstakingly, recording eight measures or less at a time, after running through the whole scene to get the overall idea. Chaplin decided to record the run-through in case anything was usable.

How can the master's music simultaneously signify a desire for lost emotional integrity and for authoritative grandeur?\n\nChaplin's dual use of ''Lohengrin'' points towards unsettling conjunctions of Nazi culture and Hollywood entertainment. Like [[Adorno]], Chaplin understands Wagner as a signifier of both: the birth of [[fascism]] out of the spirit of the total work of art, and the origin of mass culture out of the spirit of the most arduous aesthetic program of the 19th century. Unlike Adorno [who identifies American mass culture and fascist spectacle], Chaplin wants his audience to make crucial distinctions between competing Wagnerianisms...Both...rely on the driving force of utopian desires, on...the promise of self-transcendence and authentic collectivity, but they channel these mythic longings in fundamentally different directions. Although [Chaplin] exposes the puzzling modernity of Nazi politics, Chaplin is unwilling to write off either Wagner or industrial culture. [Chaplin suggests] Hollywood needs Wagner as never before in order to at once condemn the use of fantasy in fascism and warrant the utopian possibilities in industrial culture.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dark Mirror: German Cinema between Hitler and Hollywood |last=Koepnick |first=Lutz Peter |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn= 978-0-520-23311-9 |page=141 }}</ref>}}\n\n==Reception==\nChaplin's film was released nine months after Hollywood's first parody of Hitler, the short subject ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]'' by the [[Three Stooges]], which premiered in January 1940.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fighting the War of Ideas Like a Real War |last=Waller |first=J.

The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel (also Chaplin).\n\nThe Barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah ([[Paulette Goddard]]), and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The troops capture the Barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of World War I, Schultz helps the Barber regain his memory.\n\nMeanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his ever-growing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy and is sent to a [[Internment|concentration camp]]. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the Barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a [[suicide attack]], but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the Barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of Osterlich.\n\nHynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Benzino Napaloni ([[Jack Oakie]]), over which country should invade Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of \"English Mustard\". The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers. The squad leader strikes Hannah to the ground, stands over her, and cruelly eats her basket of grapes.\n\n[[File:Dictator charlie6.jpg|thumb|right|Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel with [[Jack Oakie]] as Benzino Napaloni.]]\nEscaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the Barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the Barber while out [[Waterfowl hunting|duck hunting]] in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the Barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlich's capital. The Barber has never given a public speech in his life, but he has no other choice.\n\nThe terrified Barber mounts the steps but is inspired to seize the initiative. Announcing that he (as Hynkel) has had a change of heart, he makes an impassioned plea for brotherhood and goodwill.\n\n<blockquote>\"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible. Jew\u2014Gentile\u2014Black Man, White. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness. Not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men\u2014cries out for universal brotherhood\u2014for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world\u2014millions of despairing men, women, and little children\u2014victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say\u2014do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed\u2014the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...\n\nSoldiers!-don't give yourselves to brutes\u2014men who despise you\u2014enslave you\u2014who regiment your lives\u2014tell you what to do\u2014what to think and what to feel!

The [[Third Reich]]'s repressive nature and [[militarist]] tendencies were well-known at the time. [[Ernst Lubitsch]]'s 1942 ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not To Be]]'' dealt with similar themes, and also used a mistaken-identity Hitler figure.

He wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nTheir destinies were poles apart. One was to make millions weep, while the other was to set the whole world laughing.

Willson's task was to re-record it with the full studio orchestra, fitting the music to the action. They had planned to do it painstakingly, recording eight measures or less at a time, after running through the whole scene to get the overall idea.

How can the master's music simultaneously signify a desire for lost emotional integrity and for authoritative grandeur?\n\nChaplin's dual use of ''Lohengrin'' points towards unsettling conjunctions of Nazi culture and Hollywood entertainment. Like [[Adorno]], Chaplin understands Wagner as a signifier of both: the birth of [[fascism]] out of the spirit of the total work of art, and the origin of mass culture out of the spirit of the most arduous aesthetic program of the 19th century. Unlike Adorno [who identifies American mass culture and fascist spectacle], Chaplin wants his audience to make crucial distinctions between competing Wagnerianisms...Both...rely on the driving force of utopian desires, on...the promise of self-transcendence and authentic collectivity, but they channel these mythic longings in fundamentally different directions.

He concludes:\n{{quote|Perhaps the distinction between the two characters would be more clear if Chaplin hadn't relied on some element of confusion to attract audiences to the picture. With ''The Great Dictator''{{'s}} twist of mistaken identity, the similarity between the Barber and the Tramp allowed Chaplin break {{sic}} with his old persona in the sense of characterization, but to capitalize on him in a visual sense. The similar nature of the Tramp and Barber characterizations may have been an effort by Chaplin to maintain his popularity with filmgoers, many of whom by 1940 had never seen a [[silent film|silent picture]] during the silent era. Chaplin may have created a new character from the old, but he nonetheless counted on the Charlie person to bring audiences into the theaters for his first foray into sound, and his boldest political statement to date.<ref>{{cite book |title=Chaplin in the sound era: an analysis of the seven talkies |last=Flom |first= Eric |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland |isbn= 978-0-7864-0325-7 |page=322 }}</ref>}}\n\n===Awards===\nThe film was [[13th Academy Awards#Awards|nominated for five]] [[Academy Award]]s:\n* [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Outstanding Production]] \u2013 [[United Artists]] (Charlie Chaplin, Producer)\n* [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] \u2013 Charlie Chaplin\n* [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] \u2013 Charlie Chaplin\n* [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] \u2013 [[Jack Oakie]]\n* [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music (Original Score)]] \u2013 [[Meredith Willson]]\n\n==Plagiarism lawsuit==\nChaplin's half-brother [[Sydney Chaplin|Sydney]] directed and starred in a 1921 film called ''[[King, Queen, Joker]]'' in which, like Chaplin, he played the dual role of a barber and ruler of a country which is about to be overthrown.

He lettered three years (2000\u20132002) as a wide receiver. He also played special teams for most of his playing career, serving as the holder for place kicks. He participated in three bowl games while playing at Clemson: the [[2001 Gator Bowl]], [[2001 Humanitarian Bowl]], and [[2002 Tangerine Bowl]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nScott started his coaching career as the head football coach for [[Blythewood High School]] in [[Blythewood, South Carolina]] in 2006. He won a state title in his first and only year, at the age of 25. This was Blythewood's football program's inaugural year as well. It is believed to be the first time in South Carolina high school football history that a first year head football coach led his program to a state title in its first year of fielding a team. After one year coaching at the high school level, he then served in the position of wide receivers coach for the [[Presbyterian Blue Hose football|Presbyterian Blue Hose]] of [[Presbyterian College]] in 2007.  He made his return to Clemson in 2008 as a graduate assistant on [[Tommy Bowden]]'s staff. When [[Dabo Swinney]] took over as interim head coach midway through the 2008 season he was promoted to coach wide receivers, the position that had been held by coach Swinney. He was promoted to head of recruiting in December 2008 when Dabo Swinney was given the full-time position. In December 2014, he was named co-offensive coordinator to replace outgoing offensive coordinator [[Chad Morris]], who left to take over as head coach of the SMU football program. He shared coordinator duties with Clemson's running back's coach and former teammate, [[Tony L. Elliott]]. Former Clemson teammate Brandon Streeter was hired to take over recruiting coordinator duties as well as to coach quarterbacks.\n\nClemson's football team won the national championship in January 2017, beating [[2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], with Scott and Elliott as offensive coordinators for the game.\n\n==Head coaching record==\n===College===\n{{CFB Yearly Record Start | type = coach | team = | conf =  | bowl = | poll = no }}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subhead\n | name      = [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida Bulls]]\n | conf      = [[American Athletic Conference]]\n | startyear = 2020\n | endyear   = \n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[2020 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2020]]\n | name         = [[South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida]]\n | overall      = 0\u20130\n | conference   = 0\u20130\n | confstanding = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subtotal\n | name       = South Florida\n | overall    = 0\u20130\n | confrecord = 0\u20130\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record End\n | overall = 0\u20130\n | bowls   = no\n | poll    = no\n | legend  = no\n}}\n\n==Personal life==\nScott graduated with a bachelor's degree in secondary education from Clemson University in 2003.

He lettered three years (2000\u20132002) as a wide receiver. He also played special teams for most of his playing career, serving as the holder for place kicks. He participated in three bowl games while playing at Clemson: the [[2001 Gator Bowl]], [[2001 Humanitarian Bowl]], and [[2002 Tangerine Bowl]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nScott started his coaching career as the head football coach for [[Blythewood High School]] in [[Blythewood, South Carolina]] in 2006. He won a state title in his first and only year, at the age of 25. This was Blythewood's football program's inaugural year as well. It is believed to be the first time in South Carolina high school football history that a first year head football coach led his program to a state title in its first year of fielding a team. After one year coaching at the high school level, he then served in the position of wide receivers coach for the [[Presbyterian Blue Hose football|Presbyterian Blue Hose]] of [[Presbyterian College]] in 2007.  He made his return to Clemson in 2008 as a graduate assistant on [[Tommy Bowden]]'s staff. When [[Dabo Swinney]] took over as interim head coach midway through the 2008 season he was promoted to coach wide receivers, the position that had been held by coach Swinney. He was promoted to head of recruiting in December 2008 when Dabo Swinney was given the full-time position. In December 2014, he was named co-offensive coordinator to replace outgoing offensive coordinator [[Chad Morris]], who left to take over as head coach of the SMU football program. He shared coordinator duties with Clemson's running back's coach and former teammate, [[Tony L. Elliott]]. Former Clemson teammate Brandon Streeter was hired to take over recruiting coordinator duties as well as to coach quarterbacks.\n\nClemson's football team won the national championship in January 2017, beating [[2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]], with Scott and Elliott as offensive coordinators for the game.\n\n==Head coaching record==\n===College===\n{{CFB Yearly Record Start | type = coach | team = | conf =  | bowl = | poll = no }}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subhead\n | name      = [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida Bulls]]\n | conf      = [[American Athletic Conference]]\n | startyear = 2020\n | endyear   = \n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[2020 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2020]]\n | name         = [[South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida]]\n | overall      = 0\u20130\n | conference   = 0\u20130\n | confstanding = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subtotal\n | name       = South Florida\n | overall    = 0\u20130\n | confrecord = 0\u20130\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record End\n | overall = 0\u20130\n | bowls   = no\n | poll    = no\n | legend  = no\n}}\n\n==Personal life==\nScott graduated with a bachelor's degree in secondary education from Clemson University in 2003.
