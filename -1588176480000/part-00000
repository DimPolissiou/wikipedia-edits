Invitations followed to perform at the [[Bath Festival]], [[Camden Festival]] (where its first staged production was [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]\u2019s [[Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali|''Le convenienze ed inconvenienze teatrali'']]) and [[Sadler\u2019s Wells]].\u00a0 A new relationship with [[BBC Radio 3]] enabled the company\u2019s discoveries to reach a wider audience. However, a concurrent rise in pirated recordings of Opera Rara performances led to a decision to issue its own recordings. In 1978, it released its first: the world premiere studio recording of Donizetti\u2019s [[Ugo, conte di Parigi|''Ugo, conte di Parigi'']] starring [[Janet Price]], [[Yvonne Kenny]], [[Della Jones]] and [[Christian du Plessis]]. The opera itself had been painstakingly reconstructed by Patric Schmid from the composer\u2019s own manuscript. \n\nHonouring founders Patric and Don\u2019s ambition to document all 70 of Donizetti\u2019s operas, the composer\u2019s output continues to be the heartland for Opera Rara to this day. In July 2018, the company gave the world premiere of ''[[L'ange de Nisida|L\u2019Ange de Nisida]]'' in collaboration with the [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]]. A live recording taken from those performances was released in March 2019. The score had been reconstructed over a period of eight years by Italian musicologist Candida Mantica. The first complete staging of ''L\u2019Ange de Nisida'' was subsequently given at the 2019 Donizetti Festival in [[Bergamo]].\n\n==Legacy==\nOpera Rara has not only played a central role in the evaluation of Donizetti\u2019s reputation and oeuvre but in the Renaissance of the wider bel canto repertoire. The company has brought back to life works by other 19th-century composers such as [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]], [[Simon Mayr|Mayr]], [[Saverio Mercadante|Mercadante]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], [[Giovanni Pacini|Pacini]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Ambroise Thomas|Thomas]]. Under Artistic Director [[Mark Elder|Sir Mark Elder]] (2011-2019), the company also began to explore works by French composers of the same period including [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]] and [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], as well as verismo operas from the turn of the 20th century. In September 2019, Italian conductor [[Carlo Rizzi (conductor)|Carlo Rizzi]] succeeded Sir Mark Elder.\n\nOpera Rara\u2019s rediscoveries have inspired international opera companies to stage full productions with recent examples including Offenbach\u2019s ''[[Fantasio (opera)|Fantasio]]'' at [[Paris]]\u2019 [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] and the [[Garsington Opera|Garsington Festival]], and [[Ruggero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]]\u2019s ''[[Zaz\u00e0]]'' at [[Opera Holland Park]].\n\n==Performances==\nIn recent years, Opera Rara has given annual concert performances of operas either at [[London]]\u2019s [[Barbican Centre]] or [[Royal Festival Hall|The Royal Festival Hall]], usually preceded by a week\u2013long recording in the studio. In addition to collaborating regularly with the UK\u2019s leading orchestras such as the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment]], [[the Hall\u00e9]], [[Britten Sinfonia]] and [[London Philharmonic Orchestra|London Philharmonic Orchestra,]] the company also works with leading conductors in the field of opera including [[Maurizio Benini]] and [[Daniele Rustioni]]. British conductor [[David Parry (conductor)|David Parry]] has also been a major feature of Opera Rara projects for over thirty years, conducting over twenty operas. Opera Rara has now worked with [[Royal Opera House|Royal Opera House, Covent Garden]] four times and in addition to past appearances at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]], made its [[The Proms|BBC Proms]] debut with Rossini's ''[[Semiramide]]'' in 2016. Opera Rara\u2019s first international collaboration was in 2019, with the [[Orquestra de la Comunitat Valenciana]] on ''Anima Rara'', [[Ermonela Jaho]]\u2019s debut recital disc inspired by the 19th-century Italian soprano [[Rosina Storchio]].\n\n==Recordings==\nSince 1970, Opera Rara has released over 100 recordings including 60 complete operas \u2013 many of which are world premiere recordings \u2013 an \u201cIl Salotto\u201d series and artist collections. The company\u2019s studio recordings with their carefully researched booklets have met with international acclaim. Recent accolades include the 2019 [[International Opera Awards|International Opera]], [[International Classical Music Awards|International Classical Music]], Opus Klassik and [[Edison Klassiek]] Awards for Rossini\u2019s ''[[Semiramide]]'' and 2019 [https://www.oper-magazin.de/home/ Oper!] Best Opera Recording for Donizettii\u2019s ''[[L'ange de Nisida|L\u2019Ange de Nisida]]''.\n\nOver the years, Opera Rara has established close relationships with a number of singers and helped nurture their careers.

Such actions should include [[statutory]] \u2014 including fiscal \u2014 measures designed to make unprocessed and minimally processed food more available and affordable, to encourage consumption of freshly-prepared meals, to eliminate all subsidies and price support schemes that make ultra-processed food artificially cheap, and to regulate and restrict its manufacture and marketing.<ref name=\"PAHO_2019\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" /><ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Moodie R, Stuckler D, Monteiro C, Sheron N, Neal B, Thamarangsi T, Lincoln P, Casswell S |date=12 February 2013|title=Profits and pandemics: prevention of harmful effects of tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food and drink industries |journal=The Lancet |volume=381|issue=9867|pages=670\u2013679|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62089-3|pmid=23410611}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Swinburn BA, Kraak VI, Allender S, Atkins VJ, Baker PI, Bogard JR, Brinsden H, Calvillo A, De Schutter O, Devarajan R, Ezzati M, Friel S, Goenka S, Hammond RA, Hastings G, Hawkes C, Herrero M, Hovmand PS, Howden M, Jaacks LM, Kapetanaki AB, Kasman M, Kuhnlein HV, Kumanyika SK, Larijani B, Lobstein T, Long MW, Matsudo VK, Mills SD, Morgan G, Morshed A, Nece PM, Pan A, Patterson DW, Sacks G, Shekar M, Simmons GL, Smit W, Tootee A, Vandevijvere S, Waterlander WE, Wolfenden L, Dietz WH | display-authors = 6 | title = The Global Syndemic of Obesity, Undernutrition, and Climate Change: The Lancet Commission report | journal = Lancet | volume = 393 | issue = 10173 | pages = 791\u2013846 | date = February 2019 | pmid = 30700377 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32822-8 }}</ref>\n\n== Media coverage ==\nA French [[longitudinal study]] from the Nutri Net Sant\u00e9 group published in 2018<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiolet T, Srour B, Sellem L, Kesse-Guyot E, All\u00e8s B, M\u00e9jean C, Deschasaux M, Fassier P, Latino-Martel P, Beslay M, Hercberg S, Lavalette C, Monteiro CA, Julia C, Touvier M | display-authors = 6 | title = Consumption of ultra-processed foods and cancer risk: results from NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 prospective cohort | journal = BMJ | volume = 360 | pages = k322 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29444771 | pmc = 5811844 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.k322 }}</ref> showing a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between ultra-processed food and [[cancer]] risk prompted some media outlets to run alarmist headlines claiming that eating such food may raise [[cancer]] risk, or does raise risk \u2014 these headlines were based on a common misunderstanding between [[Correlation does not imply causation|correlation and causation]].<ref name=hnr>{{cite web |publisher=Health News Review |author=Lomangino K |title='Ultra-processed' foods and cancer: Headlines show the right way, and the wrong way, to frame study results |url=https://www.healthnewsreview.org/2018/02/ultra-processed-foods-and-cancer-headlines-show-the-right-way-and-the-wrong-way-to-frame-study-results/ |date=15 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nMedia coverage of ultra-processed food, and ultra-processing and the NOVA food classification generally has been very extensive since publication beginning in 2018 of a series of French studies undertaken by the Nutri Net Sant\u00e9 group<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://info.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr/en/node/2|title=Welcome to the official website of the NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 Study. {{!}} Site institutionnel de l'\u00e9tude NutriNet-Sant\u00e9|website=info.etude-nutrinet-sante.fr|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>, and publication in 2019 of the [[National Institutes of Health|US National Institutes of Health]] [[Randomized controlled trial|randomised controlled trial]] of ultra-processed food and increases in body weight and fat.<ref name=\":2\" /> This includes briefings from scientific centres and expert organisations, reports in many countries on television and radio, newspapers and magazines, videos, podcasts, blogs, and commentary on the internet, some of which has been summarised and quoted.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=O\u2019Connor|first=Anahad|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/well/eat/why-eating-processed-foods-might-make-you-fat.html|title=Why Eating Processed Foods Might Make You Fat|date=2019-05-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nAs reported on US [[NPR|National Public Radio]] and in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]], senior US researchers were impressed by the [[National Institutes of Health]] study.
