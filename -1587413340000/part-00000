Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Allen, W C.

One of the most famous groups that she was associated with was the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. Her art works expresses a view of landscape in bold colours that would be categorized later on as part of the Group of Seven landscape painting that captures the two visions of the land: the romantic-realist view of the railway artists of the 1880s and the heroic view of the landscape in the 1890s.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nShe joined the Womens Art Association of Canada where she studied painting on china with Mary E. Dignam, its founding president.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray was welcomed into communities and numerous social affairs which included the Society of Women Painters and Sculptors and the Women Painters and Sculptors Art Club (Women Painters and Sculptors 1917) which were both centralized in New York City.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> She continued her study of painting on china  with Marshall Fry in New York in 1898 and sold her pieces later from her studio in Whitby <ref name=\":1\" />. She also gave painting classes in Whitby.<ref name=\":1\" /> She became an instructor and a critic at an all boys\u2019 school in Pickering College and an assistant art instructor at the Ontario's Ladies\u2019 College in the 1900s and later, the head of the art department.<ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://images.ourontario.ca/whitby/43070/data|title=Florence Helena McGillivray, 1906|website=images.ourontario.ca}}</ref> \n\nThe artist also helped encourage fellow Canadian artist [[Tom Thomson]], who was praised for his landscape paintings.<ref name=\":2\" /> In 1913 during her trip in Paris, her instructors  at the [[Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re|Academie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re]] were Lucien Simon and Emile-Rene Menard. But her real inspiration was the artist Frederic Fiebig<ref>{{Cite book|last=Allen |first=W C.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1090427835|title=She is one of the best : a researcher's notes on the life and times of canadian artist Florence...

Her works of art in this mode were acknowledged and she was invited to display her paintings at the Salon des Beaux Arts.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> Not long later, it is said, the artist was voted as president of the International Union.<ref name=\":2\" />  In the later years of McGillivray's life she joined the [[Ontario Society of Artists]] (1917), she was elected an Associate member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]](1924),<ref name=\":1\" /> and was a Charter member of the Canadian Society of Painters in Watercolour and its first woman member (1925). <ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\" />\n\n== Influence and Style ==\n[[File:St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H. McGillivray.jpg|thumb|St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H. McGillivray Canadian, 1864 - 1938 oil on canvas 46.7 x 61.6&nbsp;cm Purchased 1926 National Gallery of Canada (no. 3352)]]\n\nMcGillivray traveled across Canada for inspiration.<ref name=\":1\" /> She painted her environment using bold colours and the contour of shapes.<ref name=\":1\" /> McGillivray's artistic style stressed the \"abstract qualities of lines, shapes and forms\"<ref name=\":1\" /> that was expressed in her work through a large amount of paint applied using the palette knife in her oil paintings.<ref name=\":1\" /> Working outdoors, the painter developed a powerful style that defined her career.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer inspiration derived from various environments<ref name=\":1\" /> including her hometown of Whitby, and her travel to the Gatineau area <ref name=\":0\" />, as well as to Eastern Canada, including Newfoundland, and to Trinidad, Jamaica, Bahama Islands in the West Indies, Alaska, Eastern United States, Western Canada, Venice, Italy and the Swiss Alps.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> She worked in many media which included watercolour, pastel and oil.<ref name=\":1\" /> During her trip to Europe, she had encountered newly forming art styles of Symbolism and Post Impressionism that impacted and influenced her art. Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Allen, W C.

Minneapolis and St. Anthony merged in 1872. There is also a city named [[St. Anthony, Stearns County, Minnesota|St. Anthony]] in [[Stearns County, Minnesota|Stearns County]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:StAnthonysign.jpg|left|thumb|Signage to the city]]\nSt. Anthony's origins date to 1838, when [[Franklin Steele]], a storekeeper at [[Fort Snelling]], made a claim on the land east of [[St. Anthony Falls]]. Steele did not begin developing the land until 1848, but it quickly became a center of milling and trade much like the neighboring town of Minneapolis on the land west of the falls. In 1858 the town was formally organized as the Township of St. Anthony.<ref>{{cite web| title=Early St. Anthony and Minneapolis| url=http://www.mnhs.org/places/safhb/history_early.php| website=St. Anthony Falls Heritage Board}}</ref>\n\nIn 1872, Minneapolis annexed most of St. Anthony (much of present-day [[Northeast, Minneapolis|Northeast Minneapolis]]). Roughly {{convert|1000|acre}} of mostly agricultural land north of the city retained the name St. Anthony but remained unincorporated. In 1945, the township's residents voted 167\u201357 in favor of incorporating as a village. The state challenged this decision on the basis that St. Anthony was too agricultural and rural, but it was upheld by the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]]. As the city's suburbs grew outward, St. Anthony evolved from a rural township to an [[inner suburb]].<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Anthony History| url=http://www.ci.saint-anthony.mn.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={D5B9ACE3-BD0C-47FC-BF54-75188969A419}&DE={11517D69-FE5F-4FAA-8299-54CED52EBCD8}| website=City of St. Anthony}}</ref>\n\nSt. Anthony was the home of [[Apache Plaza]], the tenth indoor shopping mall in United States, which opened in October 1961. The second oldest, [[Southdale Center|Southdale]], lay only {{convert|15|mi}} to the south and was completed in October 1956.

Minneapolis and St. Anthony merged in 1872. There is also a city named [[St. Anthony, Stearns County, Minnesota|St. Anthony]] in [[Stearns County, Minnesota|Stearns County]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:StAnthonysign.jpg|left|thumb|Signage to the city]]\nSt. Anthony's origins date to 1838, when [[Franklin Steele]], a storekeeper at [[Fort Snelling]], made a claim on the land east of [[St. Anthony Falls]]. Steele did not begin developing the land until 1848, but it quickly became a center of milling and trade much like the neighboring town of Minneapolis on the land west of the falls. In 1858 the town was formally organized as the Township of St. Anthony.<ref>{{cite web| title=Early St. Anthony and Minneapolis| url=http://www.mnhs.org/places/safhb/history_early.php| website=St. Anthony Falls Heritage Board}}</ref>\n\nIn 1872, Minneapolis annexed most of St. Anthony (much of present-day [[Northeast, Minneapolis|Northeast Minneapolis]]). Roughly {{convert|1000|acre}} of mostly agricultural land north of the city retained the name St. Anthony but remained unincorporated. In 1945, the township's residents voted 167\u201357 in favor of incorporating as a village. The state challenged this decision on the basis that St. Anthony was too agricultural and rural, but it was upheld by the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]]. As the city's suburbs grew outward, St. Anthony evolved from a rural township to an [[inner suburb]].<ref>{{cite web| title=St. Anthony History| url=http://www.ci.saint-anthony.mn.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={D5B9ACE3-BD0C-47FC-BF54-75188969A419}&DE={11517D69-FE5F-4FAA-8299-54CED52EBCD8}| website=City of St. Anthony}}</ref>\n\nSt. Anthony was the home of [[Apache Plaza]], the tenth indoor shopping mall in United States, which opened in October 1961.

The FAT file system is a continuing standard which borrows source code from the original, [[legacy system|legacy]] file system and proves to be simple and robust.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2010_FAT\" /> It offers useful performance even in lightweight implementations, but cannot deliver the same performance, reliability and scalability as some modern file systems. It is, however, supported for compatibility reasons by nearly all currently developed [[operating system]]s for personal computers and many [[mobile device]]s and [[embedded system]]s, and thus is a well-suited format for data exchange between computers and devices of almost any type and age from 1981<!-- 86-DOS 0.42+ and MS-DOS/PC DOS 1.xx --> up to the present.\n \nOriginally designed in 1977 for use on [[floppy disk]]s, FAT was soon adapted and used almost universally on [[hard disk drive|hard disks]] throughout the [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] eras for two decades.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A brief introduction to FAT (File Allocation Table) formats |url = http://www.wizcode.com/articles/comments/a-brief-introduction-to-fat-file-allocation-table/|website = www.wizcode.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150925082826/http://www.wizcode.com/articles/comments/a-brief-introduction-to-fat-file-allocation-table/|archive-date = September 25, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> As disk drives evolved, the capabilities of the file system have been extended accordingly, resulting in three major file system variants: [[#FAT12|FAT12]], [[#FAT16|FAT16]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]]. The FAT standard has also been expanded in other ways while generally preserving backward compatibility with existing software.\n\nWith the introduction of more powerful computers and operating systems, as well as the development of more complex file systems for them, FAT is no longer the default file system for usage on [[Microsoft Windows]] computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/comparing-ntfs-and-fat-file-systems |title=Comparing NTFS and FAT file systems |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}</ref>\n\nFAT file systems are still commonly found on floppy disks, [[flash memory|flash]] and other [[Solid-state storage|solid-state]] [[memory card]]s and modules (including [[USB flash drive]]s), as well as many portable and embedded devices.

If you came here via an existing link please fix up the link by pointing it to [[Design of the FAT file system]] instead, or leave a note on the talk page for assistance. All previous embedded anchors continue to exist in the new article}}\n\nThe name of the file system originates from the file system's prominent usage of an index table, the ''[[Design of the FAT file system#FAT|File Allocation Table]]'' (''FAT''), statically allocated at the time of formatting. The table contains entries for each ''[[cluster (file system)|cluster]]'', a contiguous area of disk storage. Each entry contains either the number of the next cluster in the file, or else a marker indicating the end of the file, unused disk space, or special reserved areas of the disk. The ''root directory'' of the disk contains the number of the first cluster of each file in that directory; the operating system can then traverse the FAT, looking up the cluster number of each successive part of the disk file as a ''cluster chain'' until the end of the file is reached. In much the same way, ''sub-directories'' are implemented as special files containing the ''directory entries'' of their respective files.\n\nOriginally designed as an 8-bit file system, the maximum number of clusters has been significantly increased as disk drives have evolved, and so the number of bits used to identify each cluster has grown. The successive major variants of the FAT format are named after the number of table element bits: 12 ([[#FAT12|FAT12]]), 16 ([[#FAT16|FAT16]]), and 32 ([[#FAT32|FAT32]]). Except for the original [[#FAT8|8-bit FAT]] precursor, each of these variants is still{{when|date=August 2016}} in use. The FAT standard has also been expanded in other ways while generally preserving backward compatibility with existing software.\n\n=== <span id=\"ECMA\"></span><span id=\"ISO\"></span>Uses ===\n\nThe FAT file system has a [[#Historical evolution|long history]] (over three decades) of usage on desktops and portable computers, and it is frequently used in embedded solutions.\n\nFAT offers reasonably good performance and robustness, even in very light-weight implementations.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2010_FAT\" /> It is therefore widely adopted and supported by virtually all existing [[operating system]]s for personal computers as well as some [[home computers]] and a multitude of [[embedded systems]]. This also makes it a useful format for [[solid-state drive|solid-state]] [[memory card]]s and a convenient way to share data between [[operating system]]s.\n\nFAT file systems are the default file system for removable media (with the exception of CDs and DVDs) and as such are commonly found on [[floppy disk]]s, [[superfloppy|super-floppies]], [[memory card|memory]] and [[flash memory]] cards or [[USB flash drives]] and are supported by most portable devices such as [[PDA]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, [[Portable media player|media player]]s, or mobile phones. While [[#FAT12|FAT12]] is omnipresent on floppy disks, [[#FAT16|FAT16]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]] are typically found on the larger media.\n\nFAT was also commonly used on [[hard disk drive|hard disks]] throughout the [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] eras, but its use on hard drives has declined since the introduction of [[Windows XP]], which primarily uses the newer [[NTFS]]. FAT is still used in hard drives expected to be used by multiple operating systems, such as in shared Windows, [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] and DOS environments.\n\nDue to the widespread use of FAT-formatted media, many operating systems provide support for FAT through official or third-party file system handlers. For example, [[OS/2]], [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]] and [[BeOS]] provide built-in support for FAT, even though they also support more sophisticated file systems such as [[ext4]] or [[btrfs]]. [[Mac OS 9]] and [[macOS]] support FAT file systems on volumes other than the [[boot disk]]. [[AmigaOS]] supports FAT through the [[CrossDOS]] package.\n\nFor many purposes, the NTFS file system is superior to FAT in terms of features and reliability; its main drawbacks are its complexity and the size overhead for small volumes as well as the very limited support by anything other than the NT-based versions of Windows, since the exact specification is a [[trade secret]] of Microsoft. The availability of [[NTFS-3G]] since mid-2006 has led to much improved NTFS support in [[Unix-like]] operating systems, considerably alleviating this concern. It is still not possible to use NTFS in DOS-like operating systems without third-party drivers, which in turn makes it difficult to use a DOS floppy for recovery purposes. Microsoft provided a [[Recovery Console]] to work around this issue, but for security reasons it severely limited what could be done through the Recovery Console by default. The movement of recovery utilities to boot CDs based on [[BartPE]], Linux (with NTFS-3G), or [[WinPE]] is eroding this drawback, but the complexity of NTFS prevents its implementation in light-weight operating systems or most embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Design rule for Camera File system|DCF]] file system adopted by almost all [[digital camera]]s since 1998 defines a logical file system with [[8.3 filename]]s and makes the use of either FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT mandatory for its physical layer in order to maximize platform interoperability.<ref name=\"DC-009-2010\" />\n\nFAT is also used internally for the [[EFI system partition]] (partition type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_EFh|0xEF]]</tt>) in the boot stage of [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]]-compliant computers.<ref name=\"efi\" />\n\nHidden FAT filesystems are also used in the [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface|UEFI]] boot partition on modern PC's where the UEFI specification requires compliant firmware to be capable of reading FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 compliant partitions.\n\nFor floppy disks, FAT has been standardized as [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-107<ref name=\"Ecma-107\" /> and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]&nbsp;9293:1994<ref name=\"ISO_9293_1994\" /> (superseding ISO&nbsp;9293:1987<ref name=\"ISO_9293_1987\" />). These standards cover FAT12 and FAT16 with only short [[8.3 filename]] support; [[long filename]]s with [[#VFAT|VFAT]] are partially [[#Patents|patent]]ed.<ref name=\"Patent_5758352\" />\n\n=== Nomenclature ===\n\nTechnically, the term \"FAT file system\" refers to all three major variants of the file system, [[#FAT12|FAT12]], [[#FAT16|FAT16]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]], and most parties clearly distinguish between them where necessary.\nIn contrast to this, Microsoft typically no longer distinguishes between all three of them since the introduction of FAT32, and refers to both FAT12 and FAT16 as \"FAT\", whereas \"FAT32\" gets treated specially in dialog boxes and documentation. This can sometimes lead to confusion if the actual type of the file system used is not mentioned or cannot be explicitly specified (e.g., \"Do you want to format as FAT or FAT32?\" instead of \"Do you want to format as FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32?\").\n\nAnother common cause of confusion exists within the group of FAT16 file systems, since the term \"[[#FAT16|FAT16]]\" refers to both, either the whole group of FAT file systems with 16-bit wide cluster entries, or specifically only the original implementation of it with [[DOS 2.0 BPB|16-bit sector entries]], when it becomes necessary to differentiate between the original and the later implementation. While technically the newer variant with [[DOS 3.31 BPB|32-bit sector entries]] is called \"[[#FAT16B|FAT16B]]\", it is commonly referred to under the name \"FAT16\" as well, in particular since the original variant is rarely seen today and typically only used on small media when [[backward compatibility]] with DOS before 3.31 is required.\n\nFurther, the term \"[[#VFAT|VFAT]]\" has led to various misconceptions as well,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_VFAT_Name\" /> as it is sometimes erroneously used as if it would describe another variant of FAT file system to be distinguished from the FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 file systems, while in reality it does not specify another file system, but an optional extension, which can work on top of any FAT file system, FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32. Volumes utilizing VFAT long-filenames can be read also by operating systems not supporting the VFAT extension, as long as any operating systems that support the underlying file system (FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32).\n\nYet another cause for misconceptions stems from some apparent redundancy and possible ambiguity in the definition of FAT volumes.\nThe general type of file system (FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32) is determined by the width of the cluster entries in the FAT.

(While MS-DOS and PC DOS support up to 4084 data clusters on FAT12 volumes in general, cluster value <tt>0xFF0</tt><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_MAGIC_FF0\" /> is treated as additional end-of-chain marker on any FAT12 volume<ref name=\"Chappell_1994_DOS-Internals\" /> since [[MS-DOS 3.3|MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS 3.3]], which also introduced the <tt>0xF0</tt> [[BPB media descriptor|media descriptor]] value, therefore restricting the maximum practical number of data clusters to 4078 for compatibility purposes with these operating systems.)\n\nThe disk's size was stored and calculated as a 16-bit count of [[Cylinder-head-sector|sectors]], which limited the size to 32&nbsp;MiB for a logical sector size of 512&nbsp;bytes. FAT12 was used by several manufacturers with different physical formats, but a typical floppy disk at the time was 5.25-inch (130&nbsp;mm), single-sided, 40&nbsp;[[Cylinder-head-sector|tracks]], with 8&nbsp;sectors per track, resulting in a capacity of 160&nbsp;KiB for both the system areas and files. The FAT12 limitations exceeded this capacity by a factor of ten or more. (NB. The 32&nbsp;MiB limit was later circumvented using [[#Logical sectored FAT|logical sectored FAT]]s with logical sector sizes larger than 512&nbsp;bytes in some OEM versions of MS-DOS&nbsp;3.x, but this fell into disuse when [[#FAT16B|FAT16B]] became available with DOS&nbsp;3.31, which supported [[32-bit]] sector numbers and thereby further lifted the limits.)\n\nBy convention, all the control structures were organized to fit inside the first track, thus avoiding head movement during read and write operations, although this varied depending on the manufacturer and physical format of the disk. A limitation that was not addressed until much later (with [[#FAT32|FAT32]]) was that any bad sector in the control structures area, track&nbsp;0, could prevent the disk from being usable. The DOS formatting tool rejected such disks completely. Bad sectors were allowed only in the file data area and (since DOS&nbsp;2.0) were marked with the reserved value <tt>0xFF7</tt> in the FAT. They made the entire containing cluster unusable.\n\nWhile 86-DOS supported three disk formats (250.25&nbsp;KiB, 616&nbsp;KiB and 1232&nbsp;KiB with [[FAT ID]]s <tt>0xFF</tt> and <tt>0xFE</tt><!-- it's not clear if QDOS/86-DOS already used the FAT ID byte, or if this was added with MS-DOS/PC DOS 1.x. Definitely known: Standalone Disk BASIC and MIDAS did not support the FAT ID byte. Also, sources differ in regard to the actual format assignment for the 0xFF, 0xFE and 0xFD IDs. Details to be sorted out. -->) on 8-inch (200&nbsp;mm) floppy drives, IBM [[PC&nbsp;DOS 1.0]], released with the original [[IBM Personal Computer]] in 1981, supported only an 8-sector floppy format with a formatted capacity of 160&nbsp;KiB (FAT ID <tt>0xFE</tt>) for single-sided 5.25-inch floppy drives, and [[PC&nbsp;DOS 1.1]] added support for a [[double-sided disk|double-sided]] format with 320&nbsp;KiB (FAT ID <tt>0xFF</tt>). [[PC DOS 2.0]] introduced support for 9-sector floppy formats with 180&nbsp;KiB (FAT ID <tt>0xFC</tt>) and 360&nbsp;KiB (FAT ID <tt>0xFD</tt>).\n\n86-DOS&nbsp;1.00 and PC&nbsp;DOS 1.0 directory entries included only one date, the last modified date. PC&nbsp;DOS 1.1 added the last modified time. PC&nbsp;DOS 1.x [[file attribute]]s included a hidden bit and system bit, with the remaining six bits undefined. At this time, DOS did not support a hierarchical file system, which was still acceptable, given that the number of files on a disk was typically not more than a few dozen.\n\nThe [[PC XT]] was the first PC with a hard drive from IBM, and PC&nbsp;DOS 2.0 supported that hard drive with FAT12 ([[FAT ID]] <tt>0xF8</tt>).

Cluster addresses were increased to 16-bit, allowing for up to 65,524&nbsp;clusters per volume, and consequently much greater file system sizes, at least in theory. However, the maximum possible number of sectors and the maximum ([[Disk partitioning|partition]], rather than disk) size of 32&nbsp;MiB did not change. Therefore, although cluster addresses were 16&nbsp;bits, this format was not what today is commonly understood as '''FAT16'''.\nA [[partition type]] <tt>[[Partition type#PID_04h|0x04]]</tt> indicates this form of FAT16 with less than 65536&nbsp;sectors (less than 32&nbsp;MiB for sector size 512).\n\nWith the initial implementation of FAT16 not actually providing for larger partition sizes than FAT12, the early benefit of FAT16 was to enable the use of smaller clusters, making disk usage more efficient, particularly for large numbers of files only a few hundred bytes in size.\n\nAs MS-DOS&nbsp;3.0 and higher formatted all 16&nbsp;MiB-32&nbsp;MiB partitions in the FAT16 format, a 20&nbsp;MiB hard disk formatted under MS-DOS&nbsp;3.0 was not accessible by the older MS-DOS&nbsp;2.0 although MS-DOS&nbsp;2.0 was able to access 16&nbsp;MiB-32&nbsp;MiB FAT12 partitions.<ref name=\"Microsoft_69912\" /> MS-DOS&nbsp;3.0 to MS-DOS&nbsp;3.30 could still access FAT12 partitions under 15&nbsp;MiB but required all 16&nbsp;MiB-32&nbsp;MiB partitions to be FAT16, and so failed to access MS-DOS&nbsp;2.0 partitions in this size range. MS-DOS&nbsp;3.31 and higher could access 16&nbsp;MiB-32&nbsp;MiB FAT12 partitions again.\n\n=== Logical sectored FAT ===\n<!-- NB.

Several manufacturers addressed this problem, however, by developing their own FAT variants within their OEM issued versions of MS-DOS.<ref name=\"Novell_1993_FYI.M.1101\"/>\n\nSome vendors ([[AST Research|AST]] and [[NEC]]<ref name=\"Novell_1993_FYI.M.1101\"/>) supported [[AST MBR<!-- NEC MBR -->|eight]], instead of the standard [[Partition table (master boot record)|four]], primary partition entries in their custom extended ''[[Master Boot Record]]'' (''MBR''), and they adapted MS-DOS to use more than a single primary partition.\n\nOther vendors worked around the volume size limits imposed by the 16-bit sector entries and arithmetics by increasing the ''size'' of the sectors the file system dealt with, thereby blowing up dimensions.\n\nThese so-called ''logical sectors'' were larger (up to 8192&nbsp;bytes) than the ''physical sector'' size (still typically 512&nbsp;bytes) as expected by the [[ROM-BIOS]] [[INT 13H]]<!-- not sure if these OEM versions supported INT 13h, as the classical INT 13h is bound to 512 bytes. --> or the disk drive hardware. The DOS-BIOS or System BIOS would then combine multiple physical sectors into logical sectors for the file system to work with.\nThese changes were transparent to the file system implementation in the DOS kernel, since on the file system's abstraction level volumes are seen as a linear series of logically addressable sectors, also known as ''absolute sectors'' (addressed by their ''Logical Sector Number'' (''LSN''), starting with LSN&nbsp;0)<!-- similar to what much later and on a lower level, became known as LBA, though not directly related --> independent of the physical location of the volume on the physical medium and its geometry. The underlying DOS-BIOS translated these logical sectors into physical sectors according to partitioning information and the drive's physical geometry.\n\nThe drawback of this approach was a less memory-efficient sector buffering and deblocking in the DOS-BIOS, thereby causing an increased memory footprint for the DOS data structures.\nSince older DOS versions were not flexible enough to work with these logical geometries, the OEMs had to introduce new partition IDs for their FAT variants in order to hide them from off-the-shelf issues of MS-DOS and PC DOS. Known partition IDs for logical sectored FATs include: <tt>[[Partition type#PID_08h|0x08]]</tt> ([[Commodore International|Commodore]] MS-DOS 3.x), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_11h|0x11]]</tt> ([[Leading Edge Hardware Products|Leading Edge]] MS-DOS 3.x), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_14h|0x14]]</tt> (AST MS-DOS 3.x), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_24h|0x24]]</tt> (NEC MS-DOS 3.30<ref name=\"Novell_1993_FYI.M.1101\"/>), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_56h|0x56]]</tt> ([[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] MS-DOS 3.x), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_E5h|0xE5]]</tt> ([[Tandy Computers|Tandy]] MS-DOS), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_F2h|0xF2]]</tt> ([[Sperry Corporation|Sperry IT]] MS-DOS 3.x, [[Unisys]] MS-DOS 3.3 \u2013 also used by [[Digital Research]] [[DOS Plus]] 2.1).<ref name=\"Brouwer_2002_Partition-IDs\" /> OEM versions like Toshiba&nbsp;MS-DOS, Wyse&nbsp;MS-DOS&nbsp;3.2<!-- with 1024 bytes/sector --> and 3.3,<ref name=\"Microsoft_2000_Wyse-DOS\" /> as well as Zenith&nbsp;MS-DOS are also known to have utilized logical sectoring.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2000_Logical-sectoring\" /><!-- but partition IDs and other specifics of these formats are not known -->\n\nWhile non-standard and sub-optimal, these FAT variants are perfectly valid according to the specifications of the file system itself. Therefore, even if default issues of MS-DOS and PC&nbsp;DOS were not able to cope with them, most of these vendor-specific FAT12 and FAT16 variants can be mounted by more flexible file system implementations in operating systems such as DR-DOS, simply by changing the partition ID to one of the recognized types.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_DRDOS_Logical-Sectoring\" /> Also, if they no longer need to be recognized by their original operating systems, existing partitions can be \"converted\" into FAT12 and FAT16 volumes more compliant with versions of MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;4.0\u20136.3, which do not support sector sizes different from 512&nbsp;bytes,<ref name=\"Brouwer_2002_Logical_FAT\" /> by switching to a [[DOS 3.31 BPB|BPB with 32-bit entry]] for the number of sectors, as introduced since DOS&nbsp;3.31 (see [[#FAT16B|FAT16B]] below), keeping the cluster size and reducing the [[BPB logical sector size|logical sector size in the BPB]] down to 512&nbsp;bytes, while at the same time increasing the counts of logical sectors per cluster, reserved logical sectors, total logical sectors, and logical sectors per FAT by the same factor.\n\nA parallel development in MS-DOS / PC&nbsp;DOS which allowed an increase in the maximum possible FAT size was the introduction of multiple FAT partitions on a hard disk. To allow the use of more FAT partitions in a compatible way, a new partition type was introduced in PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;3.2 (1986), the ''[[Extended boot record|extended partition]]'' (EBR),<ref name=\"Duncan_1988_MS-DOS_Encyclopedia\" /> which is a container for an additional partition called ''logical drive''. Since PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;3.3 (April 1987), there is another, optional extended partition containing the next ''logical drive'', and so on. The [[Master Boot Record|MBR]] of a hard disk can either define up to four primary partitions, or an extended partition in addition to up to three primary partitions.\n\n{{See also|Extended boot record}}\n\n=== <span id=\"FAT16B\"></span><span id=\"FAT16X\"></span>Final FAT16 ===\n\n{{infobox file system\n| name                    = FAT16B\n| developer               = [[Compaq]], [[Digital Research]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Novell]]\n| full_name               = [[Design of the FAT file system#FAT16|16-bit File Allocation Table]]<br />(with 32-bit sector entries)\n| introduction_date       = 1987-11 ([[Compaq MS-DOS 3.31]])<br />1988-06-28 ([[DR DOS 3.31]])<br />1988 ([[IBM DOS 4.0]])<br />1988 ([[OS/2 1.1]])<br />1988 ([[MS-DOS 4.0 (IBM-developed)|MS-DOS 4.0]])\n| partition_id            = [[Master Boot Record|MBR]]/[[Extended Boot Record|EBR]]:<br />[[#FAT16B|FAT16B]]:&nbsp;<tt>{{abbr|0x|Values in C-notation for hexadecimal numbers}}[[Partition type#PID_06h|06]]</tt>&#x2009;<tt>[[Partition type#PID_0Eh|0x0E]]</tt>&#x2009;([[Logical block addressing|LBA]]),&#x2009;e.a.<br />[[Basic data partition|BDP]]:<br /><tt>EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7</tt>\n| min_volume_size         = 8&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]] (with 128&nbsp;byte sectors)<br />32&nbsp;MiB (with [[512e|512]]&nbsp;byte sectors)<br />256&nbsp;MiB (with [[4Kn|4&nbsp;KiB]] sectors)\n| max_volume_size         = 2&nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GiB]] (with 32&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] clusters)<br />4&nbsp;GiB (with 64&nbsp;KiB clusters) (NT&nbsp;4, PTS-DOS, EDR-DOS)<br />8&nbsp;GiB (with 128&nbsp;KiB clusters and <!-- 128 s/c -->1 or <!-- 64 s/c -->2&nbsp;KiB sectors) (NT&nbsp;4 and EDR-DOS only)<br />8&nbsp;GiB (with 128&nbsp;KiB clusters and <!-- 256 s/c -->512 byte sectors) (EDR-DOS only)<br />16&nbsp;GiB (with 256&nbsp;KiB clusters and <!-- 128 s/c -->2 or <!-- 64 s/c -->4&nbsp;KiB sectors) (NT&nbsp;4 only)\n| max_file_size           = 2,147,483,647 bytes (2&nbsp;GiB \u2013 1)<!-- 2^31 - 1 --> (without [[large file support|LFS]])<br />4,294,967,295 bytes (4&nbsp;GiB \u2013 1)<!-- 2^32 - 1 --> (with [[large file support|LFS]])<br />limited by volume size only (with FAT16+<ref name=\"DRDOS_FAT+_R2\" />)\n| file_size_granularity   = 1&nbsp;byte\n| max_files_no            = 65,460 for 32&nbsp;KiB clusters<!-- 2^16 - 12 (reserved clusters) - 64 (number of 32 KiB clusters for directory entries) -->\n| max_filename_size       = [[8.3 filename]] with [[OEM character set|OEM]] characters,<br />255 [[UCS-2]] characters<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_LFN_UNI\"/> when using [[Long filename|LFN]]\n| max_directory_depth     = 32&nbsp;levels or 66&nbsp;characters (with [[Current Directory Structure|CDS]]),<br />60&nbsp;levels or more (without CDS)\n| dates_recorded          = Modified date/time, creation date/time (DOS 7.0 and higher only), access date (only available with [[ACCDATE (CONFIG.SYS directive)|ACCDATE]] enabled),<ref name=\"Microsoft_2006_ACCDATE\" /> deletion date/time (only with DELWATCH 2<!-- with Novell DOS 7, Caldera OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher -->)\n| date_range              = [[Epoch of 1980-01-01|1980-01-01]] to [[Year 2100 problem|2099-12-31]] ([[Year 2108 problem|2107-12-31]])\n| date_resolution         = 2&nbsp;seconds for last modified time,<br />10&nbsp;ms for creation time,<br />1&nbsp;day for access date,<br />2&nbsp;seconds for deletion time\n| attributes              = [[FAT file attributes|Read-only]], [[FAT file attributes|Hidden]], [[FAT file attributes|System]], [[FAT file attributes|Volume]], [[FAT file attributes|Directory]], [[FAT file attributes|Archive]]\n| file_system_permissions = File, directory and volume access rights for [[FAT file access rights|Read]], [[FAT file access rights|Write]], [[FAT file access rights|Execute]], [[FAT file access rights|Delete]] only with [[DR-DOS]], [[PalmDOS]], [[Novell DOS]], [[OpenDOS]], [[FlexOS]], [[IBM 4680 OS|4680&nbsp;OS]], [[IBM 4690 OS|4690&nbsp;OS]], [[Concurrent DOS]], [[Multiuser DOS]], [[Datapac System Manager|System Manager]], [[REAL/32]] (Execute right only with FlexOS, 4680&nbsp;OS, 4690&nbsp;OS;

[[Microsoft]]'s <code>[[DSKPROBE]]</code> tool refers to type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_06h|0x06]]</tt> as ''BigFAT'',<ref name=\"Microsoft_2003_CC736327\" /> whereas some older versions of <code>[[FDISK]]</code> described it as ''BIGDOS''. Technically, it is known as '''FAT16B'''.\n\nSince older versions of DOS were not designed to cope with more than 65535&nbsp;sectors, it was necessary to introduce a new partition type for this format in order to hide it from pre-3.31 issues of DOS. The original form of FAT16 (with less than 65536 sectors) had a [[partition type]] <tt>[[Partition type#PID_04h|0x04]]</tt>. To deal with disks larger than this, type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_06h|0x06]]</tt> was introduced to indicate 65536 or more sectors. In addition to this, the disk driver was expanded to cope with more than 65535&nbsp;sectors as well. The only other difference between the original FAT16 and the newer FAT16B format is the usage of a [[DOS 3.31 BPB|newer BPB]] format with 32-bit sector entry. Therefore, newer operating systems supporting the FAT16B format can cope also with the original FAT16 format without any necessary changes.\n\nIf partitions to be used by pre-DOS&nbsp;3.31 issues of DOS need to be created by modern tools, the only criteria theoretically necessary to meet are a sector count of less than 65536, and the usage of the old partition ID (<tt>[[Partition type#PID_04h|0x04]]</tt>). In practice however, type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_01h|0x01]]</tt> and <tt>[[Partition type#PID_04h|0x04]]</tt> primary partitions should not be physically located outside the first 32&nbsp;MiB of the disk, due to other restrictions in MS-DOS&nbsp;2.x, which could not cope with them otherwise.\n\nIn 1988, the FAT16B improvement became more generally available through [[DR&nbsp;DOS]]&nbsp;3.31, PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;4.0, [[OS/2]]&nbsp;1.1, and MS-DOS&nbsp;4.0. The limit on partition size was dictated by the 8-bit [[Signedness|signed]] count of sectors per cluster, which originally had a maximum power-of-two value of 64. With the standard hard disk sector size of 512&nbsp;bytes, this gives a maximum of 32&nbsp;KiB cluster size, thereby fixing the \"definitive\" limit for the FAT16 partition size at 2&nbsp;GiB for sector size 512. On [[magneto-optical]] media, which can have 1 or 2&nbsp;KiB sectors instead of 0.5&nbsp;KiB, this size limit is proportionally larger.\n\nMuch later, [[Windows&nbsp;NT]] increased the maximum cluster size to 64&nbsp;KiB, by considering the sectors-per-cluster count as unsigned. However, the resulting format was not compatible with any other FAT implementation of the time, and it generated greater [[internal fragmentation]]. [[Windows 98]], SE and ME also supported reading and writing this variant, but its disk utilities did not work with it and some [[File control block|FCB]] services are not available for such volumes. This contributes to a confusing compatibility situation.\n\nPrior to 1995, versions of DOS accessed the disk via [[Cylinder-head-sector|CHS]] addressing only. When MS-DOS&nbsp;7.0&nbsp;/ [[Windows&nbsp;95]] introduced [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] disk access, partitions could start being physically located outside the first c. 8&nbsp;GiB<!-- exact value is somewhat smaller --> of this disk and thereby out of the reach of the traditional CHS addressing scheme. Partitions partially or fully located beyond the CHS barrier therefore had to be hidden from non-LBA-enabled operating systems by using the new partition type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_0Eh|0x0E]]</tt> in the partition table instead. FAT16 partitions using this partition type are also named '''FAT16X'''.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2004_KB120138\" /> The only difference, compared to previous FAT16 partitions, is the fact that some CHS-related geometry entries in the BPB record, namely the number of sectors per track and the number of heads, may contain no or misleading values and should not be used.\n\nThe number of root directory entries available for FAT12 and FAT16 is determined when the volume is formatted, and is stored in a 16-bit field. For a given number <code>RDE</code> and sector size <code>SS</code>, the number <code>RDS</code> of root directory sectors is <code>RDS=ceil((RDE\u00d732)/SS)</code>, and <code>RDE</code> is normally chosen to fill these sectors, i.e., <code>RDE*32=RDS*SS</code>. FAT12 and FAT16 media typically use 512 root directory entries on non-floppy media. Some third-party tools, like [[mkdosfs]], allow the user to set this parameter.<ref name=\"MKDOSFS\" />\n\n===[[FAT32]]===\n<!-- [[FAT32]] and [[FAT32X]] redirect here. -->\n\n{{Infobox file system\n| name                    = FAT32\n| full_name             Alicia\n\n[[Design of the FAT file system#FAT32|32-bit File Allocation Table]]<br />(with 28-bit cluster entries)\n| developer               = [[Microsoft]], [[Caldera UK|Caldera]]\n| variants = \n| introduction_date       = August 1996 ([[Windows 95 OSR2]])\n| partition_id            = [[Master Boot Record|MBR]]/[[Extended Boot Record|EBR]]:<br />[[#FAT32|FAT32]]:&nbsp;<tt>{{abbr|0x|Values in C-notation for hexadecimal numbers}}[[Partition type#PID_0Bh|0B]]</tt>&#x2009;<tt>[[Partition type#PID_0Ch|0x0C]]</tt>&#x2009;([[Logical block addressing|LBA]]),&#x2009;e.a.<br />[[Basic data partition|BDP]]:<br /><tt>EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7</tt>\n| directory_struct = \n| file_struct = \n| bad_blocks_struct = \n| min_volume_size         = 32&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]]-4.5&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] (with 65525 clusters and 512 byte sectors)<br />256&nbsp;MiB-36&nbsp;KiB (with 65525 clusters and 4&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] sectors)\n| max_volume_size         = 2&nbsp;[[Tebibyte|TiB]] (with 512&nbsp;byte sectors)<br />8&nbsp;TiB (with 2&nbsp;KiB sectors and 32&nbsp;KiB clusters)<br />16&nbsp;TiB (with 4&nbsp;KiB sectors and 64&nbsp;KiB clusters)\n| max_file_size           = 2,147,483,647 bytes (2&nbsp;GiB \u2013 1)<!-- 2^31 - 1 --> (without [[large file support|LFS]])<br />4,294,967,295 bytes (4&nbsp;GiB \u2013 1)<!-- 2^32 - 1 --><ref name=\"GB4\" /> (with [[large file support|LFS]])<br />274,877,906,943 bytes (256&nbsp;GiB \u2013 1)<!-- 2^38 -1 --> (only with FAT32+<ref name=\"DRDOS_FAT+_R2\" />)\n| max_files_no            = 268,173,300 for 32&nbsp;KiB clusters<!-- 2^28 - 12 (reserved clusters) - 262144 (number of 32&nbsp;KiB clusters for directory entries) -->\n| max_filename_size       = [[8.3 filename]] with [[OEM character set|OEM]] characters,<br />255 [[UCS-2]] characters<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_LFN_UNI\"/> when using [[Long filename|LFN]]\n| max_directory_depth     = 32&nbsp;levels or 66&nbsp;characters (with [[Current Directory Structure|CDS]]),<br />60&nbsp;levels or more (without CDS)\n| dates_recorded          = Modified date/time, creation date/time (DOS&nbsp;7.0 and higher only), access date (only available with [[ACCDATE (CONFIG.SYS directive)|ACCDATE]] enabled),<ref name=\"Microsoft_2006_ACCDATE\" /> deletion date/time (only with DELWATCH 2<!-- with Novell DOS 7, Caldera OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher -->)\n| date_range              = [[Epoch of 1980-01-01|1980-01-01]] to [[Year 2100 problem|2099-12-31]] ([[Year 2108 problem|2107-12-31]])\n| date_resolution         = 2&nbsp;seconds for last modified time,<br />10&nbsp;ms for creation time,<br />1&nbsp;day for access date,<br />2&nbsp;seconds for deletion time\n| forks_streams = \n| attributes              = [[FAT file attributes|Read-only]], [[FAT file attributes|Hidden]], [[FAT file attributes|System]], [[FAT file attributes|Volume]], [[FAT file attributes|Directory]], [[FAT file attributes|Archive]]\n| file_system_permissions = Partial, only with [[DR-DOS]], [[REAL/32]] and [[4690 OS]]\n| compression             = No\n| encryption              = No\n| data_deduplication = \n| OS = \n| file_size_granularity   = 1&nbsp;byte\n}}\n\nIn order to overcome the volume size limit of FAT16, while at the same time allowing DOS [[Real mode|real-mode]] code to handle the format, Microsoft designed a new version of the file system, '''FAT32''', which supported an increased number of possible clusters, but could reuse most of the existing code, so that the [[conventional memory]] footprint was increased by less than 5 KiB under DOS.<ref name=\"Microsoft_1998_CC768180\" /> Cluster values are represented by [[32-bit]] numbers, of which 28 bits are used to hold the cluster number.\n\n==== Maximum sizes ====\nThe FAT32 boot sector uses a 32-bit field for the sector count, limiting the maximum FAT32 volume size to 2 [[tebibyte]]s (approximately 2.2 [[terabyte]]s) with a sector size of 512 [[byte]]s. The maximum FAT32 volume size is 16 TiB (approximately 17.6 TB) with a sector size of 4,096 bytes.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2007_KB184006\" /><ref name=\"Microsoft_2007_KB314463\" /> Windows operating systems through [[Windows 10]] only create new FAT32 volumes up to 32 GB in size, however.\n\nThe maximum possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 [[GiB]] minus 1 byte or 4,294,967,295 (2<sup>32</sup> \u2212 1) bytes. This limit is a consequence of the file length entry in the directory table and would also affect huge FAT16 partitions with a sufficient sector size.<ref name=\"GB4\" /> FAT32 does not include direct built-in support for long filenames, but FAT32 volumes can optionally hold [[#VFAT|VFAT]] long filenames in addition to short filenames in exactly the same way as VFAT long filenames have been optionally implemented for FAT12 and FAT16 volumes.\n\n==== Development ====\nFAT32 was introduced with MS-DOS 7.1 / Windows 95 OSR2 in 1996, although reformatting was needed to use it, and [[DriveSpace 3]] (the version that came with Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98<!-- what about ME? -->) never supported it. Windows 98 introduced a utility to convert existing hard disks from FAT16 to FAT32 without loss of data.\n\nIn the Windows NT line, native support for FAT32 arrived in [[Windows 2000]]. A free FAT32 driver for [[Windows NT 4.0]] was available from [[Winternals]], a company later acquired by Microsoft. The acquisition of the driver from official sources is no longer possible. Since 1998, Caldera's dynamically loadable [[DRFAT32]] driver could be used to enable FAT32 support in DR-DOS.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_DRFAT32-RM\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_DRFAT32\"/> The first version of DR-DOS to natively support FAT32 and LBA access was OEM DR-DOS 7.04 in 1999. That same year [[Intelligent Micro Software|IMS]] introduced native FAT32 support with [[REAL/32]] 7.90, and [[IBM 4690 OS]] added FAT32 support with version 2.<ref name=\"IBM_4690_User_Guide\" /> [[Ahead Software]] provided another dynamically loadable FAT32.EXE driver for DR-DOS 7.03 with [[Nero Burning ROM]] in 2004.<!-- with copyrights 2002-2004 --> IBM PC DOS introduced native FAT32 support with OEM PC DOS 7.10 in 2003.\n\nTwo partition types have been reserved for FAT32 partitions, <tt>[[Partition type#PID 0Bh|0x0B]]</tt> and <tt>[[Partition type#PID 0Ch|0x0C]]</tt>.

It stores EAs on FAT12, FAT16 and HPFS using exactly the same scheme as OS/2, but does not support any other kind of [[Alternate Data Streams|ADS]] as held on NTFS volumes. Trying to copy a file with any ADS other than EAs from an NTFS volume to a FAT or HPFS volume gives a warning message with the names of the ADSs that will be lost. It does not support the FAT32.IFS method to store EAs on FAT32 volumes.\n\n[[Windows 2000]] onward acts exactly as Windows NT, except that it ignores EAs when copying to FAT32 without any warning (but shows the warning for other ADSs, like \"Macintosh Finder Info\" and \"Macintosh Resource Fork\").\n\n[[Cygwin]] uses \"<code>EA&#x2420;DATA.&#x2420;SF</code>\" files as well.\n\n=== <span id=\"LFN\"></span><span id=\"VFAT\"></span><span id=\"UVFAT\"></span>Long file names ===\n<!-- use LFN anchor for generic FAT long filename solutions and VFAT for Microsoft's VFAT -->\n\nOne of the [[user experience]] goals for the designers of [[Windows 95]] was the ability to use [[long filename]]s (LFNs\u2014up to 255 [[UTF-16]] [[code unit]]s long),<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_LFN_UNI\"/> in addition to classic [[8.3 filename]]s (SFNs). For [[backward compatibility|backward]] and [[forward compatibility]] LFN were implemented as an optional extension on top of the existing FAT file system structures using a [[workaround]] in the way directory entries are laid out.\n\nThis transparent method to store long file names in the existing FAT file systems without altering their data structures is usually known as '''[[VFAT long filename|VFAT]]''' (for \"Virtual FAT\") after the Windows 95 [[VxD|virtual device driver]].<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_VFAT_Name\" />\n\nNon VFAT-enabled operating systems can still access the files under their short file name alias without restrictions; however, the associated long file names may be lost when files with long filenames are copied under non VFAT-aware operating systems.\n\nIn Windows&nbsp;NT, support for VFAT long filenames began with version [[Windows NT 3.5|3.5]].\n\nGNU/Linux provides a VFAT filesystem driver to work with FAT volumes with VFAT long filenames. For some while, a [[UVFAT]] driver was available to provide combined support for [[#UMSDOS|UMSDOS]]-style permissions with VFAT long filenames.\n\n[[OS/2]] added long filename support to FAT using [[FAT extended file attributes|extended attributes]] (EA) before the introduction of VFAT. Thus, VFAT long filenames are invisible to OS/2, and EA long filenames are invisible to Windows; therefore experienced users of both operating systems would have to manually rename the files.\n\n[[Human68K]] supported up to [[18.3 filename]]s and ([[Shift JIS]]) [[Kanji]] characters in a proprietary FAT file system variant.\n\nIn order to support [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applications, the [[FlexOS]]-based [[IBM 4690 OS]] version 2 introduced its own [[virtual file system]] (VFS) architecture to store long filenames in the FAT file system in a backwards-compatible fashion. If enabled, the virtual filenames (VFN) are available under separate logical drive letters, whereas the real filenames (RFN) remain available under the original drive letters.<ref name=\"IBM_4690_Programming_Guide\" />\n\n=== <span id=\"ADS\"></span>Forks and Alternate Data Streams ===\n\nThe FAT file system itself is not designed for supporting [[Alternate Data Streams]] ([[Fork (file system)|ADS]]), but some operating systems that heavily depend on them have devised various methods for handling them on FAT volumes. Such methods either store the additional information in extra files and directories ([[classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]]), or give new semantics to previously unused fields of the FAT on-disk data structures ([[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]).\n\nMac&nbsp;OS using [[PC Exchange]] stores its various dates, file attributes and long filenames in a [[hidden file]] called \"<code>FINDER.DAT</code>\", and [[resource fork]]s (a common Mac&nbsp;OS ADS) in a subdirectory called \"<code>RESOURCE.FRK</code>\", in every directory where they are used. From PC&nbsp;Exchange&nbsp;2.1 onwards, they store the Mac&nbsp;OS long filenames as standard FAT long filenames and convert FAT filenames longer than 31 characters to unique 31-character filenames, which can then be made visible to Macintosh applications.\n\n[[macOS]] stores [[resource fork]]s and metadata (file attributes, other ADS) using [[AppleDouble format]] in a hidden file with a name constructed from the owner filename prefixed with \"<code>._</code>\", and [[Finder (software)|Finder]] stores some folder and file metadata in a hidden file called \"<code>[[.DS_Store]]</code>\" (but note that Finder uses <code>.DS_Store</code> even on macOS' native filesystem, [[HFS+]]).\n\n=== <span id=\"UMSDOS\"></span>UMSDOS permissions and filenames ===\n{{further|FAT filesystem and Linux}}\n\nEarly GNU/Linux distributions also supported a format known as [[UMSDOS]], a FAT variant with Unix file attributes (such as long file name and access permissions) stored in a separate file called \"<code>--linux-.---</code>\". UMSDOS fell into disuse after [[#VFAT|VFAT]] was released and it is not enabled by default in [[Linux]] from version 2.5.7 onwards.<ref name=\"Linux_ChangeLog257\" /> For some time, Linux also provided combined support for UMSDOS-style permissions and VFAT long filenames through [[UVFAT]].\n\n=== <span id=\"FAT16+\"></span><span id=\"FAT32+\"></span><span id=\"FAT32B\"></span>FAT+ ===\nIn 2007 the open '''FAT+''' draft proposed how to store [[Large file support|larger files]] up to 256&nbsp;GiB minus 1&nbsp;byte or 274,877,906,943 (2<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) bytes on slightly modified and otherwise backward-compatible FAT32 volumes,<ref name=\"DRDOS_FAT+_R2\" /> but imposes a risk that disk tools or FAT32 implementations not aware of this extension may truncate or delete files exceeding the normal FAT32 file size limit. Support for '''FAT32+''' and '''FAT16+''' is limited to some versions of [[DR-DOS]] and not available in mainstream operating systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdosprojects.de/ |title=DR-DOS/OpenDOS Enhancement Project | author=Udo Kuhnt| date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=2015-04-20}}</ref> (This extension is critically incompatible with the <code>/EAS</code> option of the FAT32.IFS method to store [[FAT extended file attributes|OS/2 extended attributes]] on FAT32 volumes.)\n\n== Derivatives ==\n\n=== Turbo FAT ===\n{{Main|Turbo FAT}}\n\nIn its [[NetWare File System]] ([[NWFS]]) [[Novell]] implemented a heavily modified variant of a FAT file system for the [[NetWare]] operating system.

The header \"FATX\" is used in redirects to this page. -->\n<!-- {{Main|FATX}} should be created instead of further expanding this FATX section -->\n\nFATX is a family of file systems designed for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game console]] [[hard disk]] drives and [[memory card]]s,<ref name=\"Xbox_FATX-Spec\" /><ref name=\"Xbox_Linux\" /> introduced in 2001.\n\nWhile resembling the same basic design ideas as [[#FAT16|FAT16]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]], the '''FATX16''' and '''FATX32''' on-disk structures are simplified, but fundamentally incompatible with normal FAT16 and FAT32 file systems, making it impossible for normal FAT file system drivers to mount such volumes.\n\nThe non-bootable [[superblock (file systems)|superblock]] sector is 4&nbsp;KiB in size and holds an 18&nbsp;byte large BPB-like structure completely different from normal [[FAT BPB|BPB]]s. Clusters are typically 16&nbsp;KiB in size and there is only one copy of the FAT on the Xbox. Directory entries are 64&nbsp;bytes in size instead of the normal [[FAT directory entry|32&nbsp;bytes]]. Files can have filenames up to 42 characters long using the [[OEM character set]]<!-- not Unicode --> and be up to 4&nbsp;GiB minus 1&nbsp;byte in size. The on-disk timestamps hold creation, modification and access dates and times but differ from FAT: in FAT, the [[Epoch (computing)|epoch]] is [[Epoch of 1980-01-01|1980]]; in FATX, the epoch is [[Epoch of 2000-01-01|2000]]. On the [[Xbox 360]], the epoch is 1980.<ref name=\"Xbox360_FATX\" />\n\n=== exFAT ===\n{{Main|exFAT}}\n\nexFAT is a file system introduced with [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]] in November 2006 and brought to the Windows&nbsp;NT family with [[Windows Vista Service Pack 1|Vista Service Pack 1]] and [[Windows XP Service Pack 3]] (and/or separate installation of Windows XP Update KB955704). It is loosely based on the File Allocation Table architecture, but incompatible, proprietary and protected by patents.<ref name=\"Microsoft_exFAT-License\" />\n\nexFAT is intended for use on [[flash drive]]s (such as [[SDXC]] and [[Memory Stick XC]]), where FAT32 is otherwise used. Microsoft's [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]] and command-line format utilities offer it as an alternative to [[NTFS]] (and, for smaller partitions, to [[#FAT16B|FAT16B]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]]). The [[Master Boot Record|MBR]] [[partition type]] is <tt>[[Partition type#PID_07h|0x07]]</tt> (the same as used for [[Installable File System|IFS]], [[High Performance File System|HPFS]], and NTFS). Logical geometry information located in the [[Volume Boot Record|VBR]] is stored in a format not resembling any kind of BPB.\n\nOn August 28, 2019, Microsoft announced that it will be making the technical specification for exFAT publicly available so that it can be used in the Linux kernel and other operating systems.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = exFAT in the Linux kernel?

The FAT file system is a continuing standard which borrows source code from the original, [[legacy system|legacy]] file system and proves to be simple and robust.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2010_FAT\" /> It offers useful performance even in lightweight implementations, but cannot deliver the same performance, reliability and scalability as some modern file systems. It is, however, supported for compatibility reasons by nearly all currently developed [[operating system]]s for personal computers and many [[mobile device]]s and [[embedded system]]s, and thus is a well-suited format for data exchange between computers and devices of almost any type and age from 1981<!-- 86-DOS 0.42+ and MS-DOS/PC DOS 1.xx --> up to the present.\n \nOriginally designed in 1977 for use on [[floppy disk]]s, FAT was soon adapted and used almost universally on [[hard disk drive|hard disks]] throughout the [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] eras for two decades.<ref>{{Cite web|title = A brief introduction to FAT (File Allocation Table) formats |url = http://www.wizcode.com/articles/comments/a-brief-introduction-to-fat-file-allocation-table/|website = www.wizcode.com|accessdate = 2015-09-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150925082826/http://www.wizcode.com/articles/comments/a-brief-introduction-to-fat-file-allocation-table/|archive-date = September 25, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> As disk drives evolved, the capabilities of the file system have been extended accordingly, resulting in three major file system variants: [[#FAT12|FAT12]], [[#FAT16|FAT16]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]]. The FAT standard has also been expanded in other ways while generally preserving backward compatibility with existing software.\n\nWith the introduction of more powerful computers and operating systems, as well as the development of more complex file systems for them, FAT is no longer the default file system for usage on [[Microsoft Windows]] computers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/comparing-ntfs-and-fat-file-systems |title=Comparing NTFS and FAT file systems |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}</ref>\n\nFAT file systems are still commonly found on floppy disks, [[flash memory|flash]] and other [[Solid-state storage|solid-state]] [[memory card]]s and modules (including [[USB flash drive]]s), as well as many portable and embedded devices.

All previous embedded anchors continue to exist in the new article}}\n\nThe name of the file system originates from the file system's prominent usage of an index table, the ''[[Design of the FAT file system#FAT|File Allocation Table]]'' (''FAT''), statically allocated at the time of formatting. The table contains entries for each ''[[cluster (file system)|cluster]]'', a contiguous area of disk storage. Each entry contains either the number of the next cluster in the file, or else a marker indicating the end of the file, unused disk space, or special reserved areas of the disk. The ''root directory'' of the disk contains the number of the first cluster of each file in that directory; the operating system can then traverse the FAT, looking up the cluster number of each successive part of the disk file as a ''cluster chain'' until the end of the file is reached. In much the same way, ''sub-directories'' are implemented as special files containing the ''directory entries'' of their respective files.\n\nOriginally designed as an 8-bit file system, the maximum number of clusters has been significantly increased as disk drives have evolved, and so the number of bits used to identify each cluster has grown. The successive major variants of the FAT format are named after the number of table element bits: 12 ([[#FAT12|FAT12]]), 16 ([[#FAT16|FAT16]]), and 32 ([[#FAT32|FAT32]]). Except for the original [[#FAT8|8-bit FAT]] precursor, each of these variants is still{{when|date=August 2016}} in use. The FAT standard has also been expanded in other ways while generally preserving backward compatibility with existing software.\n\n=== <span id=\"ECMA\"></span><span id=\"ISO\"></span>Uses ===\n\nThe FAT file system has a [[#Historical evolution|long history]] (over three decades) of usage on desktops and portable computers, and it is frequently used in embedded solutions.\n\nFAT offers reasonably good performance and robustness, even in very light-weight implementations.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2010_FAT\" /> It is therefore widely adopted and supported by virtually all existing [[operating system]]s for personal computers as well as some [[home computers]] and a multitude of [[embedded systems]]. This also makes it a useful format for [[solid-state drive|solid-state]] [[memory card]]s and a convenient way to share data between [[operating system]]s.\n\nFAT file systems are the default file system for removable media (with the exception of CDs and DVDs) and as such are commonly found on [[floppy disk]]s, [[superfloppy|super-floppies]], [[memory card|memory]] and [[flash memory]] cards or [[USB flash drives]] and are supported by most portable devices such as [[PDA]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, [[Portable media player|media player]]s, or mobile phones. While [[#FAT12|FAT12]] is omnipresent on floppy disks, [[#FAT16|FAT16]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]] are typically found on the larger media.\n\nFAT was also commonly used on [[hard disk drive|hard disks]] throughout the [[DOS]] and [[Windows 9x]] eras, but its use on hard drives has declined since the introduction of [[Windows XP]], which primarily uses the newer [[NTFS]]. FAT is still used in hard drives expected to be used by multiple operating systems, such as in shared Windows, [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] and DOS environments.\n\nDue to the widespread use of FAT-formatted media, many operating systems provide support for FAT through official or third-party file system handlers. For example, [[OS/2]], [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]] and [[BeOS]] provide built-in support for FAT, even though they also support more sophisticated file systems such as [[ext4]] or [[btrfs]]. [[Mac OS 9]] and [[macOS]] support FAT file systems on volumes other than the [[boot disk]]. [[AmigaOS]] supports FAT through the [[CrossDOS]] package.\n\nFor many purposes, the NTFS file system is superior to FAT in terms of features and reliability; its main drawbacks are its complexity and the size overhead for small volumes as well as the very limited support by anything other than the NT-based versions of Windows, since the exact specification is a [[trade secret]] of Microsoft. The availability of [[NTFS-3G]] since mid-2006 has led to much improved NTFS support in [[Unix-like]] operating systems, considerably alleviating this concern. It is still not possible to use NTFS in DOS-like operating systems without third-party drivers, which in turn makes it difficult to use a DOS floppy for recovery purposes. Microsoft provided a [[Recovery Console]] to work around this issue, but for security reasons it severely limited what could be done through the Recovery Console by default. The movement of recovery utilities to boot CDs based on [[BartPE]], Linux (with NTFS-3G), or [[WinPE]] is eroding this drawback, but the complexity of NTFS prevents its implementation in light-weight operating systems or most embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Design rule for Camera File system|DCF]] file system adopted by almost all [[digital camera]]s since 1998 defines a logical file system with [[8.3 filename]]s and makes the use of either FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 or exFAT mandatory for its physical layer in order to maximize platform interoperability.<ref name=\"DC-009-2010\" />\n\nFAT is also used internally for the [[EFI system partition]] (partition type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_EFh|0xEF]]</tt>) in the boot stage of [[Extensible Firmware Interface|EFI]]-compliant computers.<ref name=\"efi\" />\n\nHidden FAT filesystems are also used in the [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface|UEFI]] boot partition on modern PC's where the UEFI specification requires compliant firmware to be capable of reading FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 compliant partitions.\n\nFor floppy disks, FAT has been standardized as [[Ecma International|ECMA]]-107<ref name=\"Ecma-107\" /> and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]&nbsp;9293:1994<ref name=\"ISO_9293_1994\" /> (superseding ISO&nbsp;9293:1987<ref name=\"ISO_9293_1987\" />). These standards cover FAT12 and FAT16 with only short [[8.3 filename]] support; [[long filename]]s with [[#VFAT|VFAT]] are partially [[#Patents|patent]]ed.<ref name=\"Patent_5758352\" />\n\n=== Nomenclature ===\n\nTechnically, the term \"FAT file system\" refers to all three major variants of the file system, [[#FAT12|FAT12]], [[#FAT16|FAT16]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]], and most parties clearly distinguish between them where necessary.\nIn contrast to this, Microsoft typically no longer distinguishes between all three of them since the introduction of FAT32, and refers to both FAT12 and FAT16 as \"FAT\", whereas \"FAT32\" gets treated specially in dialog boxes and documentation. This can sometimes lead to confusion if the actual type of the file system used is not mentioned or cannot be explicitly specified (e.g., \"Do you want to format as FAT or FAT32?\" instead of \"Do you want to format as FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32?\").\n\nAnother common cause of confusion exists within the group of FAT16 file systems, since the term \"[[#FAT16|FAT16]]\" refers to both, either the whole group of FAT file systems with 16-bit wide cluster entries, or specifically only the original implementation of it with [[DOS 2.0 BPB|16-bit sector entries]], when it becomes necessary to differentiate between the original and the later implementation. While technically the newer variant with [[DOS 3.31 BPB|32-bit sector entries]] is called \"[[#FAT16B|FAT16B]]\", it is commonly referred to under the name \"FAT16\" as well, in particular since the original variant is rarely seen today and typically only used on small media when [[backward compatibility]] with DOS before 3.31 is required.\n\nFurther, the term \"[[#VFAT|VFAT]]\" has led to various misconceptions as well,<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_VFAT_Name\" /> as it is sometimes erroneously used as if it would describe another variant of FAT file system to be distinguished from the FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 file systems, while in reality it does not specify another file system, but an optional extension, which can work on top of any FAT file system, FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32. Volumes utilizing VFAT long-filenames can be read also by operating systems not supporting the VFAT extension, as long as any operating systems that support the underlying file system (FAT12, FAT16, or FAT32).\n\nYet another cause for misconceptions stems from some apparent redundancy and possible ambiguity in the definition of FAT volumes.\nThe general type of file system (FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32) is determined by the width of the cluster entries in the FAT. Specific threshold values for the amount of clusters<ref name=\"efi\" /> (as stored<!-- meant both ways --> in the BPB) have been defined to determine which FAT type is used<!-- meant both ways: during creation and during detection -->. Even though other properties such as the size of the volume, the count of sectors, the [[FAT BPB|BPB]] format, the [[EBPB file system name|file system name]] in an EBPB, or -in case of partitioned media- the used [[partition ID]] may often seem to be well-suited distinguishing criteria as well, they cannot reliably be used to derive the file system type from in all scenarios.<ref name=\"efi\" />\nWhilst uncommon, it is technically possible to define a FAT12 or FAT16 volume using a \"[[FAT32 EBPB]]\" (which is sort of a misnomer for the EBPB variant introduced with [[DOS 7.1 EBPB|DOS 7.1]]), which is normally used for FAT32 volumes, only.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Hybrid_Disk\" />\nAlso, while partition IDs sometimes indicate special properties such as hidden, secure, [[Cylinder-head-sector|CHS]] or [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] access to an operating system, and as such are often used in conjunction with particular file system variants only, they are typically not used to specify a type of file system by themselves, but rather to keep (older or foreign) operating systems not aware of a partition ID from accessing partitions they cannot handle or should not work with.<ref name=\"Chappell_1994_DOS-Internals\" /> It is therefore necessary to distinguish generic ''FAT file system types'' such as FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32 from ''FAT partition types'' such as FAT12, FAT16, [[#FAT16B|FAT16B]], [[#FAT16X|FAT16X]], FAT32, [[#FAT32X|FAT32X]], etc.\n\n== <span id=\"Types\"></span><span id=\"Historical evolution\"></span><span id=\"File system evolution\"></span><span id=\"File system types\"></span>Types ==\n{{See also|Timeline of DOS operating systems}}\n\n=== <span id=\"FAT8\"></span><span id=\"FAT10\"></span>Original 8-bit FAT ===\n<!-- NB. \"FAT8\" and \"FAT10\" are used as handy invisible anchors, but they never were the official names for these FAT variants, and therefore must not be used in the visible text. -->\n\n{{infobox file system\n| name = 8-bit FAT\n| full_name = 8-bit File Allocation Table\n| developer = [[Microsoft]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Seattle Computer Products|SCP]]\n| variants = \n| introduction_date = 1977/1978<!-- date for the ''FAT-enabled'' version of NCR Basic Plus 6 not narrowed down yet -->: [[NCR Basic +6]] for NCR<br />1978: [[Standalone Disk BASIC-80]] (16-byte directory entries)<ref name=\"Microsoft_1979_BASIC80-50\" /><ref name=\"Microsoft_1979_BASIC80-51\" /><br />(1978: [[Standalone Disk BASIC-86]] internal only)<br />1979-06-04: [[Standalone Disk BASIC-86]] for SCP (16-byte directory entries)<br />1979: [[MIDAS (operating system)|MIDAS]] (32-byte directory entries)\n| partition_id = \n| directory_struct = \n| file_struct = \n| bad_blocks_struct = \n| max_volume_size = <!-- TBD -->\n| max_file_size = 8 MB\n| max_files_no = <!-- TBD -->\n| max_filename_size = [[6.3 filename]]<!-- displayed with decimal dot as \"123456.789\" --> (binary files), 9&nbsp;characters<!-- displayed with space as \"123456 789\" --> (ASCII files)<ref name=\"Microsoft_1979_BASIC80-50\" /><ref name=\"Microsoft_1979_BASIC80-51\" />\n| max_directory_depth = no sub-directories\n| dates_recorded = No\n| forks_streams = \n| attributes = Write protected, [[EBCDIC]] conversion, Read after write, Binary (random rather than sequential file)<ref name=\"Microsoft_1979_BASIC80-50\" /><ref name=\"Microsoft_1979_BASIC80-51\" />\n| file_system_permissions = \n| compression = \n| encryption = \n| data_deduplication = \n| OS = \n| filename_character_set = [[ASCII]] (<tt>0x00</tt> and <tt>0xFF</tt> not allowed in first character)<ref name=\"Microsoft_1979_BASIC80-50\" /><ref name=\"Microsoft_1979_BASIC80-51\" /> <!-- In reality, character set is most probably more limited due to BASIC language restrictions. -->\n| file_size_granularity = record-granularity (128&nbsp;bytes<!-- 256 bytes for mini-disks?

(While MS-DOS and PC DOS support up to 4084 data clusters on FAT12 volumes in general, cluster value <tt>0xFF0</tt><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_MAGIC_FF0\" /> is treated as additional end-of-chain marker on any FAT12 volume<ref name=\"Chappell_1994_DOS-Internals\" /> since [[MS-DOS 3.3|MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS 3.3]], which also introduced the <tt>0xF0</tt> [[BPB media descriptor|media descriptor]] value, therefore restricting the maximum practical number of data clusters to 4078 for compatibility purposes with these operating systems.)\n\nThe disk's size was stored and calculated as a 16-bit count of [[Cylinder-head-sector|sectors]], which limited the size to 32&nbsp;MiB for a logical sector size of 512&nbsp;bytes. FAT12 was used by several manufacturers with different physical formats, but a typical floppy disk at the time was 5.25-inch (130&nbsp;mm), single-sided, 40&nbsp;[[Cylinder-head-sector|tracks]], with 8&nbsp;sectors per track, resulting in a capacity of 160&nbsp;KiB for both the system areas and files. The FAT12 limitations exceeded this capacity by a factor of ten or more. (NB. The 32&nbsp;MiB limit was later circumvented using [[#Logical sectored FAT|logical sectored FAT]]s with logical sector sizes larger than 512&nbsp;bytes in some OEM versions of MS-DOS&nbsp;3.x, but this fell into disuse when [[#FAT16B|FAT16B]] became available with DOS&nbsp;3.31, which supported [[32-bit]] sector numbers and thereby further lifted the limits.)\n\nBy convention, all the control structures were organized to fit inside the first track, thus avoiding head movement during read and write operations, although this varied depending on the manufacturer and physical format of the disk. A limitation that was not addressed until much later (with [[#FAT32|FAT32]]) was that any bad sector in the control structures area, track&nbsp;0, could prevent the disk from being usable. The DOS formatting tool rejected such disks completely. Bad sectors were allowed only in the file data area and (since DOS&nbsp;2.0) were marked with the reserved value <tt>0xFF7</tt> in the FAT. They made the entire containing cluster unusable.\n\nWhile 86-DOS supported three disk formats (250.25&nbsp;KiB, 616&nbsp;KiB and 1232&nbsp;KiB with [[FAT ID]]s <tt>0xFF</tt> and <tt>0xFE</tt><!-- it's not clear if QDOS/86-DOS already used the FAT ID byte, or if this was added with MS-DOS/PC DOS 1.x.

Details to be sorted out. -->) on 8-inch (200&nbsp;mm) floppy drives, IBM [[PC&nbsp;DOS 1.0]], released with the original [[IBM Personal Computer]] in 1981, supported only an 8-sector floppy format with a formatted capacity of 160&nbsp;KiB (FAT ID <tt>0xFE</tt>) for single-sided 5.25-inch floppy drives, and [[PC&nbsp;DOS 1.1]] added support for a [[double-sided disk|double-sided]] format with 320&nbsp;KiB (FAT ID <tt>0xFF</tt>). [[PC DOS 2.0]] introduced support for 9-sector floppy formats with 180&nbsp;KiB (FAT ID <tt>0xFC</tt>) and 360&nbsp;KiB (FAT ID <tt>0xFD</tt>).\n\n86-DOS&nbsp;1.00 and PC&nbsp;DOS 1.0 directory entries included only one date, the last modified date. PC&nbsp;DOS 1.1 added the last modified time. PC&nbsp;DOS 1.x [[file attribute]]s included a hidden bit and system bit, with the remaining six bits undefined. At this time, DOS did not support a hierarchical file system, which was still acceptable, given that the number of files on a disk was typically not more than a few dozen.\n\nThe [[PC XT]] was the first PC with a hard drive from IBM, and PC&nbsp;DOS 2.0 supported that hard drive with FAT12 ([[FAT ID]] <tt>0xF8</tt>). The fixed assumption of 8&nbsp;sectors per clusters on hard disks practically limited the maximum partition size to 16&nbsp;MiB for 512&nbsp;byte sectors and 4&nbsp;KiB clusters.\n\nThe ''[[BIOS Parameter Block]]'' (''BPB'') was introduced with PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;2.0 as well, and this version also added read-only, [[archive bit|archive]], [[volume (computing)|volume label]], and [[Directory (file systems)|directory]] attribute bits for hierarchical sub-directories.<ref name=\"two\" />\n\n[[MS-DOS 3.0]] introduced support for high-density 1.2&nbsp;MiB 5.25-inch diskettes (media descriptor <tt>0xF9</tt>), which notably had 15&nbsp;sectors per track, hence more space for the FATs.\n\nFAT12 remains in use on all common [[floppy disks]], including 1.44&nbsp;MiB and later 2.88&nbsp;MiB disks (media descriptor byte <tt>0xF0</tt>).\n\n=== <span id=\"FAT16\"></span>Initial FAT16 ===\n\n{{infobox file system\n| name                    = FAT16.\n| developer               = [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], [[Digital Research]], [[Novell]]\n| full_name               = [[Design of the FAT file system#FAT16|16-bit File Allocation Table]]<br />(with 16-bit sector entries)\n| introduction_date       = 1984-08-14 (PC DOS 3.0)<br />1984-08 (MS-DOS 3.0)\n| partition_id            = [[Master Boot Record|MBR]]/[[Extended Boot Record|EBR]]:<br />[[#FAT16|FAT16]]:&nbsp;<tt>{{abbr|0x|Values in C-notation for hexadecimal numbers}}[[Partition type#PID_04h|04]]</tt> e.a.<br />[[Basic data partition|BDP]]: <tt>EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7</tt>\n<!-- needs more refinement as this is version dependent:\n| max_volume_size         = 16&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]] (with 2&nbsp;KiB clusters) --><!-- larger volumes should use logical sectored FAT partition IDs or FAT16B partition ID -->\n| max_file_size           = limited by volume size\n| file_size_granularity   = 1&nbsp;byte\n| max_files_no            = 65,536 for 32&nbsp;KiB clusters<!-- 2^16 - 12 (reserved clusters) - 64 (number of 32 KiB clusters for directory entries) -->\n| max_filename_size       = [[8.3 filename]] with [[OEM character set|OEM]] characters,<br />255 [[UCS-2]] characters<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_LFN_UNI\"/> when using [[Long filename|LFN]]\n| max_directory_depth     = 32&nbsp;levels or 66&nbsp;characters (with [[Current Directory Structure|CDS]]),<br />60&nbsp;levels or more (without CDS)\n| dates_recorded          = Modified date/time, creation date/time (DOS 7.0 and higher only), access date (only available with [[ACCDATE (CONFIG.SYS directive)|ACCDATE]] enabled),<ref name=\"Microsoft_2006_ACCDATE\" /> deletion date/time (only with DELWATCH 2<!-- with Novell DOS 7, Caldera OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher -->)\n| date_range              = [[Epoch of 1980-01-01|1980-01-01]] to [[Year 2100 problem|2099-12-31]] ([[Year 2108 problem|2107-12-31]])\n| date_resolution         = 2&nbsp;seconds for last modified time,<br />10&nbsp;ms for creation time,<br />1&nbsp;day for access date,<br />2&nbsp;seconds for deletion time\n| attributes              = [[FAT file attributes|Read-only]], [[FAT file attributes|Hidden]], [[FAT file attributes|System]], [[FAT file attributes|Volume]], [[FAT file attributes|Directory]], [[FAT file attributes|Archive]]\n| file_system_permissions = File, directory and volume access rights for [[FAT file access rights|Read]], [[FAT file access rights|Write]], [[FAT file access rights|Execute]], [[FAT file access rights|Delete]] only with [[DR-DOS]], [[PalmDOS]], [[Novell DOS]], [[OpenDOS]], [[FlexOS]], [[IBM 4680 OS|4680&nbsp;OS]], [[IBM 4690 OS|4690&nbsp;OS]], [[Concurrent DOS]], [[Multiuser DOS]], [[Datapac System Manager|System Manager]], [[REAL/32]] (Execute right only with FlexOS, 4680&nbsp;OS, 4690&nbsp;OS; individual file / directory passwords not with FlexOS, 4680&nbsp;OS, 4690&nbsp;OS<!-- at least I could not find any user or programmer's documentation for it so far -->; [[FAT file access rights|World]]/[[FAT file access rights|Group]]/[[FAT file access rights|Owner]] permission classes only with multiuser security loaded)\n| compression             = Per-volume, [[SuperStor]], [[Stacker (disk compression)|Stacker]], [[DoubleSpace]], [[DriveSpace]]\n| encryption              = Per-volume only with [[DR-DOS]]\n}}\nOn August 14, 1984, IBM released the [[PC AT]], which featured a 20&nbsp;MiB hard disk and PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;3.0.<ref name=\"IBM_1984_PCDOS30\" /><ref name=\"IBM_1985_Reference\" /> Microsoft introduced MS-DOS&nbsp;3.0 in parallel. Cluster addresses were increased to 16-bit, allowing for up to 65,524&nbsp;clusters per volume, and consequently much greater file system sizes, at least in theory. However, the maximum possible number of sectors and the maximum ([[Disk partitioning|partition]], rather than disk) size of 32&nbsp;MiB did not change. Therefore, although cluster addresses were 16&nbsp;bits, this format was not what today is commonly understood as '''FAT16'''.\nA [[partition type]] <tt>[[Partition type#PID_04h|0x04]]</tt> indicates this form of FAT16 with less than 65536&nbsp;sectors (less than 32&nbsp;MiB for sector size 512).\n\nWith the initial implementation of FAT16 not actually providing for larger partition sizes than FAT12, the early benefit of FAT16 was to enable the use of smaller clusters, making disk usage more efficient, particularly for large numbers of files only a few hundred bytes in size.\n\nAs MS-DOS&nbsp;3.0 and higher formatted all 16&nbsp;MiB-32&nbsp;MiB partitions in the FAT16 format, a 20&nbsp;MiB hard disk formatted under MS-DOS&nbsp;3.0 was not accessible by the older MS-DOS&nbsp;2.0 although MS-DOS&nbsp;2.0 was able to access 16&nbsp;MiB-32&nbsp;MiB FAT12 partitions.<ref name=\"Microsoft_69912\" /> MS-DOS&nbsp;3.0 to MS-DOS&nbsp;3.30 could still access FAT12 partitions under 15&nbsp;MiB but required all 16&nbsp;MiB-32&nbsp;MiB partitions to be FAT16, and so failed to access MS-DOS&nbsp;2.0 partitions in this size range. MS-DOS&nbsp;3.31 and higher could access 16&nbsp;MiB-32&nbsp;MiB FAT12 partitions again.\n\n=== Logical sectored FAT ===\n<!-- NB. The header \"Logical sectored FAT\" is used in redirects to this page. -->\n\nAs hard disks grew larger, the MS-DOS and PC&nbsp;DOS implementations of FAT12 and FAT16 eventually lacked the means for taking advantage of extra capacity.  Several manufacturers addressed this problem, however, by developing their own FAT variants within their OEM issued versions of MS-DOS.<ref name=\"Novell_1993_FYI.M.1101\"/>\n\nSome vendors ([[AST Research|AST]] and [[NEC]]<ref name=\"Novell_1993_FYI.M.1101\"/>) supported [[AST MBR<!-- NEC MBR -->|eight]], instead of the standard [[Partition table (master boot record)|four]], primary partition entries in their custom extended ''[[Master Boot Record]]'' (''MBR''), and they adapted MS-DOS to use more than a single primary partition.\n\nOther vendors worked around the volume size limits imposed by the 16-bit sector entries and arithmetics by increasing the ''size'' of the sectors the file system dealt with, thereby blowing up dimensions.\n\nThese so-called ''logical sectors'' were larger (up to 8192&nbsp;bytes) than the ''physical sector'' size (still typically 512&nbsp;bytes) as expected by the [[ROM-BIOS]] [[INT 13H]]<!-- not sure if these OEM versions supported INT 13h, as the classical INT 13h is bound to 512 bytes. --> or the disk drive hardware. The DOS-BIOS or System BIOS would then combine multiple physical sectors into logical sectors for the file system to work with.\nThese changes were transparent to the file system implementation in the DOS kernel, since on the file system's abstraction level volumes are seen as a linear series of logically addressable sectors, also known as ''absolute sectors'' (addressed by their ''Logical Sector Number'' (''LSN''), starting with LSN&nbsp;0)<!-- similar to what much later and on a lower level, became known as LBA, though not directly related --> independent of the physical location of the volume on the physical medium and its geometry. The underlying DOS-BIOS translated these logical sectors into physical sectors according to partitioning information and the drive's physical geometry.\n\nThe drawback of this approach was a less memory-efficient sector buffering and deblocking in the DOS-BIOS, thereby causing an increased memory footprint for the DOS data structures.\nSince older DOS versions were not flexible enough to work with these logical geometries, the OEMs had to introduce new partition IDs for their FAT variants in order to hide them from off-the-shelf issues of MS-DOS and PC DOS. Known partition IDs for logical sectored FATs include: <tt>[[Partition type#PID_08h|0x08]]</tt> ([[Commodore International|Commodore]] MS-DOS 3.x), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_11h|0x11]]</tt> ([[Leading Edge Hardware Products|Leading Edge]] MS-DOS 3.x), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_14h|0x14]]</tt> (AST MS-DOS 3.x), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_24h|0x24]]</tt> (NEC MS-DOS 3.30<ref name=\"Novell_1993_FYI.M.1101\"/>), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_56h|0x56]]</tt> ([[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] MS-DOS 3.x), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_E5h|0xE5]]</tt> ([[Tandy Computers|Tandy]] MS-DOS), <tt>[[Partition type#PID_F2h|0xF2]]</tt> ([[Sperry Corporation|Sperry IT]] MS-DOS 3.x, [[Unisys]] MS-DOS 3.3 \u2013 also used by [[Digital Research]] [[DOS Plus]] 2.1).<ref name=\"Brouwer_2002_Partition-IDs\" /> OEM versions like Toshiba&nbsp;MS-DOS, Wyse&nbsp;MS-DOS&nbsp;3.2<!-- with 1024 bytes/sector --> and 3.3,<ref name=\"Microsoft_2000_Wyse-DOS\" /> as well as Zenith&nbsp;MS-DOS are also known to have utilized logical sectoring.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2000_Logical-sectoring\" /><!-- but partition IDs and other specifics of these formats are not known -->\n\nWhile non-standard and sub-optimal, these FAT variants are perfectly valid according to the specifications of the file system itself. Therefore, even if default issues of MS-DOS and PC&nbsp;DOS were not able to cope with them, most of these vendor-specific FAT12 and FAT16 variants can be mounted by more flexible file system implementations in operating systems such as DR-DOS, simply by changing the partition ID to one of the recognized types.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_DRDOS_Logical-Sectoring\" /> Also, if they no longer need to be recognized by their original operating systems, existing partitions can be \"converted\" into FAT12 and FAT16 volumes more compliant with versions of MS-DOS/PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;4.0\u20136.3, which do not support sector sizes different from 512&nbsp;bytes,<ref name=\"Brouwer_2002_Logical_FAT\" /> by switching to a [[DOS 3.31 BPB|BPB with 32-bit entry]] for the number of sectors, as introduced since DOS&nbsp;3.31 (see [[#FAT16B|FAT16B]] below), keeping the cluster size and reducing the [[BPB logical sector size|logical sector size in the BPB]] down to 512&nbsp;bytes, while at the same time increasing the counts of logical sectors per cluster, reserved logical sectors, total logical sectors, and logical sectors per FAT by the same factor.\n\nA parallel development in MS-DOS / PC&nbsp;DOS which allowed an increase in the maximum possible FAT size was the introduction of multiple FAT partitions on a hard disk. To allow the use of more FAT partitions in a compatible way, a new partition type was introduced in PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;3.2 (1986), the ''[[Extended boot record|extended partition]]'' (EBR),<ref name=\"Duncan_1988_MS-DOS_Encyclopedia\" /> which is a container for an additional partition called ''logical drive''. Since PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;3.3 (April 1987), there is another, optional extended partition containing the next ''logical drive'', and so on. The [[Master Boot Record|MBR]] of a hard disk can either define up to four primary partitions, or an extended partition in addition to up to three primary partitions.\n\n{{See also|Extended boot record}}\n\n=== <span id=\"FAT16B\"></span><span id=\"FAT16X\"></span>Final FAT16 ===\n\n{{infobox file system\n| name                    = FAT16B\n| developer               = [[Compaq]], [[Digital Research]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], [[Novell]]\n| full_name               = [[Design of the FAT file system#FAT16|16-bit File Allocation Table]]<br />(with 32-bit sector entries)\n| introduction_date       = 1987-11 ([[Compaq MS-DOS 3.31]])<br />1988-06-28 ([[DR DOS 3.31]])<br />1988 ([[IBM DOS 4.0]])<br />1988 ([[OS/2 1.1]])<br />1988 ([[MS-DOS 4.0 (IBM-developed)|MS-DOS 4.0]])\n| partition_id            = [[Master Boot Record|MBR]]/[[Extended Boot Record|EBR]]:<br />[[#FAT16B|FAT16B]]:&nbsp;<tt>{{abbr|0x|Values in C-notation for hexadecimal numbers}}[[Partition type#PID_06h|06]]</tt>&#x2009;<tt>[[Partition type#PID_0Eh|0x0E]]</tt>&#x2009;([[Logical block addressing|LBA]]),&#x2009;e.a.<br />[[Basic data partition|BDP]]:<br /><tt>EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7</tt>\n| min_volume_size         = 8&nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]] (with 128&nbsp;byte sectors)<br />32&nbsp;MiB (with [[512e|512]]&nbsp;byte sectors)<br />256&nbsp;MiB (with [[4Kn|4&nbsp;KiB]] sectors)\n| max_volume_size         = 2&nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GiB]] (with 32&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]] clusters)<br />4&nbsp;GiB (with 64&nbsp;KiB clusters) (NT&nbsp;4, PTS-DOS, EDR-DOS)<br />8&nbsp;GiB (with 128&nbsp;KiB clusters and <!-- 128 s/c -->1 or <!-- 64 s/c -->2&nbsp;KiB sectors) (NT&nbsp;4 and EDR-DOS only)<br />8&nbsp;GiB (with 128&nbsp;KiB clusters and <!-- 256 s/c -->512 byte sectors) (EDR-DOS only)<br />16&nbsp;GiB (with 256&nbsp;KiB clusters and <!-- 128 s/c -->2 or <!-- 64 s/c -->4&nbsp;KiB sectors) (NT&nbsp;4 only)\n| max_file_size           = 2,147,483,647 bytes (2&nbsp;GiB \u2013 1)<!-- 2^31 - 1 --> (without [[large file support|LFS]])<br />4,294,967,295 bytes (4&nbsp;GiB \u2013 1)<!-- 2^32 - 1 --> (with [[large file support|LFS]])<br />limited by volume size only (with FAT16+<ref name=\"DRDOS_FAT+_R2\" />)\n| file_size_granularity   = 1&nbsp;byte\n| max_files_no            = 65,460 for 32&nbsp;KiB clusters<!-- 2^16 - 12 (reserved clusters) - 64 (number of 32 KiB clusters for directory entries) -->\n| max_filename_size       = [[8.3 filename]] with [[OEM character set|OEM]] characters,<br />255 [[UCS-2]] characters<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_LFN_UNI\"/> when using [[Long filename|LFN]]\n| max_directory_depth     = 32&nbsp;levels or 66&nbsp;characters (with [[Current Directory Structure|CDS]]),<br />60&nbsp;levels or more (without CDS)\n| dates_recorded          = Modified date/time, creation date/time (DOS 7.0 and higher only), access date (only available with [[ACCDATE (CONFIG.SYS directive)|ACCDATE]] enabled),<ref name=\"Microsoft_2006_ACCDATE\" /> deletion date/time (only with DELWATCH 2<!-- with Novell DOS 7, Caldera OpenDOS 7.01, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher -->)\n| date_range              = [[Epoch of 1980-01-01|1980-01-01]] to [[Year 2100 problem|2099-12-31]] ([[Year 2108 problem|2107-12-31]])\n| date_resolution         = 2&nbsp;seconds for last modified time,<br />10&nbsp;ms for creation time,<br />1&nbsp;day for access date,<br />2&nbsp;seconds for deletion time\n| attributes              = [[FAT file attributes|Read-only]], [[FAT file attributes|Hidden]], [[FAT file attributes|System]], [[FAT file attributes|Volume]], [[FAT file attributes|Directory]], [[FAT file attributes|Archive]]\n| file_system_permissions = File, directory and volume access rights for [[FAT file access rights|Read]], [[FAT file access rights|Write]], [[FAT file access rights|Execute]], [[FAT file access rights|Delete]] only with [[DR-DOS]], [[PalmDOS]], [[Novell DOS]], [[OpenDOS]], [[FlexOS]], [[IBM 4680 OS|4680&nbsp;OS]], [[IBM 4690 OS|4690&nbsp;OS]], [[Concurrent DOS]], [[Multiuser DOS]], [[Datapac System Manager|System Manager]], [[REAL/32]] (Execute right only with FlexOS, 4680&nbsp;OS, 4690&nbsp;OS;

[[Microsoft]]'s <code>[[DSKPROBE]]</code> tool refers to type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_06h|0x06]]</tt> as ''BigFAT'',<ref name=\"Microsoft_2003_CC736327\" /> whereas some older versions of <code>[[FDISK]]</code> described it as ''BIGDOS''. Technically, it is known as '''FAT16B'''.\n\nSince older versions of DOS were not designed to cope with more than 65535&nbsp;sectors, it was necessary to introduce a new partition type for this format in order to hide it from pre-3.31 issues of DOS. The original form of FAT16 (with less than 65536 sectors) had a [[partition type]] <tt>[[Partition type#PID_04h|0x04]]</tt>. To deal with disks larger than this, type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_06h|0x06]]</tt> was introduced to indicate 65536 or more sectors. In addition to this, the disk driver was expanded to cope with more than 65535&nbsp;sectors as well. The only other difference between the original FAT16 and the newer FAT16B format is the usage of a [[DOS 3.31 BPB|newer BPB]] format with 32-bit sector entry. Therefore, newer operating systems supporting the FAT16B format can cope also with the original FAT16 format without any necessary changes.\n\nIf partitions to be used by pre-DOS&nbsp;3.31 issues of DOS need to be created by modern tools, the only criteria theoretically necessary to meet are a sector count of less than 65536, and the usage of the old partition ID (<tt>[[Partition type#PID_04h|0x04]]</tt>). In practice however, type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_01h|0x01]]</tt> and <tt>[[Partition type#PID_04h|0x04]]</tt> primary partitions should not be physically located outside the first 32&nbsp;MiB of the disk, due to other restrictions in MS-DOS&nbsp;2.x, which could not cope with them otherwise.\n\nIn 1988, the FAT16B improvement became more generally available through [[DR&nbsp;DOS]]&nbsp;3.31, PC&nbsp;DOS&nbsp;4.0, [[OS/2]]&nbsp;1.1, and MS-DOS&nbsp;4.0. The limit on partition size was dictated by the 8-bit [[Signedness|signed]] count of sectors per cluster, which originally had a maximum power-of-two value of 64. With the standard hard disk sector size of 512&nbsp;bytes, this gives a maximum of 32&nbsp;KiB cluster size, thereby fixing the \"definitive\" limit for the FAT16 partition size at 2&nbsp;GiB for sector size 512. On [[magneto-optical]] media, which can have 1 or 2&nbsp;KiB sectors instead of 0.5&nbsp;KiB, this size limit is proportionally larger.\n\nMuch later, [[Windows&nbsp;NT]] increased the maximum cluster size to 64&nbsp;KiB, by considering the sectors-per-cluster count as unsigned. However, the resulting format was not compatible with any other FAT implementation of the time, and it generated greater [[internal fragmentation]]. [[Windows 98]], SE and ME also supported reading and writing this variant, but its disk utilities did not work with it and some [[File control block|FCB]] services are not available for such volumes. This contributes to a confusing compatibility situation.\n\nPrior to 1995, versions of DOS accessed the disk via [[Cylinder-head-sector|CHS]] addressing only. When MS-DOS&nbsp;7.0&nbsp;/ [[Windows&nbsp;95]] introduced [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] disk access, partitions could start being physically located outside the first c. 8&nbsp;GiB<!-- exact value is somewhat smaller --> of this disk and thereby out of the reach of the traditional CHS addressing scheme. Partitions partially or fully located beyond the CHS barrier therefore had to be hidden from non-LBA-enabled operating systems by using the new partition type <tt>[[Partition type#PID_0Eh|0x0E]]</tt> in the partition table instead. FAT16 partitions using this partition type are also named '''FAT16X'''.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2004_KB120138\" /> The only difference, compared to previous FAT16 partitions, is the fact that some CHS-related geometry entries in the BPB record, namely the number of sectors per track and the number of heads, may contain no or misleading values and should not be used.\n\nThe number of root directory entries available for FAT12 and FAT16 is determined when the volume is formatted, and is stored in a 16-bit field. For a given number <code>RDE</code> and sector size <code>SS</code>, the number <code>RDS</code> of root directory sectors is <code>RDS=ceil((RDE\u00d732)/SS)</code>, and <code>RDE</code> is normally chosen to fill these sectors, i.e., <code>RDE*32=RDS*SS</code>. FAT12 and FAT16 media typically use 512 root directory entries on non-floppy media.

The maximum FAT32 volume size is 16 TiB (approximately 17.6 TB) with a sector size of 4,096 bytes.<ref name=\"Microsoft_2007_KB184006\" /><ref name=\"Microsoft_2007_KB314463\" /> Windows operating systems through [[Windows 10]] only create new FAT32 volumes up to 32 GB in size, however.\n\nThe maximum possible size for a file on a FAT32 volume is 4 [[GiB]] minus 1 byte or 4,294,967,295 (2<sup>32</sup> \u2212 1) bytes. This limit is a consequence of the file length entry in the directory table and would also affect huge FAT16 partitions with a sufficient sector size.<ref name=\"GB4\" /> FAT32 does not include direct built-in support for long filenames, but FAT32 volumes can optionally hold [[#VFAT|VFAT]] long filenames in addition to short filenames in exactly the same way as VFAT long filenames have been optionally implemented for FAT12 and FAT16 volumes.\n\n==== Development ====\nFAT32 was introduced with MS-DOS 7.1 / Windows 95 OSR2 in 1996, although reformatting was needed to use it, and [[DriveSpace 3]] (the version that came with Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows 98<!-- what about ME? -->) never supported it. Windows 98 introduced a utility to convert existing hard disks from FAT16 to FAT32 without loss of data.\n\nIn the Windows NT line, native support for FAT32 arrived in [[Windows 2000]]. A free FAT32 driver for [[Windows NT 4.0]] was available from [[Winternals]], a company later acquired by Microsoft. The acquisition of the driver from official sources is no longer possible. Since 1998, Caldera's dynamically loadable [[DRFAT32]] driver could be used to enable FAT32 support in DR-DOS.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_DRFAT32-RM\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_DRFAT32\"/> The first version of DR-DOS to natively support FAT32 and LBA access was OEM DR-DOS 7.04 in 1999. That same year [[Intelligent Micro Software|IMS]] introduced native FAT32 support with [[REAL/32]] 7.90, and [[IBM 4690 OS]] added FAT32 support with version 2.<ref name=\"IBM_4690_User_Guide\" /> [[Ahead Software]] provided another dynamically loadable FAT32.EXE driver for DR-DOS 7.03 with [[Nero Burning ROM]] in 2004.<!-- with copyrights 2002-2004 --> IBM PC DOS introduced native FAT32 support with OEM PC DOS 7.10 in 2003.\n\nTwo partition types have been reserved for FAT32 partitions, <tt>[[Partition type#PID 0Bh|0x0B]]</tt> and <tt>[[Partition type#PID 0Ch|0x0C]]</tt>.

The driver also utilizes the byte at offset [[Design of the FAT file system#DIR OFS 0Ch|<tt>0x0C</tt>]] in directory entries to store a special mark byte indicating the presence of extended attributes to help speed up things.<ref name=\"Kelder_2003_FAT32IFS0913\" /><ref name=\"Kelder_FAT32IFS074\" /> (This extension is critically incompatible with the FAT32+ method to store files larger than 4&nbsp;GiB minus 1 on FAT32 volumes.)<ref name=\"DRDOS_FAT+_R2\" />\n\nExtended attributes are accessible via the [[Workplace Shell]] desktop, through [[REXX]] scripts, and many system [[graphical user interface|GUI]] and [[command line interface|command-line]] utilities (such as [[4OS2]]).<ref name=\"Eager_2000_Tavi\" />\n\nTo accommodate its [[OS/2]] subsystem, [[Windows NT]] supports the handling of extended attributes in [[High Performance File System|HPFS]], [[NTFS]], FAT12 and FAT16. It stores EAs on FAT12, FAT16 and HPFS using exactly the same scheme as OS/2, but does not support any other kind of [[Alternate Data Streams|ADS]] as held on NTFS volumes. Trying to copy a file with any ADS other than EAs from an NTFS volume to a FAT or HPFS volume gives a warning message with the names of the ADSs that will be lost. It does not support the FAT32.IFS method to store EAs on FAT32 volumes.\n\n[[Windows 2000]] onward acts exactly as Windows NT, except that it ignores EAs when copying to FAT32 without any warning (but shows the warning for other ADSs, like \"Macintosh Finder Info\" and \"Macintosh Resource Fork\").\n\n[[Cygwin]] uses \"<code>EA&#x2420;DATA.&#x2420;SF</code>\" files as well.\n\n=== <span id=\"LFN\"></span><span id=\"VFAT\"></span><span id=\"UVFAT\"></span>Long file names ===\n<!-- use LFN anchor for generic FAT long filename solutions and VFAT for Microsoft's VFAT -->\n\nOne of the [[user experience]] goals for the designers of [[Windows 95]] was the ability to use [[long filename]]s (LFNs\u2014up to 255 [[UTF-16]] [[code unit]]s long),<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_LFN_UNI\"/> in addition to classic [[8.3 filename]]s (SFNs). For [[backward compatibility|backward]] and [[forward compatibility]] LFN were implemented as an optional extension on top of the existing FAT file system structures using a [[workaround]] in the way directory entries are laid out.\n\nThis transparent method to store long file names in the existing FAT file systems without altering their data structures is usually known as '''[[VFAT long filename|VFAT]]''' (for \"Virtual FAT\") after the Windows 95 [[VxD|virtual device driver]].<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_VFAT_Name\" />\n\nNon VFAT-enabled operating systems can still access the files under their short file name alias without restrictions; however, the associated long file names may be lost when files with long filenames are copied under non VFAT-aware operating systems.\n\nIn Windows&nbsp;NT, support for VFAT long filenames began with version [[Windows NT 3.5|3.5]].\n\nGNU/Linux provides a VFAT filesystem driver to work with FAT volumes with VFAT long filenames. For some while, a [[UVFAT]] driver was available to provide combined support for [[#UMSDOS|UMSDOS]]-style permissions with VFAT long filenames.\n\n[[OS/2]] added long filename support to FAT using [[FAT extended file attributes|extended attributes]] (EA) before the introduction of VFAT. Thus, VFAT long filenames are invisible to OS/2, and EA long filenames are invisible to Windows; therefore experienced users of both operating systems would have to manually rename the files.\n\n[[Human68K]] supported up to [[18.3 filename]]s and ([[Shift JIS]]) [[Kanji]] characters in a proprietary FAT file system variant.\n\nIn order to support [[Java (programming language)|Java]] applications, the [[FlexOS]]-based [[IBM 4690 OS]] version 2 introduced its own [[virtual file system]] (VFS) architecture to store long filenames in the FAT file system in a backwards-compatible fashion. If enabled, the virtual filenames (VFN) are available under separate logical drive letters, whereas the real filenames (RFN) remain available under the original drive letters.<ref name=\"IBM_4690_Programming_Guide\" />\n\n=== <span id=\"ADS\"></span>Forks and Alternate Data Streams ===\n\nThe FAT file system itself is not designed for supporting [[Alternate Data Streams]] ([[Fork (file system)|ADS]]), but some operating systems that heavily depend on them have devised various methods for handling them on FAT volumes. Such methods either store the additional information in extra files and directories ([[classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]]), or give new semantics to previously unused fields of the FAT on-disk data structures ([[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]).\n\nMac&nbsp;OS using [[PC Exchange]] stores its various dates, file attributes and long filenames in a [[hidden file]] called \"<code>FINDER.DAT</code>\", and [[resource fork]]s (a common Mac&nbsp;OS ADS) in a subdirectory called \"<code>RESOURCE.FRK</code>\", in every directory where they are used. From PC&nbsp;Exchange&nbsp;2.1 onwards, they store the Mac&nbsp;OS long filenames as standard FAT long filenames and convert FAT filenames longer than 31 characters to unique 31-character filenames, which can then be made visible to Macintosh applications.\n\n[[macOS]] stores [[resource fork]]s and metadata (file attributes, other ADS) using [[AppleDouble format]] in a hidden file with a name constructed from the owner filename prefixed with \"<code>._</code>\", and [[Finder (software)|Finder]] stores some folder and file metadata in a hidden file called \"<code>[[.DS_Store]]</code>\" (but note that Finder uses <code>.DS_Store</code> even on macOS' native filesystem, [[HFS+]]).\n\n=== <span id=\"UMSDOS\"></span>UMSDOS permissions and filenames ===\n{{further|FAT filesystem and Linux}}\n\nEarly GNU/Linux distributions also supported a format known as [[UMSDOS]], a FAT variant with Unix file attributes (such as long file name and access permissions) stored in a separate file called \"<code>--linux-.---</code>\". UMSDOS fell into disuse after [[#VFAT|VFAT]] was released and it is not enabled by default in [[Linux]] from version 2.5.7 onwards.<ref name=\"Linux_ChangeLog257\" /> For some time, Linux also provided combined support for UMSDOS-style permissions and VFAT long filenames through [[UVFAT]].\n\n== Derivatives ==\n\n=== Turbo FAT ===\n{{Main|Turbo FAT}}\n\nIn its [[NetWare File System]] ([[NWFS]]) [[Novell]] implemented a heavily modified variant of a FAT file system for the [[NetWare]] operating system. For larger files it utilized a performance feature named [[Turbo FAT]].\n\n=== FATX ===\n<!-- NB. The header \"FATX\" is used in redirects to this page. -->\n<!-- {{Main|FATX}} should be created instead of further expanding this FATX section -->\n\nFATX is a family of file systems designed for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game console]] [[hard disk]] drives and [[memory card]]s,<ref name=\"Xbox_FATX-Spec\" /><ref name=\"Xbox_Linux\" /> introduced in 2001.\n\nWhile resembling the same basic design ideas as [[#FAT16|FAT16]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]], the '''FATX16''' and '''FATX32''' on-disk structures are simplified, but fundamentally incompatible with normal FAT16 and FAT32 file systems, making it impossible for normal FAT file system drivers to mount such volumes.\n\nThe non-bootable [[superblock (file systems)|superblock]] sector is 4&nbsp;KiB in size and holds an 18&nbsp;byte large BPB-like structure completely different from normal [[FAT BPB|BPB]]s. Clusters are typically 16&nbsp;KiB in size and there is only one copy of the FAT on the Xbox. Directory entries are 64&nbsp;bytes in size instead of the normal [[FAT directory entry|32&nbsp;bytes]]. Files can have filenames up to 42 characters long using the [[OEM character set]]<!-- not Unicode --> and be up to 4&nbsp;GiB minus 1&nbsp;byte in size. The on-disk timestamps hold creation, modification and access dates and times but differ from FAT: in FAT, the [[Epoch (computing)|epoch]] is [[Epoch of 1980-01-01|1980]]; in FATX, the epoch is [[Epoch of 2000-01-01|2000]]. On the [[Xbox 360]], the epoch is 1980.<ref name=\"Xbox360_FATX\" />\n\n=== exFAT ===\n{{Main|exFAT}}\n\nexFAT is a file system introduced with [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0]] in November 2006 and brought to the Windows&nbsp;NT family with [[Windows Vista Service Pack 1|Vista Service Pack 1]] and [[Windows XP Service Pack 3]] (and/or separate installation of Windows XP Update KB955704). It is loosely based on the File Allocation Table architecture, but incompatible, proprietary and protected by patents.<ref name=\"Microsoft_exFAT-License\" />\n\nexFAT is intended for use on [[flash drive]]s (such as [[SDXC]] and [[Memory Stick XC]]), where FAT32 is otherwise used. Microsoft's [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]] and command-line format utilities offer it as an alternative to [[NTFS]] (and, for smaller partitions, to [[#FAT16B|FAT16B]] and [[#FAT32|FAT32]]). The [[Master Boot Record|MBR]] [[partition type]] is <tt>[[Partition type#PID_07h|0x07]]</tt> (the same as used for [[Installable File System|IFS]], [[High Performance File System|HPFS]], and NTFS). Logical geometry information located in the [[Volume Boot Record|VBR]] is stored in a format not resembling any kind of BPB.\n\nOn August 28, 2019, Microsoft announced that it will be making the technical specification for exFAT publicly available so that it can be used in the Linux kernel and other operating systems.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = exFAT in the Linux kernel?

However, the NCR Century 8200 was a 16-bit minicomputer, onto which several data entry terminals could be hooked up. [[Marc McDonald]] even remembered<!-- in 2012-08 --> a [[NCR 8500]], a mainframe of the Criterion series, which can be ruled out as well.

Other sources indicate that either the NCR 7200 series itself or the successor series were the actual target platform.

[[NCR Basic +6]], a precursor or adaptation of [[Standalone Disk BASIC-80]] was available for them at least since 1979.

Users cannot study, change, and share their [[source code]].\n* [[freeware]], which is a category of proprietary software that does not require payment for basic use.\n\nFor software under the purview of [[copyright]] to be free, it must carry a [[software license]] whereby the author grants users the aforementioned rights. Software that is not covered by copyright law, such as software in the [[public domain]], is free as long as the source code is in the public domain too, or otherwise available without restrictions.\n\nProprietary software uses restrictive software licences or [[End-user license agreement|EULAs]] and usually does not provide users with the source code. Users are thus legally or technically prevented from [[patch (computing)|changing]] the software, and this results on reliance on the publisher to provide updates, help, and support. (See also [[vendor lock-in]] and [[abandonware]]). Users often may not [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]], modify, or redistribute proprietary software.<ref name=\"Dixon\" /><ref name=\"Graham\" /> Beyond copyright law, contracts and lack of source code, there can exist additional obstacles keeping users from exercising freedom over a piece of software, such as [[software patent]]s and [[digital rights management]] (more specifically, [[tivoization]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2008/spring/the-last-mile-is-always-the-hardest/|title = The Last Mile is Always the Hardest|date = 17 July 2008|accessdate = 29 December 2014|website = [[Free Software Foundation|fsf.org]]|publisher = |last = Sullivan|first = John|authorlink = William John Sullivan|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141028230334/http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2008/spring/the-last-mile-is-always-the-hardest/|archivedate = 28 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nFree software can be a for-profit, commercial activity or not.

Left: free software, right: proprietary software, encircled: [[Freeware|Gratis software]]]]\n\nThe first formal definition of free software was published by FSF in February 1986.<ref name=\"bull6\" /> That definition, written by Richard Stallman, is still maintained today and states that software is free software if people who receive a copy of the software have the following four freedoms.<ref name=\"free-sw\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html|title=Four Freedoms - FSFE|work=fsfe.org}}</ref> The numbering begins with zero, not only as a spoof on the common usage of [[zero-based numbering]] in programming languages, but also because \"Freedom 0\" was not initially included in the list, but later added first in the list as it was considered very important.\n* Freedom 0: The freedom to ''run'' the program for any purpose.\n* Freedom 1: The freedom to ''study'' how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.\n* Freedom 2: The freedom to ''redistribute'' and make copies so you can help your neighbour.\n* Freedom 3: The freedom to ''improve'' the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.\n\nFreedoms 1 and 3 require [[source code]] to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code can range from highly impractical to nearly impossible.\n\nThus, free software means that [[User (computing)|computer users]] have the freedom to cooperate with whom they choose, and to control the software they use. To summarize this into a remark distinguishing ''libre'' (freedom) software from ''[[Gratis versus libre|gratis]]'' (zero price) software, the Free Software Foundation says: \"Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in '[[freedom of speech|free speech]]', not as in 'free beer{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"free-sw\" /> See [[Gratis versus libre|''Gratis'' versus ''libre'']].\n\nIn the late 1990s, other groups published their own definitions that describe an almost identical set of software. The most notable are [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] published in 1997,<ref name=\"Perens\" /> and the [[The Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]], published in 1998.\n\nThe [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]-based operating systems, such as [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[NetBSD]], do not have their own formal definitions of free software. Users of these systems generally find the same set of software to be acceptable, but sometimes see [[copyleft]] as restrictive. They generally advocate [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free-software licenses]], which allow others to use the software as they wish, without being legally ''forced'' to provide the source code. Their view is that this permissive approach is more free. The [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], [[MIT License|X11]], and [[Apache License|Apache]] software licenses are substantially similar in intent and implementation.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n{{Main|List of free and open-source software packages}}There are thousands of free applications and many operating systems available on the Internet. Users can easily download and install those applications via a  [[package manager]] that comes included with most [[Linux distributions]].\n\nThe [[Free Software Directory]] maintains a large database of free-software packages. Some of the best-known examples include the [[Linux kernel]], the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and Linux operating systems, the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] and [[GNU C Library|C library]]; the [[MySQL]] relational database; the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] web server; and the [[Sendmail]] mail transport agent. Other influential examples include the [[Emacs]] text editor; the [[GIMP]] raster drawing and image editor; the [[X Window System]] graphical-display system; the [[LibreOffice]] office suite; and the [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]] typesetting systems.<gallery caption=\"Free Software\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\" showfilename=\"yes\">\nFile:Kscreen-krunner.png|[[KDE Plasma]] desktop on [[Debian]].\nFile:Captura de pagina de manual de OpenSSL.png|[[OpenSSL]]'s manual page.\nFile:BgeCarSc.jpg|Creating a 3D car racing game using the [[Blender Game Engine]]\nFile:Replicant 4.0 on NexusS.png|[[Replicant (operating system)|Replicant]] smartphone, an Android-based system that is 100% free software.\nFile:Libreoffice 5.3 writer MUFFIN interface.png|[[Libreoffice]] is a free multi-platform office suite.\n</gallery>\n\n== History ==\n\n{{further|History of free and open-source software}}\n{{see also|Open-source software#History}}\n[[File:Richard Matthew Stallman.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Stallman]], founder of the [[Free Software Movement]] (2002)]]\n\nFrom the 1950s up until the early 1970s, it was normal for computer users to have the ''software freedoms'' associated with free software, which was typically [[public-domain software]].<ref name=\"infoworld1983\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA31&dq=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&f=false |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-23|title=Free software - Free software is a junkyard of software spare parts |quote=''\"In contrast to commercial software is a large and growing body of free software that exists in the public domain.

Organizations of users and suppliers, for example, [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]], were formed to facilitate exchange of software. As software was often written in an interpreted language such as [[BASIC]], the [[source code]] was distributed to use these programs. Software was also shared and distributed as printed source code ([[Type-in program]]) in [[computer magazine]]s (like [[Creative Computing]], [[SoftSide]], [[Compute!]], [[Byte magazine|Byte]] etc) and books, like the bestseller ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Ahl/DHAbio.htm | title = David H. Ahl biography from Who's Who in America | first = David | last = Ahl | accessdate = 2009-11-23}}</ref> By the early 1970s, the picture changed: software costs were dramatically increasing, a growing software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products (free in that the cost was included in the hardware cost), leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of \"free\" software bundled with hardware product costs. In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]].<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> While some software might always be free, there would henceforth be a growing amount of software produced primarily for sale. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the [[software industry]] began using technical measures (such as only distributing [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer program]]s) to prevent [[User (computing)|computer users]] from being able to study or adapt the software applications as they saw fit. In 1980, [[copyright]] law was extended to computer programs.\n\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], one of the original authors of the popular [[Emacs]] program and a longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the [[GNU project]], the purpose of which was to produce a completely non-proprietary [[Unix-like|Unix-compatible]] operating system, saying that he had become frustrated with the shift in climate surrounding the computer world and its users. In his initial declaration of the project and its purpose, he specifically cited as a motivation his opposition to being asked to agree to [[non-disclosure agreement]]s and restrictive licenses which prohibited the free sharing of potentially profitable in-development software, a prohibition directly contrary to the traditional [[hacker ethic]]. Software development for the [[GNU|GNU operating system]] began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. He developed a free software definition and the concept of \"[[copyleft]]\", designed to ensure ''software freedom'' for all.\nSome non-software industries are beginning to use techniques similar to those used in free software development for their research and development process; scientists, for example, are looking towards more open development processes, and hardware such as microchips are beginning to be developed with specifications released under [[copyleft]] licenses (see the [[OpenCores]] project, for instance). [[Creative Commons]] and the [[free-culture movement]] have also been largely influenced by the free software movement.\n\n===1980s: Foundation of the GNU project===\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the GNU project, saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users.<ref>{{cite book |last = Williams | first = Sam|date = 2002|title =  Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software |url = https://archive.org/details/freeasinfreedomr00will |publisher = O'Reilly Media |isbn = 0-596-00287-4}}</ref> Software development for the GNU operating system began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the [[GNU Manifesto]]. The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, ''[[The Free Software Definition|Free Software Definition]]'' and \"[[copyleft]]\" ideas.\n\n===1990s: Release of the Linux kernel===\nThe [[Linux kernel]], started by [[Linus Torvalds]], was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. The first licence was a proprietary software licence. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] the project under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | title=Release notes for Linux kernel 0.12 | publisher=Kernel.org}}</ref> Much like Unix, Torvalds' kernel attracted the attention of volunteer programmers.\n[[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]] (both derived from [[386BSD]]) were released as free software when the [[UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc.|USL v. BSDi]] lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. [[OpenBSD]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD in 1995.

However, unless the applications' licenses are compatible, combining programs by mixing source code or directly linking binaries is problematic, because of [[License compatibility|license technicalities]]. Programs indirectly connected together may avoid this problem.\n\nThe majority of free software falls under a small set of licenses. The most popular of these licenses are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackducksoftware.com/resources/data/top-20-licenses |quote=1. MIT license 24%, 2. GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0 23%, 3.

So it's possible for a license to be free and not in the FSF list. The OSI list only lists licenses that have been submitted, considered and approved. All open-source licenses must meet the [[Open Source Definition]] in order to be officially recognized as open source software. Free software, on the other hand, is a more informal classification that does not rely on official recognition. Nevertheless, software licensed under licenses that do not meet the Free Software Definition cannot rightly be considered free software.\n\nApart from these two organizations, the [[Debian]] project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licenses comply with their [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]]. Debian doesn't publish a list of ''approved'' licenses, so its judgments have to be tracked by checking what software they have allowed into their software archives. That is summarized at the Debian web site.<ref name=\"Debian\" />\n\nIt is rare that a license announced as being in-compliance with the FSF guidelines does not also meet the [[Open Source Definition]], although the reverse is not necessarily true (for example, the [[NASA Open Source Agreement]] is an OSI-approved license, but non-free according to FSF).\n\nThere are different categories of free software.\n* [[Public domain|Public-domain]] software: the copyright has expired, the work was not copyrighted (released without [[copyright notice]] before 1988), or the author has released the software onto the public domain with a [[waiver]] statement (in countries where this is possible). Since public-domain software lacks copyright protection, it may be freely incorporated into any work, whether proprietary or free. The FSF recommends the [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|CC0]] public domain dedication for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CC0|work=gnu.org|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n* [[permissive free software licence|Permissive licenses]], also called BSD-style because they are applied to much of the software distributed with the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] operating systems: these licenses are also known as [[Free content#Copyfree|copyfree]] as they have no restrictions on distribution.<ref name=\"copyfree\" /> The author retains copyright solely to disclaim warranty and require proper attribution of modified works, and permits redistribution and '''any''' modification, even closed-source ones. In this sense, a permissive license provides an incentive to create non-free software, by reducing the cost of developing restricted software. Since this is incompatible with the spirit of software freedom, many people consider permissive licenses to be less free than copyleft licenses.\n* [[Copyleft]] licenses, with the [[GNU General Public License]] being the most prominent: the author retains copyright and permits redistribution under the restriction that all such redistribution is licensed under the same license. Additions and modifications by others must also be licensed under the same \"copyleft\" license whenever they are distributed with part of the original licensed product. This is also known as a [[viral license|''viral'']], ''[[protective license|protective]]'', or ''reciprocal'' license. Due to the restriction on distribution not everyone considers this type of license to be free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.charvolant.org/doug/gpl/html/gpl.html|title=Why Not Use the GPL?

A popular quantitative test in computer security is to use relative counting of known unpatched security flaws. Generally, users of this method advise avoiding products that lack fixes for known security flaws, at least until a fix is available.\n\nFree software advocates strongly believe that this methodology is biased by counting more vulnerabilities for the free software systems, since their source code is accessible and their community is more forthcoming about what problems exist,<ref name=\"cnet\" /> (This is called \"Security Through Disclosure\"<ref name=\"albion\" />) and proprietary software systems can have undisclosed societal drawbacks, such as disenfranchising less fortunate would-be users of free programs. As users can analyse and trace the source code, many more people with no commercial constraints can inspect the code and find bugs and loopholes than a corporation would find practicable. According to Richard Stallman, user access to the source code makes deploying free software with undesirable hidden [[spyware]] functionality far more difficult than for proprietary software.<ref name=\"rms-fs-2006-03-09\" />\n\nSome quantitative studies have been done on the subject.<ref name=\"Wheeler\" /><ref name=\"Delio\" /><ref name=\"fuzz-revisited\" /><ref name=\"fuzz-macos\" />\n\n===Binary blobs and other proprietary software===\nIn 2006, [[OpenBSD]] started the first campaign against the use of [[binary blob]]s in [[Kernel (computing)|kernels]]. Blobs are usually freely distributable [[device driver]]s for hardware from vendors that do not reveal driver source code to users or developers. This restricts the users' freedom effectively to modify the software and distribute modified versions. Also, since the blobs are undocumented and may have [[Software bug|bugs]], they pose a security risk to any [[operating system]] whose kernel includes them. The proclaimed aim of the campaign against blobs is to collect hardware documentation that allows developers to write free software drivers for that hardware, ultimately enabling all free operating systems to become or remain blob-free.\n\nThe issue of binary blobs in the [[Linux kernel]] and other device drivers motivated some developers in Ireland to launch [[gNewSense]], a Linux based distribution with all the binary blobs removed. The project received support from the [[Free Software Foundation]] and stimulated the creation, headed by the [[Free Software Foundation Latin America]], of the [[Linux-libre]] kernel.<ref name=\"FreeGNULinuxDistributions\" /> As of October 2012, [[Trisquel]] is the most popular FSF endorsed Linux distribution ranked by Distrowatch (over 12 months).<ref name=\"DW02\" /> While [[Debian]] is not endorsed by the FSF and does not use Linux-libre, it is also a popular distribution available without kernel blobs by default since 2011.<ref name=\"FreeGNULinuxDistributions\" />\n\n== Business model ==\n\n{{see also|Business models for open-source software}}\n\n[[Commercial software|Selling software]] under any free-software licence is permissible, as is commercial use. This is true for licenses with or without [[copyleft]].<ref name=\"Popp2\" /><ref name=\"linfo\" /><ref name=\"bsdl-gpl\" />\n\nSince free software may be freely redistributed, it is generally available at little or no fee. Free software business models are usually based on adding value such as customization, accompanying hardware, support, training, integration, or certification.<ref name=\"Popp2\" /> Exceptions exist however, where the user is charged to obtain a copy of the free application itself.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2016-02/msg00227.html |title=[libreplanet-discuss] Is there any software that is libre but not gratis}}</ref>\n\nFees are usually charged for distribution on compact discs and bootable USB drives, or for services of installing or maintaining the operation of free software. Development of large, commercially used free software is often funded by a combination of user donations, [[crowdfunding]], corporate contributions, and tax money. The [[SELinux]] project at the United States [[National Security Agency]] is an example of a federally funded free-software project.\n\nProprietary software, on the other hand, tends to use a different business model, where a customer of the proprietary application pays a fee for a license to legally access and use it. This license may grant the customer the ability to configure some or no parts of the software themselves. Often some level of support is included in the purchase of proprietary software, but additional support services (especially for enterprise applications) are usually available for an additional fee. Some proprietary software vendors will also customize software for a fee.<ref name=\"Dornan\" />\n\nThe Free Software Foundation encourages selling free software. As the Foundation has written, \"distributing free software is an opportunity to raise funds for development. Don't waste it!\".<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, the FSF's own recommended license (the [[GNU GPL]]) states that \"[you] may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\"<ref name=\"GPLsection4\" />\n\nMicrosoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] stated in 2001 that \"open source is not available to commercial companies. The way the license is written, if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source.\"<ref name=\"suntimes\" /> This misunderstanding is based on a requirement of [[copyleft]] licenses (like the GPL) that if one distributes modified versions of software, they must release the source and use the same license. This requirement does not extend to other software from the same developer.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The claim of incompatibility between commercial companies and free software is also a misunderstanding. There are several large companies, e.g. [[Red Hat]] and [[IBM]], which do substantial commercial business in the development of free software.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== {{anchor|Adoption}} Economical aspects and adoption ==\n\n{{main|Free and open-source software#Adoption}}\n{{See also|Linux adoption|Open-source software#Adoption}}\n\n{{Infobox\n| decat   = yes\n| image   = [[File:Titan supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.jpg|250px]]\n| caption = Of the [[TOP500|world's five hundred]] fastest [[supercomputer]]s, 500 (100%) use the Linux kernel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top500 - List Statistics - November 2017|url=http://www.top500.org/statistics/list/ |website=Top500.org |accessdate=29 May 2016}}.</ref> The world's second fastest computer is the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]'s [[Titan (supercomputer)|Titan supercomputer]] (illustrated), which uses the [[Cray Linux Environment]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Roadrunner - BladeCenter QS22/LS21 Cluster, PowerXCell 8i 3.2 GHz / Opteron DC 1.8 GHz, Voltaire Infiniband |url=http://www.top500.org/system/177975 |website=Top500.org |accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nFree software played a significant part in the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web and the infrastructure of [[dot-com companies]].<ref name=\"Web Server Survey\" /><ref name=\"Apache Strategy\" /> Free software allows users to cooperate in enhancing and refining the programs they use; free software is a [[pure public good]] rather than a [[private good]].

However, warranties are permitted between any two parties upon the condition of the software and its usage.

Users cannot study, change, and share their [[source code]].\n* [[freeware]], which is a category of proprietary software that does not require payment for basic use.\n\nFor software under the purview of [[copyright]] to be free, it must carry a [[software license]] whereby the author grants users the aforementioned rights. Software that is not covered by copyright law, such as software in the [[public domain]], is free as long as the source code is in the public domain too, or otherwise available without restrictions.\n\nProprietary software uses restrictive software licences or [[End-user license agreement|EULAs]] and usually does not provide users with the source code. Users are thus legally or technically prevented from [[patch (computing)|changing]] the software, and this results on reliance on the publisher to provide updates, help, and support.

Left: free software, right: proprietary software, encircled: [[Freeware|Gratis software]]]]\n\nThe first formal definition of free software was published by FSF in February 1986.<ref name=\"bull6\" /> That definition, written by Richard Stallman, is still maintained today and states that software is free software if people who receive a copy of the software have the following four freedoms.<ref name=\"free-sw\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/4freedoms.en.html|title=Four Freedoms - FSFE|work=fsfe.org}}</ref> The numbering begins with zero, not only as a spoof on the common usage of [[zero-based numbering]] in programming languages, but also because \"Freedom 0\" was not initially included in the list, but later added first in the list as it was considered very important.\n* Freedom 0: The freedom to ''run'' the program for any purpose.\n* Freedom 1: The freedom to ''study'' how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.\n* Freedom 2: The freedom to ''redistribute'' and make copies so you can help your neighbour.\n* Freedom 3: The freedom to ''improve'' the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.\n\nFreedoms 1 and 3 require [[source code]] to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code can range from highly impractical to nearly impossible.\n\nThus, free software means that [[User (computing)|computer users]] have the freedom to cooperate with whom they choose, and to control the software they use. To summarize this into a remark distinguishing ''libre'' (freedom) software from ''[[Gratis versus libre|gratis]]'' (zero price) software, the Free Software Foundation says: \"Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in '[[freedom of speech|free speech]]', not as in 'free beer{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"free-sw\" /> See [[Gratis versus libre|''Gratis'' versus ''libre'']].\n\nIn the late 1990s, other groups published their own definitions that describe an almost identical set of software. The most notable are [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] published in 1997,<ref name=\"Perens\" /> and the [[The Open Source Definition|Open Source Definition]], published in 1998.\n\nThe [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]-based operating systems, such as [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[NetBSD]], do not have their own formal definitions of free software. Users of these systems generally find the same set of software to be acceptable, but sometimes see [[copyleft]] as restrictive. They generally advocate [[Permissive free software licence|permissive free-software licenses]], which allow others to use the software as they wish, without being legally ''forced'' to provide the source code. Their view is that this permissive approach is more free. The [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], [[MIT License|X11]], and [[Apache License|Apache]] software licenses are substantially similar in intent and implementation.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n{{Main|List of free and open-source software packages}}There are thousands of free applications and many operating systems available on the Internet. Users can easily download and install those applications via a  [[package manager]] that comes included with most [[Linux distributions]].\n\nThe [[Free Software Directory]] maintains a large database of free-software packages. Some of the best-known examples include the [[Linux kernel]], the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and Linux operating systems, the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] and [[GNU C Library|C library]]; the [[MySQL]] relational database; the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] web server; and the [[Sendmail]] mail transport agent. Other influential examples include the [[Emacs]] text editor; the [[GIMP]] raster drawing and image editor; the [[X Window System]] graphical-display system; the [[LibreOffice]] office suite; and the [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]] typesetting systems.<gallery caption=\"Free Software\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\" showfilename=\"yes\">\nFile:Kscreen-krunner.png|[[KDE Plasma]] desktop on [[Debian]].\nFile:Captura de pagina de manual de OpenSSL.png|[[OpenSSL]]'s manual page.\nFile:BgeCarSc.jpg|Creating a 3D car racing game using the [[Blender Game Engine]]\nFile:Replicant 4.0 on NexusS.png|[[Replicant (operating system)|Replicant]] smartphone, an Android-based system that is 100% free software.\nFile:Libreoffice 5.3 writer MUFFIN interface.png|[[Libreoffice]] is a free multi-platform office suite.\n</gallery>\n\n== History ==\n\n{{further|History of free and open-source software}}\n{{see also|Open-source software#History}}\n[[File:Richard Matthew Stallman.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Stallman]], founder of the [[Free Software Movement]] (2002)]]\n\nFrom the 1950s up until the early 1970s, it was normal for computer users to have the ''software freedoms'' associated with free software, which was typically [[public-domain software]].<ref name=\"infoworld1983\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yy8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA31&dq=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q=us%20government%20public%20domain%20software&f=false |work=[[InfoWorld]] |date=1983-06-23|title=Free software - Free software is a junkyard of software spare parts |quote=''\"In contrast to commercial software is a large and growing body of free software that exists in the public domain.

Software was also shared and distributed as printed source code ([[Type-in program]]) in [[computer magazine]]s (like [[Creative Computing]], [[SoftSide]], [[Compute!]], [[Byte magazine|Byte]] etc) and books, like the bestseller ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.swapmeetdave.com/Ahl/DHAbio.htm | title = David H.

In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]].<ref name=\"Fisher\" /> While some software might always be free, there would henceforth be a growing amount of software produced primarily for sale. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the [[software industry]] began using technical measures (such as only distributing [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer program]]s) to prevent [[User (computing)|computer users]] from being able to study or adapt the software applications as they saw fit. In 1980, [[copyright]] law was extended to computer programs.\n\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], one of the original authors of the popular [[Emacs]] program and a longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the [[GNU project]], the purpose of which was to produce a completely non-proprietary [[Unix-like|Unix-compatible]] operating system, saying that he had become frustrated with the shift in climate surrounding the computer world and its users. In his initial declaration of the project and its purpose, he specifically cited as a motivation his opposition to being asked to agree to [[non-disclosure agreement]]s and restrictive licenses which prohibited the free sharing of potentially profitable in-development software, a prohibition directly contrary to the traditional [[hacker ethic]]. Software development for the [[GNU|GNU operating system]] began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. He developed a free software definition and the concept of \"[[copyleft]]\", designed to ensure ''software freedom'' for all.\nSome non-software industries are beginning to use techniques similar to those used in free software development for their research and development process; scientists, for example, are looking towards more open development processes, and hardware such as microchips are beginning to be developed with specifications released under [[copyleft]] licenses (see the [[OpenCores]] project, for instance). [[Creative Commons]] and the [[free-culture movement]] have also been largely influenced by the free software movement.\n\n===1980s: Foundation of the GNU project===\nIn 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the GNU project, saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users.<ref>{{cite book |last = Williams | first = Sam|date = 2002|title =  Free as in Freedom: Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software |url = https://archive.org/details/freeasinfreedomr00will |publisher = O'Reilly Media |isbn = 0-596-00287-4}}</ref> Software development for the GNU operating system began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the [[GNU Manifesto]]. The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, ''[[The Free Software Definition|Free Software Definition]]'' and \"[[copyleft]]\" ideas.\n\n===1990s: Release of the Linux kernel===\nThe [[Linux kernel]], started by [[Linus Torvalds]], was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. The first licence was a proprietary software licence. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] the project under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | title=Release notes for Linux kernel 0.12 | publisher=Kernel.org}}</ref> Much like Unix, Torvalds' kernel attracted the attention of volunteer programmers.\n[[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]] (both derived from [[386BSD]]) were released as free software when the [[UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. v. Berkeley Software Design, Inc.|USL v. BSDi]] lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. [[OpenBSD]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The [[Apache HTTP Server]], commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the [[Apache License|Apache License 1.0]].\n\n== Licensing ==\n\n{{Main|Free-software license}}\n{{Further|Open-source license}}\n{{See also|Free and open-source software#Licensing}}\n\n[[File:Copyleft.svg|thumb|[[Copyleft]], a novel use of copyright law to ensure that works remain unrestricted, originates in the world of free software.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carver|first=Brian W.|date=2005-04-05|title=Share and Share Alike: Understanding and Enforcing Open Source and Free Software Licenses|journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal|location=|volume=20|pages=39|ssrn=1586574}}</ref>]]\n\nAll free-software licenses must grant users all the freedoms discussed above. However, unless the applications' licenses are compatible, combining programs by mixing source code or directly linking binaries is problematic, because of [[License compatibility|license technicalities]]. Programs indirectly connected together may avoid this problem.\n\nThe majority of free software falls under a small set of licenses. The most popular of these licenses are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackducksoftware.com/resources/data/top-20-licenses |quote=1. MIT license 24%, 2. GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0 23%, 3.

So it's possible for a license to be free and not in the FSF list. The OSI list only lists licenses that have been submitted, considered and approved. All open-source licenses must meet the [[Open Source Definition]] in order to be officially recognized as open source software. Free software, on the other hand, is a more informal classification that does not rely on official recognition. Nevertheless, software licensed under licenses that do not meet the Free Software Definition cannot rightly be considered free software.\n\nApart from these two organizations, the [[Debian]] project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licenses comply with their [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]]. Debian doesn't publish a list of ''approved'' licenses, so its judgments have to be tracked by checking what software they have allowed into their software archives. That is summarized at the Debian web site.<ref name=\"Debian\" />\n\nIt is rare that a license announced as being in-compliance with the FSF guidelines does not also meet the [[Open Source Definition]], although the reverse is not necessarily true (for example, the [[NASA Open Source Agreement]] is an OSI-approved license, but non-free according to FSF).\n\nThere are different categories of free software.\n* [[Public domain|Public-domain]] software: the copyright has expired, the work was not copyrighted (released without [[copyright notice]] before 1988), or the author has released the software onto the public domain with a [[waiver]] statement (in countries where this is possible). Since public-domain software lacks copyright protection, it may be freely incorporated into any work, whether proprietary or free. The FSF recommends the [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|CC0]] public domain dedication for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them|url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CC0|work=gnu.org|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n* [[permissive free software licence|Permissive licenses]], also called BSD-style because they are applied to much of the software distributed with the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] operating systems: these licenses are also known as [[Free content#Copyfree|copyfree]] as they have no restrictions on distribution.<ref name=\"copyfree\" /> The author retains copyright solely to disclaim warranty and require proper attribution of modified works, and permits redistribution and '''any''' modification, even closed-source ones. In this sense, a permissive license provides an incentive to create non-free software, by reducing the cost of developing restricted software. Since this is incompatible with the spirit of software freedom, many people consider permissive licenses to be less free than copyleft licenses.\n* [[Copyleft]] licenses, with the [[GNU General Public License]] being the most prominent: the author retains copyright and permits redistribution under the restriction that all such redistribution is licensed under the same license. Additions and modifications by others must also be licensed under the same \"copyleft\" license whenever they are distributed with part of the original licensed product. This is also known as a [[viral license|''viral'']], ''[[protective license|protective]]'', or ''reciprocal'' license. Due to the restriction on distribution not everyone considers this type of license to be free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.charvolant.org/doug/gpl/html/gpl.html|title=Why Not Use the GPL?

A popular quantitative test in computer security is to use relative counting of known unpatched security flaws. Generally, users of this method advise avoiding products that lack fixes for known security flaws, at least until a fix is available.\n\nFree software advocates strongly believe that this methodology is biased by counting more vulnerabilities for the free software systems, since their source code is accessible and their community is more forthcoming about what problems exist,<ref name=\"cnet\" /> (This is called \"Security Through Disclosure\"<ref name=\"albion\" />) and proprietary software systems can have undisclosed societal drawbacks, such as disenfranchising less fortunate would-be users of free programs. As users can analyse and trace the source code, many more people with no commercial constraints can inspect the code and find bugs and loopholes than a corporation would find practicable. According to Richard Stallman, user access to the source code makes deploying free software with undesirable hidden [[spyware]] functionality far more difficult than for proprietary software.<ref name=\"rms-fs-2006-03-09\" />\n\nSome quantitative studies have been done on the subject.<ref name=\"Wheeler\" /><ref name=\"Delio\" /><ref name=\"fuzz-revisited\" /><ref name=\"fuzz-macos\" />\n\n===Binary blobs and other proprietary software===\nIn 2006, [[OpenBSD]] started the first campaign against the use of [[binary blob]]s in [[Kernel (computing)|kernels]]. Blobs are usually freely distributable [[device driver]]s for hardware from vendors that do not reveal driver source code to users or developers. This restricts the users' freedom effectively to modify the software and distribute modified versions. Also, since the blobs are undocumented and may have [[Software bug|bugs]], they pose a security risk to any [[operating system]] whose kernel includes them. The proclaimed aim of the campaign against blobs is to collect hardware documentation that allows developers to write free software drivers for that hardware, ultimately enabling all free operating systems to become or remain blob-free.\n\nThe issue of binary blobs in the [[Linux kernel]] and other device drivers motivated some developers in Ireland to launch [[gNewSense]], a Linux based distribution with all the binary blobs removed. The project received support from the [[Free Software Foundation]] and stimulated the creation, headed by the [[Free Software Foundation Latin America]], of the [[Linux-libre]] kernel.<ref name=\"FreeGNULinuxDistributions\" /> As of October 2012, [[Trisquel]] is the most popular FSF endorsed Linux distribution ranked by Distrowatch (over 12 months).<ref name=\"DW02\" /> While [[Debian]] is not endorsed by the FSF and does not use Linux-libre, it is also a popular distribution available without kernel blobs by default since 2011.<ref name=\"FreeGNULinuxDistributions\" />\n\n== Business model ==\n\n{{see also|Business models for open-source software}}\n\n[[Commercial software|Selling software]] under any free-software licence is permissible, as is commercial use. This is true for licenses with or without [[copyleft]].<ref name=\"Popp2\" /><ref name=\"linfo\" /><ref name=\"bsdl-gpl\" />\n\nSince free software may be freely redistributed, it is generally available at little or no fee. Free software business models are usually based on adding value such as customization, accompanying hardware, support, training, integration, or certification.<ref name=\"Popp2\" /> Exceptions exist however, where the user is charged to obtain a copy of the free application itself.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2016-02/msg00227.html |title=[libreplanet-discuss] Is there any software that is libre but not gratis}}</ref>\n\nFees are usually charged for distribution on compact discs and bootable USB drives, or for services of installing or maintaining the operation of free software. Development of large, commercially used free software is often funded by a combination of user donations, [[crowdfunding]], corporate contributions, and tax money. The [[SELinux]] project at the United States [[National Security Agency]] is an example of a federally funded free-software project.\n\nProprietary software, on the other hand, tends to use a different business model, where a customer of the proprietary application pays a fee for a license to legally access and use it. This license may grant the customer the ability to configure some or no parts of the software themselves. Often some level of support is included in the purchase of proprietary software, but additional support services (especially for enterprise applications) are usually available for an additional fee. Some proprietary software vendors will also customize software for a fee.<ref name=\"Dornan\" />\n\nThe Free Software Foundation encourages selling free software. As the Foundation has written, \"distributing free software is an opportunity to raise funds for development. Don't waste it!\".<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, the FSF's own recommended license (the [[GNU GPL]]) states that \"[you] may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\"<ref name=\"GPLsection4\" />\n\nMicrosoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] stated in 2001 that \"open source is not available to commercial companies. The way the license is written, if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source.\"<ref name=\"suntimes\" /> This misunderstanding is based on a requirement of [[copyleft]] licenses (like the GPL) that if one distributes modified versions of software, they must release the source and use the same license. This requirement does not extend to other software from the same developer.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The claim of incompatibility between commercial companies and free software is also a misunderstanding. There are several large companies, e.g. [[Red Hat]] and [[IBM]], which do substantial commercial business in the development of free software.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n== {{anchor|Adoption}} Economical aspects and adoption ==\n\n{{main|Free and open-source software#Adoption}}\n{{See also|Linux adoption|Open-source software#Adoption}}\n\n{{Infobox\n| decat   = yes\n| image   = [[File:Titan supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.jpg|250px]]\n| caption = Of the [[TOP500|world's five hundred]] fastest [[supercomputer]]s, 500 (100%) use the Linux kernel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top500 - List Statistics - November 2017|url=http://www.top500.org/statistics/list/ |website=Top500.org |accessdate=29 May 2016}}.</ref> The world's second fastest computer is the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]'s [[Titan (supercomputer)|Titan supercomputer]] (illustrated), which uses the [[Cray Linux Environment]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Roadrunner - BladeCenter QS22/LS21 Cluster, PowerXCell 8i 3.2 GHz / Opteron DC 1.8 GHz, Voltaire Infiniband |url=http://www.top500.org/system/177975 |website=Top500.org |accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref>\n}}\n\nFree software played a significant part in the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web and the infrastructure of [[dot-com companies]].<ref name=\"Web Server Survey\" /><ref name=\"Apache Strategy\" /> Free software allows users to cooperate in enhancing and refining the programs they use; free software is a [[pure public good]] rather than a [[private good]].

Free software often has no warranty, and more importantly, generally does not assign legal liability to anyone. However, warranties are permitted between any two parties upon the condition of the software and its usage. Such an agreement is made separately from the free software license.\n\nA report by [[Standish Group]] estimates that adoption of free software has caused a drop in revenue to the [[proprietary software]] industry by about $60 billion per year.<ref name=\"standishgroup\" />.

These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay. At the time, the Stonewall Inn was owned by the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].<ref name=\"duberman183\"/><ref>Carter, pp. 79\u201383.</ref><ref name=\"AmExpMafia\">{{cite web |title=Stonewall Uprising: The Year That Changed America - Why Did the Mafia Own the Bar? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/stonewall-why-did-mafia-own-bar/ |website=American Experience |publisher=PBS |accessdate=June 5, 2019 |date=April 2011}}</ref> It catered to an assortment of patrons and was known to be popular among the poorest and most marginalized people in the gay community: [[Butch and femme|butch lesbians]], [[effeminate]] young men, [[drag queen]]s, [[male prostitution|male prostitutes]], [[transgender]] people, and [[Homelessness in the United States|homeless youth]]. Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world. On June 28, 1970, the first [[Pride parade|gay pride marches]] took place in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |title=Heritage &#124; 1970 Christopher Street Liberation Day Gay-In, San Francisco |publisher=SF Pride |date=June 28, 1970 |accessdate=June 28, 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022032242/http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}</ref> and the anniversary of the riots was commemorated in Chicago.

[[Anarchism|Anarchists]], [[Communism|communists]], and other people deemed un-American and subversive were considered security risks. Gay men and lesbians were [[lavender scare|included]] in this list by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] on the theory that they were susceptible to [[blackmail]]. In 1950, a Senate investigation chaired by [[Clyde R. Hoey]] noted in a report, \"It is generally believed that those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons\",<ref>Edsall, p. 277.</ref> and said all of the government's intelligence agencies \"are in complete agreement that sex perverts in Government constitute security risks\".<ref>David K.

Cities performed \"sweeps\" to rid neighborhoods, parks, bars, and beaches of gay people. They outlawed the wearing of opposite gender clothes, and universities expelled instructors suspected of being homosexual.<ref>Adam, p. 59.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the [[American Psychiatric Association]] listed homosexuality in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (''DSM'') as a mental disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession.<ref>Edsall, p. 247.</ref> In 1956, however, the psychologist [[Evelyn Hooker]] performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference.<ref>Edsall, p. 310.</ref> Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians,<ref>Marcus, pp. 58\u201359.</ref> but homosexuality remained in the ''DSM'' until 1974.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=drBejRLWkHkC&pg=PA76 |chapter=The Transformation of Mental Disorders in the 1980s: The DSM-III, Managed Care, and \"Cosmetic Psychopharmacology\" |page=76 |title=Medicating Children: ADHD and Pediatric Mental Health |first1=Rick |last1=Mayes |first2=Catherine |last2=Bagwell |first3=Jennifer L. |last3=Erkulwater |publisher=Harvard University Press |date= 2009 |accessdate=April 7, 2019 |isbn=978-0-674-03163-0 }}</ref>\n\n===Homophile activism===\n{{main|Homophile}}\nIn response to this trend, two organizations formed independently of each other to advance the cause of gay men and lesbians and provide social opportunities where they could socialize without fear of being arrested. [[Los Angeles]] area homosexuals created the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, in the home of communist activist [[Harry Hay]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles.<ref>Adam, pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals.<ref>Adam, pp. 63\u201364.</ref><ref>Marcus, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Soon after, several women in [[San Francisco]] met in their living rooms to form the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) for lesbians.<ref>Marcus, p. 21.</ref> Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.<ref>Gallo, pp. 1\u20135, 11.</ref>\n\nOne of the first challenges to [[political repression|government repression]] came in 1953. An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]]. Similar demonstrations were then held also at other government buildings. The purpose was to protest the treatment of gay people in Cuba<ref name=DB>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/fidel-castros-horrific-record-on-gay-rights|title=Fidel Castro's Horrific Record on Gay Rights|date=November 27, 2016|journal=Daily Beast|last1=Kirchick|first1=James}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.fi/books?id=jA8l8EYcnHsC&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76| title = Rethinking the Gay and Lesbian Movement| author = Marc Stein| date = 2012| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 9780415874106}}</ref> and U.S. employment discrimination.

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\"<ref name=\"carter142\">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?...

Twenty-eight cases of beer and nineteen bottles of hard liquor were seized, but the patrol wagons had not yet arrived, so patrons were required to wait in line for about 15&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"carter142\"/> Those who were not arrested were released from the front door, but they did not leave quickly as usual. Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo.

She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as \"a typical New York butch\" and \"a dyke\u2013stone butch\", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a [[baton (law enforcement)|baton]] for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight.<ref>Duberman, p. 196.</ref> Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown ([[Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie]] has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary<ref name=Chu>{{cite web|last=Chu |first=Grace |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/77167-an-interview-with-lesbian-stonewall-veteran-storm-delarverie|title=An interview with lesbian Stonewall veteran Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie |publisher=AfterEllen.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Accounts of people who witnessed the scene, including letters and news reports of the woman who fought with police, conflicted.

At least one was already bleeding when taken out of the bar (Carter, pp. 152\u2013153). Craig Rodwell (in Duberman, p. 197) claims the arrest of the woman was not the primary event that triggered the violence, but one of several simultaneous occurrences: \"there was just ... a flash of group\u2014of mass\u2014anger.\"</ref>), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, \"Why don't you guys do something?\" After an officer picked her up and heaved her into the back of the wagon,<ref>Carter, p. 152.</ref> the crowd became a mob and went \"berserk\": \"It was at that moment that the scene became explosive.\"<ref>Carter, p. 151.</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The night they busted Stonewall | author=Lucian K.

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around\u2014it's like standing your ground for the first time and in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away.

They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because everybody else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill.\"<ref>Carter, p. 175.</ref> With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, \"Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon.\" His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, \"All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously.\"<ref>Carter, p. 174.</ref>\n\nThe TPF formed a [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] and attempted to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police. The crowd cheered, started impromptu [[kick line]]s, and sang to the tune of [[Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay]]: \"We are the Stonewall girls/ We wear our hair in curls/ We don't wear underwear/ We show our pubic hair.\"<ref>Teal, p. 5.</ref><ref>Sara Warner (2012).

Members of the mob stopped cars, overturning one of them to block Christopher Street. [[Jack Nichols (activist)|Jack Nichols]] and [[Lige Clarke]], in their column printed in ''[[Screw (magazine)|Screw]]'', declared that \"massive crowds of angry protesters chased [the police] for blocks screaming, 'Catch them!'&nbsp;\"<ref name=\"teal6\"/>\n\nBy 4:00&nbsp;a.m., the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or gathered nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be \"electricity in the air\".<ref>Carter, p. 180.</ref> One commented: \"There was a certain beauty in the aftermath of the riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street.\"<ref>Carter, p. 181.</ref> Thirteen people had been arrested.

All three papers covered the riots; the ''Daily News'' placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\".<ref name=\"teal4\"/> All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. [[Graffiti]] appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring \"Drag power\", \"They invaded our rights\", \"Support gay power\", and \"Legalize gay bars\", along with accusations of police looting, and\u2014regarding the status of the bar\u2014\"We are open.\"<ref name=\"teal4\">Teal, p. 4.</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EFDB1E3AEE34BC4850DFB0668382679EDE |title=Police Again Rout Village Youths: Outbreak by 400 Follows a Near-Riot Over Raid |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 30, 1969 |page=22}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe next night, rioting again surrounded Christopher Street; participants remember differently which night was more frantic or violent.

More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth [[Organization of the New York City Police Department#Police precincts|Precinct]]s, but after 2:00&nbsp;a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as \"sissies\" or \"swishes\", the crowd surged to recapture them.<ref>Carter, p. 191.</ref> Street battling ensued again until 4:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref name=\"duberman204-205\">Duberman, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref>\n\n[[Beat Generation|Beat]] poet and longtime Greenwich Village resident [[Allen Ginsberg]] lived on Christopher Street, and happened upon the jubilant chaos. After he learned of the riot that had occurred the previous evening, he stated, \"Gay power! Isn't that great!... It's about time we did something to assert ourselves\", and visited the open Stonewall Inn for the first time. While walking home, he declared to Lucian Truscott, \"You know, the guys there were so beautiful\u2014they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10&nbsp;years ago.\"<ref>Teal, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence===\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. [[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\"<ref name=\"carter216-217\"/> Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]\n\n===Gay Liberation Front===\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\">LaFrank, p. 17.</ref><ref group=note>\"Hairpin drop\" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</ref> When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"<ref name=\"teal19\">Teal, p. 19.</ref> With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",<ref name=\"teal19\"/> the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \"gay\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"<ref>Marcus, p. 136.</ref> The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American society\".<ref>Duberman, p. 216.</ref> They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]], and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.<ref>Carter, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\n===Gay Activists Alliance===\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city\u2014''The Village Voice''\u2014refused to print the word \"gay\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.<ref>Clendinen, p. 40.</ref> Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name=\"carter242\">Carter, p. 242.</ref><ref>Duberman, p. 235.</ref>\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].<ref>Carter, p. 220.</ref> In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] was zapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.<ref>Carter, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref>\n\nRaids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.<ref name=\"carter242\"/> They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.<ref>Teal, pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.<ref>Carter, p. 252.</ref>\n\n===Gay Pride===\n{{main|NYC Pride March#Origins}}\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]], these were the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride marches]] in U.S. history.<ref>Duberman, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref><ref>De la Croix, Sukie (2007).

The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers.<ref>Clendinen, pp. 62\u201364.</ref> ''The New York Times'' reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15&nbsp;city blocks.<ref name=\"fosburgh\">Fosburgh, Lacey (June 29, 1970).

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]]. Many who arrived at GLF or GAA meetings were taken aback by the number of gay people in one place.<ref>Marcus, pp. 152\u2013155.</ref> Race, class, ideology, and gender became frequent obstacles in the years after the riots. This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. ''The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington''. The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<ref>Deitcher, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.

These influences, along with the liberal environment of [[Greenwich Village]], served as catalysts for the Stonewall riots.\n\nVery few establishments welcomed gay people in the 1950s and 1960s. Those that did were often bars, although bar owners and managers were rarely gay. At the time, the Stonewall Inn was owned by the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].<ref name=\"duberman183\"/><ref>Carter, pp. 79\u201383.</ref><ref name=\"AmExpMafia\">{{cite web |title=Stonewall Uprising: The Year That Changed America - Why Did the Mafia Own the Bar? |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/stonewall-why-did-mafia-own-bar/ |website=American Experience |publisher=PBS |accessdate=June 5, 2019 |date=April 2011}}</ref> It catered to an assortment of patrons and was known to be popular among the poorest and most marginalized people in the gay community: [[Butch and femme|butch lesbians]], [[effeminate]] young men, [[drag queen]]s, [[male prostitution|male prostitutes]], [[transgender]] people, and [[Homelessness in the United States|homeless youth]]. Police raids on gay bars were routine in the 1960s, but officers quickly lost control of the situation at the Stonewall Inn. Tensions between [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]] and gay residents of Greenwich Village erupted into more protests the next evening, and again several nights later. Within weeks, Village residents quickly organized into activist groups to concentrate efforts on establishing places for gay men and lesbians to be open about their [[sexual orientation]] without fear of being arrested.\n\nAfter the Stonewall riots, gay men and lesbians in New York City faced gender, race, class, and generational obstacles to becoming a cohesive community. Within six months, two gay activist organizations were formed in New York, concentrating on confrontational tactics, and three newspapers were established to promote rights for gay men and lesbians. Within a few years, gay rights organizations were founded across the U.S. and the world. On June 28, 1970, the first [[Pride parade|gay pride marches]] took place in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |title=Heritage &#124; 1970 Christopher Street Liberation Day Gay-In, San Francisco |publisher=SF Pride |date=June 28, 1970 |accessdate=June 28, 2014 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022032242/http://www.sfpride.org/heritage/1970.html |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}</ref> and the anniversary of the riots was commemorated in Chicago.

[[Los Angeles]] area homosexuals created the [[Mattachine Society]] in 1950, in the home of communist activist [[Harry Hay]].<ref>Marcus, pp. 24\u201325.</ref> Their objectives were to unify homosexuals, educate them, provide leadership, and assist \"sexual deviants\" with legal troubles.<ref>Adam, pp. 62\u201363.</ref> Facing enormous opposition to their radical approach, in 1953 the Mattachine shifted their focus to assimilation and respectability. They reasoned that they would change more minds about homosexuality by proving that gay men and lesbians were normal people, no different from heterosexuals.<ref>Adam, pp. 63\u201364.</ref><ref>Marcus, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Soon after, several women in [[San Francisco]] met in their living rooms to form the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) for lesbians.<ref>Marcus, p. 21.</ref> Although the eight women who created the DOB initially came together to be able to have a safe place to dance, as the DOB grew they developed similar goals to the Mattachine, and urged their members to assimilate into general society.<ref>Gallo, pp. 1\u20135, 11.</ref>\n\nOne of the first challenges to [[political repression|government repression]] came in 1953. An organization named [[ONE, Inc.]] published a magazine called ''ONE''. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexual people in heterosexual marriages, on the grounds that the material was obscene despite it being covered in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually [[One, Inc. v. Olesen|went to the Supreme Court]], which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.<ref>Marcus, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[Homophile]] organizations\u2014as homosexual groups self-identified in this era\u2014grew in number and spread to the East Coast. Gradually, members of these organizations grew bolder. [[Frank Kameny]] founded the Mattachine of [[Washington, D.C.]] He had been fired from the U.S. Army Map Service for being a homosexual, and sued unsuccessfully to be reinstated. Kameny wrote that homosexuals were no different from heterosexuals, often aiming his efforts at [[mental health professional]]s, some of whom attended Mattachine and DOB meetings telling members they were abnormal.<ref>Marcus, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1965, news on [[Cuba]]n prison work camps for homosexuals inspired Mattachine New York and D.C. to organize protests at the [[United Nations]] and the [[White House]].

A cohort of poets, later named the [[Beat Generation|Beat]] poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]\u2014both Greenwich Village residents\u2014also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.<ref>Adam, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, a campaign to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], who was concerned about the image of the city in preparation for the [[1964 New York World's Fair|1964 World's Fair]]. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible.<ref>Carter, pp. 29\u201337.</ref> [[Entrapment]] usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together\u2014or the officer bought the man a drink\u2014he was arrested for [[solicitation]]. One story in the ''[[New York Post]]'' described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested.<ref>Carter, p. 46.</ref> Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.<ref>Duberman, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\nThe Mattachine Society succeeded in getting newly-elected mayor [[John Lindsay]] to end the campaign of police entrapment in New York City. They had a more difficult time with the [[Alcohol laws of New York|New York State Liquor Authority]] (SLA).

In 1966 the New York Mattachine held a \"sip-in\" at a Greenwich Village bar named [[Julius (New York City)|Julius]], which was frequented by gay men, to illustrate the discrimination homosexuals faced.<ref>Jackson, Sharyn (June 17, 2008).

Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private \"bottle club\", but rarely signed their real names.<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or [[black light]]s.

We're taking the place!\"<ref name=\"Carter, p. 137.\">Carter, p. 137.</ref> Stonewall employees do not recall being tipped off that a raid was to occur that night, as was the custom. According to Duberman (p.&nbsp;194), there was a rumor that one might happen, but since it was much later than raids generally took place, Stonewall management thought the tip was inaccurate.\n\nHistorian [[David Carter (historian)|David Carter]] presents information<ref>Carter, pp. 96\u2013103</ref> indicating that the Mafia owners of the Stonewall and the manager were blackmailing wealthier customers, particularly those who worked in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].<ref name=\"AmExpMafia\"/> They appeared to be making more money from extortion than they were from liquor sales in the bar. Carter deduces that when the police were unable to receive kickbacks from blackmail and the theft of negotiable bonds (facilitated by pressuring gay [[Wall Street]] customers), they decided to close the Stonewall Inn permanently. Two undercover policewomen and two undercover policemen had entered the bar earlier that evening to gather visual evidence, as the Public Morals Squad waited outside for the signal. Once inside, they called for backup from the Sixth Precinct using the bar's pay telephone. The music was turned off and the main lights were turned on. Approximately 205&nbsp;people were in the bar that night. Patrons who had never experienced a police raid were confused. A few who realized what was happening began to run for doors and windows in the bathrooms, but police barred the doors. Michael Fader remembered,\n\n<blockquote>\"Things happened so fast you kind of got caught not knowing. All of a sudden there were police there and we were told to all get in lines and to have our identification ready to be led out of the bar.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe raid did not go as planned. Standard procedure was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women to the bathroom to verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room in the back of the bar. [[Maria Ritter (person)|Maria Ritter]], then known as male to her family, recalled, \"My biggest fear was that I would get arrested. My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!\"<ref name=\"carter142\">Carter, p. 142.</ref> Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by \"feeling some of them up inappropriately\" while frisking them.<ref>Carter, p. 141.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=30em | align=left |quote=When did you ever see a fag fight back?...

Instead, they stopped outside and a crowd began to grow and watch. Within minutes, between 100 and 150&nbsp;people had congregated outside, some after they were released from inside the Stonewall, and some after noticing the police cars and the crowd. Although the police forcefully pushed or kicked some patrons out of the bar, some customers released by the police performed for the crowd by posing and saluting the police in an exaggerated fashion. The crowd's applause encouraged them further: \"Wrists were limp, hair was primped, and reactions to the applause were classic.\"<ref>Teal, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the first patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine recalled that the crowd\u2014most of whom were homosexual\u2014had grown to at least ten times the number of people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet.<ref>Carter, p. 147.</ref> Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, \"Gay power!\", someone began singing \"[[We Shall Overcome]]\", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with \"growing and intensive hostility\".<ref>Carter, pp. 147\u2013148.</ref> An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo.

She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes.

No print accounts of the riots by reliable sources cite Garland as a reason for the riot, although one sarcastic account by a heterosexual publication suggested it. (Carter, p. 260.) Although [[Sylvia Rivera]] recalls she was saddened and amazed by the turnout at Garland's funeral on Friday, June 27, she said that she did not feel like going out much but changed her mind later. (Duberman, pp. 190\u2013191.) Bob Kohler used to talk to the homeless youth in Sheridan Square, and said, \"When people talk about Judy Garland's death having anything much to do with the riot, that makes me crazy. The street kids faced death every day. They had nothing to lose. And they couldn't have cared less about Judy. We're talking about kids who were fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Judy Garland was the middle-aged darling of the middle-class gays. I get upset about this because it trivializes the whole thing.\" (Deitcher, p. 72.)</ref> Michael Fader explained,\n\n<blockquote>We all had a collective feeling like we'd had enough of this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free.

Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if he might have to use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt [[Charcoal lighter fluid|lighter fluid]] into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, [[siren (alarm)|sirens]] were heard and fire trucks arrived.

One officer's eye was cut, and a few others were bruised from being struck by flying debris. [[Bob Kohler]], who was walking his dog by the Stonewall that night, saw the TPF arrive: \"I had been in enough riots to know the fun was over... The cops were totally humiliated. This never, ever happened. They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because everybody else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced cops to retreat before, so the anger was just enormous. I mean, they wanted to kill.\"<ref>Carter, p. 175.</ref> With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, \"Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon.\" His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, \"All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously.\"<ref>Carter, p. 174.</ref>\n\nThe TPF formed a [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] and attempted to clear the streets by marching slowly and pushing the crowd back. The mob openly mocked the police.

Many people sat on stoops or gathered nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be \"electricity in the air\".<ref>Carter, p. 180.</ref> One commented: \"There was a certain beauty in the aftermath of the riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, this was our street.\"<ref>Carter, p. 181.</ref> Thirteen people had been arrested.

All three papers covered the riots; the ''Daily News'' placed coverage on the front page. News of the riot spread quickly throughout Greenwich Village, fueled by rumors that it had been organized by the [[Students for a Democratic Society]], the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], or triggered by \"a homosexual police officer whose roommate went dancing at the Stonewall against the officer's wishes\".<ref name=\"teal4\"/> All day Saturday, June 28, people came to stare at the burned and blackened Stonewall Inn. [[Graffiti]] appeared on the walls of the bar, declaring \"Drag power\", \"They invaded our rights\", \"Support gay power\", and \"Legalize gay bars\", along with accusations of police looting, and\u2014regarding the status of the bar\u2014\"We are open.\"<ref name=\"teal4\">Teal, p. 4.</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04EFDB1E3AEE34BC4850DFB0668382679EDE |title=Police Again Rout Village Youths: Outbreak by 400 Follows a Near-Riot Over Raid |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 30, 1969 |page=22}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nThe next night, rioting again surrounded Christopher Street; participants remember differently which night was more frantic or violent.

While walking home, he declared to Lucian Truscott, \"You know, the guys there were so beautiful\u2014they've lost that wounded look that fags all had 10&nbsp;years ago.\"<ref>Teal, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Leaflets, press coverage, and more violence===\nActivity in Greenwich Village was sporadic on Monday and Tuesday, partly due to rain. Police and Village residents had a few altercations, as both groups antagonized each other. [[Craig Rodwell]] and his partner [[Fred Sargeant]] took the opportunity the morning after the first riot to print and distribute 5,000 leaflets, one of them reading: \"Get the Mafia and the Cops out of Gay Bars.\" The leaflets called for gay people to own their own establishments, for a boycott of the Stonewall and other Mafia-owned bars, and for public pressure on the mayor's office to investigate the \"intolerable situation\".<ref>Duberman, p. 205.</ref><ref>Teal, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nNot everyone in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and many members of the Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. [[Randy Wicker]], who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the \"screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went against everything that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap.\"<ref>Duberman, p. 207.</ref> Others found the closing of the Stonewall Inn, termed a \"sleaze joint\", as advantageous to the Village.<ref>Duberman, p. 206.</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday, however, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ran reports of the riots, written by Howard Smith and Lucian Truscott, that included unflattering descriptions of the events and its participants: \"forces of faggotry\", \"limp wrists\", and \"Sunday fag follies\".<ref name=\"Truscott\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uuwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K4wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6710,4693&dq=stonewall+inn&hl=en|title=Gay Power Comes to Sheridan Square|last=Truscott|first=Lucian|date=July 3, 1969|work=The Village Voice|page=1|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref><ref group=note>Carter (p. 201) attributes the anger at ''The Village Voice'' reports to its focus on the effeminate behavior of the participants, with the exclusion of any kind of bravery.

Also in the mob of between 500 and 1,000 were other groups that had had unsuccessful confrontations with the police, and were curious how the police were defeated in this situation. Another explosive street battle took place, with injuries to demonstrators and police alike, looting in local shops, and arrests of five people.<ref>Duberman, pp. 208\u2013209.</ref><ref>Carter, pp. 203\u2013205.</ref> The incidents on Wednesday night lasted about an hour, and were summarized by one witness: \"The word is out. Christopher Street shall be liberated. The fags have had it with oppression.\"<ref>Carter, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nThe feeling of urgency spread throughout Greenwich Village, even to people who had not witnessed the riots. Many who were moved by the rebellion attended organizational meetings, sensing an opportunity to take action. On July 4, 1969, the Mattachine Society performed its annual picketing in front of [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]], called the [[Annual Reminder]]. Organizers [[Craig Rodwell]], [[Frank Kameny]], [[Randy Wicker]], [[Barbara Gittings]], and [[Kay Lahusen]], who had all participated for several years, took a bus along with other picketers from New York City to Philadelphia. Since 1965, the pickets had been very controlled: women wore skirts and men wore suits and ties, and all marched quietly in organized lines.<ref>Marcus, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref> This year Rodwell remembered feeling restricted by the rules Kameny had set. When two women spontaneously held hands, Kameny broke them apart, saying, \"None of that! None of that!\" Rodwell, however, convinced about ten couples to hold hands. The hand-holding couples made Kameny furious, but they earned more press attention than all of the previous marches.<ref name=\"carter216-217\">Carter, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref><ref name=\"duberman210\">Duberman, p. 210.</ref> Participant [[Lilli Vincenz]] remembered, \"It was clear that things were changing. People who had felt oppressed now felt empowered.\"<ref name=\"carter216-217\"/> Rodwell returned to New York City determined to change the established quiet, meek ways of trying to get attention. One of his first priorities was planning Christopher Street Liberation Day.<ref>Duberman, p. 211.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner.jpg|thumb|Gay rights demonstration in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]], including members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF). The GLF in the UK held its first meeting in a basement classroom at the [[London School of Economics]] on October 13, 1970. The organization was very informal, instituting marches and other activities, leading to the first British Gay Pride March in 1972.]]\n\n===Gay Liberation Front===\nAlthough the Mattachine Society had existed since the 1950s, many of their methods now seemed too mild for people who had witnessed or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, \"The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\">LaFrank, p. 17.</ref><ref group=note>\"Hairpin drop\" was [[gay slang]] that meant to drop hints about one's sexual orientation. (LaFrank, p. 17.)</ref> When a Mattachine officer suggested an \"amicable and sweet\" candlelight vigil demonstration, a man in the audience fumed and shouted, \"Sweet! ''Bullshit!'' That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play.\"<ref name=\"teal19\">Teal, p. 19.</ref> With a flyer announcing: \"Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? You Bet Your Sweet Ass We Are!\",<ref name=\"teal19\"/> the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use \"gay\" in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the [[Daughters of Bilitis]], and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.<ref>Clendinen, p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe rise of militancy became apparent to [[Frank Kameny]] and [[Barbara Gittings]]\u2014who had worked in homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles\u2014when they attended a GLF meeting to see the new group. A young GLF member demanded to know who they were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, \"I'm gay. That's why I'm here.\"<ref>Marcus, p. 136.</ref> The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|antiwar]] demonstrators with the ideal that they \"could work to restructure American society\".<ref>Duberman, p. 216.</ref> They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the [[New York Women's House of Detention|Women's House of Detention]] in support of [[Afeni Shakur]], and other radical [[New Left]] causes. Four months after the group formed, however, it disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.<ref>Carter, pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\n===Gay Activists Alliance===\nWithin six months of the Stonewall riots, activists started a citywide newspaper called ''Gay''; they considered it necessary because the most liberal publication in the city\u2014''The Village Voice''\u2014refused to print the word \"gay\" in GLF advertisements seeking new members and volunteers.<ref>Clendinen, p. 40.</ref> Two other newspapers were initiated within a six-week period: ''Come Out!'' and ''Gay Power''; the readership of these three periodicals quickly climbed to between 20,000 and 25,000.<ref name=\"carter242\">Carter, p. 242.</ref><ref>Duberman, p. 235.</ref>\n\nGLF members organized several same-sex dances, but GLF meetings were chaotic. When Bob Kohler asked for clothes and money to help the homeless youth who had participated in the riots, many of whom slept in Christopher Park or Sheridan Square, the response was a discussion on the downfall of [[capitalism]].<ref>Carter, p. 220.</ref> In late December 1969, several people who had visited GLF meetings and left out of frustration formed the [[Gay Activists Alliance]] (GAA). The GAA was to be entirely focused on gay issues, and more orderly. Their constitution started, \"We as liberated homosexual activists demand the freedom for expression of our dignity and value as human beings.\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 50\u201351.</ref> The GAA developed and perfected a confrontational tactic called a [[Zap (action)|zap]], where they would catch a politician off guard during a public relations opportunity, and force him or her to acknowledge gay and lesbian rights. City councilmen were zapped, and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] was zapped several times\u2014once on television when GAA members made up the majority of the audience.<ref>Carter, pp. 245\u2013246.</ref>\n\nRaids on gay bars did not stop after the Stonewall riots. In March 1970, Deputy Inspector Seymour Pine raided the Zodiac and 17 Barrow Street. An after-hours gay club with no liquor or occupancy licenses called The Snake Pit was soon raided, and 167&nbsp;people were arrested. One of them was [[Diego Vi\u00f1ales]], an Argentinian national so frightened that he might be [[Deportation|deported]] as a homosexual that he tried to escape the police precinct by jumping out of a two-story window, impaling himself on a {{convert|14|in|cm|adj=on}} spike fence.<ref>Carter, pp. 238\u2013239.</ref> ''The New York Daily News'' printed a graphic photo of the young man's impalement on the front page. GAA members organized a march from Christopher Park to the Sixth Precinct in which hundreds of gay men, lesbians, and liberal sympathizers peacefully confronted the TPF.<ref name=\"carter242\"/> They also sponsored a letter-writing campaign to Mayor Lindsay in which the Greenwich Village [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and Congressman [[Ed Koch]] sent pleas to end raids on gay bars in the city.<ref>Teal, pp. 106\u2013108.</ref>\n\nThe Stonewall Inn lasted only a few weeks after the riot. By October 1969 it was up for rent. Village residents surmised it was too notorious a location, and Rodwell's boycott discouraged business.<ref>Carter, p. 252.</ref>\n\n===Gay Pride===\n{{main|NYC Pride March#Origins}}\n\nChristopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street; with simultaneous Gay Pride marches in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Chicago]], these were the first [[Pride parade|Gay Pride marches]] in U.S. history.<ref>Duberman, pp. 278\u2013279.</ref><ref>De la Croix, Sukie (2007).

An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government.<ref>Cain, pp. 91\u201392.</ref> Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"<ref>Carter, p. 251.</ref>\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\">Clendinen, p. 25.</ref> The image of gay people retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\".<ref name=\"clendinen25\"/> Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"<ref>LaFrank, p. 21.</ref> David Carter, in his article \"What made Stonewall different\", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was the first to get major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carter |first1=David |title=What made Stonewall Different |journal=The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide |volume=16 |issue=4 |year=2009 |pages=11\u201313 |url=http://www.glreview.org/article/article-509/}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Unlikely community===\nWithin two years of the Stonewall riots there were gay rights groups in every major American city, as well as Canada, Australia, and Western Europe.<ref>Adam, p. 82.</ref> People who joined activist organizations after the riots had very little in common other than their [[Homosexuality|same-sex attraction]].

This was illustrated during the 1973 Stonewall rally when, moments after [[Barbara Gittings]] exuberantly praised the diversity of the crowd, feminist activist [[Jean O'Leary]] protested what she perceived as the mocking of women by [[cross-dressers]] and [[drag queen]]s in attendance. During a speech by O'Leary, in which she claimed that drag queens made fun of women for entertainment value and profit, [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Lee Brewster]] jumped on the stage and shouted \"You go to bars because of what drag queens did for you, and ''these bitches'' tell us to quit being ourselves!\"<ref>Clendinen, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> Both the drag queens and lesbian feminists in attendance left in disgust.<ref name=\"duberman236\">Duberman, p. 236.</ref>\n\nO'Leary also worked in the early 1970s to exclude transgender people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for transgender people would be too difficult to attain.<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [[Tarrytown, New York|upstate New York]],<ref name=RiveraWholeInterview95>{{cite video |url=https://vimeo.com/35975275|title=Randy Wicker Interviews Sylvia Rivera on the Pier|time=Repeatedly throughout interview}} September 21, 1995.

Accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: \"Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now.\"<ref name=\"duberman236\"/> \"It was horrible. How could I work to exclude transvestites and at the same time criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?\"<ref>Marcus, p. 156.</ref>\n\nO'Leary was referring to the [[Lavender Menace]], a description by [[Second-wave feminism|second wave feminist]] [[Betty Friedan]] for attempts by members of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as a haven for lesbians. As part of this process, [[Rita Mae Brown]] and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.<ref>Adam, pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[lesbian feminism]] in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused to work with gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men.<ref name=\"faderman211-212\">Faderman, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref> The issues most important to gay men\u2014[[entrapment]] and public solicitation\u2014were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized as an alternative to sharing gay men's issues, especially what [[Adrienne Rich]] termed \"the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars\".<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/> Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, explaining \"It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena.\"<ref name=\"faderman211-212\"/>\n\nThroughout the 1970s, gay activism had significant successes. One of the first and most important was the \"zap\" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). At a conference on [[behavior modification]], during a film demonstrating the use of [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] to decrease same-sex attraction, [[Morris Kight]] and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \"Torture!\" and \"Barbarism!\"<ref name=\"williams\">Williams & Retter, p. 121.</ref> They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them. Although 20&nbsp;psychiatrists in attendance left, the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining, trying to convince them that homosexual people were not mentally ill.<ref name=\"williams\"/> When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972, activists brought [[John E. Fryer]], a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask, because he felt his practice was in danger. In December 1973\u2014in large part due to the efforts of gay activists\u2014the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]''.<ref>Marcus, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Cain, p. 65.</ref>\n\nGay men and lesbians came together to work in [[grassroots]] political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named [[Save Our Children]] staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in [[Dade County, Florida]]. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the [[Briggs Initiative]], designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated.<ref>Cain, p. 275.</ref> Reaction to the influence of Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.<ref>Fejes, p. 214.</ref> The subsequent 1979 [[National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] was timed to coincide with the ten-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots.<ref name=\"Ghaziani\">Ghaziani, Amin. 2008. ''The Dividends of Dissent: How Conflict and Culture Work in Lesbian and Gay Marches on Washington''. The University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of prior gay subculture===\n\nThe Stonewall riots marked such a significant turning point that many aspects of prior [[LGBT culture|gay and lesbian culture]], such as bar culture formed from decades of shame and secrecy, were forcefully ignored and denied. Historian [[Martin Duberman]] writes, \"The decades preceding Stonewall... continue to be regarded by most gay men and lesbians as some vast neolithic wasteland.\"<ref>Duberman, p. xv.</ref> Sociologist [[Barry D. Adam|Barry Adam]] notes, \"Every social movement must choose at some point what to retain and what to reject out of its past. What traits are the results of oppression and what are healthy and authentic?\"<ref name=\"adam93\">Adam, p. 93.</ref> In conjunction with the growing feminist movement of the early 1970s, roles of [[butch and femme]] that developed in lesbian bars in the 1950s and 1960s were rejected, because as one writer put it: \"all role playing is sick.\"<ref>Adam, p. 94.</ref> Lesbian feminists considered the butch roles as archaic imitations of masculine behavior.<ref>Faderman, p. 232.</ref> Some women, according to [[Lillian Faderman]], were eager to shed the roles they felt forced into playing. The roles returned for some women in the 1980s, although they allowed for more flexibility than before Stonewall.<ref>Faderman, pp. 210, 266.</ref>\n\nAuthor Michael Bronski highlights the \"attack on pre-Stonewall culture\", particularly [[Gay male pulp fiction|gay pulp fiction]] for men, where the themes often reflected self-hatred or ambivalence about being gay. Many books ended unsatisfactorily and drastically, often with suicide, and writers portrayed their gay characters as alcoholics or deeply unhappy. These books, which he describes as \"an enormous and cohesive literature by and for gay men\",<ref>Bronski, p. 16.</ref> have not been reissued and are lost to later generations. Dismissing the reason simply as political correctness, Bronski writes, \"gay liberation was a youth movement whose sense of history was defined to a large degree by rejection of the past.\"<ref>Bronski, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===Lasting impact and recognition===\n[[File:Stonewall Inn New York 002.JPG|thumb|alt=A color photograph of the Stonewall taken recently, showing a smaller plate glass window in a portion of the 1969 building|The Stonewall, a bar in part of the building where the [[Stonewall Inn]] was located. The building and the surrounding streets have been declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].]]\n\nThe riots spawned from a bar raid became a literal example of gay men and lesbians fighting back, and a symbolic call to arms for many people. Historian David Carter remarks in his book about the Stonewall riots that the bar itself was a complex business that represented a community center, an opportunity for the Mafia to blackmail its own customers, a home, and a place of \"exploitation and degradation\".<ref>Carter, p. 264.</ref> The true legacy of the Stonewall riots, Carter insists, is the \"ongoing struggle for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality\".<ref>Carter, p. 266.</ref> Historian Nicholas Edsall writes,\n\n<blockquote>Stonewall has been compared to any number of acts of radical protest and defiance in American history from the Boston Tea Party on. But the best and certainly a more nearly contemporary analogy is with Rosa Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1955, which sparked the modern civil rights movement. Within months after Stonewall radical gay liberation groups and newsletters sprang up in cities and on college campuses across America and then across all of northern Europe as well.<ref>Edsall, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBefore the rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and [[Adam Nagourney]] write,\n\n<blockquote>a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, they had an advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night the lives of millions of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.<ref>Clendinen, p. 12.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHistorian [[Lillian Faderman]] calls the riots the \"shot heard round the world\", explaining, \"The Stonewall Rebellion was crucial because it sounded the rally for that movement. It became an emblem of gay and lesbian power. By calling on the dramatic tactic of violent protest that was being used by other oppressed groups, the events at the Stonewall implied that homosexuals had as much reason to be disaffected as they.\"<ref>Faderman, p. 195.</ref>\n[[File:Stonewall Inn raid sign pride weekend 2016.jpg|thumb|left|The sign left by police following the raid is now on display just inside the entrance]]\n\n[[Joan Nestle]] co-founded the [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]] in 1974, and credits \"its creation to that night and the courage that found its voice in the streets.\"<ref name=\"lafrank17\"/> Cautious, however, not to attribute the start of gay activism to the Stonewall riots, Nestle writes,\n\n<blockquote>I certainly don't see gay and lesbian history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that it all started with Stonewall.<ref>Deitcher, p. 74.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe events of the early morning of June 28, 1969 were not the first instances of gay men and lesbians fighting back against police in New York City and elsewhere. Not only had the Mattachine Society been active in major cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago, but similarly marginalized people started the riot at Compton's Cafeteria in 1966, and another riot responded to a raid on Los Angeles' [[Black Cat Tavern]] in 1967.<ref>Witt ''et al.'', p. 210</ref> However, several circumstances were in place that made the Stonewall riots memorable. The location of the [[Lower Manhattan]] raid was a factor: it was across the street from ''[[The Village Voice]]'' offices, and the narrow crooked streets gave the rioters advantage over the police.<ref name=\"armstrong\">Armstrong, Elizabeth&nbsp;A., Crage, Suzanna&nbsp;M.

The most significant facet of the Stonewall riots, however, was the commemoration of them in Christopher Street Liberation Day, which grew into the annual [[Gay Pride]] events around the world.<ref name=\"armstrong\"/>\n\n[[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]] (officially Stonewall Equality Limited) is an [[LGBT rights]] charity in the United Kingdom, founded in 1989, and named after the [[Stonewall Inn]] because of the Stonewall riots.
