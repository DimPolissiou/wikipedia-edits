O. Wilson]] has characterised parasites as \"predators that eat prey in units of less than one\".<ref name=Wilson2014/> Parasites include [[protozoa]]ns such as the agents of [[malaria]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and [[amoebiasis|amoebic dysentery]]; animals such as [[hookworm]]s, [[lice]], [[mosquito]]es, and [[vampire bat]]s; [[fungi]] such as [[Armillaria mellea|honey fungus]] and the agents of [[ringworm]]; and plants such as [[mistletoe]], [[dodder]], and the [[Orobanchaceae|broomrapes]]. There are six major parasitic [[Behavioral ecology#Evolutionarily stable strategy|strategies]] of exploitation of animal hosts, namely [[parasitic castration]], directly transmitted parasitism (by contact), [[wikt:trophic|trophically]] transmitted parasitism (by being eaten), [[vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-transmitted parasitism, [[parasitoid]]ism, and micropredation.\n\nLike predation, parasitism is a type of [[Consumer-Resource Systems|consumer-resource interaction]],<ref name=\"pmid21199247\">{{cite journal | last=Getz |first=W.

Parasites of animals are highly [[Generalist and specialist species|specialised]], and [[reproduction|reproduce]] at a faster rate than their hosts. Classic examples include interactions between [[vertebrate]] hosts and [[Cestoda|tapeworms]], [[Trematoda|flukes]], the malaria-causing ''[[Plasmodium]]'' species, and [[Siphonaptera|fleas]].\n\nParasites suck reduce host [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] by general or specialised [[pathology]], from parasitic castration to modification of host behaviour. Parasites increase their own fitness by exploiting hosts for resources necessary for their survival, in particular by feeding on them and by using intermediate (secondary) hosts to assist in their [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission]] from one definitive (primary) suck host to another. Although parasitism is often unambiguous, it is part of a spectrum of interactions between [[species]], grading via parasitoidism into predation, through evolution into [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], and in some fungi, shading into being [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytic]].\n\nPeople have known about parasites such as [[nematode|roundworms]] and tapeworms since [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In [[Early Modern]] times, [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] observed ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' in his microscope in 1681, while [[Francesco Redi]] described internal and external parasites including [[sheep liver fluke]] and [[tick]]s. Modern [[parasitology]] developed in the 19th century. In human culture, parasitism has negative connotations. These were exploited to [[satire|satirical]] effect in [[Jonathan Swift]]'s 1733 poem \"On Poetry: A Rhapsody\", comparing poets to [[hyperparasitical]] \"vermin\". In fiction, [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 [[Gothic fiction|Gothic horror]] novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and its many later adaptations featured a [[hematophagy|blood-drinking]] parasite. [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' was one of many works of [[science fiction]] to feature a terrifying<ref name=Guardian2009/> parasitic alien species.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nFirst used in English in 1539, the word ''parasite'' comes from the [[Old French|Medieval French]] ''parasite'', from the [[Latin]] ''parasitus'', the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2'' (''parasitos''), \"one who eats at the table of another\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2Fsitos \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and that from ''\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac'' (''para''), \"beside, by\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2F \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> + ''\u03c3\u1fd6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2'' (''sitos''), \"wheat\", hence \"food\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsi%3Dtos \u03c3\u1fd6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> The related term ''parasitism'' appears in English from 1611.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsitismo%2Fs \u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Ectoparasite|Endoparasite|Macroparasite|Microparasite}}\n\n==Evolutionary strategies==\n{{see also|Parasitology}}\n\n{{anchor|Endoparasite}}{{anchor|Ectoparasite}}{{anchor|Semiparasite}}\n\n===Basic concepts===\n{{further|Parasitic life cycle}}\n[[File:Taenia solium tapeworm scolex with its four suckers and two rows of hooks 5262 lores.jpg|thumb|Head (scolex) of [[tapeworm]] ''[[Taenia solium]]'', an [[intestinal parasite]], has hooks and [[sucker (zoology)|suckers]] to attach to its [[host (biology)|host]].]]\n\nParasitism is a kind of [[symbiosis]], a close and persistent long-term biological interaction between a parasite and its host. Unlike [[saprotroph]]s, parasites feed on living hosts, though some parasitic fungi, for instance, may continue to feed on hosts they have killed. Unlike [[commensalism]] and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], the parasitic relationship harms the host, either feeding on it or, as in the case of intestinal parasites, consuming some of its food. Because parasites interact with other species, they can readily act as [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of pathogens, causing [[parasitic disease|disease]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Overview of Parasitology |url=http://parasite.org.au/para-site/introduction/introduction-essay.html |publisher=Australian Society of Parasitology and Australian Research Council/National Health and Medical Research Council) Research Network for Parasitology |date=July 2010 |isbn=978-1-8649999-1-4 | quote=Parasitism is a form of symbiosis, an intimate relationship between two different species.

Although parasitism is often unambiguous, it is part of a spectrum of interactions between [[species]], grading via parasitoidism into predation, through evolution into [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], and in some fungi, shading into being [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytic]].\n\nPeople have known about parasites such as [[nematode|roundworms]] and tapeworms since [[ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. In [[Early Modern]] times, [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] observed ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'' in his microscope in 1681, while [[Francesco Redi]] described internal and external parasites including [[sheep liver fluke]] and [[tick]]s. Modern [[parasitology]] developed in the 19th century. In human culture, parasitism has negative connotations. These were exploited to [[satire|satirical]] effect in [[Jonathan Swift]]'s 1733 poem \"On Poetry: A Rhapsody\", comparing poets to [[hyperparasitical]] \"vermin\". In fiction, [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 [[Gothic fiction|Gothic horror]] novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and its many later adaptations featured a [[hematophagy|blood-drinking]] parasite. [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' was one of many works of [[science fiction]] to feature a terrifying<ref name=Guardian2009/> parasitic alien species.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nFirst used in English in 1539, the word ''parasite'' comes from the [[Old French|Medieval French]] ''parasite'', from the [[Latin]] ''parasitus'', the [[Latinisation (literature)|latinisation]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2'' (''parasitos''), \"one who eats at the table of another\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2Fsitos \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> and that from ''\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac'' (''para''), \"beside, by\"<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpara%2F \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> + ''\u03c3\u1fd6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2'' (''sitos''), \"wheat\", hence \"food\".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsi%3Dtos \u03c3\u1fd6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref> The related term ''parasitism'' appears in English from 1611.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsitismo%2Fs \u03c3\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2], Liddell, Henry George; Scott, Robert, ''A Greek\u2013English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Ectoparasite|Endoparasite|Macroparasite|Microparasite}}\n\n==Evolutionary strategies==\n{{see also|Parasitology}}\n\n{{anchor|Endoparasite}}{{anchor|Ectoparasite}}{{anchor|Semiparasite}}\n\n===Basic concepts===\n{{further|Parasitic life cycle}}\n[[File:Taenia solium tapeworm scolex with its four suckers and two rows of hooks 5262 lores.jpg|thumb|Head (scolex) of [[tapeworm]] ''[[Taenia solium]]'', an [[intestinal parasite]], has hooks and [[sucker (zoology)|suckers]] to attach to its [[host (biology)|host]].]]\n\nParasitism is a kind of [[symbiosis]], a close and persistent long-term biological interaction between a parasite and its host. Unlike [[saprotroph]]s, parasites feed on living hosts, though some parasitic fungi, for instance, may continue to feed on hosts they have killed. Unlike [[commensalism]] and [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], the parasitic relationship harms the host, either feeding on it or, as in the case of intestinal parasites, consuming some of its food.

The fact that flamingos share parasites with ducks and geese was initially taken as evidence that these groups were more closely related to each other than either is to storks.

The technical languages of ecology and parasitology sometimes involved different meanings for the same words.

This was the first protozoan parasite of humans to be seen under a microscope.<ref name=Cox2004/> A few years later, in 1687, the Italian biologists [[Giovanni Cosimo Bonomo]] and [[Diacinto Cestoni]] described [[scabies]] as caused by the parasitic mite ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'', marking it as the first disease of humans with a known microscopic causative agent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pacs.unica.it/biblio/lesson5.htm |title=Acarus as the cause of scabies |publisher=University of Cagliari |accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ross, 20.Aug.1897.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ronald Ross]] won the 1902 [[Nobel Prize]] for showing that the [[malaria parasite]] is transmitted by mosquitoes.

[[James Paget]] discovered the intestinal nematode ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' in humans in 1835. James McConnell described the human liver fluke, ''[[Clonorchis sinensis]]'', in 1875.<ref name=Cox2004/> [[Algernon Thomas]] and [[Rudolf Leuckart]] independently made the first discovery of the life cycle of a trematode, the sheep liver fluke, by experiment in 1881\u20131883.<ref name=ChengHistory/> In 1877 [[Patrick Manson]] discovered the life cycle of the [[filarioidea|filarial worms]], that cause [[lymphatic filariasis|elephantiatis]] transmitted by mosquitoes. Manson further predicted that the [[malaria]] parasite, ''[[Plasmodium]]'', had a mosquito vector, and persuaded [[Ronald Ross]] to investigate. Ross confirmed that the prediction was correct in 1897\u20131898. At the same time, [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]] and others described the malaria parasite's life cycle stages in ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes.

Various methods of [[malaria prophylaxis]] have been tried including the use of [[antimalarial drug]]s to kill off the parasites in the blood, the eradication of its mosquito vectors with [[insecticide|organochlorine and other insecticides]], and the development of a [[malaria vaccine]].

The outcomes depend on whether the drugs decrease the chance of a helminth larva reaching adulthood. If so, natural selection can be expected to favour the production of eggs at an earlier age. If on the other hand the drugs mainly affects adult parasitic worms, selection could cause delayed maturity and increased [[virulence]]. Such changes appear to be under way: the nematode ''[[Teladorsagia circumcincta]]'' is changing its adult size and [[fecundity|reproductive rate]] in response to drugs.{{sfn|Poulin|2007|pages=265\u2013266}}\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[File:THE CRINOLETTA DISFIGURANS AnOldParasite in aNewForm.png|thumb|upright|\"An Old Parasite in a New Form\": an 1881 ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon by [[Edward Linley Sambourne]] compares a [[crinoline|crinoletta]] [[bustle]] to a parasitic insect's [[exoskeleton]]]]\n\n===Classical times===\n\nIn the [[classical era]], the concept of the parasite was not strictly pejorative: the ''parasitus'' was an [[patronage in ancient Rome|accepted role in Roman society]], in which a person could live off the hospitality of others, in return for \"flattery, simple services, and a willingness to endure humiliation\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Matyszak |first=Philip |title=24 Hours in Ancient Rome: A Day in the Life of the People Who Lived There |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJY4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT252 |year=2017 |publisher=Michael O'Mara |isbn=978-1-78243-857-1 |page=252}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Damon | first1=Cynthia | chapter=5 | title=The Mask of the Parasite: A Pathology of Roman Patronage| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEJ-aA_XQQQC | publisher=University of Michigan Press | year=1997 | page=148 | isbn=978-0472107605 | quote=A satirist seeking to portray client misery naturally focuses on the relationship with the greatest dependency, that in which a client gets his food from his patron, and for this the prefabricated persona of the parasite proved itself extremely useful.}}</ref>\n\n===Society===\n{{further|Parasitism (social offense)}}\n\nParasitism has [[Parasitism (social offense)|a derogatory sense]] in popular usage.

It was written by [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]], who developed the series with [[Kathy Burke]].\n\nThe title from the show stems from both the main characters' continual search for a male partner, and the theme music is a cover of [[ABBA]]'s \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\". The first two series were originally shown on [[BBC Two]] and were deemed successful enough for the third series to be shown on [[BBC One]]. The show is loosely based on [[Mike Leigh]]'s play [[Abigail's Party]].\n\nThe series is repeated on UK television channel [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]].\n\n==Premise==\n''Gimme Gimme Gimme'' centres around loudmouthed [[London]]er [[Linda La Hughes]] (played by [[comedian]] and [[television director|director]] [[Kathy Burke]]) and her [[homosexual|gay]] flatmate, [[actor]] [[Tom Farrell (Gimme Gimme Gimme)|Tom Farrell]] (played by [[James Dreyfus]]). A modern twist on the traditional \"odd couple\" format, much of ''Gimme Gimme Gimme's'' humour springs from its lubricious [[innuendo]] subplot, which comes from the mouths of both Tom and Linda.\n\nLinda is characterised by her red [[permanent wave|perm]], white glasses, and plump, [[lycra]]-clad figure. Boorish, unattractive Linda is convinced she is a \"stunner\"; in series three she is finally diagnosed with reversed [[body dysmorphic disorder]]. It is suggested that Linda and Tom first met at a nightclub, bonded instantly (due to both being on [[MDMA|ecstasy]]), and decided to live together. What follows is, as writer Jonathan Harvey describes, \"one long comedown\". Linda often tells humorous [[anecdotes]] about her family and childhood which suggest abuse or neglect (such as how she apparently slept on a doormat as a baby, lived in a kennel as a child, and was left in a car-boot for the two weeks her aunt went on holiday), but she always thinks of these as positive experiences. She also claims that her Daddy now lives in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], although the only proof she has is a photo of a sideboard. Linda also lived in a [[convent]] and a [[borstal]] as a teenager. She has crushes on [[Liam Gallagher]] (in whom she lost interest after series one as she \"couldn't bring up another bird's child\"), [[Robbie Williams]], and both male members of [[Hear'Say]]. She also imagines having sex with [[Dale Winton]] in a toilet cubicle.\n\nTom is melodramatic yet fails in his desire to get acting roles. He believes himself to be truly gifted in the art of acting, and often blames his failures on his agent or society itself. He did appear in one episode of ''[[EastEnders]]'' and often brags about it, delaying for as long as he can the fact that he was in one scene, had one line, and did nothing but buy a [[wikt:cagoule|cagoule]] from [[Bianca Jackson]]'s market stall. He also appeared in ''Daylight Robbery'' as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]], standing in a queue in the background. He had one line but it was cut due to timekeeping. He insists that the entire series was ruined due to the axing of his line. Tom has an obsession with appearing to be [[middle-class]] even though he hails from a working-class background, possibly because he also hates his parents. It is often suggested that Tom has no friends whatsoever (apart from Linda and his housemates) but unlike Linda he usually tries to pretend he is popular. Tom is in love with the actor [[Simon Shepherd]].\n\nAlthough they appear to loathe each other, Tom and Linda are beholden to each other due to the simple fact that nobody else can tolerate them. They are in many ways alike: selfish, unsuccessful, and physically and personally unattractive - although Tom less so. The hapless duo live in a [[Kentish Town]] [[Apartment|flat]] (69 Paradise Passage, Kentish Town) rented from elderly ex-[[prostitute]] Beryl Merit ([[Rosalind Knight]]). Other regular characters are the middle-class, horny married couple Jez ([[Brian Bovell]]) and Suze ([[Beth Goddard]]). Many of the storylines revolve around the fact that Tom and Linda find Jez sexually attractive and (particularly Linda) despise the oblivious Suze. Another recurring character is Sugar Walls ([[Elaine Lordan]]), Linda's celebrity sister. Many of the other characters can be just as hapless as Tom and Linda; Beryl still engages in sexual activities such as [[sadomasochism|S&M]] and picking up young and married men, while Jez and Suze generally lack common sense. For example, they once cancelled their holiday to the [[Algarve]] and paid \u00a3500 to stay in their own back garden after Linda opened it up as a campsite.\n\n[[Simon Shepherd]], [[Su Pollard]], [[Charlie Condou]], and [[Rose Keegan]] have made guest appearances. Su Pollard played a character called Heidi Honeycombe; when she appeared, Linda greeted her with \"Heidi! Hi!\" (a reference to Pollard's character in the sitcom ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]'').\n\nAt the end of series three, Tom finally got his big break in TV [[soap opera]] ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]''. The last episode ended with Tom leaving the flat and Linda taking off her hair (revealing it to be a wig) and sitting in the flat alone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathy Burke]] as Linda La Hughes (19 episodes)\n* [[James Dreyfus]] as Tom Farrell (19 episodes)\n* [[Beth Goddard]] as Suze Littlewood (14 episodes)\n* [[Brian Bovell]] as Jez Littlewood (13 episodes)\n* [[Rosalind Knight]] as Beryl Merit (13 episodes)\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Regular ===\n'''Linda La Hughes''' \u2013 Linda is an unattractive middle-aged woman who usually wears skin tight, colourful clothing. Linda grabs any opportunity to bluntly flirt with any man she sees. She is delusional about her appearance; in the Series 3 episode \"Trauma,\" she's finally diagnosed with reversed body dysmorphic disorder. Her age is uncertain as she has announced different ages through the three series e.g. 16, 18, 19, 23 and 28. In the Series 2 episode \"Dirty Thirty\", her birth certificate reveals that she is 39 \u2013 but in the Series 3 episode \"Secrets and Flies\" she is unexpectedly reunited with her 28-year-old son; she says she was 15 when she gave birth to him, meaning she must be 43. Linda has a large family consisting of a son named Zippy, two cousins, Simon who has a wonky eye, Velma who works in Soho who has an act called \"Snatch and Ladders\", two aunties, Nitty and Ivy, an uncle called Tyrone and a sister called Sharon Hughes who changed her name to Sugar Walls. Her Mother, called \"Queenie\" (and oddly referred to in one episode as \"Dolly\") died when Linda was a child but there is some uncertainty as to the cause; Linda tells Tom's mum that she collapsed in a paddling pool in Pinner, but her sister Sugar Walls states that she electrocuted herself on her own Slendertone pads. Her Daddy hides from her, although she thinks he's in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], but he does send her Christmas Presents. When Linda is asked what her father's name is by her son Zippy, she replies \"Daddy\".\n\n'''Thomas Thessalonius \"Tom\" Farrell''' \u2013 Tom is a 30-year-old wannabe (but bad) actor who has only had small roles on TV and on stage. Tom is openly gay and seizes every possible opportunity to get a boyfriend. Throughout Series 1, he often refers to using drugs once at home when he mistook a sleeping tablet for an E, the other when reading what \"middle class\" people should do \"the middle class person will not go to sleazy night club and get off his tits on ecstasy\" He also tends to exaggerate a lot. Series 3 concludes with him moving to [[Nottingham]] to join the cast of ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]''.\n\n'''Beryl Merit''' \u2013 Beryl is the elderly landlady of 69 Paradise Passage. She is a retired prostitute but stays involved in criminal activities such as shoplifting and bootlegging; in the Series 2 episode \"Glad to be Gay?\" she's seen to be an escort. Her best friend is Reenie, a fellow former prostitute whom she often mentions and is seen chatting to on the phone, but who [[Unseen character|never appears]].\n\n'''Jez Littlewood''' \u2013 Jez is Tom and Linda's hunky [[middle-class]] neighbour. When Tom and Linda first meet Jez, they think one of them has slept with him, but actually he had just slept on the sofa. Both Tom and Linda constantly lust after him; whilst Tom tends to be subtle about his feelings, Linda boorishly propositions Jez at every opportunity \u2013 even in Suze's presence. However, Jez is devoted to his wife.\n\n'''Suze Littlewood''' \u2013 Suze is Jez's ditzy wife. She can sometimes be nice but on other occasions she can be hyperactive and rather irritating, unintentionally coming off as a burden. Tom and Linda loathe Suze for standing in the way of their pursuit of Jez. Linda, especially, showers her with vicious insults, most of which go way over her head. She and Jez have a voracious \u2013 often vociferous \u2013 sex life. In the Series 3 episode \"Secrets and Flies\" (featuring Linda's own long-lost son), she gives birth to their baby boy, Lee-on-Solent \"Lee\" Littlewood. Suze has also stated that she is a \"committed vegetarian\", with a liking for spinach pie and [[quorn]] placenta.\n\n=== Recurring ===\n'''Norma''' \u2013 Norma is Tom's agent and appears throughout all three of the series.\n\n'''Sugar Walls''' \u2013 Sugar (birthname Sharon Hughes) is Linda's famous sister. She is a model, but is more famous for her promiscuity than her modelling career. She appears once in series 1 and again in series 2.\n\n'''Simon Shepherd''' \u2013 Simon is Tom's celebrity crush. Simon is famous for starring in ''[[Peak Practice]]''. He appears in every series.\n\n== Production ==\nThe series was filmed in front of a live studio audience in Studio 2 at [[The London Studios]], South Bank, [[London]]\n\nWriter Jonathan Harvey appeared in three episodes; as a guest at the series 1 wedding, once as make-up artist Louis, and then as a customer in a sofa store.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Gimme Gimme Gimme episodes}}\n\n''Gimme Gimme Gimme'' has broadcast three series and 19 episodes in total. The first series premiered on BBC Two on 8 January 1999 and lasted for six episodes, concluding on 12 February 1999. Following this, a Millennium special was screened at the end of the year on 29 December 1999. A second series commenced on 14 January 2000 and finished on 18 February 2000, again including six episodes. A short sketch included as part of Comic Relief was broadcast on 16 March 2001. Due to the high viewing figures and success the show received, it was moved to BBC One for a six-episode third series which was the last. Each episode was written by Jonathan Harvey and directed by [[Liddy Oldroyd]] for the first two series and the special; the third series was directed by Tristram Shapeero.\n\n==Ratings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"80\"|Series !! width=\"180\"|Episode !! width=\"190\"|Viewers\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" | <center>1</center> || <center>1</center> || <center>6,550,000</center>\n|-\n| <center>2</center> || <center>6,290,000</center>\n|-\n| <center>3</center> || <center>5,950,000</center>\n|-\n| <center>4</center> || <center>6,100,000</center>\n|-\n| <center>5</center> || <center>5,840,000</center>\n|- \n| <center>6</center> || <center>5,350,000</center>\n|-\n!

It was written by [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]], who developed the series with [[Kathy Burke]].\n\nThe title from the show stems from both the main characters' continual search for a male partner, and the theme music is a cover of [[ABBA]]'s \"[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]\". The first two series were originally shown on [[BBC Two]] and were deemed successful enough for the third series to be shown on [[BBC One]]. The show is loosely based on [[Mike Leigh]]'s play [[Abigail's Party]].\n\nThe series is repeated on UK television channel [[Gold (UK TV channel)|Gold]].\n\n==Premise==\n''Gimme Gimme Gimme'' centres around loudmouthed [[London]]er [[Linda La Hughes]] (played by [[comedian]] and [[television director|director]] [[Kathy Burke]]) and her [[homosexual|gay]] flatmate, [[actor]] [[Tom Farrell (Gimme Gimme Gimme)|Tom Farrell]] (played by [[James Dreyfus]]). A modern twist on the traditional \"odd couple\" format, much of ''Gimme Gimme Gimme's'' humour springs from its lubricious [[innuendo]] subplot, which comes from the mouths of both Tom and Linda.\n\nLinda is characterised by her red [[permanent wave|perm]], white glasses, and plump, [[lycra]]-clad figure. Boorish, unattractive Linda is convinced she is a \"stunner\"; in series three she is finally diagnosed with reversed [[body dysmorphic disorder]]. It is suggested that Linda and Tom first met at a nightclub, bonded instantly (due to both being on [[MDMA|ecstasy]]), and decided to live together. What follows is, as writer Jonathan Harvey describes, \"one long comedown\". Linda often tells humorous [[anecdotes]] about her family and childhood which suggest abuse or neglect (such as how she apparently slept on a doormat as a baby, lived in a kennel as a child, and was left in a car-boot for the two weeks her aunt went on holiday), but she always thinks of these as positive experiences. She also claims that her Daddy now lives in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], although the only proof she has is a photo of a sideboard. Linda also lived in a [[convent]] and a [[borstal]] as a teenager. She has crushes on [[Liam Gallagher]] (in whom she lost interest after series one as she \"couldn't bring up another bird's child\"), [[Robbie Williams]], and both male members of [[Hear'Say]]. She also imagines having sex with [[Dale Winton]] in a toilet cubicle.\n\nTom is melodramatic yet fails in his desire to get acting roles. He believes himself to be truly gifted in the art of acting, and often blames his failures on his agent or society itself. He did appear in one episode of ''[[EastEnders]]'' and often brags about it, delaying for as long as he can the fact that he was in one scene, had one line, and did nothing but buy a [[wikt:cagoule|cagoule]] from [[Bianca Jackson]]'s market stall. He also appeared in ''Daylight Robbery'' as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]], standing in a queue in the background. He had one line but it was cut due to timekeeping. He insists that the entire series was ruined due to the axing of his line. Tom has an obsession with appearing to be [[middle-class]] even though he hails from a working-class background, possibly because he also hates his parents. It is often suggested that Tom has no friends whatsoever (apart from Linda and his housemates) but unlike Linda he usually tries to pretend he is popular. Tom is in love with the actor [[Simon Shepherd]].\n\nAlthough they appear to loathe each other, Tom and Linda are beholden to each other due to the simple fact that nobody else can tolerate them. They are in many ways alike: selfish, unsuccessful, and physically and personally unattractive - although Tom less so. The hapless duo live in a [[Kentish Town]] [[Apartment|flat]] (69 Paradise Passage, Kentish Town) rented from elderly ex-[[prostitute]] Beryl Merit ([[Rosalind Knight]]). Other regular characters are the middle-class, horny married couple Jez ([[Brian Bovell]]) and Suze ([[Beth Goddard]]). Many of the storylines revolve around the fact that Tom and Linda find Jez sexually attractive and (particularly Linda) despise the oblivious Suze. Another recurring character is Sugar Walls ([[Elaine Lordan]]), Linda's celebrity sister. Many of the other characters can be just as hapless as Tom and Linda; Beryl still engages in sexual activities such as [[sadomasochism|S&M]] and picking up young and married men, while Jez and Suze generally lack common sense. For example, they once cancelled their holiday to the [[Algarve]] and paid \u00a3500 to stay in their own back garden after Linda opened it up as a campsite.\n\n[[Simon Shepherd]], [[Su Pollard]], [[Charlie Condou]], and [[Rose Keegan]] have made guest appearances. Su Pollard played a character called Heidi Honeycombe; when she appeared, Linda greeted her with \"Heidi! Hi!\" (a reference to Pollard's character in the sitcom ''[[Hi-de-Hi!]]'').\n\nAt the end of series three, Tom finally got his big break in TV [[soap opera]] ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]''. The last episode ended with Tom leaving the flat and Linda taking off her hair (revealing it to be a wig) and sitting in the flat alone.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kathy Burke]] as Linda La Hughes (19 episodes)\n* [[James Dreyfus]] as Tom Farrell (19 episodes)\n* [[Beth Goddard]] as Suze Littlewood (14 episodes)\n* [[Brian Bovell]] as Jez Littlewood (13 episodes)\n* [[Rosalind Knight]] as Beryl Merit (13 episodes)\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Regular ===\n'''Linda La Hughes''' \u2013 Linda is an unattractive middle-aged woman who usually wears skin tight, colourful clothing. Linda grabs any opportunity to bluntly flirt with any man she sees. She is delusional about her appearance; in the Series 3 episode \"Trauma,\" she's finally diagnosed with reversed body dysmorphic disorder. Her age is uncertain as she has announced different ages through the three series e.g. 16, 18, 19, 23 and 28. In the Series 2 episode \"Dirty Thirty\", her birth certificate reveals that she is 39 \u2013 but in the Series 3 episode \"Secrets and Flies\" she is unexpectedly reunited with her 28-year-old son; she says she was 15 when she gave birth to him, meaning she must be 43. Linda has a large family consisting of a son named Zippy, two cousins, Simon who has a wonky eye, Velma who works in Soho who has an act called \"Snatch and Ladders\", two aunties, Nitty and Ivy, an uncle called Tyrone and a sister called Sharon Hughes who changed her name to Sugar Walls. Her Mother, called \"Queenie\" (and oddly referred to in one episode as \"Dolly\") died when Linda was a child but there is some uncertainty as to the cause; Linda tells Tom's mum that she collapsed in a paddling pool in Pinner, but her sister Sugar Walls states that she electrocuted herself on her own Slendertone pads. Her Daddy hides from her, although she thinks he's in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]], but he does send her Christmas Presents. When Linda is asked what her father's name is by her son Zippy, she replies \"Daddy\".\n\n'''Thomas Thessalonius \"Tom\" Farrell''' \u2013 Tom is a 30-year-old wannabe (but bad) actor who has only had small roles on TV and on stage. Tom is openly gay and seizes every possible opportunity to get a boyfriend. Throughout Series 1, he often refers to using drugs once at home when he mistook a sleeping tablet for an E, the other when reading what \"middle class\" people should do \"the middle class person will not go to sleazy night club and get off his tits on ecstasy\" He also tends to exaggerate a lot. Series 3 concludes with him moving to [[Nottingham]] to join the cast of ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]''.\n\n'''Beryl Merit''' \u2013 Beryl is the elderly landlady of 69 Paradise Passage. She is a retired prostitute but stays involved in criminal activities such as shoplifting and bootlegging; in the Series 2 episode \"Glad to be Gay?\" she's seen to be an escort. Her best friend is Reenie, a fellow former prostitute whom she often mentions and is seen chatting to on the phone, but who [[Unseen character|never appears]].\n\n'''Jez Littlewood''' \u2013 Jez is Tom and Linda's hunky [[middle-class]] neighbour. When Tom and Linda first meet Jez, they think one of them has slept with him, but actually he had just slept on the sofa. Both Tom and Linda constantly lust after him; whilst Tom tends to be subtle about his feelings, Linda boorishly propositions Jez at every opportunity \u2013 even in Suze's presence. However, Jez is devoted to his wife.\n\n'''Suze Littlewood''' \u2013 Suze is Jez's ditzy wife. She can sometimes be nice but on other occasions she can be hyperactive and rather irritating, unintentionally coming off as a burden. Tom and Linda loathe Suze for standing in the way of their pursuit of Jez. Linda, especially, showers her with vicious insults, most of which go way over her head. She and Jez have a voracious \u2013 often vociferous \u2013 sex life. In the Series 3 episode \"Secrets and Flies\" (featuring Linda's own long-lost son), she gives birth to their baby boy, Lee-on-Solent \"Lee\" Littlewood. Suze has also stated that she is a \"committed vegetarian\", with a liking for spinach pie and [[quorn]] placenta.\n\n=== Recurring ===\n'''Norma''' \u2013 Norma is Tom's agent and appears throughout all three of the series.\n\n'''Sugar Walls''' \u2013 Sugar ('''birthname''' Sharon Hughes) is Linda's famous sister. She is a model, but is more famous for her promiscuity than her modelling career. She appears once in series 1 and again in series 2.\n\n'''Simon Shepherd''' \u2013 Simon is Tom's celebrity crush. Simon is famous for starring in ''[[Peak Practice]]''. He appears in every series.\n\n== Production ==\nThe series was filmed in front of a live studio audience in Studio 2 at [[The London Studios]], South Bank, [[London]]\n\nWriter Jonathan Harvey appeared in three episodes; as a guest at the series 1 wedding, once as make-up artist Louis, and then as a customer in a sofa store.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Gimme Gimme Gimme episodes}}\n\n''Gimme Gimme Gimme'' has broadcast three series and 19 episodes in total. The first series premiered on BBC Two on 8 January 1999 and lasted for six episodes, concluding on 12 February 1999. Following this, a Millennium special was screened at the end of the year on 29 December 1999. A second series commenced on 14 January 2000 and finished on 18 February 2000, again including six episodes. A short sketch included as part of Comic Relief was broadcast on 16 March 2001. Due to the high viewing figures and success the show received, it was moved to BBC One for a six-episode third series which was the last. Each episode was written by Jonathan Harvey and directed by [[Liddy Oldroyd]] for the first two series and the special; the third series was directed by Tristram Shapeero.\n\n==Ratings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"80\"|Series !! width=\"180\"|Episode !! width=\"190\"|Viewers\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\" | <center>1</center> || <center>1</center> || <center>6,550,000</center>\n|-\n| <center>2</center> || <center>6,290,000</center>\n|-\n| <center>3</center> || <center>5,950,000</center>\n|-\n| <center>4</center> || <center>6,100,000</center>\n|-\n| <center>5</center> || <center>5,840,000</center>\n|- \n| <center>6</center> || <center>5,350,000</center>\n|-\n!

It is one of the band's fastest and most guitar-orientated singles. The song was released in August 2001 as the first single from their seventh album ''[[Get Ready (New Order album)|Get Ready]]''. It entered the [[UK Singles Charts]] at number eight, attracting considerable attention and critical praise as the band's comeback single, their first since 1993. The song also found moderate success internationally, peaking at number three in [[Canada]], number seven in Finland, and reaching the top 50 in [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], Italy, [[Poland]] and [[Sweden]].\n\n\"Crystal\" appears as the first track on the album in a different version than the single release, with an extended intro and [[Coda (music)|coda]].\n\n==Release==\nSinger-guitarist [[Bernard Sumner]] originally gave the song to German record label Mastermind for Success, and it was recorded by label artist Corvin Dalek. However, DJ [[Pete Tong]] heard the song and declared it to be the best New Order single since \"[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]\", leading Sumner to reconsider the gift and have New Order record and release it.\n\nA version of the single was also released in Japan to promote the release of the New Order DVD ''316'', and has a different cover that resembles the ''316'' cover. B-sides for the single were 4 live audio tracks taken from the DVD. The single was [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]d by a variety of remixes, and an original song titled \"Behind Closed Doors\". All versions feature extensive backing vocals from Dawn Zee, mostly wordless. Zee has continued to perform with New Order on all their successive studio albums.\n\nAfter the song was released, a remix contest was held in which there were thousands of entries around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acidplanet.com/contests/neworder/|title=New Order Remix Contest|publisher=acidplanet.com|accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nJoe Tangari of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' called the song as \"possibly one of New Order's best singles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5767-get-ready/ |title=New Order: Get Ready &#124; Album Reviews |work=Pitchfork |date=2001-11-18 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}</ref> ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' rated it a 9/10 and described it as \"fantastic\" and the \"confident, strutting return of a band that knows that the music industry has missed it.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Grzesiak |first=Steve |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/5193/reviews/1794-new-order-crystal |title=Single Review: New Order - Crystal |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=2001-08-01 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}</ref> ''[[Stereogum]]'' placed the song at number ten in the list of their top ten best New Order songs.<ref>http://www.stereogum.com/1244332/the-10-best-new-order-songs/list/</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nThe main music video, set to the album version, was directed by [[Johan Renck]], produced by Nicola Doring<ref name=\"liner\">{{cite web|url=http://s.dsimg.com/image/R-897648-1170538406.jpeg|title=''Crystal'' DVD single liner notes|publisher=|accessdate=2012-12-09}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> through London production company Jane Fuller Associates and cinematographed by Fredrik Callingg\u00e5rd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mymanagement.co.uk/credits.php?dopNum=4&listType=Promo|title=Fredrik Callingg\u00e5rd Music Video credits|publisher=My Management|accessdate=2012-12-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041753/http://www.mymanagement.co.uk/credits.php?dopNum=4&listType=Promo|archivedate=2012-04-26}}</ref> It does not feature New Order; instead, it depicts a younger band miming to New Order's music and words. At the end, a large number of people come on stage to pull them off-stage.\n\nThe fictional band is named \"The Killers\" (the name appears on the bass drum in the video). This name later inspired [[The Killers|a real band of the same name]], who lifted a number of elements of the layout of the set in the \"Crystal\" video for their own video \"[[Somebody Told Me]]\". In 2005, at Scotland's [[T in the Park]] festival, New Order performed the song with The Killers' frontman [[Brandon Flowers]] singing the main vocals in a guest performance.

It is one of the band's fastest and most guitar-orientated singles. The song was released in August 2001 as the first single from their seventh album ''[[Get Ready (New Order album)|Get Ready]]''. It entered the [[UK Singles Charts]] at number eight, attracting considerable attention and critical praise as the band's comeback single, their first since 1993. The song also found moderate success internationally, peaking at number three in [[Canada]], number seven in Finland, and reaching the top 50 in [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], Italy, [[Poland]] and [[Sweden]].\n\n\"Crystal\" appears as the first track on the album in a different version than the single release, with an extended intro and [[coda]].\n\n==Release==\nSinger-guitarist [[Bernard Sumner]] originally gave the song to German record label Mastermind for Success, and it was recorded by label artist Corvin Dalek. However, DJ [[Pete Tong]] heard the song and declared it to be the best New Order single since \"[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]\", leading Sumner to reconsider the gift and have New Order record and release it.\n\nA version of the single was also released in Japan to promote the release of the New Order DVD ''316'', and has a different cover that resembles the ''316'' cover. B-sides for the single were 4 live audio tracks taken from the DVD. The single was [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]d by a variety of remixes, and an original song titled \"Behind Closed Doors\". All versions feature extensive backing vocals from Dawn Zee, mostly wordless. Zee has continued to perform with New Order on all their successive studio albums.\n\nAfter the song was released, a remix contest was held in which there were thousands of entries around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acidplanet.com/contests/neworder/|title=New Order Remix Contest|publisher=acidplanet.com|accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nJoe Tangari of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' called the song as \"possibly one of New Order's best singles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5767-get-ready/ |title=New Order: Get Ready &#124; Album Reviews |work=Pitchfork |date=2001-11-18 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}</ref> ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' rated it a 9/10 and described it as \"fantastic\" and the \"confident, strutting return of a band that knows that the music industry has missed it.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Grzesiak |first=Steve |url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/5193/reviews/1794-new-order-crystal |title=Single Review: New Order - Crystal |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=2001-08-01 |accessdate=2014-02-24}}</ref> ''[[Stereogum]]'' placed the song at number ten in the list of their top ten best New Order songs.<ref>http://www.stereogum.com/1244332/the-10-best-new-order-songs/list/</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nThe main music video, set to the album version, was directed by [[Johan Renck]], produced by Nicola Doring<ref name=\"liner\">{{cite web|url=http://s.dsimg.com/image/R-897648-1170538406.jpeg|title=''Crystal'' DVD single liner notes|publisher=|accessdate=2012-12-09}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> through London production company Jane Fuller Associates and cinematographed by Fredrik Callingg\u00e5rd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mymanagement.co.uk/credits.php?dopNum=4&listType=Promo|title=Fredrik Callingg\u00e5rd Music Video credits|publisher=My Management|accessdate=2012-12-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041753/http://www.mymanagement.co.uk/credits.php?dopNum=4&listType=Promo|archivedate=2012-04-26}}</ref> It does not feature New Order; instead, it depicts a younger band miming to New Order's music and words. At the end, a large number of people come on stage to pull them off-stage.\n\nThe fictional band is named \"The Killers\" (the name appears on the bass drum in the video). This name later inspired [[The Killers|a real band of the same name]], who lifted a number of elements of the layout of the set in the \"Crystal\" video for their own video \"[[Somebody Told Me]]\".

However they also engage in proselytizing activies, discussing among themselves in small groups the basics of Tabligh and traveling with their husbands (or another ''[[mahram]]'') on proselytizing trips.<ref name=defeo-12-10-09>{{cite web |last1=De F\u00e9o |first1=Agn\u00e8s |title=Behind the Veil, In the Ranks of the Tablighi Jamaat |url=http://www.world-religion-watch.org/index.php/about-us-researchers-and-fellows-at-world-religion-watch/research-publications-and-working-papers/284-veil-tabligh-jamaat |publisher=World Religion Watch |accessdate=23 January 2016 |date=12 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128094407/http://www.world-religion-watch.org/index.php/about-us-researchers-and-fellows-at-world-religion-watch/research-publications-and-working-papers/284-veil-tabligh-jamaat |archive-date=28 January 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Tabligh inculcates in them that dawah is also important alongside taking care of their spouses or taking care of their children.<ref name=defeo-12-10-09/>\n\nAccording to a 1996 study by Barbara Metcalf,<ref name=womenbm/> the Tablighi Jamaat has encouraged to participate since the beginning of the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations.

The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

The daughter of a Christian bookbinder purchased from Brandeis povidl (plum jam) which she claimed had made her family ill; as her father coincidentally died a few days after eating it. The [[burgomaster]] of the city ordered the closure of Brandeis' store and imprisoned him, his wife, and son for selling poisonous food to Christians. Investigations by municipal authorities and the court of appeal in Prague revealed that the bookbinder had died of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] and the charges were dismissed. Brandeis wrote a scroll which he called ''Shir HaMa'alot l'David'' (\"A [[Song of Ascents]] to David\"), to be read on 10 Adar, accompanied by a festive meal. He was freed from prison four days before Purim after the charges against him were proven to be false, and in celebration of his release, Jews from his city celebrated with povidl or plum hamantaschen.\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sacharin |first1=Emily |title=A Purim Classic: Sugar Cookie Hamantaschen |url=https://www.poppyandprune.com/2018/02/12/purim-classic-sugar-cookie-hamantaschen/ |website=Poppy and Prune |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Purims, Special |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12450-purims-special#anchor26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204004/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12450-purims-special#anchor26 |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 March 2016 |website=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Vanilla pastry cream with chocolate chips===\n\n[[File:Hamantashen.jpg|thumb|right|Hamantash filled with vanilla pastry cream and chocolate chips prior to baking.]]\n\nIsraeli baker Uri Scheft offers hamantaschen filled with a vanilla [[custard|pastry cream]] and chocolate chips at Lehamim/Breads Bakery, his bakeries in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[New York City]].

The dough is generally prepared with flour, eggs, sugar, butter (or margarine or cooking oil), and a flavoring such as vanilla (or sometimes [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[rose water]], or [[orange blossom water]] may be used); sometimes milk is used in the dough, and sometimes a leavener such as baking powder or baking soda is added as well. The dough is then mixed gently so as to incorporate all the ingredients together but not make the dough tough and give the hamantaschen an inferior texture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scheft |first1=Uri |title=Breaking Breads}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hamantaschen Purim Dresden (1).JPG|thumb|right|Hamantaschen served at a Purim party in Dresden that have been dusted with powdered sugar.]]\n\nThe dough is allowed to rest in the refrigerator and is then removed and rolled out to a thickness of between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch; rounds of dough are stamped out and are often brushed with an [[egg wash]] to encourage sealing prior to the addition of the filling.

The bottom and the top two corners of the dough are folded inward but do not fully enclose the filling, allowing it to remain visible. Sometimes hamantaschen may be frozen for a short period of time after shaping in order to prevent leakage of the filling. Then they are baked in an oven at medium heat for a short duration of time. Sometimes after baking hamantaschen may be dusted with [[confectioner's sugar]], dipped in [[melted chocolate]], or topped with [[sprinkles]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nathan |first1=Joan |title=The Jewish Holiday Cookbook}}</ref>\n\nSavory hamantaschen are prepared in much the same way as sweet hamantaschen, with the exception of the fillings; and they are generally made with a different dough, such one similar to a [[pie]] crust or [[puff pastry]], or a modified sweet hamantaschen dough containing less sugar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sarna |first1=Shannon |title=The Modern Jewish Baker}}</ref>\n\n==Hamantashen in Israel==\n\n[[File:Purim In Mahne Yehuda.jpg|thumb|right|Bakers selling hamantaschen as part of Purim celebrations at [[Machne Yehuda]] in [[Jerusalem, Israel]].]]\n\n{{blockquote|\"In recent years, Israeli bakeries have increasingly offered gourmet versions of the three-cornered cookie \u2014 marzipan, say, or gluten-free varieties \u2014 alongside the classics, like poppyseed.

The daughter of a Christian bookbinder purchased from Brandeis povidl (plum jam) which she claimed had made her family ill; as her father coincidentally died a few days after eating it. The [[burgomaster]] of the city ordered the closure of Brandeis' store and imprisoned him, his wife, and son for selling poisonous food to Christians. Investigations by municipal authorities and the court of appeal in Prague revealed that the bookbinder had died of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] and the charges were dismissed. Brandeis wrote a scroll which he called ''Shir HaMa'alot l'David'' (\"A [[Song of Ascents]] to David\"), to be read on 10 Adar, accompanied by a festive meal. He was freed from prison four days before Purim after the charges against him were proven to be false, and in celebration of his release, Jews from his city celebrated with povidl or plum hamantaschen.\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sacharin |first1=Emily |title=A Purim Classic: Sugar Cookie Hamantaschen |url=https://www.poppyandprune.com/2018/02/12/purim-classic-sugar-cookie-hamantaschen/ |website=Poppy and Prune |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Purims, Special |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12450-purims-special#anchor26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204004/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12450-purims-special#anchor26 |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 March 2016 |website=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Vanilla pastry cream with chocolate chips===\n\n[[File:Hamantashen.jpg|thumb|right|Hamantash filled with vanilla pastry cream and chocolate chips prior to baking.]]\n\nIsraeli baker Uri Scheft offers hamantaschen filled with a vanilla [[custard|pastry cream]] and chocolate chips at Lehamim/Breads Bakery, his bakeries in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[New York City]].

Depending on the ingredients used in the dough, the consistency of the finished hamantaschen can range from dry and crumbly like to a [[shortbread]], to soft and cakey like a [[black and white cookie]], to firm and crisp like a butter cookie. The dough is generally prepared with flour, eggs, sugar, butter (or margarine or cooking oil), and a flavoring such as vanilla (or sometimes [[cocoa]], [[rose water]], or [[orange blossom water]] may be used); sometimes milk is used in the dough, and sometimes a leavener such as baking powder or baking soda is added as well. The dough is then mixed gently so as to incorporate all the ingredients together but not make the dough tough and give the hamantaschen an inferior texture.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scheft |first1=Uri |title=Breaking Breads}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hamantaschen Purim Dresden (1).JPG|thumb|right|Hamantaschen served at a Purim party in Dresden that have been dusted with powdered sugar.]]\n\nThe dough is allowed to rest in the refrigerator and is then removed and rolled out to a thickness of between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch; rounds of dough are stamped out and are often brushed with an [[egg wash]] to encourage sealing prior to the addition of the filling. The most popular filling is [[poppyseed]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Scheft |first1=Uri |title=Breaking Breads}}</ref>, but apricot, prune, strawberry, raspberry, chocolate, [[peanut butter and jelly]], and others are also common. The bottom and the top two corners of the dough are folded inward but do not fully enclose the filling, allowing it to remain visible. Sometimes hamantaschen may be frozen for a short period of time after shaping in order to prevent leakage of the filling. Then they are baked in an oven at medium heat for a short duration of time. Sometimes after baking hamantaschen may be dusted with [[confectioner's sugar]], dipped in [[melted chocolate]], or topped with [[sprinkles]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nathan |first1=Joan |title=The Jewish Holiday Cookbook}}</ref>\n\nSavory hamantaschen are prepared in much the same way as sweet hamantaschen, with the exception of the fillings; and they are generally made with a different dough, such one similar to a [[pie]] crust or [[puff pastry]], or a modified sweet hamantaschen dough containing less sugar.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sarna |first1=Shannon |title=The Modern Jewish Baker}}</ref>\n\n==Hamantashen in Israel==\n\n[[File:Purim In Mahne Yehuda.jpg|thumb|right|Bakers selling hamantaschen as part of Purim celebrations at [[Machne Yehuda]] in [[Jerusalem, Israel]].]]\n\n{{blockquote|\"In recent years, Israeli bakeries have increasingly offered gourmet versions of the three-cornered cookie \u2014 marzipan, say, or gluten-free varieties \u2014 alongside the classics, like poppyseed.

It was produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. The 20th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]ic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after a [[butler]] has kidnapped them to gain his mistress's fortune which was intended to go to them. The film features the voices of [[Eva Gabor]], [[Hermione Baddeley]], [[Phil Harris]], Dean Clark, [[Sterling Holloway]], [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Roddy Maude-Roxby]].\n\nIn 1962, ''The Aristocats'' project began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode for ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#Walt Disney.27s Wonderful World of Color .281961.E2.80.931969.29|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'', developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of re-writes, [[Walt Disney]] suggested the project would be more suitable for an animated film, and placed the project in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] as ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' advanced into production. When ''The Jungle Book'' was nearly complete, Disney appointed [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] to develop preliminary work on ''The Aristocats'', making it the last film project to be approved by Disney personally before his death in December 1966.\n\n''The Aristocats'' was released on December 24, 1970 to positive reception and was a box office success.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot length should be between 400 and 700 words. Current count is 483 words.-->\n\nIn [[Paris, France|Paris]] 1910, mother cat Duchess and her three [[kitten]]s, Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse, live with retired opera diva Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, and her English butler, Edgar. One day while preparing her [[will (law)|will]] with lawyer Georges Hautecourt, Madame declares her fortune to be left to her cats until their deaths, and thereafter to Edgar. Edgar hears this through a [[speaking tube]] and plots to eliminate the cats. Therefore, he sedates the cats by putting [[sleeping pills]] in a milk mixture intended for them, and enters the countryside to abandon them. There, he is ambushed by two [[hound]]s named Napoleon and Lafayette, and the cats are stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence.\n\nIn the morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris. The group briefly [[hitchhiking|hitchhikes]] in a milk truck before being chased off by the driver. Later, while crossing a railroad trestle, the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, but Marie falls into a river and is saved by O'Malley, who in turn has to be rescued himself by two English geese, Amelia and Abigail Gabble, who accompany the cats to Paris. Edgar returns to the country to retrieve his possessions from Napoleon and Lafayette, as the only evidence that could incriminate him.\n\nTravelling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet O'Malley's friend Scat Cat and his musicians, who perform the song \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\". After the band has departed, O'Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill. Here, Duchess' loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O'Malley's proposal of marriage. Duchess and the kittens return to Madame's mansion, but Edgar places them in a sack and prepares to ship them to [[Timbuktu]]; They direct Roquefort to retrieve O'Malley. He does so, and O'Malley returns to the mansion, instructing Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. The alley cats and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. At the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu himself, never to be seen again. Madame Adelaide's will is rewritten to exclude Edgar, with Madame remaining ignorant of the reason for Edgar's departure. After adopting O\u2019Malley into the family, Madame establishes a charity foundation housing Paris' stray cats (represented by Scat Cat and his band, who reprise their song).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eva Gabor]] as Duchess \u2013 Madame Adelaide's [[cat]] and mother of three [[kittens]], forced to choose between loyalty to Madame and her own attachment to Thomas O'Malley at the end of the film.

By New Year's 1962, McGowan had found several stories including a children's book about a mother cat and her kittens set in New York City. However, Tytle felt that a [[London]] location had added a significant element to ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' and suggested setting the story of the cats in Paris.<ref name=\"mouseplanet\">{{cite web|last=Sampson|first=Wade|title=The Secret Origin of the Aristocats|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/9084/The_Secret_Origin_of_the_Aristocats|publisher=Mouse Planet|date=December 23, 2009|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref> Following a rough storyline, the story became about two servants\u2014a butler and a maid\u2014who were in line to inherit a fortune of an eccentric mistress after the pet cats died and focused on their feeble and foolish attempts to eliminate the felines.

Disney approved for the draft, but recommended additional cuts which were made by February 1963. Before filming was to commence, Rowe wrote a letter to Disney addressing his displeasure of the script revisions, in which Tytle responded to Rowe that the changes Disney approved of would be kept.

It was produced by [[Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]]. The 20th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, and revolves around a family of [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]ic cats, and how an alley cat acquaintance helps them after a [[butler]] has kidnapped them to gain his mistress's fortune which was intended to go to them. The film features the voices of [[Eva Gabor]], [[Hermione Baddeley]], [[Phil Harris]], Dean Clark, [[Sterling Holloway]], [[Scatman Crothers]], and [[Roddy Maude-Roxby]].\n\nIn 1962, ''The Aristocats'' project began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode for ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#Walt Disney.27s Wonderful World of Color .281961.E2.80.931969.29|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'', developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of re-writes, [[Walt Disney]] suggested the project would be more suitable for an animated film, and placed the project in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]] as ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' advanced into production. When ''The Jungle Book'' was nearly complete, Disney appointed [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] to develop preliminary work on ''The Aristocats'', making it the last film project to be approved by Disney personally before his death in December 1966.\n\n''The Aristocats'' was released on December 24, 1970 to positive reception and was a box office success.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot length should be between 400 and 700 words. Current count is 483 words.-->\n\nIn [[Paris, France|Paris]] 1910, mother cat Duchess and her three [[kitten]]s, Berlioz, Marie, and Toulouse, live with retired opera diva Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, and her English butler, Edgar. One day while preparing her [[will (law)|will]] with lawyer Georges Hautecourt, Madame declares her fortune to be left to her cats until their deaths, and thereafter to Edgar. Edgar hears this through a [[speaking tube]] and plots to eliminate the cats. Therefore, he sedates the cats by putting [[sleeping pills]] in a milk mixture intended for them, and enters the countryside to abandon them. There, he is ambushed by two [[hound]]s named Napoleon and Lafayette, and the cats are stranded in the countryside, while Madame Adelaide, Roquefort the mouse and Frou-Frou the horse discover their absence.\n\nIn the morning, Duchess meets an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley, who offers to guide her and the kittens to Paris. The group briefly [[hitchhiking|hitchhikes]] in a milk truck before being chased off by the driver. Later, while crossing a railroad trestle, the cats narrowly avoid an oncoming train, but Marie falls into a river and is saved by O'Malley, who in turn has to be rescued himself by two English geese, Amelia and Abigail Gabble, who accompany the cats to Paris. Edgar returns to the country to retrieve his possessions from Napoleon and Lafayette, as the only evidence that could incriminate him.\n\nTravelling across the rooftops of the city, the cats meet O'Malley's friend Scat Cat and his musicians, who perform the song \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat\". After the band has departed, O'Malley and Duchess converse on a nearby rooftop while the kittens listen at a windowsill. Here, Duchess' loyalty to Madame prompts her to decline O'Malley's proposal of marriage. Duchess and the kittens return to Madame's mansion, but Edgar places them in a sack and prepares to ship them to [[Timbuktu]]; They direct Roquefort to retrieve O'Malley. He does so, and O'Malley returns to the mansion, instructing Roquefort to find Scat Cat and his gang. The alley cats and Frou-Frou fight Edgar, while Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. At the end of the fight, Edgar is locked in his own packing-case and sent to Timbuktu himself, never to be seen again. Madame Adelaide's will is rewritten to exclude Edgar, with Madame remaining ignorant of the reason for Edgar's departure. After adopting O\u2019Malley into the family, Madame establishes a charity foundation housing Paris' stray cats (represented by Scat Cat and his band, who reprise their song).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Eva Gabor]] as Duchess \u2013 Madame Adelaide's cat and mother of three kittens, forced to choose between loyalty to Madame and her own attachment to Thomas O'Malley at the end of the film.

O'Malley is a cat from Rome in the Italian dub because In Italy, it was widely known that until recent times there were lots of Alley Cats in the Colosseum.\n* [[Gary Dubin]] as Toulouse \u2013 the oldest kitten, who idolizes all alley cats and especially Thomas. He is also a talented painter and is loosely based on French painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]].\n* [[Louise English|Liz English]] as Marie \u2013 middle kitten; often imperious or snobbish to her brothers, but her mother's special companion. Something of a singer.\n* Dean Clark as Berlioz \u2013 the youngest kitten. He is somewhat timid and shy, named after the French composer [[Hector Berlioz]]. This Berlioz is a talented pianist.\n* [[Roddy Maude-Roxby]] as Edgar Balthazar \u2013 Madame Adelaide's dim-witted butler who tries to get rid of the cats in order to inherit her fortune.\n* [[Scatman Crothers]] as Scat Cat \u2013 Thomas' best friend and leader of a gang of [[jazz]]-playing alley cats.

Napoleon insists, whenever cohort Lafayette makes a suggestion, that he is in command, then adopts Lafayette's suggestion as his own.\n* [[George Lindsey]] as Lafayette \u2013 a [[Basset Hound]] and Napoleon's companion. He sometimes proves smarter than Napoleon, but is also more timid.\n* [[Hermione Baddeley]] as Madame Adelaide Bonfamille \u2013 a former opera singer and owner of Duchess and her kittens.\n* [[Charles Lane (actor)|Charles Lane]] as Georges Hautecourt \u2013 Madame Bonfamille's lawyer: an eccentric, lively old man\n* [[Nancy Kulp]] as Frou-Frou \u2013 Roquefort's horse companion, who subdues Edgar. [[Ruth Buzzi]] provided her singing voice.\n* [[Monica Evans]] as Abigail Gabble \u2013 a goose who befriends the cats.\n* [[Carole Shelley]] as Amelia Gabble \u2013 Abigail's twin sister.\n* [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]] as Uncle Waldo \u2013 the drunken gander uncle of Abigail and Amelia.\n* [[Peter Renaday]] as French Milkman/Le Petit Cafe Cook/Truck Movers (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\n\n===Story development===\nOn December 9, 1961, Walt Disney suggested that Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan find some animal stories to adapt as a two-part live-action episode for the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series#Walt Disney.27s Wonderful World of Color .281961.E2.80.931969.29|Wonderful World of Color]]'' television program. By New Year's 1962, McGowan had found several stories including a children's book about a mother cat and her kittens set in New York City. However, Tytle felt that a [[London]] location had added a significant element to ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' and suggested setting the story of the cats in Paris.<ref name=\"mouseplanet\">{{cite web|last=Sampson|first=Wade|title=The Secret Origin of the Aristocats|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/9084/The_Secret_Origin_of_the_Aristocats|publisher=Mouse Planet|date=December 23, 2009|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref> Following a rough storyline, the story became about two servants\u2014a butler and a maid\u2014who were in line to inherit a fortune of an eccentric mistress after the pet cats died and focused on their feeble and foolish attempts to eliminate the felines. [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Francoise Rosay]] were in mind to portray the butler and the distressed Madame.{{sfn|Koenig|1997|p=141}} A subplot centered around a mother cat hiding her kittens to keep them out of danger in a variety of different homes and locales around Paris, France. During the filming of ''[[Escapade in Florence]]'', McGowan brought him the story that had been written by Tom Rowe, an American writer who was living in Paris.<ref name=\"mouseplanet\" />\n\n[[File:Phil Harris 1956.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Before his death in 1966, Walt Disney contacted Phil Harris (pictured here) to voice Thomas O'Malley.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&dat=19801208&id=SfVSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ToMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7155,2696962&hl=en||title=An encore purr-formance for 'The Aristocats'|last=Pearson|first=Howard|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|via=[[Google News Archive]]|date=December 8, 1980|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nBy August 1962, they sent the completed script to Burbank, where it was returned as \"rejected\" by an unknown executive at the Disney studios. Nevertheless, Tytle brought the script to Disney staying at the [[Connaught Hall, London|Connaught]] in London. Disney approved for the draft, but recommended additional cuts which were made by February 1963. Before filming was to commence, Rowe wrote a letter to Disney addressing his displeasure of the script revisions, in which Tytle responded to Rowe that the changes Disney approved of would be kept. However, by summer 1963, the project was shelved, where Tytle, in a discussion with Walt, recommended to produce ''The Aristocats'' as an animated feature.<ref name=\"mouseplanet\" /> For that reason, Disney temporarily shelved the project as the animation department was occupied with ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''.<ref name=\"Ottawa\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&dat=19701218&id=kr0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XO0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2560,1843732&hl=en|title=The Aristocats for Christmas|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|via=Google News Archive|date=December 18, 1970|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref> Meanwhile, director [[Wolfgang Reitherman]] learned of the project and suggested it as a follow-up project to ''Jungle Book''.<ref name=jimhill /> Because of the production delays, Tytle was advised to centralize his efforts on [[Live action|live action projects]] and was replaced by [[Winston Hibler]].<ref name=\"mouseplanet\" />\n\nIn 1966, Disney assigned [[Ken Anderson (animator)|Ken Anderson]] to determine whether ''Aristocats'' would be suitable for an animated feature.
