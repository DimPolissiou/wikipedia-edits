The term \"domestic service\" applies to the equivalent occupational category. In traditional English contexts, such a person was said to be \"in service\".<ref>\n{{cite OED | in service}}</ref> Domestic helpers perform a variety of household services for an individual or a family, from providing [[childcare|care for children]] and elderly dependents to [[housekeeping]], including cleaning and household maintenance. Other responsibilities may include [[cooking]], [[laundry]] and [[ironing]], shopping for food and other household errands. Such work has always needed to be done but before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the advent of labour saving devices, it was physically much harder.\n\nSome domestic helpers live within their employer's household. In some cases, the contribution and skill of servants whose work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued. However, for the most part, domestic work, while necessary, is demanding and undervalued. Although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries, it is often not extensively enforced. In many jurisdictions, domestic work is poorly regulated and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses, including [[slavery]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anti-Slavery International|title=Domestic Work and Slavery|url=http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/child_domestic_work.aspx|website=Anti-Slavery.Org|publisher=Anti-Slavery International|accessdate=24 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930183517/http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/child_domestic_work.aspx|archivedate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Servant'' is an older English word for \"domestic worker\", though not all servants worked inside the home. Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer's residence, was sometimes simply called \"service\" and has often been part of a hierarchical system. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the [[Victorian era]], perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the [[Edwardian period]] (a period known in the United States as the [[Gilded Age]] and in France as the [[Belle \u00c9poque]]), which reflected the limited [[social mobility]] before [[World War I]].\n\n==Terminology==\nOther terms include '''domestic helper''', '''domestic servant''', '''manservant''' or '''menial'''.\n\n==History==\n[[ILO]] estimates in 2015, based on national surveys and/or censuses of 232 countries and territories, place the number of domestic workers at around 67.1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_436343.pdf|title=ILO Global estimates of migrant workers and migrant domestic workers: results and methodology|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2016-12-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329004937/http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---com/documents/publication/wcms_436343.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-29}}</ref> But the ILO itself states that \"experts say that due to the fact that this kind of work is often hidden and unregistered, the total number of domestic workers could be as high as 100 million\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_157891/lang--en/index.htm|title=100th ILO annual Conference decides to bring an estimated 53 to 100 million domestic workers worldwide under the realm of labour standards|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2016-12-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084648/http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_157891/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=2016-12-27}}</ref> The ILO also states that 83% of domestic workers are women and many are migrant workers.\n\nIn [[Guatemala]], it is estimated that eight percent of all women work as domestic workers. They hardly have any legal protection. According to Guatemalan labor law, domestic work is \"subject neither to a working time statute nor to regulations on the maximum number of working hours in a day\".{{Contradict-inline|reason=First it says there are no restrictions on working time, then goes on to mention a couple.|date=May 2017}} Legally, domestic helpers are only entitled to ten hours of free time in 24 hours, and one day off per week.

It is not uncommon, however, for employers to hire servants illegally and fail to offer a work contract. Since domestic staff predominantly come from disadvantaged groups with less access to education, they are often vulnerable and uninformed of their rights, especially in rural areas. Nevertheless, domestics employed without a proper contract can successfully sue their employers and be compensated for abuse committed. It is common in Brazil for domestic staff, including childcare staff, to be required to wear uniforms, while this requirement has fallen out of use in other countries.\n\nIn the [[United States]], domestic workers are generally excluded from many of the legal protections afforded to other classes of worker, including the provisions of the [[National Labor Relations Act]].<ref>See the UN Human Rights Committee's report, \"Domestic Workers' Rights in the United States.\"</ref> However, in recent years, advocacy groups like the [[National Domestic Workers Alliance|National Domestic Workers' Alliance]] have succeeded in passing a [[Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights|Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights]] into state law in New York, Hawaii, and California.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/national-domestic-workers-alliance.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/national-domestic-workers-alliance.html|title=The New Labor Movement Fighting for Domestic Workers' Rights|last=Hilgers|first=Lauren|date=2019-02-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally domestic workers have mostly been women and are likely to be immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/386.html|title=Domestic Work and Workers|last=Graff|first=Daniel A.|date=n.d.|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2009-08-31|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513124817/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/386.html|archivedate=2009-05-13}}</ref> Currently, there are 1.8 million domestic workers, and tens of thousands of people are believed to be in forced labor in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/womans-work-the-home-economics-of-domestic-workers|title=The Home Economics of Domestic Workers|last=Bello|first=Grace|date=January 17, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130131003736/http://bitchmagazine.org/post/womans-work-the-home-economics-of-domestic-workers|archivedate=January 31, 2013}}</ref> America's domestic home help workers, most of them female members of minority groups, earn low wages and often receive no retirement or health benefits because the lack of basic labor protections.\n\nDomestic workers are also excluded from vacation time, sick time, and overtime, and only thirteen percent of domestic workers get health insurance provided by their employers.

One of these causes is that with more women taking up full-time jobs, a dually employed household with children places a heavy burden on parents. It is argued however that this burden wouldn't result in the demand for outside domestic help if men and women were providing equal levels of effort in domestic work and child-rearing within their own home.<ref name = \"Connelly\"/>\n\nThe demand for domestic workers has also become primarily fulfilled by [[migrant domestic workers]] from other countries who flock to wealthier nations to fulfill the demand for help at home.<ref name = \"Castro\">\"Feminists and Domestic Workers; Muchachas No More: Domestic Workers in Latin America and the Caribbean\" by Elsa M.

The Act influenced the creation of domestic service laws in other nations, although legislation tended to favour employers. However, before the passing of such Acts servants, and workers in general, had no protection in law. The only real advantage that domestic service provided was the provision of meals, accommodation, and sometimes clothes, in addition to a modest wage. Service was normally an [[apprentice]] system with room for advancement through the ranks.\n\nThe conditions faced by domestic workers have varied considerably throughout history and in the contemporary world. In the course of twentieth-century movements for [[labour rights]], [[women's rights]] and immigrant rights, the conditions faced by domestic workers and the problems specific to their class of employment have come to the fore.\n\nIn 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] adopted the [[Convention on domestic workers|Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers]]. Previously, at its 301st Session (March 2008), the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) Governing Body agreed to place an item on decent work for domestic workers on the agenda of the 99th Session of the International Labour Conference (2010) with a view to the setting of labour standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/resource/subject/domestic.htm|title=Resource guide on domestic workers|publisher=[[International Labour Organization]]|accessdate=October 4, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222239/http://www.ilo.org/public/english/support/lib/resource/subject/domestic.htm|archivedate=October 4, 2013}}</ref> In July 2011, at the annual International Labour Conference, held by the ILO, conference delegates adopted the [[Convention on Domestic Workers]] by a vote of 396 to 16, with 63 abstentions.

Though they often have their own quarters, their accommodations are not usually as comfortable as those reserved for the family members. In some cases, they sleep in the kitchen or small rooms, such as a [[box room]], sometimes located in the basement or attic. Domestic workers may live in their own home, though more often they are \"live-in\" domestics, meaning that they receive their [[room and board]] as part of their salaries. In some countries, because of the large gap between urban and rural incomes, and the lack of employment opportunities in the countryside, even an ordinary middle class urban family can afford to employ a full-time live-in servant. The majority of domestic workers in [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[India]], and other populous developing countries, are people from the rural areas who are employed by urban families.\n\nEmployers may require their domestic workers to wear a [[uniform]], [[livery]] or other \"domestic workers' clothes\" when in their employers' residence. The uniform is usually simple, though aristocratic employers sometimes provided elaborate decorative liveries, especially for use on formal occasions. Female servants wore long, plain, dark-coloured [[Dress (garment)|dresses]] or [[black]] skirts with white belts and white [[blouse]]s, and black shoes, and male servants and butlers would wear something from a simple [[suit (clothing)|suit]], or a white [[dress shirt]], often with [[Necktie|tie]], and [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickers]].  In traditional portrayals, the attire of domestic workers especially was typically more formal and conservative than that of those whom they serve.  For example, in films of the early 20th century, a butler might appear in a tailcoat, while male family members and guests appeared in lounge suits or sports jackets and trousers depending on the occasion.  In later portrayals, the employer and guests might wear casual slacks or even jeans, while a male domestic worker wore a jacket and tie or a white dress shirt with black trousers, necktie or bowtie, maybe even waistcoat, or a female domestic worker either a blouse and skirt (or trousers) or a uniform.\n\nOn 30 March 2009, [[Peru]] adopted a law banning employers from requiring domestic workers to wear a uniform at public places.

Organizations such as [[Kalayaan (charity)|Kalayaan]] support the growing number of these [[migrant domestic workers]].\n\nThe migration of domestic workers can lead to several different effects both on the countries that are sending workers abroad and countries that are receiving domestic workers from abroad. One particular relationship between countries sending workers and countries receiving workers is that the sending country can be filling gaps in labor shortages of the receiving country.<ref name = \"Anderson\">\"Who needs migrant workers?

Bridget Anderson and Martin Ruhs, Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS) University of Oxford Working draft: 11th May 2009</ref> This relationship can be potentially beneficial for both countries involved because the demand for labor is being met and fulfilled by workers' demand for jobs. This relationship however can prove to be quite complicated and not always beneficial.

What studies are now starting to show is that women are dominating large numbers of the international migration patterns by taking up large percentages of domestic workers that leave their home country in search for work as a domestic laborer in another country.<ref>WOMEN AND MIGRATION: The Social Consequences of Gender, Silvia Pedraza, Department of Sociology and Program in American Culture, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109</ref>\n\nWomen who migrate to take up work as domestic workers are motivated by different reasons and migrate to a variety of different outcomes. While for many women, domestic work abroad is the only opportunity to find work and provide an income for their families, domestic labor is a market they are forced to enter due to blocked mobility in their homelands.<ref>INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION, DOMESTIC WORK, AND CARE WORK Undocumented Latina Migrants in Israel, Rebeca Raijman, University of Haifa, Israel, SILVINA SCHAMMAH-GESSER and ADRIANA KEMP, Tel Aviv University</ref> Additionally, migrant domestic workers often have to face the stress of leaving family members behind in their home countries while they take up work abroad.

In support, some argue that because domestic work occurs within the private sphere, which is seen as inherently feminine. This argument goes that the constructed link between domestic work and femininity<ref>Jindy Pettman. \"Migration,\" in Gender Matters in Global Politics ed. Laura Shepherd (Routledge, New York: 2010) 257.</ref> carries the implication that it is often referred to as 'domestic help,' and that domestic workers are referred to as 'nannies' or 'maids.' At least one author has argued that use of language compounded with the association with domestic work with femininities contributes to the exclusion of domestic work from the majority of national labour laws.<ref>Salleh, \"Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt,\" 3.</ref>\n\nDue to a lack of economic opportunity in the Global South, many women with families leave their countries of origin and their own families to pursue work in the Global North. When they arrive in their country of destination, their work often entails caring for another family (including children and the elderly). Domestic workers often migrate to financially support their immediate family, extended family, and even other members of their community. While enduring dangerous and demeaning working and living conditions in the North, the majority of their wages are remitted to their countries of origin.<ref>Jindy Pettman, \"Migration,\" in Gender Matters in Global Politics ed. Laura Shepherd (Routledge, New York: 2010) 257.</ref>\n\nAn additional argument has been made that because their work takes place within the private sphere, they are often rendered invisible and employers are able to withhold their travel documents, confining them to their employers' home and inhibiting their access to legal redress. Those making this argument assert that the result of what they refer to as a power dynamic and an asserted lack of labour rights, is that domestic workers are often forbidden to contact their families and often go months, years, and even decades without seeing their families, whose lives their remittances are supporting.\n\nFurther, it has been argued that their ability to fill labour shortages and accept positions within the reproductive labour force that citizens of their host countries would reject underpins the development of the global capitalist system,<ref>Pettman, Jindy, \"Migration,\" 257.</ref> Simultaneously, and that they are enabling the beneficiaries of their remittances in the South to ascend the social ladder. To some, these arguments lead to a conclusion that both circumstances in the North and South constitute embodied debt through the improvement of one's life at the expense of another's hardship, and that the labour of such workers is too often not seen as work, due to the association of their gendered bodies with reproductive labour.\n\nHowever, on June 17, 2011, after 70 years of lobbying by civil society groups, the ILO adopted a convention with the aim of protecting and empowering domestic workers. Much of lobbying that contributed toward the ratification of ILO C189 was done by domestic workers groups, demonstrating that they are not merely victims but agents of change. That only two labour receiving countries have ratified the convention has been argued by some to demonstrates the reluctance of governments to acknowledge what such advocates see as a debt owed by society to such workers and to repay that perceived debt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfasia.org/home/459-ratify-and-implement-ilo-convention-189-on-decent-work-for-domestic-workers-now%20 |title=Ratify and Implement ILO Convention 189 on Decent Work for Domestic Workers Now! |publisher=Mfasia.org |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212080343/http://www.mfasia.org/home/459-ratify-and-implement-ilo-convention-189-on-decent-work-for-domestic-workers-now |archivedate=2013-12-12 }}</ref>\n\nSuch advocates assert that the ratification and enforcement of ILO C189 would mean that migrant domestic workers would enjoy the same labour rights as other more 'masculine' fields as well as the citizens of their destination countries. An incomplete list of basic rights guaranteed by ILO C189 under Article 7 includes: maximum working hours; fixed minimum wages; paid leave; provision of food and accommodation; and weekly rest periods. Guaranteeing these rights to migrant domestic workers would not constitute repayment the embodied debt owed to them, but they are entitled to these rights as they are both workers and human beings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:2551460|title=Convention C189 - Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189)|website=www.ilo.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103064407/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:2551460|archivedate=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Social effects==\n[[File:Pilgrimage of Korea(n) lady.jpg|thumb|left|upright =2.0|Male servants carrying a [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] and female maid with a traditional fan (Korea c.1904)]]\nAs women currently dominate the domestic labor market throughout the world, they have learned to navigate the system of domestic work both in their own countries and abroad in order to maximize the benefits of entering the domestic labor market.\n\nAmong the disadvantages of working as a domestic worker is the fact that women working in this sector are working in an area often regarded as a [[private sphere]].<ref name = \"Connelly\">Arat-Koc, S.

Their isolation is increased by their invisibility in the public sphere and the repetitive, intangible nature of their work decreases its value, making the workers themselves more dispensable.<ref name=\"Domestic Workers' Social Networks 1994 pp. 50-64\">Regulating the Unregulated?: Domestic Workers' Social Networks, Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo, Social Problems, Vol. 41, No. 1, Special Issue on Immigration, Race, and Ethnicity in America (Feb., 1994), pp. 50\u201364</ref> The level of isolation women face also depends on the type of domestic work they are involved with.

Some have to perform tasks considered degrading showing a manifestation of employer power over worker powerlessness. Employing domestic work from foreign countries can perpetuate the idea that domestic or service work is reserved for other social or racial groups and plays into the stereotype that it is work for inferior groups of people.<ref name = \"Anderson2\">Just Another Job?

In modern times, it has been a norm among upper and upper-middle-class families in the Philippines to hire at least one maidservant-caretaker (''katulong''/''kasambahay/yaya'') to care for the household and children. Most, particularly maidservant-caretakers (''katulong''/''kasambahay/yaya''), live together in the house of their master's family with usually only a day off per month. This practice has eventually influenced the architecture of some houses or apartment condos where it has become a norm to section a room where domestic maidservants sleep as their personal room, usually near the kitchen or laundry area. Some wealthy families also section off an area or house where all the maidservants sleep or a part of the kitchen where they eat separate from the master's table. There are also employment agencies and special government laws regarding the regulation of domestic worker employment, such as the \"Domestic Workers Act\" or \"Batas Kasambahay\" in [https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2013/ra_10361_2013.html Republic Act No 10361]. Many live underpaid since many are informally hired or salaries are not declared truthfully to government offices or have an agreement instead to pay through other means, such as paying for their education, pension, or to send money back to their families. This practice was eventually exported to neighboring countries and all other countries that [[Overseas Filipino Worker|overseas Filipino workers]] (OFWs) have worked in, such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[China]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and other countries in the [[Middle East]], and etc., hence some maidservants continue living with the same mindset of how domestic worker culture was practiced in the Philippines. This has also, at times, been used as a cause to look down upon overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in the countries where they can be found. It has sometimes created controversies in other countries such as abuse charges in several countries in the Middle East or like the case of [[Flor Contemplacion]], who was executed in Singapore for murder allegations. There have also been documentaries or [[Romantic comedy|rom-com]] movies made in the Philippines about the plight or life of domestic workers, particularly maidservant-caretakers (''katulong''/''kasambahay''/''yaya'').\n\n===Singapore===\nData from Singapore's [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Ministry of Manpower]] (MOM), showed that in June 2019 there were some 255,800 Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW) in Singapore. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers|title=Foreign workforce numbers|website=Ministry of Manpower Singapore|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The demand for Foreign Domestic Workers came about from the desire of the Singapore government to employ local women in the workforce.

Domestic workers estimated approximately 600,000 from Indonesia, 275,000 from Sri Lanka and 200,000 from Philippines. However, HRW reported that a number of domestic workers in Saudi Arabia face a range of abuses. Besides, the organization also interviewed Saudi labor and social affairs official, who acknowledged the issue of domestic worker abuse.

With limited skills and illiteracy, many men turned to become [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]], whereas the majority of women participated in domestic work. Not only were they not qualified for other jobs, but they were denied other jobs and segregated from American society purely based on the color of their skin. The South wanted to keep segregation alive and hence passed legislation such as the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Laws]] post-Civil war which denied African Americans of legal equality and political rights.  These laws kept many African Americans as a second-class status up until new laws ended segregation in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States|last=Norton|first=Mary Beth|publisher=New York: Houghton Mifflin Company|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=856\u2013858}}</ref>\n\nUp until the mid-twentieth century, domestic work was a prominent source of income for many women of different ethnic backgrounds. Many of these women were either African American or immigrants. More specifically, the post-civil war South had a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers. At the turn of the nineteenth century, there was also a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers in the North.  Many African American women migrated to the North for better work opportunities and higher wages compared to their employment options in the South. The African American women who worked as domestic workers were generally treated as poor, childlike beings that were seen as victims of their own ignorance of living in communities of crime and other societal infringements.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, despite the stereotypes labeled upon domestic workers, these women still settled for these positions because the only occupations that were open to African American women before World War I were domestic services.

This is because many white families lost their source of income and were not able to pay domestic workers to work in their home.  At this time, many domestic workers relied on asking strangers on the street for housework such as cleaning.  They house jumped, looking for any job that they could get. The domestic workforce was significantly impacted by the Great Depression which caused a decrease in their wages and an intolerable 18 hour workday.  Also, agricultural workers and the African American women working as domestic workers at this time were explicitly excluded from social security and the FLSA in the New Deal legislation.<ref name=\":1\" />  This is because the New Dealer politicians were more worried about losing support from the Southern Democrats in Congress who supported segregation rather than refusing coverage for many African Americans.<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike their white counterparts, African Americans did not form labor unions because they lacked the resources, consciousness, and the access to networks used for union recruiting.  On top of that, the domestic workers would not typically have earned enough money to be able to afford being a part of a union.  Even if the African American domestic workers wanted to advance in society, it was nearly impossible because the racial structures in the United States rarely allowed them class mobility.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, domestic workers that were white such as the Irish and the Germans utilized working in middle-class homes to their advantage.  Working in the middle-class homes served to Americanize, allowing the workers to identify more with their employers than women of their own class and instilled an aspiration to become middle-class status.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Blacks in 1960s America ====\nNearly ninety percent of African American women worked as domestic workers during the Civil Rights Movement era.<ref name=\":0\" />  Their participation in the Civil Rights Movement went fairly undocumented, and despite their low-status career in the United States, they were beneficial for the betterment of society and the status of the African American race.  It has been noted that the southern African American women were the backbone of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nSince many white households relied on the African American domestic workers for housework, the workers were able to have a direct impact on the white race when rebelling for their civil rights.  The African American domestic workers boycotted buses and tried to register to vote, and many were denied and imprisoned. However, the domestic workers utilized imprisonment to educate other African American women on the Civil Rights Movement and what to do to contribute.  Additionally, typically the domestic workers rebelled in an informal manner, such as resisting to live in the same home in which they worked.

The term \"domestic service\" applies to the equivalent occupational category. In traditional English contexts, such a person was said to be \"in service\".<ref>\n{{cite OED | in service}}</ref> Domestic helpers perform a variety of household services for an individual or a family, from providing [[childcare|care for children]] and elderly dependents to [[housekeeping]], including cleaning and household maintenance. Other responsibilities may include [[cooking]], [[laundry]] and [[ironing]], shopping for food and other household errands. Such work has always needed to be done but before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the advent of labour saving devices, it was physically much harder.\n\nSome domestic helpers live within their employer's household. In some cases, the contribution and skill of servants whose work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued. However, for the most part, domestic work, while necessary, is demanding and undervalued. Although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries, it is often not extensively enforced. In many jurisdictions, domestic work is poorly regulated and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses, including [[slavery]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anti-Slavery International|title=Domestic Work and Slavery|url=http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/child_domestic_work.aspx|website=Anti-Slavery.Org|publisher=Anti-Slavery International|accessdate=24 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930183517/http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/child_domestic_work.aspx|archivedate=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n''Servant'' is an older English word for \"domestic worker\", though not all servants worked inside the home. Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer's residence, was sometimes simply called \"service\" and has often been part of a hierarchical system. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the [[Victorian era]], perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the [[Edwardian period]] (a period known in the United States as the [[Gilded Age]] and in France as the [[Belle \u00c9poque]]), which reflected the limited [[social mobility]] before [[World War I]].\n\n==Terminology==\nOther terms include '''domestic helper''', '''domestic servant''', '''manservant''' or '''menial'''.\n\n==History==\n[[ILO]] estimates in 2015, based on national surveys and/or censuses of 232 countries and territories, place the number of domestic workers at around 67.1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_436343.pdf|title=ILO Global estimates of migrant workers and migrant domestic workers: results and methodology|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2016-12-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329004937/http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---com/documents/publication/wcms_436343.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-29}}</ref> But the ILO itself states that \"experts say that due to the fact that this kind of work is often hidden and unregistered, the total number of domestic workers could be as high as 100 million\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_157891/lang--en/index.htm|title=100th ILO annual Conference decides to bring an estimated 53 to 100 million domestic workers worldwide under the realm of labour standards|work=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2016-12-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227084648/http://www.ilo.org/ilc/ILCSessions/100thSession/media-centre/press-releases/WCMS_157891/lang--en/index.htm|archivedate=2016-12-27}}</ref> The ILO also states that 83% of domestic workers are women and many are migrant workers.\n\nIn [[Guatemala]], it is estimated that eight percent of all women work as domestic workers. They hardly have any legal protection. According to Guatemalan labor law, domestic work is \"subject neither to a working time statute nor to regulations on the maximum number of working hours in a day\".{{Contradict-inline|reason=First it says there are no restrictions on working time, then goes on to mention a couple.|date=May 2017}} Legally, domestic helpers are only entitled to ten hours of free time in 24 hours, and one day off per week.

It is not uncommon, however, for employers to hire servants illegally and fail to offer a work contract. Since domestic staff predominantly come from disadvantaged groups with less access to education, they are often vulnerable and uninformed of their rights, especially in rural areas. Nevertheless, domestics employed without a proper contract can successfully sue their employers and be compensated for abuse committed. It is common in Brazil for domestic staff, including childcare staff, to be required to wear uniforms, while this requirement has fallen out of use in other countries.\n\nIn the [[United States]], domestic workers are generally excluded from many of the legal protections afforded to other classes of worker, including the provisions of the [[National Labor Relations Act]].<ref>See the UN Human Rights Committee's report, \"Domestic Workers' Rights in the United States.\"</ref> However, in recent years, advocacy groups like the [[National Domestic Workers Alliance|National Domestic Workers' Alliance]] have succeeded in passing a [[Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights|Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights]] into state law in New York, Hawaii, and California.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/national-domestic-workers-alliance.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/21/magazine/national-domestic-workers-alliance.html|title=The New Labor Movement Fighting for Domestic Workers' Rights|last=Hilgers|first=Lauren|date=2019-02-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally domestic workers have mostly been women and are likely to be immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/386.html|title=Domestic Work and Workers|last=Graff|first=Daniel A.|date=n.d.|work=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|accessdate=2009-08-31|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513124817/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/386.html|archivedate=2009-05-13}}</ref> Currently, there are 1.8 million domestic workers, and tens of thousands of people are believed to be in forced labor in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/womans-work-the-home-economics-of-domestic-workers|title=The Home Economics of Domestic Workers|last=Bello|first=Grace|date=January 17, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130131003736/http://bitchmagazine.org/post/womans-work-the-home-economics-of-domestic-workers|archivedate=January 31, 2013}}</ref> America's domestic home help workers, most of them female members of minority groups, earn low wages and often receive no retirement or health benefits because the lack of basic labor protections.\n\nDomestic workers are also excluded from vacation time, sick time, and overtime, and only thirteen percent of domestic workers get health insurance provided by their employers.

One of these causes is that with more women taking up full-time jobs, a dually employed household with children places a heavy burden on parents.

The Act influenced the creation of domestic service laws in other nations, although legislation tended to favour employers. However, before the passing of such Acts servants, and workers in general, had no protection in law. The only real advantage that domestic service provided was the provision of meals, accommodation, and sometimes clothes, in addition to a modest wage. Service was normally an [[apprentice]] system with room for advancement through the ranks.\n\nThe conditions faced by domestic workers have varied considerably throughout history and in the contemporary world. In the course of twentieth-century movements for [[labour rights]], [[women's rights]] and immigrant rights, the conditions faced by domestic workers and the problems specific to their class of employment have come to the fore.\n\nIn 2011, the [[International Labour Organization]] adopted the [[Convention on domestic workers|Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers]].

Though they often have their own quarters, their accommodations are not usually as comfortable as those reserved for the family members. In some cases, they sleep in the kitchen or small rooms, such as a [[box room]], sometimes located in the basement or attic. Domestic workers may live in their own home, though more often they are \"live-in\" domestics, meaning that they receive their [[room and board]] as part of their salaries. In some countries, because of the large gap between urban and rural incomes, and the lack of employment opportunities in the countryside, even an ordinary middle class urban family can afford to employ a full-time live-in servant. The majority of domestic workers in [[China]], [[Mexico]], [[India]], and other populous developing countries, are people from the rural areas who are employed by urban families.\n\nEmployers may require their domestic workers to wear a [[uniform]], [[livery]] or other \"domestic workers' clothes\" when in their employers' residence. The uniform is usually simple, though aristocratic employers sometimes provided elaborate decorative liveries, especially for use on formal occasions. Female servants wore long, plain, dark-coloured [[Dress (garment)|dresses]] or [[black]] skirts with white belts and white [[blouse]]s, and black shoes, and male servants and butlers would wear something from a simple [[suit (clothing)|suit]], or a white [[dress shirt]], often with [[Necktie|tie]], and [[knickerbockers (clothing)|knickers]].  In traditional portrayals, the attire of domestic workers especially was typically more formal and conservative than that of those whom they serve.  For example, in films of the early 20th century, a butler might appear in a tailcoat, while male family members and guests appeared in lounge suits or sports jackets and trousers depending on the occasion.  In later portrayals, the employer and guests might wear casual slacks or even jeans, while a male domestic worker wore a jacket and tie or a white dress shirt with black trousers, necktie or bowtie, maybe even waistcoat, or a female domestic worker either a blouse and skirt (or trousers) or a uniform.\n\nOn 30 March 2009, [[Peru]] adopted a law banning employers from requiring domestic workers to wear a uniform at public places. However, it's not explained which punishments will be given to employers violating the law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.peruthisweek.com/news-8597-law-order-peru-domestic-servants-can-no-longer-be-forced-wear-uniforms-public|title=Peru: Domestic servants can no longer be forced to wear uniforms in public|publisher=Living in Peru|language=English|last=Guerra|first=Isabel|date=30 March 2009|accessdate=19 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116170711/http://archive.peruthisweek.com/news-8597-law-order-peru-domestic-servants-can-no-longer-be-forced-wear-uniforms-public|archivedate=16 January 2017}}</ref> [[Chile]] adopted a similar law in 2014, also banning employers to require domestic workers to wear uniform at public places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/1999066/housemaid-turned-rapper-gives-voice-suffering-domestic-helpers|title=Housemaid-turned-rapper gives voice to suffering of domestic helpers in Latin America|publisher=South China Morning Post|language=English|date=4 August 2016|accessdate=15 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119050130/http://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/1999066/housemaid-turned-rapper-gives-voice-suffering-domestic-helpers|archivedate=19 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/1999066/housemaid-turned-rapper-gives-voice-suffering-domestic-helpers|title=Brazil rapper voices Latin housemaids' suffering|publisher=New Strait Times|language=English|date=4 August 2016|accessdate=15 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119050130/http://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/1999066/housemaid-turned-rapper-gives-voice-suffering-domestic-helpers|archivedate=19 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Child workers==\n{{Main|Child labour}}\n{{See also|Restavek}}\n[[File:Child Maid Servant.JPG|thumb|Child maid servant in [[India]].

There are at least one million domestic workers in [[Saudi Arabia]] under the [[kafala system]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Major sources of domestic workers include [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]], [[India]], the [[Philippines]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Ethiopia]]. Taiwan also imports domestic workers from [[Vietnam]] and [[Mongolia]]. Organizations such as [[Kalayaan (charity)|Kalayaan]] support the growing number of these [[migrant domestic workers]].\n\nThe migration of domestic workers can lead to several different effects both on the countries that are sending workers abroad and countries that are receiving domestic workers from abroad. One particular relationship between countries sending workers and countries receiving workers is that the sending country can be filling gaps in labor shortages of the receiving country.<ref name = \"Anderson\">\"Who needs migrant workers? Introduction to the analysis of staff shortages, immigration and public policy\". Bridget Anderson and Martin Ruhs, Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS) University of Oxford Working draft: 11th May 2009</ref> This relationship can be potentially beneficial for both countries involved because the demand for labor is being met and fulfilled by workers' demand for jobs. This relationship however can prove to be quite complicated and not always beneficial. When unemployment in a receiving country rises migrant domestic workers are not only no longer needed but their presence can be detrimental to domestic workers of that country.<ref name = \"Anderson\"/>\n\nWhen international migration began to flourish the assumed migrant worker was typically considered to be a man. What studies are now starting to show is that women are dominating large numbers of the international migration patterns by taking up large percentages of domestic workers that leave their home country in search for work as a domestic laborer in another country.<ref>WOMEN AND MIGRATION: The Social Consequences of Gender, Silvia Pedraza, Department of Sociology and Program in American Culture, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109</ref>\n\nWomen who migrate to take up work as domestic workers are motivated by different reasons and migrate to a variety of different outcomes. While for many women, domestic work abroad is the only opportunity to find work and provide an income for their families, domestic labor is a market they are forced to enter due to blocked mobility in their homelands.<ref>INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION, DOMESTIC WORK, AND CARE WORK Undocumented Latina Migrants in Israel, Rebeca Raijman, University of Haifa, Israel, SILVINA SCHAMMAH-GESSER and ADRIANA KEMP, Tel Aviv University</ref> Additionally, migrant domestic workers often have to face the stress of leaving family members behind in their home countries while they take up work abroad. Upward mobility is particularly difficult for migrant domestic workers because their opportunities are often limited by their illegal status putting a very definite limitation on the work that is available to them as well as their power to negotiate with employers<ref name=\"De Regt\"/>\n\n==Advocacy for migrant workers== <!-- This section needs to be adapted / absorbed into another section in this article-->\n\nSome argue that personal sacrifices of domestic workers has helped to underpin economic and social development globally. Ariel Salleh's article \"Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt\", defines embodied debt as \"debt owed by the Global North and Global South to the 'reproductive workers' who produce and maintain the new labour force.\"<ref>Ariel Salleh, ed. \"Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt,\" in Eco-Sufficiency and Global Justice (Pluto Press: London, 2009) 5.</ref> According to the ILO, women constitute 80% of domestic workers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Tran |first=Mark |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jan/09/ilo-better-pay-domestic-workers |title=ILO urges better pay and conditions for 53 million domestic workers &#124; Global development |publisher=theguardian.com |accessdate=2014-07-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029031331/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jan/09/ilo-better-pay-domestic-workers |archivedate=2014-10-29 }}</ref>  The substantially high percentage of women in domestic work some argue results from this sector's association with motherhood, leading to an assumption that domestic work is by nature the work of females. In support, some argue that because domestic work occurs within the private sphere, which is seen as inherently feminine. This argument goes that the constructed link between domestic work and femininity<ref>Jindy Pettman. \"Migration,\" in Gender Matters in Global Politics ed. Laura Shepherd (Routledge, New York: 2010) 257.</ref> carries the implication that it is often referred to as 'domestic help,' and that domestic workers are referred to as 'nannies' or 'maids.' At least one author has argued that use of language compounded with the association with domestic work with femininities contributes to the exclusion of domestic work from the majority of national labour laws.<ref>Salleh, \"Ecological Debt: Embodied Debt,\" 3.</ref>\n\nDue to a lack of economic opportunity in the Global South, many women with families leave their countries of origin and their own families to pursue work in the Global North. When they arrive in their country of destination, their work often entails caring for another family (including children and the elderly). Domestic workers often migrate to financially support their immediate family, extended family, and even other members of their community. While enduring dangerous and demeaning working and living conditions in the North, the majority of their wages are remitted to their countries of origin.<ref>Jindy Pettman, \"Migration,\" in Gender Matters in Global Politics ed. Laura Shepherd (Routledge, New York: 2010) 257.</ref>\n\nAn additional argument has been made that because their work takes place within the private sphere, they are often rendered invisible and employers are able to withhold their travel documents, confining them to their employers' home and inhibiting their access to legal redress. Those making this argument assert that the result of what they refer to as a power dynamic and an asserted lack of labour rights, is that domestic workers are often forbidden to contact their families and often go months, years, and even decades without seeing their families, whose lives their remittances are supporting.\n\nFurther, it has been argued that their ability to fill labour shortages and accept positions within the reproductive labour force that citizens of their host countries would reject underpins the development of the global capitalist system,<ref>Pettman, Jindy, \"Migration,\" 257.</ref> Simultaneously, and that they are enabling the beneficiaries of their remittances in the South to ascend the social ladder. To some, these arguments lead to a conclusion that both circumstances in the North and South constitute embodied debt through the improvement of one's life at the expense of another's hardship, and that the labour of such workers is too often not seen as work, due to the association of their gendered bodies with reproductive labour.\n\nHowever, on June 17, 2011, after 70 years of lobbying by civil society groups, the ILO adopted a convention with the aim of protecting and empowering domestic workers. Much of lobbying that contributed toward the ratification of ILO C189 was done by domestic workers groups, demonstrating that they are not merely victims but agents of change. That only two labour receiving countries have ratified the convention has been argued by some to demonstrates the reluctance of governments to acknowledge what such advocates see as a debt owed by society to such workers and to repay that perceived debt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfasia.org/home/459-ratify-and-implement-ilo-convention-189-on-decent-work-for-domestic-workers-now%20 |title=Ratify and Implement ILO Convention 189 on Decent Work for Domestic Workers Now! |publisher=Mfasia.org |date=2012-06-16 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212080343/http://www.mfasia.org/home/459-ratify-and-implement-ilo-convention-189-on-decent-work-for-domestic-workers-now |archivedate=2013-12-12 }}</ref>\n\nSuch advocates assert that the ratification and enforcement of ILO C189 would mean that migrant domestic workers would enjoy the same labour rights as other more 'masculine' fields as well as the citizens of their destination countries. An incomplete list of basic rights guaranteed by ILO C189 under Article 7 includes: maximum working hours; fixed minimum wages; paid leave; provision of food and accommodation; and weekly rest periods. Guaranteeing these rights to migrant domestic workers would not constitute repayment the embodied debt owed to them, but they are entitled to these rights as they are both workers and human beings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:2551460|title=Convention C189 - Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189)|website=www.ilo.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103064407/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:2551460|archivedate=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Social effects==\n[[File:Pilgrimage of Korea(n) lady.jpg|thumb|left|upright =2.0|Male servants carrying a [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquin]] and female maid with a traditional fan (Korea c.1904)]]\nAs women currently dominate the domestic labor market throughout the world, they have learned to navigate the system of domestic work both in their own countries and abroad in order to maximize the benefits of entering the domestic labor market.\n\nAmong the disadvantages of working as a domestic worker is the fact that women working in this sector are working in an area often regarded as a [[private sphere]].<ref name = \"Connelly\">Arat-Koc, S.

Their isolation is increased by their invisibility in the public sphere and the repetitive, intangible nature of their work decreases its value, making the workers themselves more dispensable.<ref name=\"Domestic Workers' Social Networks 1994 pp. 50-64\">Regulating the Unregulated?: Domestic Workers' Social Networks, Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo, Social Problems, Vol. 41, No. 1, Special Issue on Immigration, Race, and Ethnicity in America (Feb., 1994), pp. 50\u201364</ref> The level of isolation women face also depends on the type of domestic work they are involved with.

Some have to perform tasks considered degrading showing a manifestation of employer power over worker powerlessness.

In modern times, it has been a norm among upper and upper-middle-class families in the Philippines to hire at least one maidservant-caretaker (''katulong''/''kasambahay/yaya'') to care for the household and children. Most, particularly maidservant-caretakers (''katulong''/''kasambahay/yaya''), live together in the house of their master's family with usually only a day off per month. This practice has eventually influenced the architecture of some houses or apartment condos where it has become a norm to section a room where domestic maidservants sleep as their personal room, usually near the kitchen or laundry area. Some wealthy families also section off an area or house where all the maidservants sleep or a part of the kitchen where they eat separate from the master's table. There are also employment agencies and special government laws regarding the regulation of domestic worker employment, such as the \"Domestic Workers Act\" or \"Batas Kasambahay\" in [https://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2013/ra_10361_2013.html Republic Act No 10361]. Many live underpaid since many are informally hired or salaries are not declared truthfully to government offices or have an agreement instead to pay through other means, such as paying for their education, pension, or to send money back to their families. This practice was eventually exported to neighboring countries and all other countries that [[Overseas Filipino Worker|overseas Filipino workers]] (OFWs) have worked in, such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[China]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and other countries in the [[Middle East]], and etc., hence some maidservants continue living with the same mindset of how domestic worker culture was practiced in the Philippines. This has also, at times, been used as a cause to look down upon overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in the countries where they can be found. It has sometimes created controversies in other countries such as abuse charges in several countries in the Middle East or like the case of [[Flor Contemplacion]], who was executed in Singapore for murder allegations. There have also been documentaries or [[Romantic comedy|rom-com]] movies made in the Philippines about the plight or life of domestic workers, particularly maidservant-caretakers (''katulong''/''kasambahay''/''yaya'').\n\n===Singapore===\nData from Singapore's [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Ministry of Manpower]] (MOM), showed that in June 2019 there were some 255,800 Foreign Domestic Workers (FDW) in Singapore. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers|title=Foreign workforce numbers|website=Ministry of Manpower Singapore|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> The demand for Foreign Domestic Workers came about from the desire of the Singapore government to employ local women in the workforce. Starting with the Foreign Maid Scheme in 1978 Malaysia (with whom there were special immigration arrangements), Bangladesh, Burma, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand were recruiting grounds for domestic workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/case-studies/fdws_in_singapore.pdf?sfvrsn=2ac5960b_2|title=Foreign Domestic Workers in Singapore: Social and Historical Perspectives|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Nearly 20% of Singapore household has a domestic worker which has been attributed to rising wealth, parents who both work as well as the ageing population.

For example in the case of an Indonesian maid had her teeth knocked out by a hammer. On 1 August, her employer had been sentenced to 11 years\u2019 jail and was also ordered to pay the foreign domestic worker about S$56,500 in compensation or serve an additional five months. The husband of her abuser received a sentence of 15 months\u2019 jail and needed to pay S$1,000 in compensation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/maid-abuse-woman-hammered-maids-teeth-worst-recent-case-11772958|title=Jail for woman who hammered out maid\u2019s teeth in 'worst' recent case of abuse|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Saudi Arabia,===\nAccording to a 2008 report by [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW), the [[Ministry of Labor and Social Development (Saudi Arabia)|Saudi Ministry of Labor]] provided official figures of 1.2 million household workers in [[Saudi Arabia]] including domestic workers, drivers, and gardeners. The report stated that the Gulf country employed nearly 1.5 million women domestic workers from [[Indonesia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Philippines]]. Domestic workers estimated approximately 600,000 from Indonesia, 275,000 from Sri Lanka and 200,000 from Philippines. However, HRW reported that a number of domestic workers in Saudi Arabia face a range of abuses. Besides, the organization also interviewed Saudi labor and social affairs official, who acknowledged the issue of domestic worker abuse. The report stated that no accurate figure exists to highlight the total violations of labor rights and other human rights that women migrant domestic workers confront in the Arab nation.<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/saudiarabia0708_1.pdf|title=\"As If I Am Not Human\" Abuses against Asian Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia|accessdate=7 July 2008|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n==== Blacks post-Civil War to World War I ====\nIn the United States, [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] legally ended in 1865, however, the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] informed the former slaves now classified as freedmen and women that they could either sign labor contracts with white planters or be evicted from the land that they had lived on.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite thesis|last=Armstrong|first=Trena|title=The hidden help : black domestic workers in the civil rights movement.|date=2012|publisher=University of Louisville|doi=10.18297/etd/46|language=en}}</ref> Most freedmen in the South signed labor contracts with their former white slave owners because that was the only work experience they had.  With limited skills and illiteracy, many men turned to become [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]], whereas the majority of women participated in domestic work. Not only were they not qualified for other jobs, but they were denied other jobs and segregated from American society purely based on the color of their skin. The South wanted to keep segregation alive and hence passed legislation such as the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Laws]] post-Civil war which denied African Americans of legal equality and political rights.  These laws kept many African Americans as a second-class status up until new laws ended segregation in the 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A People and a Nation: A History of the United States|last=Norton|first=Mary Beth|publisher=New York: Houghton Mifflin Company|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=856\u2013858}}</ref>\n\nUp until the mid-twentieth century, domestic work was a prominent source of income for many women of different ethnic backgrounds. Many of these women were either African American or immigrants. More specifically, the post-civil war South had a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers. At the turn of the nineteenth century, there was also a high concentration of African Americans working as domestic workers in the North.  Many African American women migrated to the North for better work opportunities and higher wages compared to their employment options in the South. The African American women who worked as domestic workers were generally treated as poor, childlike beings that were seen as victims of their own ignorance of living in communities of crime and other societal infringements.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, despite the stereotypes labeled upon domestic workers, these women still settled for these positions because the only occupations that were open to African American women before World War I were domestic services.  It was necessary they worked along with their husbands in order to keep their families financially supported.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=May|first=Vanessa|date=March 2012|title=Working at Home: Domestic Workers in the Nineteenth and Twentieth-Century United States|journal=History Compass|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=284\u2013293|doi=10.1111/j.1478-0542.2011.00832.x|issn=1478-0542}}</ref>\n\nFrequently underpaid, African American servants commonly took food scraps and discarded clothing from their employers in a practice known as \u201c[[pan toting]]\u201d or the \u201cservice pan\u201d.<ref name=Hunter-132>{{citation | last = Hunter | first = Tera W. | title = To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Massachusetts | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0674893092 | page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674893092/page/132 132] | url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674893092/page/132 }}</ref> The service pan augmented wages in almost two-thirds of the employers\u2019 households in Athens, Georgia, in 1913.<ref name=Sharpless-74>{{citation | last = Sharpless | first = Rebecca | title = Cooking in Other Women\u2019s Kitchens: Domestic Workers in the South, 1865-1960 | location = Chapel Hill | publisher = University of North Carolina | year = 2010 | page = 74}}</ref> The pan system was used by employers to justify paying a lower wage,<ref name=Sharpless-154>Sharpless, p. 154.</ref> and used by domestic workers to counter their employers\u2019 dishonesty.<ref name=Hunter-132 /> Whites also pointed to the practice of pan toting as proof that \u201ca Negro could not help but steal\u201d, thereby reinforcing stereotypes of \u201cblack inferiority and dependency\u201d and rationalizing racist paternalism.<ref name=Sharpless-154 />\n\n==== Blacks in the Great Depression ====\nDuring the Great Depression, many domestic workers lost their jobs.  This is because many white families lost their source of income and were not able to pay domestic workers to work in their home.  At this time, many domestic workers relied on asking strangers on the street for housework such as cleaning.  They house jumped, looking for any job that they could get. The domestic workforce was significantly impacted by the Great Depression which caused a decrease in their wages and an intolerable 18 hour workday.  Also, agricultural workers and the African American women working as domestic workers at this time were explicitly excluded from social security and the FLSA in the New Deal legislation.<ref name=\":1\" />  This is because the New Dealer politicians were more worried about losing support from the Southern Democrats in Congress who supported segregation rather than refusing coverage for many African Americans.<ref name=\":1\" /> Unlike their white counterparts, African Americans did not form labor unions because they lacked the resources, consciousness, and the access to networks used for union recruiting.  On top of that, the domestic workers would not typically have earned enough money to be able to afford being a part of a union.  Even if the African American domestic workers wanted to advance in society, it was nearly impossible because the racial structures in the United States rarely allowed them class mobility.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, domestic workers that were white such as the Irish and the Germans utilized working in middle-class homes to their advantage.  Working in the middle-class homes served to Americanize, allowing the workers to identify more with their employers than women of their own class and instilled an aspiration to become middle-class status.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Blacks in 1960s America ====\nNearly ninety percent of African American women worked as domestic workers during the Civil Rights Movement era.<ref name=\":0\" />  Their participation in the Civil Rights Movement went fairly undocumented, and despite their low-status career in the United States, they were beneficial for the betterment of society and the status of the African American race.  It has been noted that the southern African American women were the backbone of the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nSince many white households relied on the African American domestic workers for housework, the workers were able to have a direct impact on the white race when rebelling for their civil rights.  The African American domestic workers boycotted buses and tried to register to vote, and many were denied and imprisoned. However, the domestic workers utilized imprisonment to educate other African American women on the Civil Rights Movement and what to do to contribute.  Additionally, typically the domestic workers rebelled in an informal manner, such as resisting to live in the same home in which they worked.  By doing this, the African American domestic workers transformed the domestic services, and collective organizations came about promoting a better work environment for African American domestic workers.  Their act of rebellion gave way for a change of how they were treated, how they were paid, and how they were respected.\n\n==Varieties of domestic workers==\n[[File:A valet in India.jpg|thumb|A [[valet]] in India, c. 1870]]\n[[File:Amesservants.jpg|thumb|The servants at Stonehouse Hill, the estate of F.

If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a ballot, which is randomly selected.\n\nCritics have suggested that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students.

NCEA replaced the old [[School Certificate (New Zealand)|School Certificate]], [[Sixth Form Certificate]] and [[New Zealand University Bursary|Bursary]] systems.\n\nThe IGCSE and A-level exams of the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] Board are offered at some schools. For these qualifications, IGCSE is sat in year 11, [[Advanced Level (UK)|AS-level]] in year 12 and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] in year 13. Neither of these independent qualifications are registered on the [[NZQA National Qualifications Framework]].\n\nUniversity Entrance, based on NCEA results, allows entrance to New Zealand universities.

If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a ballot, which is randomly selected.\n\nCritics have suggested that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lowers socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationforum.org.nz/documents/e_newsletter/12_03/Dec03_Chchzone.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905164438/http://www.educationforum.org.nz/documents/e_newsletter/12_03/Dec03_Chchzone.htm |archivedate=2005-09-05 }}</ref>\n\n== School qualifications ==\nThe Government-run student qualification system is the [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement]] (\"NCEA\"). At some schools students can opt for [[IGCSE]]/[[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] (popularly known as \"Cambridge exams\") or the [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate Diploma]].\n\nNCEA has three levels, one for each of the last three years of secondary school. It contains a mix of internal and external assessments. NCEA replaced the old [[School Certificate (New Zealand)|School Certificate]], [[Sixth Form Certificate]] and [[New Zealand University Bursary|Bursary]] systems.\n\nThe IGCSE and A-level exams of the [[Cambridge International Examinations]] Board are offered at some schools. For these qualifications, IGCSE is sat in year 11, [[Advanced Level (UK)|AS-level]] in year 12 and [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-level]] in year 13. Neither of these independent qualifications are registered on the [[NZQA National Qualifications Framework]].\n\nUniversity Entrance, based on NCEA results, allows entrance to New Zealand universities. [[New Zealand Scholarship]] is a qualification pitched at students within the top stanine level.\n\n== Fees and donations ==\n{{main|School Fees in New Zealand}}\nStrictly speaking, no fees need to be paid for education at a state school provided the student is a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident, or an Australian citizen. However, most schools also ask for a \"voluntary donation\" from parents, informally known as \"school fees\" or a \"parental contribution\".\n\n== Trades unions ==\nThe [[Post Primary Teachers' Association]] (PPTA) is the largest trade union in secondary education in New Zealand with 18,000 teaching staff employed in state and state integrated secondary schools being members.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ppta.org.nz/index.php/about-ppta |title= About PPTA |publisher= Post Primary Teachers' Association |accessdate= 14 February 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130208014458/http://ppta.org.nz/index.php/about-ppta |archivedate= 8 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIndependent Schools Education Association (ISEA) is the union for teaching and non-teaching staff in New Zealand independent (private) schools.<ref>http://www.isea.org.nz</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Education in New Zealand]]\n* For a list of New Zealand schools with Wikipedia articles, see [[:Category:Schools in New Zealand|Category:Schools in New Zealand]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.minedu.govt.nz/ Ministry of Education (New Zealand)]\n* [http://www.minedu.govt.nz/index.cfm?layout=document&documentid=6169&indexid=5633&indexparentid=5611 Guide to Schooling in New Zealand]\u2014covers primary, intermediate and secondary schooling.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pinnate]] and reach  {{nowrap|3-5 m}} long. A young palm produces about 30 leaves a year. Established palms over 10 years produce about 20 leaves a year. The [[flower]]s are produced in dense clusters; each individual flower is small, with three sepals and three petals.\n\nThe palm fruit takes 5\u20136 months to mature from pollination to maturity. It is reddish, about the size of a large plum, and grows in large bunches. Each fruit is made up of an oily, fleshy outer layer (the pericarp), with a single [[seed]] (the [[palm kernel]]), also rich in oil. When ripe, each bunch of fruit weighs between {{convert|5|and|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} depending on the age of the palm tree.\n\n==Planting==\n[[File:Elaeis guineensis fruits on tree.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Oil palm fruit]]\nFor each [[hectare]] of oil palm, which is harvested year-round, the annual production averages 20&nbsp;tonnes {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} of fruit yielding {{nowrap|4,000 kg}} of palm oil and {{nowrap|750 kg}} {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} of [[seed]] kernels yielding {{nowrap|500 kg}} of high-quality palm kernel oil, as well as {{nowrap|600 kg}} of kernel meal. Kernel meal is processed for use as [[livestock]] feed.<ref name = MPOB>{{Cite web| title = About the Malaysian Palm Oil Industry | publisher = Malaysian Palm Oil Board|url=http://www.palmoilworld.org/about_malaysian-industry.html}}</ref>\n\nAll modern, commercial planting material consists of tenera palms or DxP hybrids, which are obtained by crossing thickshelled dura with shell-less pisifera. Although common commercial germinated seed is as thick-shelled as the dura mother palm, the resulting palm will produce thin-shelled tenera fruit. An alternative to germinated seed, once constraints to mass production are overcome, are tissue-cultured or \"clonal\" palms, which provide \"true copies\" of high-yielding DxP palms.\n\nAn oil palm nursery must have an uninterrupted supply of clean water and topsoil which is both well-structured and sufficiently deep to accommodate three rounds of on-site bag-filling. About 35&nbsp;ha can grow enough seedlings over a three-year period to plant a 5,000-ha plantation. Prenursery seedlings must be watered daily. Whenever rainfall is less than 10&nbsp;mm per day, irrigation is required, and the system must be capable of uniformly applying 6.5&nbsp;mm water per day.\n\nPrenursery seedlings in the four-leaf stage of development (10 to 14 weeks after planting) are usually transplanted to the main nursery after their gradual adjustment to full sunlight and a rigid selection process. During culling, seedlings that have grassy, crinkled, twisted, or rolled leaves are discarded.\n\nWeeds growing in the [[polybag]]s must be carefully pulled out. Herbicides should not be used. Numerous insects (ants, armyworms, bagworms, aphids, thrips, mites, grasshoppers, and mealybugs) and vertebrates (rats, squirrels, porcupines, wild boar, and monkeys) are pests in oil-palm nurseries and must be carefully identified before control measures are implemented.\n\nAfter eight months in the nursery, normal healthy plants should be 0.8\u20131&nbsp;m in height and display five to eight functional leaves.\n\nThe proper approach to oil palm development begins with the establishment of leguminous cover plants, immediately following land clearing. They help prevent soil erosion and surface run-off, improve soil structure and palm root development, increase the response to mineral fertilizer in later years, and reduce the danger of micronutrient deficiencies. Leguminous cover plants also help prevent outbreaks of ''Oryctes'' beetles, which nest in exposed decomposing vegetation. Both phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are needed to maximize the leguminous cover plants' symbiotic nitrogen-fixation potential of around 200&nbsp;kg nitrogen/ha/yr, and are applied to most soils at 115 to 300&nbsp;kg phosphorus oxide/ha and 35 to 60&nbsp;kg potassium oxide/ha. Young palms are severely set back where grasses are allowed to dominate the inter-row vegetation, particularly on poor soils where the correction of nutrient deficiencies is difficult and costly.\n\n==Crop nutrient==\n[[File:Elaeis guineensis0.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Oil palm ''Elaeis guinnensis'']]\n[[Mineral uptake|Nutrient uptake]] is low during the first year, but increases steeply between year one and year three (when harvesting commences) and stabilizes around years five to six. Early applications of [[fertilizer]], better planting material, and more rigid culling have led to a dramatic increase in early yields in the third to sixth years from time of planting. In regions without a significant [[drought|drop in rainfall]], yields of over 25 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches per hectare have been achieved in the second year of harvesting.\n\n[[Nitrogen deficiency]] is usually associated with conditions of water-logging, heavy weed infestation, and topsoil [[erosion]]. Symptoms are a general paling and stiffening of the pinnae, which lose their glossy lustre. Extended deficiency will reduce the number of effective fruit bunches produced, as well as the bunch size.\n\nPhosphorus-deficient leaves do not show specific symptoms, but frond length, bunch size, and trunk diameter are all reduced.\n\n[[Potassium deficiency (plants)|Potassium deficiency]] is very common and is the major yield constraint in sandy or [[peat|peaty soils]]. The most frequent symptom is \"confluent orange spotting\". Pale green spots appear on the pinnae of older leaves; as the deficiency intensifies, the spots turn orange or reddish-orange and [[desiccation]] sets in, starting from the tips and outer margins of the pinnae. Other symptoms are \"orange blotch\" and \"midcrown yellowing\". In soils having a low water-holding capacity (sands and peats), potassium deficiency can lead to a rapid, premature desiccation of fronds.\n\n[[Copper deficiency (plants)|Copper deficiency]] is common on deep peat soils and occurs also on very sandy soils. It appears initially as whitish-yellow mottling of younger fronds. As the deficiency intensifies, yellow, mottled, interveinal stripes appear, and rusty, brown spots develop on the distal ends of leaflets. Affected fronds and leaflets are stunted and leaflets dry up. On sandy soils, palms recover rapidly after a basal application of 50&nbsp;grams of copper sulphate. On peat soils, lasting correction of copper deficiency is difficult, as applied [[copper sulphate]] is rendered unavailable. A promising method of correcting copper deficiency on peat soil is to mix copper sulphate with [[clay]] soil and to form tennis-ball sized \"copper mudballs\" that are placed around the palm to provide a slow-release source of available copper.\n\nHealthy, well selected seedlings are necessary for early and sustained high yield. In most cases, granular multinutrient compound fertilizers are the preferred nutrient source for seedlings in the nursery. Where subsoil is used to fill the polybags, extra dressings of Kieserite may be required (10-15&nbsp;g every six to eight weeks). Where compound fertilizers are not available, equivalent quantities of straight materials should be used.\n\nTo maintain good fertilizer response and high yields in older palms, selective [[thinning]] is often necessary.\n\n==Cross-breeding==\n{{expand section|Cross-breeding ''E. guineensis'' with ''E. oleifera'' should be included|date=September 2012}}\nUnlike other relatives, oil palms do not produce [[offshoot (plant)|offshoot]]s; propagation is by sowing the [[seed]]s.\n\nSeveral [[variety (botany)|varieties]] and [[Form (botany)|forms]] of ''Elaeis guineensis'' have been selected that have different characteristics. These include:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicos.org/Name/2400016?tab=subordinatetaxa|title=Tropicos}}</ref>\n:::::*''E. guineensis'' fo. ''dura''\n:::::*''E. guineensis'' var. ''pisifera''\n:::::*''E, guineensis'' fo. ''tenera''\n\nBefore the Second World War, selection work had started in the ''Deli dura'' population in Malaya. Pollen was imported from Africa, and DxT and DxP crosses were made. Segregation of fruit forms in crosses made in the 1950s was often incorrect. In the absence of a good marker gene, there was no way of knowing whether control of pollination was adequate.\n\nAfter the work of Beirnaert and Vanderweyen (1941), it became feasible to monitor the efficacy of controlled pollination. From 1963 until the introduction of the palm-pollinating weevil ''Elaeidobius kamerunicus'' in 1982, contamination in Malaysia's commercial plantings was generally low. Thrips, the main pollinating agent at that time, apparently rarely gained access to bagged female inflorescences. However, ''E. kamerunicus'' is much more persistent, and after it was introduced, ''Deli dura'' contamination{{clarify|date=September 2012}} became a significant problem. This problem apparently persisted for much of the 1980s, but in a 1991 comparison of seed sources, contamination had been reduced to below 2%, indicating control had been restored.\n\nA 1992 study at a trial plot in [[Banting]], Selangor, revealed the \"yield of Deli dura oil palms after four generations of selection was 60% greater than that of the unselected base population. Crossing the dura and pisifera to give the thin-shelled tenera fruit type improved partitioning of dry matter within the fruit, giving a 30% increase in oil yield at the expense of shell, without changing total dry matter production.\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00039396 |first1=R.

A reliable and quick technique was developed for testing the pathogenicity of the fungus by inoculating oil palm germinated seeds.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://palmoilis.mpob.gov.my/publications/TOT/TT-314.pdf |title=Technique for inoculation of oil palm germinated seeds with ganoderma |last1=Idris |first1=A S |last2=Kushairi |first2=D |last3=Ariffin |first3=D |last4=Basri |first4=M W |journal=Malaysian Palm Oil Board Information Series |issue=314 |issn=1511-7871 |date=June 2006}}</ref>\n\nThis fatal disease can lead to losses as much as 80% after repeated planting cycles.

''Ganoderma'' is an extraordinary organism capable exclusively of degrading [[lignin]] to [[carbon dioxide]] and water; celluloses are then available as nutrients for the fungus. It is necessary to consider this mode of attack as a white rot involving lignin biodegradation, for integrated control. The existing literature does not report this area and appears to be concerned particularly with the mode of spread and molecular biology of ''Ganoderma''. The white rot perception opens up new fields in breeding/selecting for resistant cultivars of oil palms with high [[lignin]] content, ensuring the conditions for lignin decomposition are reduced, and simply sealing damaged oil palms to stop decay. The spread likely is by spores rather than roots. The knowledge gained can be employed in the rapid degradation of oil palm waste on the plantation floor by inoculating suitable fungi, and/or treating the waste more appropriately (e.g. chipping and spreading over the floor rather than windrowing).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2006.11.009 |title=Ganoderma disease of oil palm\u2014A white rot perspective necessary for integrated control |year=2007 |last1=Paterson |first1=R.R.M. |journal=Crop Protection |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=1369\u20131376|hdl=1822/7349 }}</ref>\n\nEndophytic bacteria are organisms inhabiting plant organs that at some time in their life cycles can colonize the internal plant tissues without causing apparent harm to the host.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Azevedo |first1=Jo\u00e3o L\u00facio |last2=Maccheroni |first2=Walter |last3=Pereira |first3=Jos\u00e9 Odair |last4=De Ara\u00fajo |first4=Welington Luiz |year=2000 |title=Endophytic microorganisms: a review on insect control and recent advances on tropical plants |journal=Electronic Journal of Biotechnology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15\u20136 |doi=10.2225/vol3-issue1-fulltext-4}}</ref> Introducing endophytic bacteria to the roots to control plant disease is to manipulate the indigenous bacterial communities of the roots in a manner, which leads to enhanced suppression of soil-borne pathogens.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pinnate]] and reach  {{nowrap|3-5 m}} long. A young palm produces about 30 leaves a year. Established palms over 10 years produce about 20 leaves a year. The [[flower]]s are produced in dense clusters; each individual flower is small, with three sepals and three petals.\n\nThe palm fruit takes 5\u20136 months to mature from pollination to maturity. It is reddish, about the size of a large plum, and grows in large bunches. Each fruit is made up of an oily, fleshy outer layer (the pericarp), with a single [[seed]] (the [[palm kernel]]), also rich in oil. When ripe, each bunch of fruit weighs between {{convert|5|and|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} depending on the age of the palm tree.\n\n==Planting==\n[[File:Elaeis guineensis fruits on tree.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Oil palm fruit]]\nFor each [[hectare]] of oil palm, which is harvested year-round, the annual production averages 20&nbsp;tonnes {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} of fruit yielding {{nowrap|4,000 kg}} of palm oil and {{nowrap|750 kg}} {{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} of [[seed]] kernels yielding {{nowrap|500 kg}} of high-quality palm kernel oil, as well as {{nowrap|600 kg}} of kernel meal.

Although common commercial germinated seed is as thick-shelled as the dura mother palm, the resulting palm will produce thin-shelled tenera fruit. An alternative to germinated seed, once constraints to mass production are overcome, are tissue-cultured or \"clonal\" palms, which provide \"true copies\" of high-yielding DxP palms.\n\nAn oil palm nursery must have an uninterrupted supply of clean water and topsoil which is both well-structured and sufficiently deep to accommodate three rounds of on-site bag-filling. About 35&nbsp;ha can grow enough seedlings over a three-year period to plant a 5,000-ha plantation. Prenursery seedlings must be watered daily. Whenever rainfall is less than 10&nbsp;mm per day, irrigation is required, and the system must be capable of uniformly applying 6.5&nbsp;mm water per day.\n\nPrenursery seedlings in the four-leaf stage of development (10 to 14 weeks after planting) are usually transplanted to the main nursery after their gradual adjustment to full sunlight and a rigid selection process. During culling, seedlings that have grassy, crinkled, twisted, or rolled leaves are discarded.\n\nWeeds growing in the [[polybag]]s must be carefully pulled out. Herbicides should not be used. Numerous insects (ants, armyworms, bagworms, aphids, thrips, mites, grasshoppers, and mealybugs) and vertebrates (rats, squirrels, porcupines, wild boar, and monkeys) are pests in oil-palm nurseries and must be carefully identified before control measures are implemented.\n\nAfter eight months in the nursery, normal healthy plants should be 0.8\u20131&nbsp;m in height and display five to eight functional leaves.\n\nThe proper approach to oil palm development begins with the establishment of leguminous cover plants, immediately following land clearing. They help prevent soil erosion and surface run-off, improve soil structure and palm root development, increase the response to mineral fertilizer in later years, and reduce the danger of micronutrient deficiencies. Leguminous cover plants also help prevent outbreaks of ''Oryctes'' beetles, which nest in exposed decomposing vegetation. Both phosphorus and potassium fertilizers are needed to maximize the leguminous cover plants' symbiotic nitrogen-fixation potential of around 200&nbsp;kg nitrogen/ha/yr, and are applied to most soils at 115 to 300&nbsp;kg phosphorus oxide/ha and 35 to 60&nbsp;kg potassium oxide/ha. Young palms are severely set back where grasses are allowed to dominate the inter-row vegetation, particularly on poor soils where the correction of nutrient deficiencies is difficult and costly.\n\n==Crop nutrient==\n[[File:Elaeis guineensis0.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Oil palm ''Elaeis guinnensis'']]\n[[Mineral uptake|Nutrient uptake]] is low during the first year, but increases steeply between year one and year three (when harvesting commences) and stabilizes around years five to six. Early applications of [[fertilizer]], better planting material, and more rigid culling have led to a dramatic increase in early yields in the third to sixth years from time of planting. In regions without a significant [[drought|drop in rainfall]], yields of over 25 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches per hectare have been achieved in the second year of harvesting.\n\n[[Nitrogen deficiency]] is usually associated with conditions of water-logging, heavy weed infestation, and topsoil [[erosion]]. Symptoms are a general paling and stiffening of the pinnae, which lose their glossy lustre. Extended deficiency will reduce the number of effective fruit bunches produced, as well as the bunch size.\n\nPhosphorus-deficient leaves do not show specific symptoms, but frond length, bunch size, and trunk diameter are all reduced.\n\n[[Potassium deficiency (plants)|Potassium deficiency]] is very common and is the major yield constraint in sandy or [[peat|peaty soils]]. The most frequent symptom is \"confluent orange spotting\". Pale green spots appear on the pinnae of older leaves; as the deficiency intensifies, the spots turn orange or reddish-orange and [[desiccation]] sets in, starting from the tips and outer margins of the pinnae. Other symptoms are \"orange blotch\" and \"midcrown yellowing\". In soils having a low water-holding capacity (sands and peats), potassium deficiency can lead to a rapid, premature desiccation of fronds.\n\n[[Copper deficiency (plants)|Copper deficiency]] is common on deep peat soils and occurs also on very sandy soils. It appears initially as whitish-yellow mottling of younger fronds. As the deficiency intensifies, yellow, mottled, interveinal stripes appear, and rusty, brown spots develop on the distal ends of leaflets. Affected fronds and leaflets are stunted and leaflets dry up. On sandy soils, palms recover rapidly after a basal application of 50&nbsp;grams of copper sulphate. On peat soils, lasting correction of copper deficiency is difficult, as applied [[copper sulphate]] is rendered unavailable. A promising method of correcting copper deficiency on peat soil is to mix copper sulphate with [[clay]] soil and to form tennis-ball sized \"copper mudballs\" that are placed around the palm to provide a slow-release source of available copper.\n\nHealthy, well selected seedlings are necessary for early and sustained high yield. In most cases, granular multinutrient compound fertilizers are the preferred nutrient source for seedlings in the nursery. Where subsoil is used to fill the polybags, extra dressings of Kieserite may be required (10-15&nbsp;g every six to eight weeks). Where compound fertilizers are not available, equivalent quantities of straight materials should be used.\n\nTo maintain good fertilizer response and high yields in older palms, selective [[thinning]] is often necessary.\n\n==Cross-breeding==\n{{expand section|Cross-breeding ''E. guineensis'' with ''E. oleifera'' should be included|date=September 2012}}\nUnlike other relatives, oil palms do not produce [[offshoot (plant)|offshoot]]s; propagation is by sowing the [[seed]]s.\n\nSeveral [[variety (botany)|varieties]] and [[Form (botany)|forms]] of ''Elaeis guineensis'' have been selected that have different characteristics.

In the absence of a good marker gene, there was no way of knowing whether control of pollination was adequate.\n\nAfter the work of Beirnaert and Vanderweyen (1941), it became feasible to monitor the efficacy of controlled pollination. From 1963 until the introduction of the palm-pollinating weevil ''Elaeidobius kamerunicus'' in 1982, contamination in Malaysia's commercial plantings was generally low. Thrips, the main pollinating agent at that time, apparently rarely gained access to bagged female inflorescences. However, ''E. kamerunicus'' is much more persistent, and after it was introduced, ''Deli dura'' contamination{{clarify|date=September 2012}} became a significant problem. This problem apparently persisted for much of the 1980s, but in a 1991 comparison of seed sources, contamination had been reduced to below 2%, indicating control had been restored.\n\nA 1992 study at a trial plot in [[Banting]], Selangor, revealed the \"yield of Deli dura oil palms after four generations of selection was 60% greater than that of the unselected base population. Crossing the dura and pisifera to give the thin-shelled tenera fruit type improved partitioning of dry matter within the fruit, giving a 30% increase in oil yield at the expense of shell, without changing total dry matter production.\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00039396 |first1=R.

''Ganoderma'' is an extraordinary organism capable exclusively of degrading [[lignin]] to [[carbon dioxide]] and water; celluloses are then available as nutrients for the fungus. It is necessary to consider this mode of attack as a white rot involving lignin biodegradation, for integrated control. The existing literature does not report this area and appears to be concerned particularly with the mode of spread and molecular biology of ''Ganoderma''. The white rot perception opens up new fields in breeding/selecting for resistant cultivars of oil palms with high [[lignin]] content, ensuring the conditions for lignin decomposition are reduced, and simply sealing damaged oil palms to stop decay. The spread likely is by spores rather than roots. The knowledge gained can be employed in the rapid degradation of oil palm waste on the plantation floor by inoculating suitable fungi, and/or treating the waste more appropriately (e.g. chipping and spreading over the floor rather than windrowing).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cropro.2006.11.009 |title=Ganoderma disease of oil palm\u2014A white rot perspective necessary for integrated control |year=2007 |last1=Paterson |first1=R.R.M. |journal=Crop Protection |volume=26 |issue=9 |pages=1369\u20131376|hdl=1822/7349 }}</ref>\n\nEndophytic bacteria are organisms inhabiting plant organs that at some time in their life cycles can colonize the internal plant tissues without causing apparent harm to the host.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Azevedo |first1=Jo\u00e3o L\u00facio |last2=Maccheroni |first2=Walter |last3=Pereira |first3=Jos\u00e9 Odair |last4=De Ara\u00fajo |first4=Welington Luiz |year=2000 |title=Endophytic microorganisms: a review on insect control and recent advances on tropical plants |journal=Electronic Journal of Biotechnology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=15\u20136 |doi=10.2225/vol3-issue1-fulltext-4}}</ref> Introducing endophytic bacteria to the roots to control plant disease is to manipulate the indigenous bacterial communities of the roots in a manner, which leads to enhanced suppression of soil-borne pathogens.

Furthermore, as the remaining unprotected lowland forest dwindles, developers are looking to plant [[peat]] swamp land, using drainage that begins an [[oxidation]] process of the peat which can release 5,000 to 10,000 years worth of stored carbon. Drained peat is also at very high risk of forest fire.

Examples of these production techniques have been registered as projects under the [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s [[Clean Development Mechanism]].\n\nBy using palm biomass to generate renewable energy, fuels and [[biodegradable]] products, both the [[Energy returned on energy invested|energy balance]] and the greenhouse gas emissions balance for palm biodiesel is improved. For every tonne of palm oil produced from fresh fruit bunches, a farmer harvests around 6 tonnes of waste palm fronds, 1 tonne of palm trunks, 5 tonnes of empty fruit bunches, 1 tonne of press fiber (from the mesocarp of the fruit), half a tonne of [[palm kernel]] endocarp, 250&nbsp;kg of [[palm kernel]] press cake, and 100 tonnes of palm oil mill effluent.{{citation needed|date=August 2012|reason=I found a different number here http://www.americanpalmoil.com/sustainable-pome.html}} Some oil palm plantations incinerate biomass to generate power for palm oil mills.

There, Hindu beliefs mixed with the local [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] culture and started the usage of palm seeds by traditional healers suffixed with ''tok '[[bomoh]]' ''or ''pawang'' in the local language. Every bunch of palm fruit usually bears a single 'illustrious' seed which looks like a shiny black pearl called ''[[sbatmi]]'' in Tamil and ''shakti'' in Malay. These are used as accessories by the ''bomoh'' and ''pawang'' in the mixed ritual for peace with nature as these are believed to contain mystical healing properties, and those wearing them are blessed by nature.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nModern usage has seen more common people keeping these as charm or fashion items to feel at peace, owing to their use by celebrities. All palm seeds contain acid; these ''sbatmi ''are no different and should be handled with care.

On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]].\n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because images rather than words are traditionally used for the [[symbol]]ism of the shoulder patch worn to identify a soldier's unit. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert Tab is unique in that while it is awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army.

Recondo was also sometimes worn in the style of the more traditional shoulder tab.\n\nIn designing the unit patch for the [[Security Force Assistance Brigade]] stood up in 2018, the US Army took inspiration from the classic Recondo arrowhead design.

On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]].\n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because images rather than words are traditionally used for the [[symbol]]ism of the shoulder patch worn to identify a soldier's unit. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert Tab is unique in that while it is awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army.

The Pershing tab was discontinued with the deactivation of units following the elimination of the [[Pershing missile]] system in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=56th Field Artillery Command: Shoulder Sleeve Insignia; Distinctive Unit Insignia |work=[[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=3448&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services}}</ref>\n\n===Air Assault===\n{{multiple image\n|align    = right\n|width1   = 60\n|image1   = 101st Air Assault.jpg\n|caption1 = [[101st Airborne Division|101st Airborne]]\n|width2   = 160\n|image2   = US Army 11th Air Assault Tab-Historical.png\n|caption2 = SSI tab of the former 11th Air Assault Division\n}}\nIn 1963, the [[11th Airborne Division (United States)#Reactivation (11th Air Assault Division) and inactivation|11th Air Assault Division (Test)]] was established\u2014formed from reactivated elements of the [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division]]\u2014to explore the theory and practicality of [[air assault|helicopter assault tactics]], and was inactivated two years later when testing was completed and the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile)]] was formed. Although this test unit wore the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 11th Airborne Division, they replaced their Airborne Tab with a unique Air Assault Tab, believed to be the first and last approved Air Assault Tab in the U.S. Army. However, the [[101st Airborne Division]] is a helicopter air assault division despite officially wearing the Airborne tab rather than the Air Assault tab. On a number of occasions, soldiers of the 101st Airborne have worn a custom made \"Air Assault\" tab rather than the official \"Airborne\" tab as a part of their unit patch.\n\n===Army Air Forces' Command Identification===\n[[File:US Army Air Forces Command Tab-Training Command.png|180px|thumb|Example: The AAF Training Command SSI tab]]\nWith the expansion of the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (AAF) in [[World War II]], the [[:File:US Army Air Corps Hap Arnold Wings.svg|AAF SSI]] became one of the most widely worn shoulder insignias of the war.<ref name=\"AAF Tabs\">[http://www.angelfire.com/md2/patches/airforcearcs.html United States Army, Second World War, Air Force Command Arcs], angelfire.com, by Dr. Howard G.
