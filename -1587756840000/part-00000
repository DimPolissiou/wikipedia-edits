However, French settlement into the area remained limited until the 19th century. The late 19th century and early 20th century saw attempts by the provincial government to assimilate the Franco-Ontarian population into the anglophone majority with the introduction of regulations that promoted the use of English over French. However, in the 1960s, the provincial government began to implement measures to accommodate Franco-Ontarian within its institutions, beginning with the establishment of a public French [[first language]] school system in 1968. French language rights in the province were furthered in the 1970s as a result of ''[[C'est l'temps]]'', a Franco-Ontarian [[civil disobedience]] movement that pressured several governmental departments to adopt bilingual policies. In an effort to accommodate Franco-Ontarians for all its public services, the provincial government passed the ''[[French Language Services Act]]'' in 1986. \n\nThe ''French Language Services Act'' recognized the French language as a \"historic language of Ontario,\" and as an official language of the province's education system, its judiciary, and its legislature.

In an attempt to protect Franco-Ontarian language rights, the [[Francophone Assembly of Ontario|''Association canadienne-fran\u00e7aise d'\u00c9ducation de l'Ontario'']] (ACF\u00c9O) was formed in 1910, who typically opposed the English-only initiatives launched by the [[Orange Order of Canada]], and Irish Catholics led by Michael Fallon, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of London, Ontario|Bishop of London, Ontario]].<ref name=canen2/> However, French Canadian migration throughout Ontario continued, with sawmills and papermills in [[Kapuskasing]], and [[Hearst, Ontario|Hearst]]; and automotive plants in [[Oshawa]] and [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] attracting French Canadian laborers during the 1920s.<ref name=canen3/>\n[[File:Manifestation d ecoliers dans les rues d Ottawa contre le Reglement 17, en fevrier 1916.jpg|thumb|Children in Ottawa protesting against [[Regulation 17]], 1916.

As a result, francophones had to pursue high school education in English, pay tuition to private high schools (which few Franco-Ontarian families could afford), or simply stop attending school after Grade 9.<ref>C.M. Wallace and Ashley Thomson, ''Sudbury: Rail Town to Regional Capital''. [[Dundurn Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55002-170-2}}.</ref> Due to the lack of funding, several generations of Franco-Ontarians grew up without formal education, with the dropout rate for francophones high during this period. Franco-Ontarians thus opted for jobs which did not require reading and mathematical skills, such as mining and forestry, and were virtually absent from white collar jobs. Sociologically, it meant that education was not a value transmitted to younger Franco-Ontarians. Further, those that did have higher levels of education often pursue job opportunities in larger cities, particularly Ottawa or even Montreal, which can create a barrier to economic development in their home communities. As well, even today many students of Franco-Ontarian background are still educated in anglophone schools. This has the effect of reducing the use of French as a first language in the province, and thereby limiting the growth of the Franco-Ontarian community.\n\nQuebec writer [[Yves Beauchemin]]  once controversially referred to the Franco-Ontarian community as ''\"warm corpses\"'' (\u00ab cadavres encore chauds \u00bb) who had no chance of surviving as a community.

An area is designated as a French service area if the francophone population is greater than 5,000 people ''or'' 10 per cent of the community's total population. Due to the 5,000 population threshold, large cities that are actually overwhelmingly anglophone with virtually no francophones population proportional for the size of the city, are nevertheless still subject to the Act. Francophones who live in non-designated areas can also receive French language services by directly contacting the Office of Francophone Affairs in Toronto, or in the nearest designated community.\n\nThe most recent addition to the list of designated areas is the city of Markham. It was named in June 2015, and after the three-year implementation period provided for by the French Language Services Act, officially became a bilingual service centre in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.ontario.ca/ofa/en/2015/06/ontario-to-offer-french-language-services-in-markham.html|title=Ontario to Offer French-Language Services in Markham|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=April 23, 2015|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|website=news.ontario.ca}}</ref> Enforcement of the French Language Services Act is conducted through the office of the provincial French Language Services Commissioner.

Francophones in some parts of the province have noted some difficulty in actually accessing French language services, especially in civil litigation matters; for example, francophones in the justice system have sometimes faced unnecessary and expensive delays in their judicial proceedings, or been forced to proceed in English even if they were merely functional but not fluent in the language, due to gaps in the system's ability to actually provide full French services.<ref>Daniel Kitts, [https://www.tvo.org/article/why-francophones-are-fighting-for-access-to-justice-in-ontario \"Why francophones are fighting for access to justice in Ontario\"].

As a result, public French-language elementary and secondary schools are administered through its eight separate school boards, or four secularized boards. These school boards were formed after the passage of the ''Fewer School Boards Act'' in 1997,<ref name=canen2/> with a number of secularized and separate school boards being split and re-consolidated based on language. The re-consolidated French school boards served a significantly larger [[catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] than an English-language school board in the province due to the smaller francophone population.\n\nIn addition to public elementary and secondary school, a number of [[private school]]s also operate with French as the primary instructional language.\n\n===Post-secondary===\n[[File:La Cit\u00e9 coll\u00e9giale.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Aerial view of [[Coll\u00e8ge La Cit\u00e9]] campus in Ottawa.

The former is based in Sudbury, and operates satellite campuses throughout northern Ontario, and Toronto; while the latter is based in Ottawa, with a secondary campus in Hawkesbury. A third French-language college, [[Coll\u00e8ge des Grands-Lacs]], operated in Toronto from 1995 to 2002.

Three other Ontario-based universities are officially bilingual institutions, offering instruction in both English and French.

They include [[Dominican University College]], a university college affiliated with [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa; and [[Glendon College]], a federated college of [[York University]] in Toronto.<ref name=school/> The [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]], a graduate school of the [[University of Toronto]], is also functionally bilingual.<ref name=school/> Although these affiliated institutions are bilingual and offer instruction in French, their parent university are otherwise an anglophone institution.\n\n==Language==\nThe dialects of French spoken in Ontario are similar to, but distinct from, [[Quebec French]] and constitute part of the greater [[Canadian French]] dialect. Due to the large English majority in the province, English loanwords are sometimes used in the informal or slang registers of Franco-Ontarian French. While English loanwords occur to a large extent in many varieties of French in Canada and Europe, there has been more of a conscious effort in Quebec to eliminate anglicisms.\n\nIn addition, the majority of Franco-Ontarians are, out of necessity, functionally or fluently bilingual in English, a fact that encourages borrowing, as does the fact that the English language has a greater prestige in the province from its being a majority language. Franco-Ontarian communities with a small francophone population tend to have more English-influenced French, and some younger speakers there may feel more comfortable using English than French. On the other hand, the French spoken in French-dominant Ontarian communities (such as Hearst and Hawkesbury), or in those communities near the Quebec border (such as Ottawa), is virtually indistinguishable from Quebec French.\n\nFurthermore, improved access to publicly funded French-language schools and the establishment of bilingual universities and French language community colleges has improved French-language proficiency in younger populations.\n\n==Culture==\nThe primary cultural organization of the Franco-Ontarian community is the [[AFO (Canada)|Assembl\u00e9e de la francophonie de l'Ontario]], or AFO, which coordinates many of the community's cultural and political activities.\n\nFranco-Ontarians retain many cultural traditions from their [[French Canadian]] ancestry. For example, unmarried elder siblings ''dansent sur leurs bas'' (dance on their socks) when their younger siblings get married. [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] Franco-Ontarians attend ''messe de minuit'' (midnight mass) on [[Christmas Eve]]. Many Franco-Ontarians also enjoy late night feasts/parties on Christmas Eve, called ''[[r\u00e9veillon]]'', at which [[tourti\u00e8re]] is a common dish.\n\n===Franco-Ontarian identity===\nThe concept of Franco-Ontarian as a distinct cultural identity emerged primarily in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=lamort>[https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/idees/503559/la-mort-presumee-du-canada-francais \"La mort pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du Canada fran\u00e7ais\"].

[[Le Nordir]], 1999. {{ISBN|2921365855}}.</ref> \n\n====Definition==== \nThe term ''Franco-Ontarian'' has two related usages, which overlap closely but are not identical: it may refer to francophone residents of Ontario, regardless of their place of birth, or to people of French Canadian ancestry ''born'' in Ontario, regardless of their primary language or current place of residence. The term ''Ontarois'' is used sometimes to distinguish French-speaking Ontarians, while the general term for Ontarian in French is ''Ontarien''. The use of the term ''Ontarois'' follows the convention that a francophone minority is referred to with endings of -ois\n\nIn popular usage, the first meaning predominates and the second is poorly understood. Although most Franco-Ontarians meet both definitions, there are notable exceptions. For example, although [[Louise Charron]] was the first native-born Franco-Ontarian appointed to the bench of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], she was preceded as a francophone judge from Ontario by [[Louise Arbour]], a [[French-speaking Quebecer|Quebecer]] who worked in Ontario for much of her professional career as a lawyer and judge. As a result, both women have been referred to as \"the first Franco-Ontarian Supreme Court justice\", although the technically correct practice is to credit Charron, Franco-Ontarian in both senses, with that distinction.\n\nConversely, two of the most famous [[rock music|rock]] musicians from Ontario, [[Avril Lavigne]] and [[Alanis Morissette]], are Franco-Ontarian by the second definition but not by the first, since they were born to Franco-Ontarian parents but currently live outside Ontario and work primarily in English. Former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] was born in Windsor to a Franco-Ontarian father from [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]] and an anglophone mother, although many Canadians consider him a Quebecer as he represented a [[Montreal]] [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] in Parliament.\n\nBoth meanings can be politically charged. Using the second to the exclusion of the first may be considered offensive to some in that it excludes francophones born in or with [[ethnic origin]]s from other francophone countries from the Franco-Ontarian community. Using the first to the exclusion of the second obscures the very real ethno-cultural distinctions that exist between Franco-Ontarians, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, [[Acadians]], [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] and other Canadian francophone communities, and the pressures toward assimilation into the [[English Canadian]] majority that the community faces. As a result, the complex political and sociological context of ''Franco-Ontarian'' can only be fully understood by recognizing both meanings and understanding the distinctions between the two.\n\n====Franco-Ontarian Flag====<!-- This section is linked from [[Trillium]] -->\n[[File:Harty ON.jpg|thumb|A Franco-Ontarian flag (left-foreground) at a welcome sign for [[Harty, Ontario|Harty]], Ontario.]]\nThe [[Franco-Ontarian flag]] consists of two bands of green and white. The left portion has a solid light green background with a white [[fleur-de-lys]] in the middle, while the right portion has a solid white background with a stylized green [[trillium]] in the middle. The green represents the summer months, while the white represents the winter months. The trillium is the floral symbol of Ontario, while the fleur-de-lys represents the [[French-Canadian]] heritage of the Franco-Ontarian community.

The late 19th century and early 20th century saw attempts by the provincial government to assimilate the Franco-Ontarian population into the anglophone majority with the introduction of regulations that promoted the use of English over French. However, in the 1960s, the provincial government began to implement measures to accommodate Franco-Ontarian within its institutions, beginning with the establishment of a public French [[first language]] school system in 1968. French language rights in the province were furthered in the 1970s as a result of ''[[C'est l'temps]]'', a Franco-Ontarian [[civil disobedience]] movement that pressured several governmental departments to adopt bilingual policies. In an effort to accommodate Franco-Ontarians for all its public services, the provincial government passed the ''[[French Language Services Act]]'' in 1986. \n\nThe ''French Language Services Act'' recognized the French language as a \"historic language of Ontario,\" and as an official language of the province's education system, its judiciary, and its legislature.

Franco-Ontarians thus opted for jobs which did not require reading and mathematical skills, such as mining and forestry, and were virtually absent from white collar jobs. Sociologically, it meant that education was not a value transmitted to younger Franco-Ontarians. Further, those that did have higher levels of education often pursue job opportunities in larger cities, particularly Ottawa or even Montreal, which can create a barrier to economic development in their home communities. As well, even today many students of Franco-Ontarian background are still educated in anglophone schools.

An area is designated as a French service area if the francophone population is greater than 5,000 people ''or'' 10 per cent of the community's total population. Due to the 5,000 population threshold, large cities that are actually overwhelmingly anglophone with virtually no francophones population proportional for the size of the city, are nevertheless still subject to the Act. Francophones who live in non-designated areas can also receive French language services by directly contacting the Office of Francophone Affairs in Toronto, or in the nearest designated community.\n\nThe most recent addition to the list of designated areas is the city of Markham.

As a result, public French-language elementary and secondary schools are administered through its eight separate school boards, or four secularized boards. These school boards were formed after the passage of the ''Fewer School Boards Act'' in 1997,<ref name=canen2/> with a number of secularized and separate school boards being split and re-consolidated based on language. The re-consolidated French school boards served a significantly larger [[catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] than an English-language school board in the province due to the smaller francophone population.\n\nIn addition to public elementary and secondary school, a number of [[private school]]s also operate with French as the primary instructional language.\n\n===Post-secondary===\n[[File:La Cit\u00e9 coll\u00e9giale.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Aerial view of [[Coll\u00e8ge La Cit\u00e9]] campus in Ottawa.

Due to the large English majority in the province, English loanwords are sometimes used in the informal or slang registers of Franco-Ontarian French. While English loanwords occur to a large extent in many varieties of French in Canada and Europe, there has been more of a conscious effort in Quebec to eliminate anglicisms.\n\nIn addition, the majority of Franco-Ontarians are, out of necessity, functionally or fluently bilingual in English, a fact that encourages borrowing, as does the fact that the English language has a greater prestige in the province from its being a majority language. Franco-Ontarian communities with a small francophone population tend to have more English-influenced French, and some younger speakers there may feel more comfortable using English than French. On the other hand, the French spoken in French-dominant Ontarian communities (such as Hearst and Hawkesbury), or in those communities near the Quebec border (such as Ottawa), is virtually indistinguishable from Quebec French.\n\nFurthermore, improved access to publicly funded French-language schools and the establishment of bilingual universities and French language community colleges has improved French-language proficiency in younger populations.\n\n==Culture==\nThe primary cultural organization of the Franco-Ontarian community is the [[AFO (Canada)|Assembl\u00e9e de la francophonie de l'Ontario]], or AFO, which coordinates many of the community's cultural and political activities.\n\nFranco-Ontarians retain many cultural traditions from their [[French Canadian]] ancestry. For example, unmarried elder siblings ''dansent sur leurs bas'' (dance on their socks) when their younger siblings get married. [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] Franco-Ontarians attend ''messe de minuit'' (midnight mass) on [[Christmas Eve]]. Many Franco-Ontarians also enjoy late night feasts/parties on Christmas Eve, called ''[[r\u00e9veillon]]'', at which [[tourti\u00e8re]] is a common dish.\n\n===Franco-Ontarian identity===\nThe concept of Franco-Ontarian as a distinct cultural identity emerged primarily in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<ref name=lamort>[https://www.ledevoir.com/opinion/idees/503559/la-mort-presumee-du-canada-francais \"La mort pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e du Canada fran\u00e7ais\"].

[[Le Nordir]], 1999. {{ISBN|2921365855}}.</ref> \n\n====Definition==== \nThe term ''Franco-Ontarian'' has two related usages, which overlap closely but are not identical: it may refer to francophone residents of Ontario, regardless of their place of birth, or to people of French Canadian ancestry ''born'' in Ontario, regardless of their primary language or current place of residence. The term ''Ontarois'' is used sometimes to distinguish French-speaking Ontarians, while the general term for Ontarian in French is ''Ontarien''. The use of the term ''Ontarois'' follows the convention that a francophone minority is referred to with endings of -ois\n\nIn popular usage, the first meaning predominates and the second is poorly understood. Although most Franco-Ontarians meet both definitions, there are notable exceptions. For example, although [[Louise Charron]] was the first native-born Franco-Ontarian appointed to the bench of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], she was preceded as a francophone judge from Ontario by [[Louise Arbour]], a [[French-speaking Quebecer|Quebecer]] who worked in Ontario for much of her professional career as a lawyer and judge. As a result, both women have been referred to as \"the first Franco-Ontarian Supreme Court justice\", although the technically correct practice is to credit Charron, Franco-Ontarian in both senses, with that distinction.\n\nConversely, two of the most famous [[rock music|rock]] musicians from Ontario, [[Avril Lavigne]] and [[Alanis Morissette]], are Franco-Ontarian by the second definition but not by the first, since they were born to Franco-Ontarian parents but currently live outside Ontario and work primarily in English. Former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] was born in Windsor to a Franco-Ontarian father from [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]] and an anglophone mother, although many Canadians consider him a Quebecer as he represented a [[Montreal]] [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] in Parliament.\n\nBoth meanings can be politically charged. Using the second to the exclusion of the first may be considered offensive to some in that it excludes francophones born in or with [[ethnic origin]]s from other francophone countries from the Franco-Ontarian community. Using the first to the exclusion of the second obscures the very real ethno-cultural distinctions that exist between Franco-Ontarians, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, [[Acadians]], [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] and other Canadian francophone communities, and the pressures toward assimilation into the [[English Canadian]] majority that the community faces. As a result, the complex political and sociological context of ''Franco-Ontarian'' can only be fully understood by recognizing both meanings and understanding the distinctions between the two.\n\n====Franco-Ontarian Flag====<!-- This section is linked from [[Trillium]] -->\n[[File:Harty ON.jpg|thumb|A Franco-Ontarian flag (left-foreground) at a welcome sign for [[Harty, Ontario|Harty]], Ontario.]]\nThe [[Franco-Ontarian flag]] consists of two bands of green and white.

There are also numerous community theatre groups and school theatre groups.\n\nAnnual music festivals include [[La Nuit sur l'\u00e9tang]] in Sudbury and the [[Festival Franco-Ontarien]] in Ottawa. Notable figures in Franco-Ontarian music include [[Robert Paquette]], [[Marcel Aymar]], [[En Bref]], [[Chuck Labelle]], [[Les Chaizes Muzikales]], [[Brasse-Camarade]], [[Swing (Canadian band)|Swing]], [[Konflit Dramatik]], [[St\u00e9phane Paquette]], [[Damien Robitaille]] and [[CANO]].\n\nThe song \"Notre Place\" by [[Paul Demers]] and Fran\u00e7ois Dub\u00e9, long considered an unofficial anthem of the Franco-Ontarian community after it was written for a gala to celebrate the passage of the French Language Services Act in 1986, was legally designated as the community's official anthem by the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] in 2017.<ref>[http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1019975/notre-place-devient-lhymne-officiel-des-franco-ontariens ''Notre place'' devient l'hymne officiel des Franco-Ontariens].

[[TFO]], March 2, 2017.</ref>\n\n==Media==\n===Print===\nOntario has one francophone daily newspaper, ''[[Le Droit]]'' in Ottawa. However, several other communities in Ontario are served by francophone community weekly papers, including ''[[L'Express (Toronto)|L'Express]]'' and ''Le M\u00e9tropolitain'' in Toronto, ''[[Le Voyageur]]'' in Sudbury, ''[[L'Action (London, Ontario)|L'Action]]'' in London/Sarnia, ''[[Le Rempart]]'' in Windsor, ''Le R\u00e9gional'' in Hamilton-Niagara and ''[[Le Journal de Cornwall]]'' in Cornwall. Important historical publications include Ottawa's ''Le Progr\u00e8s'', which was launched in 1858 as the province's first francophone newspaper, and Sudbury's ''[[L'Ami du peuple (Canadian newspaper)|L'Ami du peuple]]'', which was published from 1942 to 1968.\n\n===Radio===\nOn radio, the Franco-Ontarian community is served primarily by Radio-Canada's [[Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re]] network, which has originating stations in Ottawa ([[CBOF-FM|CBOF]]), Toronto ([[CJBC (AM)|CJBC]]), Sudbury ([[CBON-FM|CBON]]) and Windsor ([[CBEF]]), with rebroadcasters throughout Ontario. ''[[Ici Musique]]'', Radio-Canada's arts and culture network, currently broadcasts only in Ottawa ([[CBOX-FM|CBOX]]), Toronto ([[CJBC-FM]]), Sudbury ([[CBBX-FM|CBBX]]), [[Kitchener-Waterloo]] (CJBC-FM-1) and Windsor (CJBC-FM-2), with an additional transmitter licensed but not yet launched in Timmins.\n\nNon-profit francophone community stations exist in several communities, including Penetanguishene ([[CFRH-FM|CFRH]]), Hearst ([[CINN-FM|CINN]]), Kapuskasing ([[CKGN-FM|CKGN]]), Cornwall ([[CHOD-FM|CHOD]]), Ottawa ([[CJFO-FM|CJFO]]) and Toronto ([[CHOQ-FM|CHOQ]]). Many [[campus radio]] stations air one or two hours per week of French-language programming as well, although only [[CHUO-FM|CHUO]] at the University of Ottawa and [[CKLU-FM|CKLU]] at Laurentian University are officially bilingual stations.\n\nFrancophone commercial radio stations exist in Sudbury ([[CHYC-FM|CHYC]]), Timmins ([[CHYK-FM|CHYK]]) and Sturgeon Falls/North Bay ([[CHYQ-FM|CHYQ]]); all three stations are owned and operated by [[Le5 Communications]], and air distinct locally-targeted morning shows while operating for the remainder of the day as a shared region-wide simulcast with each station originating some of the common programming. Ottawa francophones are served by the commercial radio stations licensed to [[Gatineau]], and many other Eastern Ontario communities are within the broadcast range of the Gatineau and [[Montreal]] media markets. One station in [[Hawkesbury, Ontario|Hawkesbury]] ([[CHPR-FM|CHPR]]) airs a few hours per week of locally oriented programming, but otherwise simulcasts a commercial station from Montreal.\n\n===Television===\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | image1 = CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre - 02.jpg\n | width1 = 134\n | caption1= [[CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre]]\n |footer= [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|Radio-Canada]], Canada's French language [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]] operates two studios in Ontario\n | image2 = CBC Centre.JPG\n | caption2= [[Canadian Broadcasting Centre]], Toronto\n | width2 = 141\n}}\nThe province has two [[Ici Radio-Canada T\u00e9l\u00e9]] stations, [[CBOFT-DT]] in Ottawa and [[CBLFT-DT]] in Toronto, which previously had rebroadcast transmitters throughout the province but remain available provincewide on basic cable. Both stations carry identical programming directed from Radio-Canada's [[master control]] in [[Montreal]], except for local news and advertisements. CBOFT produces a newscast for broadcast only in the Ottawa area, while CBLFT produces another serving the rest of the province. The network formerly also operated [[CBEFT]] in Windsor, which was shut down in 2012.\n\nThe provincial government operates [[TFO]], a sister channel to [[TVOntario]], which is available provincewide via mandatory carriage on basic cable or satellite packages and via online streaming; it formerly also transmitted over the air in selected communities with significant francophone populations, but this was discontinued in 2012. In 2003, TFO produced and aired ''[[Francoeur]]'', the first Franco-Ontarian ''[[t\u00e9l\u00e9roman]]''. In 2008, TFO also began airing the first Franco-Ontarian [[sitcom]], ''[[M\u00e9t\u00e9o+]]'' \u2014 itself, in part, a satire of the Franco-Ontarian community's relative lack of access to local French-language media. In 2012, the production team behind ''M\u00e9t\u00e9o+'' launched ''[[Les Bleus de Ramville]]''.\n[[File:\u00c9mission JAM - James Zhao, Toronto.jpg|thumb|Musicians from ''[[JAM TFO]]'', one of several programs the French language provincial public broadcaster, [[TFO]].]]\nThe Quebec-based francophone network [[TVA (Canadian TV network)|TVA]] as well as specialty channels [[TV5 Qu\u00e9bec Canada]] and [[Ici RDI]] are available on all Ontario cable systems, as these channels are mandated by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] for carriage by all Canadian cable operators. Where there is sufficient local demand for French-language television, Ontario cable systems may also offer French-language channels such as [[V (TV network)|V]], [[Ici ARTV]], [[Elle Fictions]] and [[R\u00e9seau des sports|RDS]], although these channels only have discretionary status outside Quebec and are typically offered only on a [[digital cable]] tier rather than in basic cable packages.\n\n==Notable Franco-Ontarians==\n{{main|List of Franco-Ontarians}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ontario}}\n*[[French Canadians]]\n**[[Acadians]], [[French-speaking Quebecer]], [[Franco-Albertan]], [[Franco-Columbian]], [[Franco-Manitoban]], [[Franco-Newfoundlander]], [[Franco-Nunavois]], [[Fransaskois]], [[Franco-T\u00e9nois]], [[Franco-Yukonnais]]\n*[[English-speaking Quebecker]]\n*[[Muskrat French]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notefoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ofa.gov.on.ca/en/index.html Government of Ontario, Office of Francophone Affairs]\n\n{{French diaspora}}\n\n[[Category:Franco-Ontarian culture|*]]\n[[Category:Franco-Ontarian people|*]]\n[[Category:French-Canadian people|Ontario]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of French descent]]\n", "name_user": "Leventio", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDemographics:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Ontarian"}

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, it was incorporated after it had obtained from then, the Town of Cornwall, a franchise to operate a streetcar service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, it was incorporated after it had obtained from then, the Town of Cornwall, a franchise to operate a streetcar service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2019|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707033751/https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|archive-date=2019-07-07|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.
