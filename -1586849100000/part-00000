After the [[Roman Senate]] declared war on the [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Reign of Cleopatra|queen Cleopatra]], Antony, her lover and ally, betrayed the Roman government and joined the war on Cleopatra's side. After the decisive victory for Octavian at the [[Battle of Actium]], Cleopatra and Antony withdrew to [[Alexandria]], where Octavian besieged the city until both Antony and Cleopatra [[Death of Cleopatra|committed suicide]].\n\nFollowing the end of the war, Octavian brought peace to the Roman state that had been plagued by a century of [[Roman civil wars|civil wars]]. Octavian became the most powerful man in the Roman world and the Senate bestowed upon him the name of [[Augustus (title)|Augustus]] in 27 BC. Octavian, now Augustus, would be the first [[Roman Emperor]] and would transform the [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] Republic into the [[autocracy|autocratic]] [[Roman Empire]].\n\nThe last Republican Civil War would mark the beginning of the [[Pax Romana]], a period of relative internal peace and stability.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Mark Antony]] was in Egypt with [[Cleopatra]] instead of his wife, [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]], who also happened to be [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s sister. Octavian was scheming to find a way to sever ties with [[Mark Antony|Antony]], start a war to crush him, kill a potential rival ([[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and Cleopatra\u2019s son, [[Caesarion]]), and take control of the entire Roman world. He did this by cleverly exposing Antony\u2019s will to the Senate, where he read out how Antony had left all his money to his children by Cleopatra, where they would reign as monarchs over kingdoms that he and Cleopatra would leave to them. Romans were scandalized by this type of behavior. Then Antony divorced Octavia to marry Cleopatra.\n\nOctavian (who later became the emperor Augustus) convinced the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] via a propaganda campaign to start a war against Cleopatra, since they were reluctant to declare war on Antony, as he was a true Roman and the last thing Octavian or the Senate needed was a mutiny. Eventually, Octavian chased Antony\u2019s senatorial supporters from Rome, and in 32 BC, the Roman Senate declared war against Cleopatra.\n\n==Political and military buildup==\n[[File:Cleopatra Tetradrachm Antiochia.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Cleopatra]] and [[Mark Antony]] on the [[obverse]] and reverse, respectively, of a silver [[tetradrachm]] struck at the [[Antioch on the Orontes|Antioch]] mint in 36 BC]]\n[[File:Augustus Statue.JPG|thumb|upright|A reconstructed statue of Augustus as a younger Octavian, dated ca. 30 BC]]\n\nThe Caesarians Octavian (Caesar's principal, [[Caesarion|though not sole, heir]]), Mark Antony, and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]] under the [[Second Triumvirate]] had stepped in to fill the [[power vacuum]] caused by [[Julius Caesar]]'s assassination. After the Triumvirate had defeated [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] at the [[Battle of Philippi]] (42 BC) and Lepidus was expelled from the Triumvirate (36 BC), Octavian and Antony were left as the two most powerful men in the Roman world. Octavian took control of the west, including [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]], [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]], and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]]. Antony received control of the east, including [[Roman Greece|Graecia]], [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Aegyptus]].\n\nFor a time, Rome saw peace. Octavian put down revolts in the west while Antony reorganized the east; however, the peace was short lived. Antony had been having an affair with the queen of Egypt, Cleopatra. Rome, especially Octavian, took note of Antony's actions. Since 40 BC, Antony had been married to Octavia Minor, the sister of Octavian. Octavian seized the opportunity and had his minister [[Gaius Maecenas]] produce a propaganda campaign against Antony.\n\nAll of Rome felt astonished when they heard word of Antony's ''[[Donations of Alexandria]].'' In these donations, Antony ceded much of Rome's territory in the east to Cleopatra. Cleopatra and [[Caesarion]] were crowned co-rulers of Egypt and [[Cyprus]]; [[Alexander Helios]] was crowned ruler of [[Armenia]], [[Medes|Media]], and [[Parthia]]; [[Cleopatra Selene II]] was crowned ruler of [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Libya]]; and [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] was crowned ruler of [[Phoenicia]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], and [[Cilicia]]. Cleopatra took the title of Queen of Kings and Caesarion took the title of King of Kings.\n\nIn response, Octavian increased the personal attacks against Antony, but the [[SPQR|Senate and people of Rome]] were not convinced. Octavian's chance came when Antony married Cleopatra in 32 BC before he divorced Octavia. That action combined with information that Antony was planning to establish a second Senate in Alexandria created the perfect environment for Octavian to strip Antony of his power.\n\nOctavian summoned the Senate and accused Antony of anti-Roman sentiments. Octavian had illegally seized Antony's will from the [[Temple of Vesta]]. In it, Antony recognized Caesarion as Caesar's legal heir, left his possessions to his children by Cleopatra, and finally indicated his desire to be buried with Cleopatra in Alexandria instead of in Rome. The Senators were not moved by Caesarion or Antony's children but Antony's desire to be buried outside of Rome invoked the Senate's rage. Octavian, the natural politician he was, blamed Cleopatra and not Antony. The Senate declared war on Cleopatra, and Octavian knew that Antony would come to her aid.\n\nWhen Cleopatra received word that Rome had declared war, Antony threw his support to Egypt. Immediately, the Senate stripped Antony of all his official power and labeled him as an outlaw and a traitor. Octavian summoned all of his legions, numbering almost 200,000 Roman legionaries. Cleopatra and Antony did the same, assembling roughly the same number in mixed heavy Roman and light Egyptian infantry.\n\n==War==\n\n===Naval theatre===\n[[File:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|300px|right|thumb|''The [[Battle of Actium]]'' by [[Laureys a Castro]].  This was the decisive battle of the naval theater.]]\nBy mid-summer of 31 BC, Antony manoeuvred his army into Greece and Octavian soon followed. Octavian brought with him his chief military adviser and closest friend [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] to command his naval forces. Although the ground forces were comparable, Octavian's fleet was superior. Antony's fleet was made up of large vessels, but with inexperienced crews and commanders. Octavian's fleet of smaller, more manoeuvrable vessels was filled with experienced sailors.\n\nOctavian moved his soldiers across the [[Adriatic Sea]] to confront Antony near [[Actium]]. Meanwhile, Agrippa disrupted Antony's supply lines with the navy. [[Gaius Sosius]] commanded a squadron in Mark Antony's fleet with which he managed to defeat the squadron of [[Lucius Arruntius]] and put it to flight, but when the latter was reinforced by Agrippa, Sosius's ally [[Tarcondimotus]] - the king of Cilicia - was killed and Sosius himself was forced to flee.\n\nOctavian decided not to attack and risk unnecessary losses. Instead, Octavian wanted to battle Antony by sea where his experienced sailors could dominate. In response, Antony and Octavian engaged in [[Fabian strategy]] until the time was right. As the summer ended and autumn began to set in, both Octavian and Antony settled for a [[battle of attrition]]. The strategy of delay paid dividends to Octavian, as morale sank and prominent Romans deserted Antony's cause.\n[[File:Marcus Antonius marble bust in the Vatican Museums.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman sculpture|Roman marble bust]] of the [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[triumvir]] [[Mark Antony]], late 1st century AD, [[Vatican Museums]]]]\n\nThe first conflict of the war occurred when Octavian's general Agrippa captured the Greek city and naval port of [[Messenia|Methone]]. The city had previously been loyal to Antony. Although Antony was an experienced soldier, he did not understand naval combat, which led to his downfall. Antony moved his fleet to [[Actium]] where Octavian's navy and army had taken camp. In what would become known as the [[Battle of Actium]], Antony, on September 2, 31 BC, moved his large [[quinquereme]]s through the strait and into the open sea. There, Octavian's light and manoeuvrable [[Liburna|Liburnian]] ships drew in battle formation against Antony's warships. Cleopatra stayed behind Antony's line on her royal barge.\n\nA devastating blow to Antony's forces came when one of Antony's former generals delivered to Octavian Antony's battle plan. Antony had hoped to use his biggest ships to drive back Agrippa's wing on the north end of his line, but Octavian's entire fleet stayed carefully out of range. Shortly after mid-day, Antony was forced to extend his line out from the protection of the shore, and then finally engage the enemy. Octavian's fleet, armed with better trained and fresher crews, made quick work of Antony's larger and less experienced navy. Octavian's soldiers had spent years fighting in Roman naval combat, where one objective was to ram the enemy ship and at the same time kill the above deck crew with a shower of arrows and catapult-launched stones large enough to decapitate a man.\n\nAs the armies stood on either side of the naval battle, they watched as Antony was being outmatched by Agrippa. Seeing that the battle was going against Antony, Cleopatra's fleet retreated to open sea without firing a shot, leaving Antony to fight for himself. As a gap opened in Agrippa's blockade, she funneled through, and was soon closely followed by Antony's command ships. The commanders of Antony's land forces, which were supposed to follow him to Asia, promptly surrendered their legions without a fight. Antony retreated to a smaller vessel with his flag and managed to escape to Alexandria. By the end of the day, Antony's entire fleet would lie at the bottom of the sea and the Roman world had witnessed the largest naval battle in almost 200 years.\n\n===Land campaign===\nEven though Octavian wanted to immediately pursue Antony and Cleopatra, many of his veterans wanted to retire and return to private life. Octavian allowed many of his longest serving veterans (as many as 10 legions by some accounts) to retire. Many of those legionaries could trace their service to [[Julius Caesar]] some 20 years earlier.\n[[File:Roman Wall painting from the House of Giuseppe II, Pompeii, 1st century AD, death of Sophonisba, but more likely Cleopatra VII of Egypt consuming poison.jpg|thumb|[[Roman art|Roman painting]] from the House of Giuseppe II, [[Pompeii]], early 1st century AD, most likely depicting [[Cleopatra VII]] of [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], wearing her royal [[diadem]], consuming poison in an [[Death of Cleopatra|act of suicide]], while her son [[Caesarion]], also wearing a royal diadem, stands behind her]]\n\nAfter the winter ended, Octavian resumed the hunt. In the spring of 30 BC, Octavian rejected the idea of transporting his army across the sea and attacking Alexandria directly, and instead travelled by land through Asia. Antony had received much of his backing from Rome's [[client kingdom]]s in the east. By marching his army by land, he ensured Antony could not regroup and cement his authority over the provinces.\n\n[[Image:The Death of Cleopatra arthur.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''The Death of Cleopatra'' by [[Reginald Arthur]].]]\nMeanwhile, Antony attempted to secure an army in [[Cyrenaica]] from [[Lucius Pinarius]]. Unfortunately for Antony, Pinarius had switched his loyalty to Octavian. When Octavian received word of this development, he ordered Pinarius to move his four legions east towards Alexandria while Octavian would move west. Trapped in Egypt with the remnant of their former army, Antony and Cleopatra bided their time awaiting Octavian's arrival.\n\nWhen Octavian and Pinarius arrived at Alexandria, they placed the entire city under siege. Before Octavian had arrived, Antony took the roughly 10,000 soldiers he had left and attacked Pinarius, unaware that he was outnumbered 2 to 1. Pinarius destroyed what was left of Antony's army with Antony escaping back to Alexandria before Octavian arrived. As Octavian approached with his legions, what remained of Antony's cavalry and fleet surrendered to Octavian. Most of Antony's infantry surrendered without any engagement at this stage of the conflict, and Antony's cause was lost.\n\nAntony was forced to watch as his army and hopes of dominance in Rome were handed to Octavian. In honourable Roman tradition, Antony, on August 1, 30 BC, fell on his sword. According to the ancient accounts however, he was not entirely successful and with an open wound in his belly, was taken to join Cleopatra, who had fled to her [[mausoleum]]. Here Antony succumbed to his wound and supposedly died in his lover's arms, leaving her alone to face Octavian.\n\nCleopatra did not immediately follow Antony in suicide. Instead, in a last-ditch effort, Cleopatra opened negotiations with Octavian. Cleopatra begged Octavian to spare [[Caesarion]]\u2019s life in exchange for willing imprisonment. Octavian refused. Within a week, Octavian informed Cleopatra that she was to play a role in Octavian's [[Roman triumph|Triumph]] back in Rome. This role was \"carefully explained to her\", while Caesarion was \"butchered without compunction\". Octavian supposedly said \"two Caesars are one too many\" as he ordered Caesarion's death.<ref>Green, p. 697</ref> According to [[Strabo]] who was alive at the time of the event, Cleopatra died from a self-induced bite from a venomous snake, or from applying a poisonous ointment to herself.<ref>Strabo, Geography, XVII 10</ref> Learning of [[Death of Cleopatra|Cleopatra's death]], Octavian had mixed feelings. He admired the bravery of Cleopatra, and gave her and Antony a public military funeral in Rome. As they left Alexandria, a new age dawned when Rome annexed Egypt. With Cleopatra's death, the final war of the Republic was over.\n[[Image:Statue-Augustus.jpg|220px|thumb|Due to this war, Octavian would become [[Augustus]] and the first [[Roman Emperor]].]]\n\n==Aftermath==\nWithin a month, Octavian was named [[Pharaoh]], and Egypt became his personal possession. By executing Antony's supporters, Octavian finally brought a century of civil war to a close. In 27 BC Octavian was named [[Augustus]] by the Senate and given unprecedented powers. Octavian, now Augustus, transformed the Republic into the [[Roman Empire]], ruling it as the first [[Roman emperor]].\n\nIn the ensuing months and years, Augustus passed a series of laws that, while outwardly preserving the appearance of the Republic, made his position within it of paramount power and authority. He laid the foundations for what is now called the Roman Empire. From then on, the Roman state would be ruled by a Princeps (first citizen); in modern terms, Rome would from now on be ruled by Emperors.\n\nThe Senate ostensibly still had power and authority over certain Senatorial provinces, but the critical border provinces, such as Syria, Egypt, and Gaul, requiring the greatest numbers of legions, would be directly ruled by Augustus and succeeding Emperors.\n\nWith the end of the last Republican civil war, the Republic was replaced by the Empire. The reign of Augustus would usher in the golden era of Roman culture and produce a stability which Rome had not seen in over a century. With Rome in control of the entire Mediterranean world, a peace would reign in the Roman world for centuries after the death of Augustus: the so-called [[Pax Romana]] (Roman Peace).\n\nThe Empire that Augustus established would last in Western Europe until the [[fall of Rome]] in the 5th century AD. The Eastern part of the Roman Empire would also survive as the [[Byzantine Empire]] until the [[fall of Constantinople]] in AD 1453.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Ancient Roman Wars}}\n{{Ancient Greek Wars|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:30 BC]]\n[[Category:32 BC]]\n[[Category:30s BC conflicts]]\n[[Category:1st century BC in the Roman Republic]]\n[[Category:Augustus]]\n[[Category:Caesarion]]\n[[Category:Cleopatra]]\n[[Category:Mark Antony]]\n[[Category:Roman Alexandria]]\n[[Category:Roman Republican civil wars]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the Ptolemaic Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Last war of the Roman Republic\n| width       = \n| partof      = the [[crisis of the Roman Republic]]\n| image       = \n| image_size  = \n| alt         = \n| caption     = \n| date        = Spring of 32 BC \u2013 August (Sextilis) 30 BC\n| place       = [[Roman Greece|Greece]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]]\n| territory   = Rome annexes Egypt\n| result      = Victory for Octavian<br>\u2022 Rome is united under Octavian's rule<br>\u2022 Octavian becomes Augustus<br>\u2022 Roman Republic transforms into the Roman Empire\n| combatant1  = Supporters of Octavian\n| combatant2  = Supporters of Mark Antony<br>[[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]]\n| commander1  = [[Augustus|Octavian]]<br>[[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]]<br>[[Titus Statilius Taurus#Titus Statilius Taurus (I)|Titus Statilius Taurus]]<br>[[Lucius Pinarius|Lucius Pinarius Scarpus]]\n| commander2  = [[Mark Antony]]{{executed|suicide}}<br>[[Cleopatra]]{{executed|suicide}}<br>[[Gaius Sosius]]{{POW}}<br>[[Publius Canidius Crassus|P.

When Octavian received word of this development, he ordered Pinarius to move his four legions east towards Alexandria while Octavian would move west. Trapped in Egypt with the remnant of their former army, Antony and Cleopatra bided their time awaiting Octavian's arrival.\n\nWhen Octavian and Pinarius arrived at Alexandria, they placed the entire city under siege. Before Octavian had arrived, Antony took the roughly 10,000 soldiers he had left and attacked Pinarius, unaware that he was outnumbered 2 to 1. Pinarius destroyed what was left of Antony's army with Antony escaping back to Alexandria before Octavian arrived. As Octavian approached with his legions, what remained of Antony's cavalry and fleet surrendered to Octavian. Most of Antony's infantry surrendered without any engagement at this stage of the conflict, and Antony's cause was lost.\n\nAntony was forced to watch as his army and hopes of dominance in Rome were handed to Octavian. In honourable Roman tradition, Antony, on August 1, 30 BC, fell on his sword. According to the ancient accounts however, he was not entirely successful and with an open wound in his belly, was taken to join Cleopatra, who had fled to her [[mausoleum]]. Here Antony succumbed to his wound and supposedly died in his lover's arms, leaving her alone to face Octavian.\n\nCleopatra did not immediately follow Antony in suicide. Instead, in a last-ditch effort, Cleopatra opened negotiations with Octavian. Cleopatra begged Octavian to spare [[Caesarion]]\u2019s life in exchange for willing imprisonment. Octavian refused. Within a week, Octavian informed Cleopatra that she was to play a role in Octavian's [[Roman triumph|Triumph]] back in Rome. This role was \"carefully explained to her\", while Caesarion was \"butchered without compunction\". Octavian supposedly said \"two Caesars are one too many\" as he ordered Caesarion's death.<ref>Green, p. 697</ref> According to [[Strabo]] who was alive at the time of the event, Cleopatra died from a self-induced bite from a venomous snake, or from applying a poisonous ointment to herself.<ref>Strabo, Geography, XVII 10</ref> Learning of [[Death of Cleopatra|Cleopatra's death]], Octavian had mixed feelings. He admired the bravery of Cleopatra, and gave her and Antony a public military funeral in Rome. As they left Alexandria, a new age dawned when Rome annexed Egypt. With Cleopatra's death, the final war of the Republic was over.\n[[Image:Statue-Augustus.jpg|220px|thumb|Due to this war, Octavian would become [[Augustus]] and the first [[Roman Emperor]].]]\n\n==Aftermath==\nWithin a month, Octavian was named [[Pharaoh]], and Egypt became his personal possession. By executing Antony's supporters, Octavian finally brought a century of civil war to a close. In 27 BC Octavian was named [[Augustus]] by the Senate and given unprecedented powers. Octavian, now Augustus, transformed the Republic into the [[Roman Empire]], ruling it as the first [[Roman emperor]].\n\nIn the ensuing months and years, Augustus passed a series of laws that, while outwardly preserving the appearance of the Republic, made his position within it of paramount power and authority. He laid the foundations for what is now called the Roman Empire. From then on, the Roman state would be ruled by a Princeps (first citizen); in modern terms, Rome would from now on be ruled by Emperors.\n\nThe Senate ostensibly still had power and authority over certain Senatorial provinces, but the critical border provinces, such as Syria, Egypt, and Gaul, requiring the greatest numbers of legions, would be directly ruled by Augustus and succeeding Emperors.\n\nWith the end of the last Republican civil war, the Republic was replaced by the Empire. The reign of Augustus would usher in the golden era of Roman culture and produce a stability which Rome had not seen in over a century. With Rome in control of the entire Mediterranean world, a peace would reign in the Roman world for centuries after the death of Augustus: the so-called [[Pax Romana]] (Roman Peace).\n\nThe Empire that Augustus established would last in Western Europe until the [[fall of Rome]] in the 5th century AD. The Eastern part of the Roman Empire would also survive as the [[Byzantine Empire]] until the [[fall of Constantinople]] in AD 1453.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Ancient Roman Wars}}\n{{Ancient Greek Wars|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:30 BC]]\n[[Category:32 BC]]\n[[Category:30s BC conflicts]]\n[[Category:1st century BC in the Roman Republic]]\n[[Category:Augustus]]\n[[Category:Caesarion]]\n[[Category:Cleopatra]]\n[[Category:Mark Antony]]\n[[Category:Roman Alexandria]]\n[[Category:Roman Republican civil wars]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the Ptolemaic Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Sam1370", "label": "safe", "comment": "Unneeded", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_war_of_the_Roman_Republic"}

The show stars [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] as Marty Gold and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Hannah Miller, coworkers at a [[Chicago]] magazine with a mutual romantic attraction who struggle to keep their relationship strictly professional. The series, from creator Wendy Kout and developers Dennis Koenig and [[Peter Noah]], was produced by Adam Productions (a company run by [[John Ritter]]) in association with [[20th Century Fox Television]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===First season===\nChicago native Hannah Miller (Curtis) returns to her hometown after quitting her teaching post out of state and breaking up with her long-term boyfriend. On the flight back, she meets Marty Gold (Lewis), an eccentric magazine columnist for ''Chicago Monthly'', a trendy publication with hard-hitting exposes and pop-culture pieces. Marty's fear of flying and frazzled nerves are calmed by Hannah, who then shares her story of change with him and her plans to launch a writing career upon returning home. It just so happens, according to Marty, that there is an opening at ''Chicago Monthly'' for a researcher, which Hannah jumps at. Once the two arrive home, Marty introduces Hannah to his boss, blustery magazine editor Norman Keil ([[Louis Giambalvo]]), who sees a lot in her and gives her a trial assignment\u2014a 2,000-word article on \"the tortilla wars: does Chicago prefer corn or flour?\" for 9 o'clock the following morning. Hannah aces and delivers, becoming part of the team and coincidentally getting a desk opposite Marty's. It becomes clear that Marty got Hannah the job because he was instantly attracted to her. Still getting over her recent breakup, Hannah is not ready to consider anyone new yet, but feels a connection to Marty she cannot or does not want to consummate.\n\nOthers at ''Chicago Monthly'' detect hints of attraction between Hannah and Marty, but (early on at least) are generally more occupied with the sensational and outrageous stories to which the two were assigned. Jules Kramer ([[Richard Frank (actor)|Richard Frank]]), affectionately known as \"Julie\", is Norman's fawning assistant, and Pamela Peyton-Finch ([[Sandy Faison]]) a glamorous, cutthroat writer. The stories shift between the easygoing (but sometimes frenetic) office camaraderie and Marty's and Hannah's personal lives. Hannah's gun-toting outdoorsman dad, Leo Miller ([[Bruce Kirby (actor)|Bruce Kirby]]), is also a character.\n\nWith each passing episode, as the two banter and form a friendship as well as a working relationship, they come closer to realizing the potential for romance. They would have realized this sooner if they were not so distracted. Marty is tentatively dating a girl named Alice (guest star [[Wendie Malick]]) while Hannah's recent ex, Jack (guest star [[Robin Thomas]]), visits and turns out to be Marty's former college roommate. The reunion for the three is a bit strained. Finally, in the first-season finale, Alice dumps Marty, and Hannah, who is making strides in getting over Jack, accepts Marty's invitation to dinner\u2014though both agree it is \"not a date\".\n\n===Second season===\n[[Image:Anythingbutlovecast.jpg|thumb|left|225px|''Anything but Love'' second-season cast. From left: Joseph Maher, Holly Fulger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Richard Frank, Richard Lewis, Ann Magnuson.]]\nAs the second season opened, there were new faces and adjustments in the series, along with further progress in Hannah and Marty's relationship. Each episode now began with a prologue scene in which Marty and Hannah had lunch at a diner while having a conversation which poked fun at life's trivial conventions (i.e., clothing styles, dating habits, etc.). A sneak preview of these segments aired in ABC network promos for the show in August 1989, advertising the show's return in its original Tuesday night time slot after a three-month break. The following month, ''Anything but Love'' moved to Wednesday nights at 9:30/8:30c.\n\nIn the season premiere, Hannah returned from vacation to find that the magazine had been taken over by new owners, becoming a weekly publication and being renamed the ''Chicago Weekly''. Norman was replaced by a new editor, the ultra-hip Catherine Hughes (played by performance artist and former [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]] member Ann Magnuson), who instantly promoted Hannah to writer. Pamela was also gone, and arriving in her place was English TV critic Brian Allquist ([[Joseph Maher]]), whose reviews became one of the more popular features of the ''Weekly'', but not without its fair share of controversy. Harold and Kelly (as played by actor/playwrights [[Billy Van Zandt]], and Jane Milmore, who also served as story consultants on the show at this time) were other new staff members.  For unexplained reasons, Julie's last name changed to Bennett; however, under the new ownership, he remained as editor's assistant.\n\nHannah and Marty were now fighting off a stronger sexual attraction, and their close calls with intimacy and courtship intensified, which resulted in hilarious and comedically challenging situations. To give Hannah an outlet in which she could sort out her feelings for Marty, and her love life in general, the producers added her long-time best friend, Robin Dulitski ([[Holly Fulger]]), who also acted as Hannah's landlord. Hannah and Robin had an in-joke running back from their teenage years, in which they pictured themselves married by their thirties to dashing brothers named Schmenkman. For fun, they both regularly called each other \"Mrs. Schmenkman\". Robin was truly rooting for a Hannah/Marty relationship; at one point, however, she started feeling herself drawn to Marty, which resulted in them sharing a brief kiss. Marty was not as interested in dating Robin as she was in him, so after a brief disappointment, Robin re-channeled her energy in helping Hannah realize her feelings for Marty. Various family members of Marty's began making further guest appearances, as the emphasis on the character's [[Jewish]] culture became more prominent. While the two danced around their attraction, they continued to date others from time to time. Later in the season, Marty introduces Hannah to his ex-fianc\u00e9e at his family's [[Passover Seder|seder]], upon which Hannah feels that the two may still have feelings for each other.\n\nHannah and Catherine became something of soul sisters both in and out of the office as well, providing support to each other through many twists and turns. Their friendship became similar to that of Hannah and Robin's. At one point in the season, Catherine hires Robin briefly to write a column featuring her \"every woman\" views on current events and social issues. Catherine, who prided herself on being very avant-garde in her editorial command and all-knowing of the ins and outs of pop culture, was crushed when a close companion and legendary artist snubbed her of mention in his recently published diaries. Feeling the onset of a nervous breakdown, she temporarily left Marty in charge of the ''Weekly''. Brian also faced his first major public criticism at the magazine in this episode, in which fans of the latest ''Star Squad'' movie (a fictional take on ''[[Star Trek]]'') stormed down to the ''Weekly'' office to protest his scathing review. Fortunately for Brian and Marty, Catherine overcame her wounded pride and returned to work. Marty would get a chance to fill the editor's shoes again that season, when a troubleshooter from the ''Weekly'''s parent company arrived and decided to replace Catherine; again, Catherine's cutting-edge approach to journalism was underappreciated. Marty had to pull some clever blackmail in order to get her back. While Catherine in the end remained at the ''Weekly'', it was Brian who ended up with a short stint. In the episode \"The Days of Whine and..\" (March 21, 1990), a woman shows up to threaten Brian after an unfavorable review of her husband's work caused him to die. The woman stalks Brian ruthlessly. It escalates to the point where, out of rage and his attempt to avoid her watching his every move, Brian smashes all the TV sets on display at Marshall Field's department store, and is sent to jail.\n\nIn the season finale, Hannah celebrates her 30th birthday, a time which celebrated many joys but also some emptiness and regret. After looking back at her complicated romantic life, she realizes that the one missing aspect of her existence is right under her nose\u2014Marty. After a year's worth of dodging the obvious chemistry between them, Hannah comes forward and shares her true feelings with Marty. As it turns out, Marty was on the cusp of revealing the same.\n\n===Third season===\n''Anything but Love'' was renewed for a third season in the spring of 1990, but was omitted from ABC's 1990 fall schedule. In the wake of a ratings fall the previous season, the producers had called for further retooling of the show. The third-season premiere was moved to February 6, 1991, and the season itself only consisted of ten episodes. The opening storyline picked up straight from where the second-season finale left off, with Marty and Hannah admitting that they were indeed in love with each other. The two reveled in their newfound joy, and agreed to take things slowly and uncommitted. However, such an event was not to be complete without a [[monkey wrench]] thrown in. The breakthrough development was compounded by the arrival of guest star [[John Ritter]], who signed on for a three-episode story arc (which ABC aptly planned for February sweeps, and was heavily promoting in order to kickstart the series). Ritter played Patrick Serrau, a renowned photographer swept into town when the ''Weekly'' hired him to work on a special series. Hannah and Patrick become well acquainted, and when the two are required to work together on her piece for the project, their association quickly gets to be more casual than professional.\n\nMarty catches on to Patrick's maneuverisms and spies on him and Hannah when they stop by his hotel suite. Hannah feels wooed by Patrick, but feels challenged by her standing love for Marty. Struggling to keep his composure, Marty lets Hannah know of his awareness of the whole situation, while Hannah decides to let her heart lead the way. Patrick and Hannah get intimate, and as their assignment progressed, Patrick asks Hannah to join him in [[West Africa]]\u2014for both work and romance. After some consideration, Hannah says yes, and Marty is devastated. Rather than resort to drastic behavior, he nonchalantly challenges Patrick's views on many urban issues discussed in the magazine project, which bring out an arrogant, negative side of his personality. Hannah, who had seen these true colors appear at times through her partnership with Patrick, finally admitted to herself that he was not the right man to be with. She ultimately turned back to Marty as Patrick departed the country, and the two finally entered a committed relationship.\n\nThe couple fantasized how everyone in their life, who had constantly pondered \"will they or won't they?\" for nearly the last two years, would react to their dating. Once the word got out, everyone celebrated. The one person who was a little less keen on the idea was a new columnist at the office, Mike Urbanek ([[Bruce Weitz]]), who thought Marty and Hannah's tendency to avoid full-out romance was nothing but silly game playing. No-nonsense Mike, a good friend of Marty's, was only weary of the pairing as a result of the experiences he had after many years of marriage. Just as Hannah got from Robin, Marty got the male counterpart of advice from Mike, albeit from the point of view of a husband. All the significant \"firsts\" of Hannah and Marty's courtship were then chronicled\u2014the first fight (which unfolded at work), the first bout of jealousy (Hannah's reeling when Marty has to accompany a swimsuit model to the [[Caribbean]] for an interview), etc.\n\n===Fourth season===\nThe fourth season begins with Hannah feeling ill, and at a visit to the doctor's, is told that she may be experiencing signs of [[morning sickness]]. Hannah takes a home pregnancy test, which shows a positive result. Both Marty and Hannah are excited when they learn that they are expecting parents\u2014yet unmarried ones. As both believed in a legal union before embarking on such a step, they decided to rush off and get married. However, in the eleventh hour, just a short while before the couple marched off to the hastily prepared ceremony, the doctor's office calls back to tell Hannah that the results of their in-house test are negative. Given that Hannah's supposed pregnancy symptoms have disappeared, she and Marty are convinced that the home test was a lie, and decide to call off the wedding.\n\nThe couple's relationship reaches enticing new heights, and the main plotline further became inventive. In one episode, a young staff writer/intern at the office causes Marty and Hannah to escape into a fantasy in which they met as children, and brought their relationship from juvenile puppy love to the present day. The series continued to draw much critical acclaim as a result of Curtis and Lewis' on-screen chemistry at this time. The bond of the cast as a whole was at its strongest as well, with more episodes centering on the escapades of the guys (Marty, Julie and Mike) as well as the \"sisterhood\" (Hannah, Robin and Catherine). Then, perhaps not to the surprise of fans, John Ritter returned in December 1991 to further the saga of Patrick Serrau for two more episodes. Patrick was back in Chicago when his photography went on exhibit at the local art museum. Showing no signs of his usual lecherous self, Patrick attempts to lure Hannah once again by digging up some discrediting facts about Marty. Before the end of the two-parter, Marty manages to outplay Patrick once more, who truly did not have a chance to get Hannah due to how committed they were. While \"dashing\" Patrick proved no threat to the love of Hannah and Marty, others around them began facing less stable relationships. In early 1992, it was revealed that Catherine had a husband in an open marriage, who showed up wanting a divorce when he found a new woman he wished to be exclusive with. Not long after, Mike begins to show emotional distance in his marriage, when he puts the moves on Robin while his wife leaves town for a week.\n\n==Production run==\nAlthough the show was initially popular in its abbreviated first season, producers decided to make cast changes for the second in order to provide Curtis and Lewis with more flavorful supporting characters. While critics hailed the changes, ABC's moving the show to Wednesdays at 9:30/8:30c caused a large drop in the series' ratings. (It was announced as the 9:00/8:00c show but the immediate success of ''[[Doogie Howser, M.D.]]'' caused ABC to flip the shows two weeks into the season. Since it was renewed as a mid-season replacement, the third season did not begin until February 1991. ABC kept the show in the same Wednesday time slot, and ramped up promotions with the advertising tagline \"The All-New ''Anything but Love''\" (corresponding with the current cast changes and the opening three-episode arc with John Ritter). All of this stabilized audiences enough to grant the series a fourth season. In August 1991, ''Anything but Love'' was moved to the unusual time slot of Wednesday at 10/9c, as a part of an all-comedy block ('''''The Hump''''') that was short-lived. Ratings slipped again, and the show returned to the Wednesday 9:30/8:30 slot in early November.\n\nUnusually, the show was not canceled by the network. Instead, [[20th Century Fox]] pulled the plug on the show in 1992, having calculated that the show would not get renewed for a fifth season and would be unprofitable in [[first-run syndication]].\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 1 (1989)===\n{{Episode table |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n

Carrere later played Lewis's girlfriend on several episodes of the 2007 season of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', and co-starred with Curtis in ''[[True Lies]]''.\n\n==Theme music==\nThe title track, which shared its name with the series, was a sentimental soft-rock song. In the first season, a main vocal track was used for the opening credits, dominated by woodwinds with a synth underscore, and was performed by [[J.D. Souther]]. The original opening sequence featured time-lapsed stills of Lewis and Curtis outdoors as the two \"bonded\".\n\nBeginning in the second season and onward, the theme song was now instrumental during the title sequence, featuring an acoustic guitar and piano prominence on a synth base, and a higher pitch. The visuals were redesigned to feature still photos of Lewis and Curtis in a series of different poses, separately and together, with professional photo backgrounds behind them. These photos appeared in moving strips that traveled in all sorts of directions along a greenish-blue, textured wall. The title and credits were encased in metallic, multicolored boxes that traveled across the screen along with the photos; the font was a calligraphic type.\n\n==Home media==\nOn February 6, 2007, [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|20th Century Fox]] released '''Anything But Love- Volume 1''', a 3-disc boxset featuring the first 28 episodes of the series on DVD in Region 1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n|-\n| Volume 1\n| 28\n| February 6, 2007\n|-\n| Volume 2\n| 28\n| TBA\n|}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0096534|Anything But Love}}\n* {{tv.com show|anything-but-love|Anything but Love}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anything But Love}}\n[[Category:1989 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1992 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:1980s American romantic comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American romantic comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American workplace comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American workplace comedy television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Otheruses}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox television|\n | show_name = Anything but Love\n | image = Anything But Love (US TV series) title-card.jpg\n | caption =\n | genre = [[Sitcom]]\n | creator = Wendy Kout\n | developer = {{Plain list|\n*Dennis Koenig\n*[[Peter Noah]]\n}}\n | starring = {{Plain list|\n*[[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]]\n*[[Jamie Lee Curtis]]\n*[[Richard Frank (actor)|Richard Frank]]\n*[[Sandy Faison]] <small>(Season 1)</small>\n*[[Bruce Kirby (actor)|Bruce Kirby]] <small>(Season 1)</small>\n*[[Louis Giambalvo]] <small>(Season 1)</small>\n*[[Holly Fulger]] <small>(Seasons 2\u20134)</small>\n*[[Ann Magnuson]]</small> (Seasons 2\u20134)</small>\n*[[Joseph Maher]] <small>(Season 2)</small>\n*[[Billy Van Zandt]] <small>(Season 2)</small>\n*[[Jane Milmore]] <small>(Season 2)</small>\n*[[Bruce Weitz]] <small>(Seasons 3\u20134)</small>\n}}\n | theme_music_composer =\n | composer =\n | country = United States\n | language = English\n | num_seasons = 4\n | num_episodes = 56\n | executive_producer = {{Plain list|\n*Robert M.

The show stars [[Richard Lewis (comedian)|Richard Lewis]] as Marty Gold and [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Hannah Miller, coworkers at a [[Chicago]] magazine with a mutual romantic attraction who struggle to keep their relationship strictly professional. The series, from creator Wendy Kout and developers Dennis Koenig and [[Peter Noah]], was produced by Adam Productions (a company run by [[John Ritter]]) in association with [[20th Century Fox Television]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===First season===\nChicago native Hannah Miller (Curtis) returns to her hometown after quitting her teaching post out of state and breaking up with her long-term boyfriend. On the flight back, she meets Marty Gold (Lewis), an eccentric magazine columnist for ''Chicago Monthly'', a trendy publication with hard-hitting exposes and pop-culture pieces. Marty's fear of flying and frazzled nerves are calmed by Hannah, who then shares her story of change with him and her plans to launch a writing career upon returning home. It just so happens, according to Marty, that there is an opening at ''Chicago Monthly'' for a researcher, which Hannah jumps at. Once the two arrive home, Marty introduces Hannah to his boss, blustery magazine editor Norman Keil ([[Louis Giambalvo]]), who sees a lot in her and gives her a trial assignment\u2014a 2,000-word article on \"the tortilla wars: does Chicago prefer corn or flour?\" for 9 o'clock the following morning. Hannah aces and delivers, becoming part of the team and coincidentally getting a desk opposite Marty's. It becomes clear that Marty got Hannah the job because he was instantly attracted to her. Still getting over her recent breakup, Hannah is not ready to consider anyone new yet, but feels a connection to Marty she cannot or does not want to consummate.\n\nOthers at ''Chicago Monthly'' detect hints of attraction between Hannah and Marty, but (early on at least) are generally more occupied with the sensational and outrageous stories to which the two were assigned. Jules Kramer ([[Richard Frank (actor)|Richard Frank]]), affectionately known as \"Julie\", is Norman's fawning assistant, and Pamela Peyton-Finch ([[Sandy Faison]]) a glamorous, cutthroat writer. The stories shift between the easygoing (but sometimes frenetic) office camaraderie and Marty's and Hannah's personal lives. Hannah's gun-toting outdoorsman dad, Leo Miller ([[Bruce Kirby (actor)|Bruce Kirby]]), is also a character.\n\nWith each passing episode, as the two banter and form a friendship as well as a working relationship, they come closer to realizing the potential for romance. They would have realized this sooner if they were not so distracted. Marty is tentatively dating a girl named Alice (guest star [[Wendie Malick]]) while Hannah's recent ex, Jack (guest star [[Robin Thomas]]), visits and turns out to be Marty's former college roommate. The reunion for the three is a bit strained. Finally, in the first-season finale, Alice dumps Marty, and Hannah, who is making strides in getting over Jack, accepts Marty's invitation to dinner\u2014though both agree it is \"not a date\".\n\n===Second season===\n[[Image:Anythingbutlovecast.jpg|thumb|left|225px|''Anything but Love'' second-season cast. From left: Joseph Maher, Holly Fulger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Richard Frank, Richard Lewis, Ann Magnuson.]]\nAs the second season opened, there were new faces and adjustments in the series, along with further progress in Hannah and Marty's relationship. Each episode now began with a prologue scene in which Marty and Hannah had lunch at a diner while having a conversation which poked fun at life's trivial conventions (i.e., clothing styles, dating habits, etc.). A sneak preview of these segments aired in ABC network promos for the show in August 1989, advertising the show's return in its original Tuesday night time slot after a three-month break. The following month, ''Anything but Love'' moved to Wednesday nights at 9:30/8:30c.\n\nIn the season premiere, Hannah returned from vacation to find that the magazine had been taken over by new owners, becoming a weekly publication and being renamed the ''Chicago Weekly''. Norman was replaced by a new editor, the ultra-hip Catherine Hughes (played by performance artist and former [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]] member Ann Magnuson), who instantly promoted Hannah to writer. Pamela was also gone, and arriving in her place was English TV critic Brian Allquist ([[Joseph Maher]]), whose reviews became one of the more popular features of the ''Weekly'', but not without its fair share of controversy. Harold and Kelly (as played by actor/playwrights [[Billy Van Zandt]], and Jane Milmore, who also served as story consultants on the show at this time) were other new staff members.  For unexplained reasons, Julie's last name changed to Bennett; however, under the new ownership, he remained as editor's assistant.\n\nHannah and Marty were now fighting off a stronger sexual attraction, and their close calls with intimacy and courtship intensified, which resulted in hilarious and comedically challenging situations. To give Hannah an outlet in which she could sort out her feelings for Marty, and her love life in general, the producers added her long-time best friend, Robin Dulitski ([[Holly Fulger]]), who also acted as Hannah's landlord. Hannah and Robin had an in-joke running back from their teenage years, in which they pictured themselves married by their thirties to dashing brothers named Schmenkman. For fun, they both regularly called each other \"Mrs. Schmenkman\". Robin was truly rooting for a Hannah/Marty relationship; at one point, however, she started feeling herself drawn to Marty, which resulted in them sharing a brief kiss. Marty was not as interested in dating Robin as she was in him, so after a brief disappointment, Robin re-channeled her energy in helping Hannah realize her feelings for Marty. Various family members of Marty's began making further guest appearances, as the emphasis on the character's [[Jewish]] culture became more prominent. While the two danced around their attraction, they continued to date others from time to time. Later in the season, Marty introduces Hannah to his ex-fianc\u00e9e at his family's [[Passover Seder|seder]], upon which Hannah feels that the two may still have feelings for each other.\n\nHannah and Catherine became something of soul sisters both in and out of the office as well, providing support to each other through many twists and turns. Their friendship became similar to that of Hannah and Robin's. At one point in the season, Catherine hires Robin briefly to write a column featuring her \"every woman\" views on current events and social issues. Catherine, who prided herself on being very avant-garde in her editorial command and all-knowing of the ins and outs of pop culture, was crushed when a close companion and legendary artist snubbed her of mention in his recently published diaries. Feeling the onset of a nervous breakdown, she temporarily left Marty in charge of the ''Weekly''. Brian also faced his first major public criticism at the magazine in this episode, in which fans of the latest ''Star Squad'' movie (a fictional take on ''[[Star Trek]]'') stormed down to the ''Weekly'' office to protest his scathing review. Fortunately for Brian and Marty, Catherine overcame her wounded pride and returned to work. Marty would get a chance to fill the editor's shoes again that season, when a troubleshooter from the ''Weekly'''s parent company arrived and decided to replace Catherine; again, Catherine's cutting-edge approach to journalism was underappreciated. Marty had to pull some clever blackmail in order to get her back. While Catherine in the end remained at the ''Weekly'', it was Brian who ended up with a short stint. In the episode \"The Days of Whine and..\" (March 21, 1990), a woman shows up to threaten Brian after an unfavorable review of her husband's work caused him to die. The woman stalks Brian ruthlessly. It escalates to the point where, out of rage and his attempt to avoid her watching his every move, Brian smashes all the TV sets on display at Marshall Field's department store, and is sent to jail.\n\nIn the season finale, Hannah celebrates her 30th birthday, a time which celebrated many joys but also some emptiness and regret. After looking back at her complicated romantic life, she realizes that the one missing aspect of her existence is right under her nose\u2014Marty. After a year's worth of dodging the obvious chemistry between them, Hannah comes forward and shares her true feelings with Marty. As it turns out, Marty was on the cusp of revealing the same.\n\n===Third season===\n''Anything but Love'' was renewed for a third season in the spring of 1990, but was omitted from ABC's 1990 fall schedule. In the wake of a ratings fall the previous season, the producers had called for further retooling of the show. The third-season premiere was moved to February 6, 1991, and the season itself only consisted of ten episodes. The opening storyline picked up straight from where the second-season finale left off, with Marty and Hannah admitting that they were indeed in love with each other. The two reveled in their newfound joy, and agreed to take things slowly and uncommitted. However, such an event was not to be complete without a [[monkey wrench]] thrown in. The breakthrough development was compounded by the arrival of guest star [[John Ritter]], who signed on for a three-episode story arc (which ABC aptly planned for February sweeps, and was heavily promoting in order to kickstart the series). Ritter played Patrick Serrau, a renowned photographer swept into town when the ''Weekly'' hired him to work on a special series. Hannah and Patrick become well acquainted, and when the two are required to work together on her piece for the project, their association quickly gets to be more casual than professional.\n\nMarty catches on to Patrick's maneuverisms and spies on him and Hannah when they stop by his hotel suite. Hannah feels wooed by Patrick, but feels challenged by her standing love for Marty. Struggling to keep his composure, Marty lets Hannah know of his awareness of the whole situation, while Hannah decides to let her heart lead the way. Patrick and Hannah get intimate, and as their assignment progressed, Patrick asks Hannah to join him in [[West Africa]]\u2014for both work and romance. After some consideration, Hannah says yes, and Marty is devastated. Rather than resort to drastic behavior, he nonchalantly challenges Patrick's views on many urban issues discussed in the magazine project, which bring out an arrogant, negative side of his personality. Hannah, who had seen these true colors appear at times through her partnership with Patrick, finally admitted to herself that he was not the right man to be with. She ultimately turned back to Marty as Patrick departed the country, and the two finally entered a committed relationship.\n\nThe couple fantasized how everyone in their life, who had constantly pondered \"will they or won't they?\" for nearly the last two years, would react to their dating. Once the word got out, everyone celebrated. The one person who was a little less keen on the idea was a new columnist at the office, Mike Urbanek ([[Bruce Weitz]]), who thought Marty and Hannah's tendency to avoid full-out romance was nothing but silly game playing. No-nonsense Mike, a good friend of Marty's, was only weary of the pairing as a result of the experiences he had after many years of marriage. Just as Hannah got from Robin, Marty got the male counterpart of advice from Mike, albeit from the point of view of a husband. All the significant \"firsts\" of Hannah and Marty's courtship were then chronicled\u2014the first fight (which unfolded at work), the first bout of jealousy (Hannah's reeling when Marty has to accompany a swimsuit model to the [[Caribbean]] for an interview), etc.\n\n===Fourth season===\nThe fourth season begins with Hannah feeling ill, and at a visit to the doctor's, is told that she may be experiencing signs of [[morning sickness]]. Hannah takes a home pregnancy test, which shows a positive result. Both Marty and Hannah are excited when they learn that they are expecting parents\u2014yet unmarried ones. As both believed in a legal union before embarking on such a step, they decided to rush off and get married. However, in the eleventh hour, just a short while before the couple marched off to the hastily prepared ceremony, the doctor's office calls back to tell Hannah that the results of their in-house test are negative. Given that Hannah's supposed pregnancy symptoms have disappeared, she and Marty are convinced that the home test was a lie, and decide to call off the wedding.\n\nThe couple's relationship reaches enticing new heights, and the main plotline further became inventive. In one episode, a young staff writer/intern at the office causes Marty and Hannah to escape into a fantasy in which they met as children, and brought their relationship from juvenile puppy love to the present day. The series continued to draw much critical acclaim as a result of Curtis and Lewis' on-screen chemistry at this time. The bond of the cast as a whole was at its strongest as well, with more episodes centering on the escapades of the guys (Marty, Julie and Mike) as well as the \"sisterhood\" (Hannah, Robin and Catherine). Then, perhaps not to the surprise of fans, John Ritter returned in December 1991 to further the saga of Patrick Serrau for two more episodes. Patrick was back in Chicago when his photography went on exhibit at the local art museum. Showing no signs of his usual lecherous self, Patrick attempts to lure Hannah once again by digging up some discrediting facts about Marty. Before the end of the two-parter, Marty manages to outplay Patrick once more, who truly did not have a chance to get Hannah due to how committed they were. While \"dashing\" Patrick proved no threat to the love of Hannah and Marty, others around them began facing less stable relationships. In early 1992, it was revealed that Catherine had a husband in an open marriage, who showed up wanting a divorce when he found a new woman he wished to be exclusive with. Not long after, Mike begins to show emotional distance in his marriage, when he puts the moves on Robin while his wife leaves town for a week.\n\n==Production run==\nAlthough the show was initially popular in its abbreviated first season, producers decided to make cast changes for the second in order to provide Curtis and Lewis with more flavorful supporting characters. While critics hailed the changes, ABC's moving the show to Wednesdays at 9:30/8:30c caused a large drop in the series' ratings. (It was announced as the 9:00/8:00c show but the immediate success of ''[[Doogie Howser, M.D.]]'' caused ABC to flip the shows two weeks into the season. Since it was renewed as a mid-season replacement, the third season did not begin until February 1991. ABC kept the show in the same Wednesday time slot, and ramped up promotions with the advertising tagline \"The All-New ''Anything but Love''\" (corresponding with the current cast changes and the opening three-episode arc with John Ritter). All of this stabilized audiences enough to grant the series a fourth season. In August 1991, ''Anything but Love'' was moved to the unusual time slot of Wednesday at 10/9c, as a part of an all-comedy block ('''''The Hump''''') that was short-lived. Ratings slipped again, and the show returned to the Wednesday 9:30/8:30 slot in early November.\n\nUnusually, the show was not canceled by the network. Instead, [[20th Century Fox]] pulled the plug on the show in 1992, having calculated that the show would not get renewed for a fifth season and would be unprofitable in [[first-run syndication]].\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 1 (1989)===\n{{Episode table |overall= |season= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |episodes= \n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n

Carrere later play Lewis's girlfriend on several episodes of the 2007 season of ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', and co-starred with Curtis in ''[[True Lies]]''.\n\n==Theme music==\nThe title track, which shared its name with the series, was a sentimental soft-rock song. In the first season, a main vocal track was used for the opening credits, dominated by woodwinds with a synth underscore, and was performed by [[J.D. Souther]]. The original opening sequence featured time-lapsed stills of Lewis and Curtis outdoors as the two \"bonded\".\n\nBeginning in the second season and onward, the theme song was now instrumental during the title sequence, featuring an acoustic guitar and piano prominence on a synth base, and a higher pitch. The visuals were redesigned to feature still photos of Lewis and Curtis in a series of different poses, separately and together, with professional photo backgrounds behind them. These photos appeared in moving strips that traveled in all sorts of directions along a greenish-blue, textured wall. The title and credits were encased in metallic, multicolored boxes that traveled across the screen along with the photos; the font was a calligraphic type.\n\n==Home media==\nOn February 6, 2007, [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|20th Century Fox]] released '''Anything But Love- Volume 1''', a 3-disc boxset featuring the first 28 episodes of the series on DVD in Region 1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!DVD Name\n!Ep #\n!Release Date\n|-\n| Volume 1\n| 28\n| February 6, 2007\n|-\n| Volume 2\n| 28\n| TBA\n|}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0096534|Anything But Love}}\n* {{tv.com show|anything-but-love|Anything but Love}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anything But Love}}\n[[Category:1989 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1992 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series about Jews and Judaism]]\n[[Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Chicago]]\n[[Category:1980s American romantic comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American romantic comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American workplace comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American workplace comedy television series]]\n", "name_user": "Wukai", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGuest stars", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anything_but_Love"}

Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\nIn this competition, the heaviest athlete of the Games, [[Ricardo Blas Jr.]], competed with a body weight of 210&nbsp;kg. Despite his huge body, he was thrown away by his opponent in the first round, eliminating him from the tournament.\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

the 2008 Summer Olympics}}\nThe '''Men's 100+ kg''' '''[[Judo]]''' competition at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] was held on August 15 at the [[Beijing Science and Technology University Gymnasium]].\nPreliminary rounds started at 12:00 Noon [[China Standard Time|CST]].\n[[Repechage]] finals, semifinals, bouts for bronze medals and the final were held at 18:00pm CST.\n\nThis event was the heaviest of the men's judo weight classes, allowing competitors with over 100 kilograms of body mass. Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\nIn this competition, the heaviest athlete of the Games, [[Ricardo Blas Jr.]], competed with a body weight of 210&nbsp;kg. Despite his huge body, he was thrown away by his opponent in the first round, eliminating him from the tournament.\n\n==Tournament results==\n\n==Qualifying athletes==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located on a peninsula at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nThe Port Gardner Peninsula was historically inhabited by the [[Snohomish people]], who had a winter village named Hibulb near the mouth of the river. American settlement in the area began with loggers and homesteaders arriving in the 1860s, but plans to build a city were not conceived until 1890. A consortium of East Coast investors seeking to build a major industrial city acquired land in the area and filed a [[plat]]ted for \"Everett\", which they named in honor of [[Everett Colby]], the son of investor [[Charles L. Colby]]. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major lumber center with several large [[sawmill]]s.\n\nEverett became the county seat in 1897 after a dispute with [[Snohomish, Washington|Snohomish]] contested over several elections and a [[Washington Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] case. The city was the site of labor unrest during the 1910s, which culminated in the [[Everett massacre]] in 1916 that killed several members of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]. The area was connected by new [[interurban]] railways and highway bridges in the 1920s, transforming it into a major commercial hub, and gained an airport at [[Paine Field]] in 1936.\n\nThe city's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aerospace after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at Paine Field in 1967. Boeing's presence brought additional industrial and commercial development to Everett, as well as new residential neighborhoods to the south and west of the peninsula that was [[Annexation|annexed]] by the city. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses. Everett stages several annual festivals and is also home to minor league sports teams, including the [[Everett Silvertips]] at [[Angel of the Winds Arena]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.
