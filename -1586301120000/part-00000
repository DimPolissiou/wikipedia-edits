He was known for his high-pitched screamed vocals and lyrics that either shock, offend, or invoke [[black comedy|morbid humor]]. Throughout his career, Putnam was also involved in numerous side projects.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early years===\nPutnam was born on May 15, 1968, in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/71292842 |title=Seth Edward Putnam |website=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref> to father Edward R.

In the mid-1980s, Putnam played bass in the [[thrash metal]] band [[Executioner (band)|Executioner]].\n\n===Personality===\nDespite his shock humor and turbulent lifestyle, Putnam was often described by fans and peers as a warm, intelligent, sensitive man.

That summer, they recorded 4 songs. all of them were old Sickness songs. \"Blinking Blue Lights\" was actually recorded by Kilslug, but never released. The other songs that were done originally by the Sickness never got released either. They made another E.P. called \"Bad Mood\" that had a certain amount of copies pressed but were never officially released. Seth and Lee Suniga (owner of Menace To Sobriety Records) sold them on eBay. Angry Hate did 2 live shows in March and April of 2002.\n\n====Satan's Warriors====\nSatan's Warriors started in February of 1986 after Seth and his friends made up a fake death metal fanzine with fake band names as a joke, Seth eventually admitted to doing it, in April of that year. There was an opening for a band\nto play live over the radio so Seth got a lineup together and made a 4 song demo with him on drums and vocals and his cousin Drew on guitar. Their final show was on July of 1988. They were supposed to get back together in 2003 and re-record some songs written between 1986 and 1988. The lineup was supposed to be with Seth on guitar & vocals, Paulie Kraynak on second guitar, and John Gillis on drums.\n\n====Impaled Northern Moonforest====\nIn early 1997, Seth and Josh Martin came up with the idea of starting a joke black metal band and decided to record a demo, they didn't use actual drums because someone was sleeping in the room next to them so Josh played his acoustic guitar while Seth did vocals and percussion by slapping his leg and a mattress, they did a few shows and sold copies of their first demo, the titles on the demo are different from the ones on the 7\" vinyl release due to Seth and Josh losing their copies of the demo and forgetting the titles.\n\n====Shit Scum====\nShit Scum formed in 1988 after Seth saw an ad looking for musicians, Seth chose to call after seeing Cryptic Slaughter as the only influence because not many people in Boston were into that band. Seth eventually invited Fred Ordonez to see Satan's Warriors (which was their last show), Anal Cunt was also playing what was supposed to be their last show but Fred and his friends never showed up, so Seth did another show with Anal Cunt so Fred could see them, Shit Scum also did their first show on the same day. Seth was eventually invited to a studio to play bass on their first demo called \"Self Mutilation\", they later did a show in 1990, Seth and Fred (without Wayne who was their drummer) went to a studio that college rock bands mainly performed at. The engineer didn't like them and tried convincing them to quit, the record was eventually finished and they ended up owing the studio money so the studio kept the master reel. Anal Cunt did a tour in Germany and did some Shit Scum covers. Matthias Weigand (head of Ecocentric Records) liked the cover of the song \"Shit Scum\" and wanted to put out a 7\". Seth called the studio and asked about the reel, the guy on the phone said \"it's right here, pick it up whenever you want\", not knowing they owed money to the studio. Seth mixed all the songs and sent them to Ecocentric Records. Fred never had a cover for the record so Matthias made one up. The record was eventually called \"Manson Is Jesus\". Fred wanted the record to be called, \"I Wish this Record Could Punch You in the Face\", and have a fist on the cover. Shit Scum had already broken up by the time the album was released.\n\n====Full Blown A.I.D.S.====\nFull Blown A.I.D.S. started in 1997 while he was jamming with his friend and cousin. In 1998 he wrote some songs and recorded a demo of \"No One Cares\" with Nate Linehan on drums. In 2002 he moved to Texas for a while but eventually moved back to Boston. In 2003 the band went into the studio and recorded some songs and mixed them in a day. They eventually put out 2 E.P's and put out a compilation CD in 2008<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2062039-Full-Blown-AIDS|title=Full Blown AIDS|last=|first=|date=|website=Discogs|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> with both E.P's and the song \"Throwing Cars At People On Coke With Thor\".\n\n====Death's Head Quartet====\nThe Death's Head Quartet was a Jazz/Noise improv. band that featured Seth on bass and vocals, Chris Joyce on guitar, Robert Williams on drums, and Jim Hobbs on saxophone<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wickedsickrecords.com/SP_FAQs.htm#What%20are%20ALL%20the%20bands%20that%20Seth%20been%20involved%20with%20(including%20guest%20appearances)|title=SP FAQ's|website=www.wickedsickrecords.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>. Their first release was called \"Live on the Joint\" which was a radio broadcast from November 1st, 2001. Their second release was recorded on April 9th of 2001 and wasn't released until 2003. \n\n====Cuntsaw====\nCuntsaw started in 1989 with Seth on vocals and guitar and Tim Morse on drums. They usually practiced after Anal Cunt shows. They did one demo called \"Concerned\" and did one show at Brandeis University with Fred Ordonez on second guitar. They eventually broke up. The Anal Cunt Song \"Foreplay With A Tree Shredder\" was originally a Cuntsaw song that had a different title.\n\n====You're Fired====\nYou're Fired started in 2002. Within two months they had a nine-song demo recorded which eventually became the Warning E.P and was released in 2002. After Seth passed away, they made an E.P. called \"The End\" with Paulie Kraynak on guitar. Most of the riffs were written by Seth and the album was also recorded with Seth's Gibson SG and Marshall amplifier that were also used on the Warning E.P. \"The End\" was released in 2012 on vinyl and it also can be purchased on BandCamp along with the Warning E.P.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yourefiredboston.bandcamp.com/|title=The End (E.P.), by YOU'RE FIRED|website=YOU'RE FIRED|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n====Pantera====\nIn 1996, Putnam did guest vocals on [[Pantera]]'s [[The Great Southern Trendkill]] for their songs,\"The Great Southern Trendkill\", \"War Nerve\", \"13 Steps to Nowhere\", and \"Suicide Note Pt. II\".\n\n====Adolf Satan====\nAdolf Satan started in 2002 after Upsidedown Cross broke up. Seth played drums for the band for a brief period of time. He eventually quit and Nate Linehan joined. They made a demo in 2003 and eventually made a self titled studio album. They made another demo in 2006 and broke up 2 years later.\n\n*[[Upsidedown Cross (band)|Upsidedown Cross]] (note: Although Putnam is credited playing guitar on their split with Sloth, the album was actually recorded years before he joined the band)\n*[[Executioner (band)|Executioner]]\n*[[Post Mortem (Boston Band)|Post Mortem]]\n*[[Siege (band)|Siege]]\n\n====P.O.D.D.A. (Pile Of Drunks & Drug Addicts)====\nNot much is known about this band but they had only one recording session in 2007 which eventually surfaced onto YouTube, the band had Seth on vocals, [https://www.discogs.com/artist/2659376-Dejan-Podobnik Dejan Podobnik](Patareni, Millions of Dead Cops...) on drums and Chomi on guitar. Mickey Offender from D.R.I., Offenders,  was supposed to lay a bass track but it never happened.(rip)\n\n====Sirhan Sirhan====\nThis band started in December of 1990 and Seth and Tim Morse were trying to think of a christmas gift for Mike Mahan who recently moved to Indiana, they recorded a demo and got a band picture in a $2 photo booth. They sent it to Mike who eventually lost his copy, the demo was released as a split album with Cuntsaw.\n\n====Insult====\nInsult started in 1992 and decided to record an album in 1997, it was going horribly for them so they got Seth to come in and produce their album, the album was called \"I Wanna Be A Burn Victim\", Seth eventually became their bass player and did a west coast tour with them in 1998 as well as a live show over the radio which was released on a split with Anal Cunt, he quit in 1999.\n\n====Person Killer====\nPerson Killer was a one man project Seth started around 1995, he made a demo and sent it to Earache Records along with a t-shirt, a pin, and a letter that didn't reveal the sender's name. It was planned to be released on a two LP set called \"The Worst Of Seth Putnam\" but it hasn't been released.\n\n===Vaginal Jesus===\nRumors circulated as to whether or not Putnam was a member of Vaginal Jesus, originally stating that he was just \"friends\" with the band. However, he later retracted this claim and publicly admitted to being a member.<ref>Resistance magazine // issue no. 25, Winter 2005/2006</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623033415/http://www.racrecords.com/shop/magazines/resistance-magazine-issue-25-spring-2007/|title=Resistance Magazine Issue #25 Winter 2005 / 2006 \u2013 R.A.C.

They made another E.P. called \"Bad Mood\" that had a certain amount of copies pressed but were never officially released. Seth and Lee Suniga (owner of Menace To Sobriety Records) sold them on eBay. Angry Hate did 2 live shows in March and April of 2002.\n\n====Satan's Warriors====\nSatan's Warriors started in February of 1986 after Seth and his friends made up a fake death metal fanzine with fake band names as a joke, Seth eventually admitted to doing it, in April of that year. There was an opening for a band\nto play live over the radio so Seth got a lineup together and made a 4 song demo with him on drums and vocals and his cousin Drew on guitar. Their final show was on July of 1988. They were supposed to get back together in 2003 and re-record some songs written between 1986 and 1988. The lineup was supposed to be with Seth on guitar & vocals, Paulie Kraynak on second guitar, and John Gillis on drums.\n\n====Impaled Northern Moonforest====\nIn early 1997, Seth and Josh Martin came up with the idea of starting a joke black metal band and decided to record a demo, they didn't use actual drums because someone was sleeping in the room next to them so Josh played his acoustic guitar while Seth did vocals and percussion by slapping his leg and a mattress, they did a few shows and sold copies of their first demo, the titles on the demo are different from the ones on the 7\" vinyl release due to Seth and Josh losing their copies of the demo and forgetting the titles.\n\n====Shit Scum====\nShit Scum formed in 1988 after Seth saw an ad looking for musicians, Seth chose to call after seeing Cryptic Slaughter as the only influence because not many people in Boston were into that band. Seth eventually invited Fred Ordonez to see Satan's Warriors (which was their last show), Anal Cunt was also playing what was supposed to be their last show but Fred and his friends never showed up, so Seth did another show with Anal Cunt so Fred could see them, Shit Scum also did their first show on the same day. Seth was eventually invited to a studio to play bass on their first demo called \"Self Mutilation\", they later did a show in 1990, Seth and Fred (without Wayne who was their drummer) went to a studio that college rock bands mainly performed at. The engineer didn't like them and tried convincing them to quit, the record was eventually finished and they ended up owing the studio money so the studio kept the master reel. Anal Cunt did a tour in Germany and did some Shit Scum covers. Matthias Weigand (head of Ecocentric Records) liked the cover of the song \"Shit Scum\" and wanted to put out a 7\". Seth called the studio and asked about the reel, the guy on the phone said \"it's right here, pick it up whenever you want\", not knowing they owed money to the studio. Seth mixed all the songs and sent them to Ecocentric Records. Fred never had a cover for the record so Matthias made one up. The record was eventually called \"Manson Is Jesus\". Fred wanted the record to be called, \"I Wish this Record Could Punch You in the Face\", and have a fist on the cover. Shit Scum had already broken up by the time the album was released.\n\n====Full Blown A.I.D.S.====\nFull Blown A.I.D.S. started in 1997 while he was jamming with his friend and cousin. In 1998 he wrote some songs and recorded a demo of \"No One Cares\" with Nate Linehan on drums. In 2002 he moved to Texas for a while but eventually moved back to Boston. In 2003 the band went into the studio and recorded some songs and mixed them in a day. They eventually put out 2 E.P's and put out a compilation CD in 2008<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2062039-Full-Blown-AIDS|title=Full Blown AIDS|last=|first=|date=|website=Discogs|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref> with both E.P's and the song \"Throwing Cars At People On Coke With Thor\".\n\n====Death's Head Quartet====\nThe Death's Head Quartet was a Jazz/Noise improv. band that featured Seth on bass and vocals, Chris Joyce on guitar, Robert Williams on drums, and Jim Hobbs on saxophone<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wickedsickrecords.com/SP_FAQs.htm#What%20are%20ALL%20the%20bands%20that%20Seth%20been%20involved%20with%20(including%20guest%20appearances)|title=SP FAQ's|website=www.wickedsickrecords.com|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>. Their first release was called \"Live on the Joint\" which was a radio broadcast from November 1st, 2001. Their second release was recorded on April 9th of 2001 and wasn't released until 2003. \n\n====Cuntsaw====\nCuntsaw started in 1989 with Seth on vocals and guitar and Tim Morse on drums. They usually practiced after Anal Cunt shows. They did one demo called \"Concerned\" and did one show at Brandeis University with Fred Ordonez on second guitar. They eventually broke up. The Anal Cunt Song \"Foreplay With A Tree Shredder\" was originally a Cuntsaw song that had a different title.\n\n====You're Fired====\nYou're Fired started in 2002. Within two months they had a nine-song demo recorded which eventually became the Warning E.P and was released in 2002. After Seth passed away, they made an E.P. called \"The End\" with Paulie Kraynak on guitar. Most of the riffs were written by Seth and the album was also recorded with Seth's Gibson SG and Marshall amplifier that were also used on the Warning E.P. \"The End\" was released in 2012 on vinyl and it also can be purchased on BandCamp along with the Warning E.P.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yourefiredboston.bandcamp.com/|title=The End (E.P.), by YOU'RE FIRED|website=YOU'RE FIRED|access-date=2019-12-03}}</ref>\n\n====Pantera====\nIn 1996, Putnam did guest vocals on [[Pantera]]'s [[The Great Southern Trendkill]] for their songs,\"The Great Southern Trendkill\", \"War Nerve\", \"13 Steps to Nowhere\", and \"Suicide Note Pt. II\".\n\n====Adolf Satan====\nAdolf Satan started in 2002 after Upsidedown Cross broke up. Seth played drums for the band for a brief period of time. He eventually quit and Nate Linehan joined. They made a demo in 2003 and eventually made a self titled studio album. They made another demo in 2006 and broke up 2 years later.\n\n*[[Upsidedown Cross (band)|Upsidedown Cross]] (note: Although Putnam is credited playing guitar on their split with Sloth, the album was actually recorded years before he joined the band)\n*[[Executioner (band)|Executioner]]\n*[[Post Mortem (Boston Band)|Post Mortem]]\n*[[Siege (band)|Siege]]\n\n====P.O.D.D.A. (Pile Of Drunks & Drug Addicts)====\nNot much is known about this band but they had only one recording session in 2007 which eventually surfaced onto YouTube, the band had Seth on vocals, [https://www.discogs.com/artist/2659376-Dejan-Podobnik Dejan Podobnik](Patareni, Millions of Dead Cops...) on drums and Chomi on guitar. Mickey Offender from D.R.I., Offenders,  was supposed to lay a bass track but it never happened.(rip)\n\n====Sirhan Sirhan====\nThis band started in December of 1990 and Seth and Tim Morse were trying to think of a christmas gift for Mike Mahan who recently moved to Indiana, they recorded a demo and got a band picture in a $2 photo booth. They sent it to Mike who eventually lost his copy, the demo was released as a split album with Cuntsaw.\n\n====Insult====\nInsult started in 1992 and decided to record an album in 1997, it was going horribly for them so they got Seth to come in and produce their album, the album was called \"I Wanna Be A Burn Victim\", Seth eventually became their bass player and did a west coast tour with them in 1998 as well as a live show over the radio which was released on a split with Anal Cunt, he quit in 1999.\n\n====Person Killer====\nPerson Killer was a one man project Seth started around 1995, he made a demo and sent it to Earache Records along with a t-shirt, a pin, and a letter that didn't reveal the sender's name. It was planned to be released on a 2 LP set called \"The Worst Of Seth Putnam\" but it hasn't been released.\n\n===Vaginal Jesus===\nRumors circulated as to whether or not Putnam was a member of Vaginal Jesus, originally stating that he was just \"friends\" with the band. However, he later retracted this claim and publicly admitted to being a member.<ref>Resistance magazine // issue no. 25, Winter 2005/2006</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180623033415/http://www.racrecords.com/shop/magazines/resistance-magazine-issue-25-spring-2007/|title=Resistance Magazine Issue #25 Winter 2005 / 2006 \u2013 R.A.C.

Some ideas included the \"Spies\", \"Americans\" and \"Eagles\".  Eventually, however, the new team's operators decided simply to name the team \"D.C. United\".

United earned its second consecutive berth into the [[CONCACAF Champions League|CONCACAF Champions' Cup]].  In 1998, the tournament was held mid-season in the United States, and the club made it a priority to earn a North American title.  Following a lopsided quarterfinal 8\u20130 victory over Trindiadian side [[Joe Public F.C.|Joe Public]], United earned a semifinal matchup against the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Invierno 1997|1997 Mexican Invierno]] champions, [[Club Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], ultimately defeating Club Leon 2\u20130 on goals by [[Roy Lassiter]].\n\nIn the [[1998 CONCACAF Champions' Cup#Final|1998 final]], United went up against [[Deportivo Toluca]], the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Verano 1998|1998 Mexican Vernao]] champions. In front of a crowd of 12,607 a 41st-minute goal from United's [[Eddie Pope]] gave United its first, and to date, their only CONCACAF title. United became the first sports franchise in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to earn a continental honor, and the first American and MLS club to win a CONCACAF title. To this date, United is one of only two American soccer clubs to have won any CONCACAF club title.\n\nUnited's continental success culminated in the [[1998 Copa Interamericana|1998]] [[Copa Interamericana]], a now-defunct playoff series between the CONCACAF and [[CONMEBOL]] champions to determine the best soccer club in [[The Americas]]. As winners of 1998 Champions' Cup, United earned a berth into the series to take on [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] of Brazil. In the first leg of the series, played at RFK Stadium, Vasco da Gama earned a 1\u20130 lead in the series. The return match, played in December 1998 was held at [[Lockhart Stadium]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida. In the match, United earned a 2\u20130 win and the 2\u20131 advantage in aggregates to win the series and the final Interamericana title.\n\nDespite two major continental titles in 1998, United failed to win an MLS trophy for the first time. Finishing with the second best regular season record, United fell 10 points shy of Los Angeles Galaxy in the competition for best record. United earned its way into the [[MLS Cup '98|1998]] MLS Cup final through a shoot-out over [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]] in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and a 2\u20131 series victory over [[Columbus Crew]], for United's third consecutive Eastern Conference championship. Taking on upstart expansion side, [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], United were shut out for a 0\u20132 loss against the Fire for the team's first MLS Cup loss.\n\n==== 1999:  Rongen steps in ====\n\n[[Bruce Arena]] had been D.C. United's coach from the beginning, but in October 1998, Arena left the team to direct [[United States men's national soccer team|the U.S. men's national team]].  To replace Arena, United turned to [[Thomas Rongen]], who had won Coach of the Year honors as head of the Tampa Bay Mutiny in MLS's inaugural season.  Rongen guided United to another successful season, and victory in the 1999 MLS Cup in Foxboro, Massachusetts.\n\n== Rebuilding (2000\u201303) ==\n\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, Arena's departure marked the beginning of a downturn in the team's fortunes.<ref name=FIFA>{{cite web |url= https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=887744.html |title= America's one and only United |work= [[FIFA]] |date= September 24, 2008 |accessdate= September 6, 2009}}</ref>  While the club again won the MLS Cup in 1999 under coach [[Thomas Rongen]], following the [[1999 Major League Soccer season|1999]] [[Major League Soccer]] season, the league substantially revised its rules regarding the structural format of the league, including the salary cap.  The club was forced to release several key players so to come within the salary cap, and replaced them with younger, less expensive players.  This \"new look\" United was the first D.C. United squad to fail to reach the MLS Cup and indeed failed to reach the playoffs altogether.  D.C. United finished the [[2000 Major League Soccer season|2000]] MLS season with a record of 8\u20136\u201318 (W-T-L), second worst in the league.\n\nIn 2001 (a season that suffered, the team's 8\u20132\u201316 record consigned the team to a last place finish in the East.  Following two disappointing seasons, the organization fired Rongen and hired former [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]] head coach, [[Ray Hudson]], who had become available when the Fusion was disbanded following contraction by MLS.  Hudson had led the Fusion to a league best 16\u20135\u20135 record, winning the [[MLS Supporters' Shield]].  Despite his pedigree, however, Hudson failed to make a substantial impact with D.C. United in his first year of managing.  In Hudson's debut year of 2002, United finished last in the Eastern Conference for the third consecutive year.  In 2003, D.C. United ended its three-year playoff drought, but the team was eliminated in the conference semifinals by the Chicago Fire 4\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nDespite the playoff berth, Hudson was fired following the 2003 season, [[Piotr Nowak]] replacing him before the start of the 2004 season.<ref name=tradition>{{cite web|url=http://web.mlsnet.com/t103/load.jsp?section=about&content=tradition |title=D.C.

The record was good enough for a second seed in the 2004 MLS Cup Playoffs. In the Eastern Conference championship, the second seed United hosted fourth seed New England in a match that has been deemed as the greatest match in MLS history.<ref name=\"USAToday\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\"/><ref name=\"WashPost\"/><ref name=\"DCU\"/> In front of 21,000 spectators; United and the Revolution battled to a 3\u20133 draw during regulation time, thanks to a last gasp equalizer from New England's [[Pat Noonan]]. Still leveled at three-apiece, the match had to go into penalty kicks. The first takers, New England's [[Steve Ralston]] and D.C.'s [[Ben Olsen]] both missed their penalties, while the next two; [[Matt Reis]] and [[Santino Quaranta]] successfully converted their penalties. The third kick-takers, [[Taylor Twellman]] and [[Freddy Adu]] both nailed their shots. Things got interesting in the fourth and fifth rounds, where New England had their shot saved, while D.C.'s hit the crossbar. The series had to go to sudden death penalty kicks, where New England's [[Clint Dempsey]] missed his, whereas United's [[Brian Carroll]] successfully converted his. Followed by huge uproar and the club storming the field, it was the first time in five years United returned to the MLS Cup championship.\n\nIn [[MLS Cup 2004]], United took on the Western Conference regular season and postseason champions, [[Sporting Kansas City|Kansas City Wizards]]. The Wizards, were coming off a 2\u20130 victory against the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] in the Western Conference finals, to advance to the championship match. The 2004 final received additional hype around United making their first MLS Cup finals appearance in five years, as well as the prospect of Adu playing in his first major cup final. For Kansas City, it was their first trip to the final in four years, having won [[MLS Cup 2000]] previously. For the Wizards, the team started on better ground as Wizards midfielder, [[Jose Burciaga Jr.]] drilled a 25-yard shot into the back of the net, giving the Wizards a 1\u20130 advantage only six minutes into the match. United quickly responded as the Black-and-Red scored thrice within seven minutes, starting with a 19th and 23rd minute pair of goals from [[Alecko Eskandarian]] preluding to Wizards defender, [[Alexandru Zotinc\u0103]] conceding an own goal in the 26th minute. The quick turn of events, according to analysis, shell shocked Kansas City. With a 3\u20131 lead going into the half, United looked poised to earn their fourth MLS championship, only to have that hope speculated in the 58th minute. During that moment, United defensive midfielder [[Dema Kovalenko]] drew a penalty kick for Kansas City and consequently earned a red card ejection from the match. With the ejection, Kovalenko infamously became the first MLS player to be ejected from an MLS Cup final in league history. To this date, no other player in MLS Cup history had been ejected from the championship. Thus allowed Wizards striker, [[Josh Wolff]] to convert a penalty to move the match within a goal. Subsequently, United's Eskandarian was substituted out for Adu, who made his appearance in the 65th minute. Adu was praised for a solid final 25 minutes in which he went on numerous runs deep down the Wizards' back third of the field. In spite of Adu's offensive spark, the shorthanded United had to spend a majority of the final 20 minutes continuously defending off the Wizards, who continuously pressured the back line wave after wave of attacks. However, United were able to veer off wave after wave of Wizards attack to earn their fourth ever MLS Cup title.\n\n=== Consecutive shields ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DC United Guadalajara Copa Sudamericana 2007.jpeg|thumb|right|For finishing third place in the 2007 CONCACAF Champions' Cup, D.C.

Between 2005 and 2008, United nearly doubled their trophy case by earning a [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]] title in [[2008 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final|2008]] as well as two [[MLS Supporters' Shield|Supporters Shield]]s during the three-year span. Most notably, United became the first MLS club to consecutively win the Supporters Shield, in which they won the regular season honor in both [[2006 Major League Soccer season|2006]] and [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007]]. The two Shields gave United berths into the 2007 and 2008 editions of the [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] in which the Black-and-Red made two semifinal runs.\n\nThe [[2006 D.C. United season|2006]] campaign was among United's best regular season performances in club history, tallying a league-best 52 goals while conceding only 38 goals, the second-fewest in the league. By the end of the regular season, United bested [[FC Dallas]] in the Supporters' Shield race, earning a total of 55 points off of a 15\u20137\u201310 record, ahead of Dallas' 52 points.

The justification behind this involved United's inability to defend the [[Supporters' Shield]], an awarded given to the MLS club with the best regular season record, for a third-consecutive year. Additionally, the club failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since [[2002 Major League Soccer season|2002]], finishing sixth in the [[Eastern Conference (MLS)|Eastern Conference]] and 10th in the overall table. The poorer record marked the teams lowest positioning in the league table in nearly five years.\n\nTheir performance league play reflected on the continental stage as well.

The tournament replaced the obsolete CONCACAF Champions' Cup, and was similarly modeled after its cousin tournament, the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the Champions League, United continued their misfortunes, losing all their Group Stage matches at home, and only managing to pick up one draw at Costa Rica's [[C.D. Saprissa|Saprissa]]. United finished in the bottom of Group C, with a record of 0\u20131\u20135 (W-T-L).\n\nDespite poor performance in MLS and CONCACAF competitions, United excelled in the domestic cup competition, the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]]. During the 2008 Open Cup campaign, United won their first Open Cup title in 12 years defeating the [[Charleston Battery]], 2\u20131. The domestic cup title was their first since their [[1996 D.C. United season|inaugural season]]. The U.S. Open Cup, a domestic cup tournament much similar to the [[FA Cup]] runs parallel to the regular seasons of all tiers of professional and amateur soccer in the [[Soccer in the United States|United States]]. The tournament is open for entry for any soccer club, professional or amateur, that is affiliated with the [[United States Soccer Federation]]. For MLS clubs, the top six American MLS clubs overall in the regular season are admitted entry into the third round proper, or round of 16, in the tournament. By finishing 1st overall in the regular season, United booked a third round entry in the tournament proper. The club opened Open Cup play with wins against [[Rochester Rhinos]] of the [[United Soccer League (1984\u201385)|USL First Division]] (second tier) and [[New England Revolution]] of MLS (first tier) in the third round and quarterfinals respectively. In the semifinals, United won in [[extra time]] to defeat [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]. In the championship, United defeated [[Charleston Battery]] of the [[USL Second Division]] (third tier) to win the Open Cup for a second time in club history.\n\nThe 2009 season looked to be a stronger campaign for United, as the club held itself in a playoff position for a majority of MLS regular season play. Outside of the league, United made through the [[2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification#Schedule|MLS qualification propers]] of the U.S. Open Cup to qualify for the main tournament proper. Once in the actual tournament, United reached the U.S. Open Cup final for the second consecutive year, and for the fourth time in their history. Hosting the [[Seattle Sounders FC]], the match site was heavily criticized as to how U.S. Soccer determined the venue,<ref name=\"dc-opencup-stadium\">{{cite news |first=Jos\u00e9 Miguel |last=Romero |title=U.S. Open Cup has been battle, and that's just on final site |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sounders/2009781867_sounders01.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=September 10, 2009}}</ref>  which was kept private.<ref name=\"dcprelude\">{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Goff |title=United, Sounders Add Heat to U.S. Open Cup Final |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/01/AR2009090103171.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 2, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref> The match, ended in a 2\u20131 victory for Seattle. Seattle's [[Fredy Montero]] and [[Roger Levesque]] scoring the teams two goals, while United's [[Clyde Simms]] scored a late-consolation goal. On-pitch controversy swirled around United goalkeeper, [[Josh Wicks]] who intentionally stomped on Montero's hand, after Montero scored the opening goal in the 67th minute. Two minutes later, Wicks was ejected from the match, causing United's [[Christian Gomez]] to sub out to be replaced by back-up keeper, [[Milo\u0161 Koci\u0107]]. Following the match, U.S. Soccer suspended Wicks for five Open Cup matches.\n\nBy winning the 2008 U.S. Open Cup, United earned a berth into the [[2009\u201310 CONCACAF Champions League]]. United fared better in their second Champions League journey, earning three wins, a draw and two losses. However, despite the winning record, United finished third in their group, narrowly missing out on the quarterfinals. Until the [[2011\u201312 CONCACAF Champions League]], United had the highest total number of points in Group Stage not to qualify for the knockout round of the Champions League.\n\n=== 2010:  Wooden Spoon recipients ===\n[[File:DC United Head Coach Tom Soehn (2008).jpg|thumb|left]]\n\n{{see also|2010 D.C. United season}}\n\nFollowing the club's failure to qualify for the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]] for two consecutive seasons, Tom Soehn resigned from the head coaching duties.  Soehn became a director of soccer operations for the then-second tier club, [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986\u20132010)|Vancouver Whitecaps]].  D.C. United hired former [[Sporting Kansas City|Kansas City Wizards]] head coach, [[Curt Onalfo]] to replace Soehn.  Onalfo, who had played for United in the 1990s, became the first former United player to be hired as a head coach. The recently retired [[Ben Olsen]] was hired as an assistant coach for Onalfo while Steve Sampson, who was an assistant to Soehn, remained on the coaching staff.\n\nOnalfo's tenure was brief and unsuccessful.  The 2010 season marked the poorest league finish for the club since [[2002 Major League Soccer season|2002]], and the worst regular season record in franchise history.  The team managed to only win six regular season matches out of a possible 30, while losing 20 games and drawing four.  United scored only 22 goals, the lowest team total in MLS regular season history, and the lowest offensive production since the [[Toronto FC]] in [[2007 Toronto FC season|2007]].  United's attendance fell to 14,500 fans a game.  Onalfo was fired before the end of the season, on August 4, 2010, and the team assigned coaching duties to Ben Olsen on an interim basis.  As interim manager, Olsen led the team to a 3\u20136\u20131 record during the final 10 games of the regular season.\n\nDespite the team's poor regular season performance, the club had a strong run in the [[2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|2010]] [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]], where they reached the semifinals before falling to eventual [[2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final|runners-up]], [[Columbus Crew]].\n\n==\"Bennyball\" (2012\u2013) ==\n{{see also|2011 D.C.

The club completed three major acquisitions during the offseason, first obtaining ex-[[Sporting Kansas City]] attacker [[Josh Wolff]] and [[Houston Dynamo]] striker [[Joseph Ngwenya]] in the MLS Re-Entry Draft and then in February 2011, following a lengthy trial, signing [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] standout [[Charlie Davies]] on a season-long loan from French outfit [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux]] of the [[Ligue 1|French Ligue 1]].\n\n=== 2012:  Thohir and Levien join ownership group ===\n{{see also|2012 D.C.

Their ambitions included expanding D.C. United's global reach as well as the prime goal, acquiring a soccer stadium for the team.\n\nOn October 21, 2012, D.C United defeated [[Columbus Crew]] at RFK, 3\u20132, and returned to the MLS Cup Playoffs for the first time in five years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shatzer|first=Martin|title=D.C.

In their last 15 games, United scored more than 2 goals only once, in that playoff-clinching win over the Crew. In fact, that was the only game in the final six in which United scored more than one goal. After losing star player [[Dwayne De Rosario]] to a season-ending knee injury, coach Ben Olsen had implemented a strategy of playing a deliberately defensive shell and aiming for one clear chance in attack to win a game, tactics that came to be known as Bennyball.\n\nIn the playoffs, United defeated rival [[New York Red Bulls]] in the conference semifinals and proceeded to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they fell to the [[Houston Dynamo]] on a 4\u20132 aggregate score. The conference semifinals against New York were disrupted by [[Hurricane Sandy]].  The storm interrupted essential services in the New York / New Jersey area, making it impracticable to begin the two-game series in New York as scheduled.  MLS, with United's concurrence, switched the order of the home-and-away games, moving the first game to Washington and thereby eliminating United's advantage, as the higher-seeded team, as host of the second and potentially deciding game.  A snowstorm hit New York on the night of the rescheduled second match, and after ineffective snow removal, the match was postponed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shatzer|first=Martin|title=\nD.C. United Vs.

For a majority of the franchise's season, the Diplomats played at RFK Stadium, but some of their matches were played at [[W.T.

Awarded Inaugural MLS Franchise ===\nPrior to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], the [[United States Soccer Federation]] fulfilled promises to [[FIFA]] by aiding in the foundation of a new professional league.

In keeping with [[Sports in the United States|sports naming conventions in the United States]], the earliest efforts entailed the area's name followed by a mascot. Some ideas included the \"Spies\", \"Americans\" and \"Eagles\".  Eventually, however, the new team's operators decided simply to name the team \"D.C. United\".  The name \"United\" alluded to well-known European club names such as [[Leeds United A.F.C|Leeds]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and reflected the team's location in the capital of the United States.<ref name=\"dc united name\">{{cite book|last=Dure|first=Beau|title=Long Range Goals: The Success Story of Major League Soccer|year=2010|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Dulles, Virginia|isbn=978-1-59797-509-4|pages=21\u201323}}</ref><ref>http://www.mlssoccer.com/history/club/dcunited</ref>\n\nThe team's colors and original logo, along with those of the other ten original teams, were announced on October 17, 1995, during a presentation in New York City.<ref name=overview/> Black and white are D.C.

The team's shirt sponsor is Leidos. In 2011, the team introduced a predominantly red [[Third jersey|third kit]] with black accents to be worn four or more times in the season.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/2011/01/dc_uniteds_third_jersey.html |title= D.C.

White and red are the colors of the [[flag of Washington, D.C.]], and the stripes are also reminiscent of those used on the flag. [[Goalkeeper (association football)|Goalkeepers]] usually distinguish themselves with a red or green colored shirt.\n\nThe team's original shield was implemented in 1996 consisting of the team's name, D.C. United, above a black [[bald eagle]] facing right on a red field, clutching in its talons three [[soccer ball]]s overlaid on three white stars. The three stars and balls were again intended to represent the region's three jurisdictions. The eagle \u2013 the national bird of the United States \u2013 symbolizes many of the attributes of the team, including speed and power. This original logo was redesigned before the 1998 season. The current design reoriented the eagle facing left, and removed the three stars below it, whose metaphor was retained by three raised wing feathers. At the center of the eagle is a single gold colored star and soccer ball, which represents the team's victory in [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[MLS Cup 1996|inaugural cup in 1996]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.footballcrests.com/clubs/dc-united-sc |title= D.C.

The team's second year saw United compete, in addition to Major League Soccer, in the U.S. Open Cup and the CONCACAF Champions' Cup.\n\nOn August 12, 1997, United would play their first international opponent, Trinidad and Tobago's [[United Petrotrin]] in the CONCACAF [[1997 CONCACAF Champions' Cup#Quarterfinals|quarterfinals]]. There, an 84th-minute goal from [[Marco Etcheverry]] gave the club the 1\u20130 win, and a spot in the CONCACAF semifinals, where United would face a familiar foe, [[Los Angeles Galaxy]].<ref name=\"1997 CONCACAF\"/>  Played once again at Washington, D.C.'s [[Robert F.

United earned its second consecutive berth into the [[CONCACAF Champions League|CONCACAF Champions' Cup]].  In 1998, the tournament was held mid-season in the United States, and the club made it a priority to earn a North American title.  Following a lopsided quarterfinal 8\u20130 victory over Trindiadian side [[Joe Public F.C.|Joe Public]], United earned a semifinal matchup against the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Invierno 1997|1997 Mexican Invierno]] champions, [[Club Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]], ultimately defeating Club Leon 2\u20130 on goals by [[Roy Lassiter]].\n\nIn the [[1998 CONCACAF Champions' Cup#Final|1998 final]], United went up against [[Deportivo Toluca]], the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Verano 1998|1998 Mexican Vernao]] champions. In front of a crowd of 12,607 a 41st-minute goal from United's [[Eddie Pope]] gave United its first, and to date, their only CONCACAF title. United became the first sports franchise in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area to earn a continental honor, and the first American and MLS club to win a CONCACAF title. To this date, United is one of only two American soccer clubs to have won any CONCACAF club title.\n\nUnited's continental success culminated in the [[1998 Copa Interamericana|1998]] [[Copa Interamericana]], a now-defunct playoff series between the CONCACAF and [[CONMEBOL]] champions to determine the best soccer club in [[The Americas]]. As winners of 1998 Champions' Cup, United earned a berth into the series to take on [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] of Brazil. In the first leg of the series, played at RFK Stadium, Vasco da Gama earned a 1\u20130 lead in the series. The return match, played in December 1998 was held at [[Lockhart Stadium]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida. In the match, United earned a 2\u20130 win and the 2\u20131 advantage in aggregates to win the series and the final Interamericana title.\n\nDespite two major continental titles in 1998, United failed to win an MLS trophy for the first time. Finishing with the second best regular season record, United fell 10 points shy of Los Angeles Galaxy in the competition for best record. United earned its way into the [[MLS Cup '98|1998]] MLS Cup final through a shoot-out over [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]] in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and a 2\u20131 series victory over [[Columbus Crew]], for United's third consecutive Eastern Conference championship. Taking on upstart expansion side, [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]], United were shut out for a 0\u20132 loss against the Fire for the team's first MLS Cup loss.\n\n==== 1999:  Rongen steps in ====\n\n[[Bruce Arena]] had been D.C. United's coach from the beginning, but in October 1998, Arena left the team to direct [[United States men's national soccer team|the U.S. men's national team]].  To replace Arena, United turned to [[Thomas Rongen]], who had won Coach of the Year honors as head of the Tampa Bay Mutiny in MLS's inaugural season.  Rongen guided United to another successful season, and victory in the 1999 MLS Cup in Foxboro, Massachusetts.\n\n== Rebuilding (2000\u201303) ==\n\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, Arena's departure marked the beginning of a downturn in the team's fortunes.<ref name=FIFA>{{cite web |url= https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=887744.html |title= America's one and only United |work= [[FIFA]] |date= September 24, 2008 |accessdate= September 6, 2009}}</ref>  While the club again won the MLS Cup in 1999 under coach [[Thomas Rongen]], following the [[1999 Major League Soccer season|1999]] [[Major League Soccer]] season, the league substantially revised its rules regarding the structural format of the league, including the salary cap.  The club was forced to release several key players so to come within the salary cap, and replaced them with younger, less expensive players.  This \"new look\" United was the first D.C. United squad to fail to reach the MLS Cup and indeed failed to reach the playoffs altogether.  D.C. United finished the [[2000 Major League Soccer season|2000]] MLS season with a record of 8\u20136\u201318 (W-T-L), second worst in the league.\n\nIn 2001 (a season that suffered, the team's 8\u20132\u201316 record consigned the team to a last place finish in the East.  Following two disappointing seasons, the organization fired Rongen and hired former [[Miami Fusion F.C.|Miami Fusion]] head coach, [[Ray Hudson]], who had become available when the Fusion was disbanded following contraction by MLS.  Hudson had led the Fusion to a league best 16\u20135\u20135 record, winning the [[MLS Supporters' Shield]].  Despite his pedigree, however, Hudson failed to make a substantial impact with D.C. United in his first year of managing.  In Hudson's debut year of 2002, United finished last in the Eastern Conference for the third consecutive year.  In 2003, D.C. United ended its three-year playoff drought, but the team was eliminated in the conference semifinals by the Chicago Fire 4\u20130 on aggregate.\n\nDespite the playoff berth, Hudson was fired following the 2003 season, [[Piotr Nowak]] replacing him before the start of the 2004 season.<ref name=tradition>{{cite web|url=http://web.mlsnet.com/t103/load.jsp?section=about&content=tradition |title=D.C.

Highlighted with an [[MLS Cup]] title, two [[MLS Supporters' Shield|Supporters' Shield]]s, and an [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|Open Cup]] title, United nearly doubled their trophy case in the span of four years.\n\nFebruary 18, 2004; Nowak took the helm of head coach for United following the firing of Ray Hudson. The year was also marked by the arrival of up and coming teen prodigy [[Freddy Adu]] who, at the time, was only 14 years old.

The record was good enough for a second seed in the 2004 MLS Cup Playoffs. In the Eastern Conference championship, the second seed United hosted fourth seed New England in a match that has been deemed as the greatest match in MLS history.<ref name=\"USAToday\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\"/><ref name=\"WashPost\"/><ref name=\"DCU\"/> In front of 21,000 spectators; United and the Revolution battled to a 3\u20133 draw during regulation time, thanks to a last gasp equalizer from New England's [[Pat Noonan]]. Still leveled at three-apiece, the match had to go into penalty kicks. The first takers, New England's [[Steve Ralston]] and D.C.'s [[Ben Olsen]] both missed their penalties, while the next two; [[Matt Reis]] and [[Santino Quaranta]] successfully converted their penalties. The third kick-takers, [[Taylor Twellman]] and [[Freddy Adu]] both nailed their shots. Things got interesting in the fourth and fifth rounds, where New England had their shot saved, while D.C.'s hit the crossbar. The series had to go to sudden death penalty kicks, where New England's [[Clint Dempsey]] missed his, whereas United's [[Brian Carroll]] successfully converted his. Followed by huge uproar and the club storming the field, it was the first time in five years United returned to the MLS Cup championship.\n\nIn [[MLS Cup 2004]], United took on the Western Conference regular season and postseason champions, [[Sporting Kansas City|Kansas City Wizards]]. The Wizards, were coming off a 2\u20130 victory against the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] in the Western Conference finals, to advance to the championship match. The 2004 final received additional hype around United making their first MLS Cup finals appearance in five years, as well as the prospect of Adu playing in his first major cup final. For Kansas City, it was their first trip to the final in four years, having won [[MLS Cup 2000]] previously. For the Wizards, the team started on better ground as Wizards midfielder, [[Jose Burciaga Jr.]] drilled a 25-yard shot into the back of the net, giving the Wizards a 1\u20130 advantage only six minutes into the match. United quickly responded as the Black-and-Red scored thrice within seven minutes, starting with a 19th and 23rd minute pair of goals from [[Alecko Eskandarian]] preluding to Wizards defender, [[Alexandru Zotinc\u0103]] conceding an own goal in the 26th minute. The quick turn of events, according to analysis, shell shocked Kansas City. With a 3\u20131 lead going into the half, United looked poised to earn their fourth MLS championship, only to have that hope speculated in the 58th minute. During that moment, United defensive midfielder [[Dema Kovalenko]] drew a penalty kick for Kansas City and consequently earned a red card ejection from the match. With the ejection, Kovalenko infamously became the first MLS player to be ejected from an MLS Cup final in league history. To this date, no other player in MLS Cup history had been ejected from the championship. Thus allowed Wizards striker, [[Josh Wolff]] to convert a penalty to move the match within a goal. Subsequently, United's Eskandarian was substituted out for Adu, who made his appearance in the 65th minute. Adu was praised for a solid final 25 minutes in which he went on numerous runs deep down the Wizards' back third of the field. In spite of Adu's offensive spark, the shorthanded United had to spend a majority of the final 20 minutes continuously defending off the Wizards, who continuously pressured the back line wave after wave of attacks. However, United were able to veer off wave after wave of Wizards attack to earn their fourth ever MLS Cup title.\n\n=== Consecutive shields ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DC United Guadalajara Copa Sudamericana 2007.jpeg|thumb|right|For finishing third place in the 2007 CONCACAF Champions' Cup, D.C.

United's success in earning the 2004 MLS Cup title, the club went on a run in which has been credited as a \"second golden age\" for United. Between 2005 and 2008, United nearly doubled their trophy case by earning a [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]] title in [[2008 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final|2008]] as well as two [[MLS Supporters' Shield|Supporters Shield]]s during the three-year span. Most notably, United became the first MLS club to consecutively win the Supporters Shield, in which they won the regular season honor in both [[2006 Major League Soccer season|2006]] and [[2007 Major League Soccer season|2007]]. The two Shields gave United berths into the 2007 and 2008 editions of the [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup]] in which the Black-and-Red made two semifinal runs.\n\nThe [[2006 D.C. United season|2006]] campaign was among United's best regular season performances in club history, tallying a league-best 52 goals while conceding only 38 goals, the second-fewest in the league. By the end of the regular season, United bested [[FC Dallas]] in the Supporters' Shield race, earning a total of 55 points off of a 15\u20137\u201310 record, ahead of Dallas' 52 points. Off the pitch, an attempt to sell the franchise fell through, while other clubs found owners, such as their Atlantic Cup rivals, the MetroStars being sold to [[Red Bull]] and being rebranded as New York Red Bulls.<ref name=\"2006 MLS\">{{cite web|last=Litterer|first=Dave|title=The Year in American Soccer, 2006.

The justification behind this involved United's inability to defend the [[Supporters' Shield]], an awarded given to the MLS club with the best regular season record, for a third-consecutive year. Additionally, the club failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since [[2002 Major League Soccer season|2002]], finishing sixth in the [[Eastern Conference (MLS)|Eastern Conference]] and 10th in the overall table. The poorer record marked the teams lowest positioning in the league table in nearly five years.\n\nTheir performance league play reflected on the continental stage as well. Finishing as the [[2007 Major League Soccer season#Standings|2007 MLS Supporters' Shield]] winners, United qualified for the inaugural [[CONCACAF Champions League]], an international club tournament featuring the league, domestic and playoff champions from [[CONCACAF]] nations, pertaining to North and Central America, as well as the Caribbean. The tournament replaced the obsolete CONCACAF Champions' Cup, and was similarly modeled after its cousin tournament, the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the Champions League, United continued their misfortunes, losing all their Group Stage matches at home, and only managing to pick up one draw at Costa Rica's [[C.D. Saprissa|Saprissa]]. United finished in the bottom of Group C, with a record of 0\u20131\u20135 (W-T-L).\n\nDespite poor performance in MLS and CONCACAF competitions, United excelled in the domestic cup competition, the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]]. During the 2008 Open Cup campaign, United won their first Open Cup title in 12 years defeating the [[Charleston Battery]], 2\u20131. The domestic cup title was their first since their [[1996 D.C. United season|inaugural season]]. The U.S. Open Cup, a domestic cup tournament much similar to the [[FA Cup]] runs parallel to the regular seasons of all tiers of professional and amateur soccer in the [[Soccer in the United States|United States]]. The tournament is open for entry for any soccer club, professional or amateur, that is affiliated with the [[United States Soccer Federation]]. For MLS clubs, the top six American MLS clubs overall in the regular season are admitted entry into the third round proper, or round of 16, in the tournament. By finishing 1st overall in the regular season, United booked a third round entry in the tournament proper. The club opened Open Cup play with wins against [[Rochester Rhinos]] of the [[United Soccer League (1984\u201385)|USL First Division]] (second tier) and [[New England Revolution]] of MLS (first tier) in the third round and quarterfinals respectively. In the semifinals, United won in [[extra time]] to defeat [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]. In the championship, United defeated [[Charleston Battery]] of the [[USL Second Division]] (third tier) to win the Open Cup for a second time in club history.\n\nThe 2009 season looked to be a stronger campaign for United, as the club held itself in a playoff position for a majority of MLS regular season play. Outside of the league, United made through the [[2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup qualification#Schedule|MLS qualification propers]] of the U.S. Open Cup to qualify for the main tournament proper. Once in the actual tournament, United reached the U.S. Open Cup final for the second consecutive year, and for the fourth time in their history.

Two minutes later, Wicks was ejected from the match, causing United's [[Christian Gomez]] to sub out to be replaced by back-up keeper, [[Milo\u0161 Koci\u0107]]. Following the match, U.S. Soccer suspended Wicks for five Open Cup matches.\n\nBy winning the 2008 U.S. Open Cup, United earned a berth into the [[2009\u201310 CONCACAF Champions League]]. United fared better in their second Champions League journey, earning three wins, a draw and two losses. However, despite the winning record, United finished third in their group, narrowly missing out on the quarterfinals.

Soehn became a director of soccer operations for the then-second tier club, [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986\u20132010)|Vancouver Whitecaps]].  D.C. United hired former [[Sporting Kansas City|Kansas City Wizards]] head coach, [[Curt Onalfo]] to replace Soehn.  Onalfo, who had played for United in the 1990s, became the first former United player to be hired as a head coach. The recently retired [[Ben Olsen]] was hired as an assistant coach for Onalfo while Steve Sampson, who was an assistant to Soehn, remained on the coaching staff.\n\nOnalfo's tenure was brief and unsuccessful.  The 2010 season marked the poorest league finish for the club since [[2002 Major League Soccer season|2002]], and the worst regular season record in franchise history.  The team managed to only win six regular season matches out of a possible 30, while losing 20 games and drawing four.  United scored only 22 goals, the lowest team total in MLS regular season history, and the lowest offensive production since the [[Toronto FC]] in [[2007 Toronto FC season|2007]].  United's attendance fell to 14,500 fans a game.  Onalfo was fired before the end of the season, on August 4, 2010, and the team assigned coaching duties to Ben Olsen on an interim basis.  As interim manager, Olsen led the team to a 3\u20136\u20131 record during the final 10 games of the regular season.\n\nDespite the team's poor regular season performance, the club had a strong run in the [[2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|2010]] [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]], where they reached the semifinals before falling to eventual [[2010 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final|runners-up]], [[Columbus Crew]].\n\n==\"Bennyball\" (2012\u2013) ==\n{{see also|2011 D.C.

The club completed three major acquisitions during the offseason, first obtaining ex-[[Sporting Kansas City]] attacker [[Josh Wolff]] and [[Houston Dynamo]] striker [[Joseph Ngwenya]] in the MLS Re-Entry Draft and then in February 2011, following a lengthy trial, signing [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] standout [[Charlie Davies]] on a season-long loan from French outfit [[FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard|Sochaux]] of the [[Ligue 1|French Ligue 1]].\n\n=== 2012:  Thohir and Levien join ownership group ===\n{{see also|2012 D.C. United season}}\nIn summer 2012, [[Erick Thohir]] and [[Jason Levien]], both at the time minority partners in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Philadelphia 76ers]], joined club owner William Chang's ownership group.  Their ambitions included expanding D.C. United's global reach as well as the prime goal, acquiring a soccer stadium for the team.\n\nOn October 21, 2012, D.C United defeated [[Columbus Crew]] at RFK, 3\u20132, and returned to the MLS Cup Playoffs for the first time in five years.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shatzer|first=Martin|title=D.C.

In their last 15 games, United scored more than 2 goals only once, in that playoff-clinching win over the Crew. In fact, that was the only game in the final six in which United scored more than one goal. After losing star player [[Dwayne De Rosario]] to a season-ending knee injury, coach Ben Olsen had implemented a strategy of playing a deliberately defensive shell and aiming for one clear chance in attack to win a game, tactics that came to be known as Bennyball.\n\nIn the playoffs, United defeated rival [[New York Red Bulls]] in the conference semifinals and proceeded to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they fell to the [[Houston Dynamo]] on a 4\u20132 aggregate score. The conference semifinals against New York were disrupted by [[Hurricane Sandy]].  The storm interrupted essential services in the New York / New Jersey area, making it impracticable to begin the two-game series in New York as scheduled.  MLS, with United's concurrence, switched the order of the home-and-away games, moving the first game to Washington and thereby eliminating United's advantage, as the higher-seeded team, as host of the second and potentially deciding game.  A snowstorm hit New York on the night of the rescheduled second match, and after ineffective snow removal, the match was postponed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shatzer|first=Martin|title=\nD.C. United Vs.

The team traded the first [[2014 MLS SuperDraft]] pick for the second position and selected [[Steve Birnbaum]]. The Re-Entry draft saw the return to the fold of [[Bobby Boswell]], along with fellow free agents [[Sean Franklin]] and [[Fabian Espindola]]. Off-season trades also brought in veterans [[Davy Arnaud]], [[Jeff Parke]] and [[Eddie Johnson (American soccer)|Eddie Johnson]], while a trade early in 2014 added another quality veteran in [[Chris Rolfe]]. While 2013 had brought the most precipitous one-season decline in MLS history, the 2014 D.C. United team managed the greatest turnaround in the other direction in league history. The team claimed the regular season Eastern Conference Championship,<ref>{{cite web|last=Goff|first=Steven|title=D.C.

It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. A series of [[Regional Red List]]s are produced by countries or organizations which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.\n\nThe IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the [[extinction]] risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policymakers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction. According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) (1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity, to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.<ref>CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants Committees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7\u20139 December 2000, retrieved 14 November 2012</ref>\n\nMajor species assessors include [[BirdLife International]], the [[Institute of Zoology]] (the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]]), the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], and many Specialist Groups within the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.\n\nThe IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a [[peer review]]ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of [[BirdLife International]], an entire class ([[Bird|Aves]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//about/overview#redlist_authorities |title=Red List Overview |work=IUCN Red List |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630010436/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/overview#redlist_authorities |archivedate=30 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of species included on the Red List has been increasing over time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Thomas E.|author-link=Thomas Lovejoy|date=8 August 2017|title=Extinction tsunami can be avoided|journal=[[PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=32|pages=8840\u20138841|doi=10.1073/pnas.1711074114|pmc=5559057|pmid=28747527|doi-access=free}}</ref> As of 2019, of 105,000 species surveyed, 28,338 are considered at risk of extinction because of human activity, in particular [[overfishing]], [[hunting]] and [[land development]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5629548/almost-30000-species-face-extinction-new-report|title='The Numbers Are Just Horrendous.'

It uses a set of criteria to evaluate the extinction risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. With its strong scientific base, the IUCN Red List is recognized as the most authoritative guide to the status of biological diversity. A series of [[Regional Red List]]s are produced by countries or organizations, which assess the risk of extinction to species within a political management unit.\n\nThe IUCN Red List is set upon precise criteria to evaluate the [[extinction]] risk of thousands of species and subspecies. These criteria are relevant to all species and all regions of the world. The aim is to convey the urgency of conservation issues to the public and policy makers, as well as help the international community to try to reduce species extinction. According to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) (1996), the formally stated goals of the Red List are to provide scientifically based information on the status of species and subspecies at a global level, to draw attention to the magnitude and importance of threatened biodiversity, to influence national and international policy and decision-making, and to provide information to guide actions to conserve biological diversity.<ref>CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), Joint Meeting of the Animals and Plants Committees, Shepherdstown (United States of America), 7\u20139 December 2000, retrieved 14 November 2012</ref>\n\nMajor species assessors include [[BirdLife International]], the [[Institute of Zoology]] (the research division of the [[Zoological Society of London]]), the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]], and many Specialist Groups within the [[IUCN Species Survival Commission]] (SSC). Collectively, assessments by these organizations and groups account for nearly half the species on the Red List.\n\nThe IUCN aims to have the category of every species re-evaluated every five years if possible, or at least every ten years. This is done in a [[peer review]]ed manner through IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) Specialist Groups, which are Red List Authorities responsible for a species, group of species or specific geographic area, or in the case of [[BirdLife International]], an entire class ([[Bird|Aves]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org//about/overview#redlist_authorities |title=Red List Overview |work=IUCN Red List |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=20 June 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630010436/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/overview#redlist_authorities |archivedate=30 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe number of species included on the Red List has been increasing over time.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lovejoy|first=Thomas E.|author-link=Thomas Lovejoy|date=8 August 2017|title=Extinction tsunami can be avoided|journal=[[PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=32|pages=8840\u20138841|doi=10.1073/pnas.1711074114|pmc=5559057|pmid=28747527|doi-access=free}}</ref> As of 2019, of 105,000 species surveyed, 28,338 are considered at risk of extinction because of human activity, in particular [[overfishing]], [[hunting]] and [[land development]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://time.com/5629548/almost-30000-species-face-extinction-new-report|title='The Numbers Are Just Horrendous.'

In addition to traditional [[parade]] performances, many marching [[Musical ensemble|band]]s also perform field shows at sporting events and marching band [[competition]]s.

Instruments during the 18th century included fifes, drums, the oboe ([[hautbois]]), French horn, clarinet and bassoon. Drummers summoned men from their farms and ranches to muster for duty. In the chaotic environment of the battlefield, musical instruments were the only means of commanding the men to advance, stand or retire. In the mid 19th century each smaller unit had their own fifer and drummer, who sounded the daily routine. When units massed for battle a band of musicians was formed for the whole.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ammu/hd_ammu.htm |title=Military Music in American and European Traditions &#124; Thematic Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-05-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626131610/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ammu/hd_ammu.htm |archivedate=2014-06-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], modern marching bands are most commonly associated with performing during [[American football]] games.

The first university fight song, ''[[For Boston]],'' was created at [[Boston College]]. Many more recognizable and popular university fight songs are borrowed and played by high schools across the United States. Four such fight songs commonly used by high schools are the [[University of Michigan]]'s ''[[The Victors]]'', the [[University of Illinois]]' ''[[Illinois Loyalty]]'', the [[University of Notre Dame]]'s ''[[Notre Dame Victory March|Victory March]]'', and the [[United States Naval Academy]]'s ''[[Anchors Aweigh]]''.

With high school programs on the rise, marching bands started to become competitive organizations, with the first national contest being held in 1923 in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. [[U.S. state|State]] and national contests became common, often featuring parades and mass-band concerts featuring all participating groups. By 1938, competitive band programs had become numerous and widespread, making a national contest too large to manage and leading to multiple state and regional contests in its place.

These bands are said to be ''corps-style'' bands. Areas where changes have been adopted from drum corps include:\n* Marching: instead of a traditional high step, drum corps tend to march with a fluid glide step, also known as a roll step, to keep musicians' torsos completely still.\n* Auxiliaries: adaptation of the [[Color guard (flag twirling)|flag]], [[rifle]], [[Baton twirling|baton]] and [[sabre]] units into ''auxiliaries'', who march with the band and provide visual flair by spinning and tossing flags or mock weapons and using dance in the performance.\n* Percussion: moving marching timpani and keyboard percussion into a stationary sideline percussion section, or \"[[front ensemble|pit]]\", which has since incorporated many different types of percussion instruments such as: tambourines, crash cymbals, suspended cymbals, bass drum and gong sets, chimes, EWI's (electronic woodwind instrument), and most keyboards.\n* Competitions: marching band competitions are judged using criteria similar to criteria used in drum corps competitions, with emphasis on individual aspects of the band (captions for music performance, visual performance, percussion, guard (auxiliary), and general effect are standard).\n\n==Styles==\nMarching bands are categorized by style based on primary function, instrumentation, and technique, although many organizations may fill multiple roles.\n\n===Military style===\n[[File:Aggie Band.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band|Texas A&M]]'s \"aTm\" formation during halftime]]\n\n[[Military band]]s or [[corps of drums]] were historically the first marching bands. Instrumentation in these bands varies but generally consists of brass, woodwinds, and percussion. Due to their original purpose, military marching bands typically march in a forward direction with consistent straight lines. Music is performed at a constant tempo (120\u2013140 [[BPM (music)|BPM]]) to facilitate the steady marching of the entire military group the band is playing with. The marching step size, or interval, is consistent, and usually at a ''6 to 5'' (six steps per five yards) or ''8 to 5'' (eight steps to five yards). This style includes field music units such as [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]] or bugle bands, [[pipe band]]s, and [[fife and drum corps]].\n\nActive duty military marching bands often perform in parades with other military units and march in the same manner as other military personnel. Due to a lack of appreciation, competition venues, and military personnel, almost all military marching bands have disappeared from schools in the United States, with exceptions including the [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]] from [[Texas A&M University]], the [[Highty-Tighties]] of the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]], and the Cadets of [[Norwich University]] Military College of Vermont. There is also a pocket of about 80 high school military-style marching bands in Eastern Texas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnlike in the United States, military-style marching bands have a strong presence in Latin American countries, especially those that have strong military traditions, most importantly of Prussian, French, Spanish and Portuguese origins. Such bands are found in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, and Peru. In Ecuador and Venezuela in particular, corps of drums is the main military-style band for schools. Military-style corps of drums are also seen in schools, colleges, and universities in Mexico and Mexican schools in the US using only the snare drum and the bugle (though in some schools the instrumentation can be larger). These bands also are present in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama, as well as in Commonwealth and ex-French nations in the Caribbean and Belize and Guayana, given British and French influences. Also, Vietnam has a strong military marching band tradition in schools, following the French and Soviet/Russian tradition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:British Youth Marching Band.jpg|thumb|The Brentwood Imperial Youth Band]]\n\nThe United Kingdom keeps the military-style tradition with many civil and youth bands in all of the UK keeping the military band traditions of the country, either as marching wind bands, Corps of Drums, bugle bands, pipe bands, and in Northern Ireland, fife and drum bands. Examples would be the [[Royal British Legion]] bands and the bands of the various UK youth uniformed organizations. Styled on the UK military tradition, [[Fiji]]'s [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military Forces]] also have a marching band<ref>{{cite news |last=Gibson |first=Dawn |title=Military band at Gulf exhibition |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=225455 |accessdate=13 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Fiji Times|The Fiji Times]] |date=17 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006113549/http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=225455 |archivedate=6 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the military band traditions of the Commonwealth of Nations, by extension, reached almost every country of it with military, school, civil and schools bands styled on the traditions of the British Armed Forces and the armed services of Commonwealth countries which were trained by British military personnel.\n\n===Corps style===\n[[File:West Chester University of Pennsylvania Golden Rams Performance.jpg|left|thumb|[[West Chester University of Pennsylvania|West Chester University Golden Rams Marching Band]]]]\n\n[[Corps style band]]s directly reflect the trends seen in modern drum and bugle corps of [[Drum Corps International]] (DCI). Unlike the military band style, drum corps style step sizes are constantly changing to accommodate the differing forms the band is creating on the field. Forms may be linear, curvilinear, or scatter. Music selections can include anything from symphonic music, film scores, to world music, jazz, rock, or pop music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnlike a military band's use of baton twirlers, Corps Style bands may include a \"color guard\" that spin flags, rifles, sabres\u2014and may also incorporate dance. Other visual elements unique to the corps style is the usage of props, backdrops, and even costuming \u2013 to add more theatrical elements to the show.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:SOS2010.JPG|thumb|The [[Muncie Southside High School]] Spirit of South Marching Band performs at the Preliminary contest at the [[Indiana State Fair Band Day]] Competition in 2010.]]\n\nOther elements unique to the Corps Style bands are the incorporation of the ''front ensemble''. This includes the usage of keyboard percussion such as xylophone, marimba, and bells; or any other color percussion instruments such as timpani, cymbals, conga, tambourine, triangle, drum set, etc. The front ensemble may also use sound amplification or electronic instruments such as synthesizers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe ''corps style'' constantly evolves, with contributions from college bands, high school bands, and drum and bugle corps throughout the United States. Typically, corps style bands gear their performances for marching competitions and marching festivals. Competitions featuring the corps style on the national level include Drum Corps International, Winter Guard International, and Bands Of America. The competitive high school marching band is modeled after the corps style band.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nCorps style is a competitive style, judged in several \"captions\" that include Visual Analysis, Visual Proficiency, Color Guard, Music Analysis, Brass, Percussion, and General Effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dci.org/static/judging|title=Judging 'By the Numbers'|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dci.org|publisher=Drum Corps International|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional style===\n\nTraditional style bands, also known as show bands, are marching bands geared primarily towards crowd entertainment and perform on football fields. Typically, they perform a routine before the game, another at halftime, and sometimes after the game as well. Competitive show bands perform only one show that is continually refined throughout a season, while bands that focus on entertainment rather than competition usually perform a unique show for each game. These shows normally consists of three to five musical pieces accompanied by formations rooted in origin from ''Patterns in Motion'',{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} a book penned by band director [[Bill Moffit|William C. \"Bill\" Moffit]], bandmaster of [[Purdue University]] [[All-American Marching Band]] and [[University of Houston]] [[Spirit of Houston]].\n\nA recognizable style of show band is the one fielded by [[HBCU band|historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs). HBCU bands utilize the traditional \"ankle-knee\" high step and music selections are largely based on R&B, hip-hop, and contemporary popular music. In addition to traditional drill formations, HBCU bands feature heavily choreographed dance routines as part of their performances. Many of these bands may have a twirler line or a dancer line, but not necessarily flag twirlers. One of the most notable depictions of HBCU bands is the 2002 film ''[[Drumline (film)|Drumline]]''. The history of African-American marching bands was explored through a 2018 exhibition called \"Marching On: The Politics of Performance\" in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://storefrontnews.org/programming/marching-on-the-politics-of-performance/|title=Marching On: The Politics of Performance|last=|first=|date=|website=Storefront for Art and Architecture|access-date=}}</ref> HBCU bands are a significant part of African-American musical culture and HBCU bands often surpass their associated football teams in popularity, a phenomenon that is uncommon among collegiate and high school marching bands. In 1989, as part of the celebrations for the bicentennial of the French Revolution, the [[Florida A&M University]] [[Marching 100]], one of the most prolific HBCU bands in the country, was selected as the official representative of the United States in the bicentennial parade.\n\nAnother style of show band is that used by many of the [[Big Ten Conference]] marching bands, a semi-military and semi-corps style. These bands perform a show that is designed to entertain the audience but feature more traditional symphonic styles of music (marches, film scores, jazz, or older pop music) as well as some contemporary music. Big Ten style show bands have been influential in creating some of the earliest marching band innovations, and the style is used in high schools throughout much of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1244213799&disposition=inline|title=A Descriptive Analysis of the Eleven Big Ten Conference Marching Band Programs|last=Fuller|first=John Allen|date=1995|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811184009/https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1244213799&disposition=inline|archivedate=2017-08-11}}</ref>\n\nMost show bands of either type include the traditional military band instrumentation of woodwinds, brass, and battery percussion. Some also include the front ensemble keyboard percussion, and may also incorporate the use of a color guard for flag, and rifle routines as well as a dance line.\n\n===Carnival bands===\n[[File:Derby Midshipmen Band Parade.JPG|thumb|The Derby Midshipmen Band, a carnival band in the United Kingdom]]\nCarnival bands are a United Kingdom variant of show bands. Carnival bands typically march in time to the music, and may also participate in parades and competitions. They contain [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[percussion instruments|percussion]], but may or may not use [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]]s.<ref>[[:File:Derby Midshipmen Band 2005.jpg]]</ref> In The United States, specifically in California, carnival bands (known as Parade bands in the states) perform regularly in parades and parade competitions. These US bands are also modeled on the country's military band tradition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Scramble bands===\n\n[[Scramble band]]s (also referred to as 'Scatter' bands) are a variation on show bands. They generally do not march in time with the music, but, as their name implies, scramble from design to design and often incorporate comedic elements into their performances. Most of the bands in the [[Ivy League]] use this style, excepting only [[Cornell University]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Scramble Bands | url = http://www.princeton.edu/~puband/about/scramble.html | accessdate = 2008-05-08 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080224041742/http://www.princeton.edu/~puband/about/scramble.html | archivedate = 2008-02-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mb.bigredbands.org/history.php |title=Cornell University Big Red Marching Band |publisher=Mb.bigredbands.org |accessdate=2014-05-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516151311/http://mb.bigredbands.org/history.php |archivedate=2014-05-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\nThe size and composition of a marching band can vary greatly. Some bands have fewer than twenty members, and some have over 500. American marching bands vary considerably in their instrumentation. Some bands omit some or all [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]]s, but it is not uncommon to see [[piccolo]]s, [[flute]]s, [[soprano clarinet]]s, [[alto saxophone]]s, and [[tenor saxophone]]s (woodwinds are not used in corps style marching). [[E-flat clarinet|E\u266d clarinets]], [[alto clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]]s, and [[baritone saxophone]]s are less common, but can be found in some bands. [[Bassoon]]s and [[oboe]]s are very seldom found on a field due to the risk of incidental damage, the impracticality of marching with an exposed double reed, and high sensitivity to weather.\n\nThe [[Brass instrument|brass section]] usually includes [[trumpet]]s or [[cornet]]s; [[French horn]]s, [[alto horn]]s, or [[mellophone]]s; [[Types of trombones#Tenor trombone|tenor trombone]]s; [[baritone horn]]s or [[euphonium]]s; and [[tuba]]s or [[sousaphone]]s. E\u266dsoprano [[cornet]]s are sometimes used to supplement or replace the high woodwinds, while the mellophone often is used in place of the French horn. Some especially large bands use [[flugelhorn]]s and bass trombones. Specially designed versions of the lower brass have been created for use while marching. These are typically wrapped in such a way that allows the bell to face toward the audience at all times. Bands may also modify their instrumentation to remove slide trombones completely and replace them with another instrument, such as a valved trombone or marching baritone horn.\n\n[[Marching percussion]] (often referred to as the [[drumline]], battery, or back battery) typically includes [[snare drum]]s, [[tenor drum]]s, [[bass drum]]s, and [[cymbal]]s and are responsible for keeping tempo for the band. All of these instruments have been adapted for mobile, outdoor use. Marching versions of the [[glockenspiel]] (bells), [[xylophone]], and [[marimba]] are also rarely used by some ensembles. Historically, the percussion section also employed mounted [[timpani]] that featured manual controls.\n\nFor bands that include a [[front ensemble]] (also known as the pit or auxiliary percussion), stationary instrumentation may include orchestral percussion such as [[timpani]], [[tambourine]]s, [[maraca]]s, [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]s, [[conga]]s, [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]]s, [[marimba]]s, [[xylophone]]s, [[bongo drum|bongo]]s, [[vibraphone]]s, [[timbales]], [[claves]], [[guiro]]s, and chimes or [[tubular bell]]s, concert bass drums, and [[gong]]s, as well as a multitude of auxiliary percussion equipment, all depending on the instrumentation of the field show. Drum sets, purpose-built drum racks, and other mounted instruments are also placed here. Until the advent of the pit in the early 1980s, many of these instruments were carried on the field by marching percussionists by hand or on mounting brackets. Some bands also include electronic instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s, [[electric guitar]]s, and [[bass guitar]], along with the requisite [[amplifier|amplification]]. If double-reed or string instruments are used, they are usually placed here, but even this usage is very rare due to their relative fragility. Unusual percussive instruments are sometimes used, including [[drum brake|brake drums]], empty propane tanks, trashcans, [[railroad tie]]s, stomping rigs, and other interesting sounds. In modern marching band, there is a use of amplification of the front ensemble to help balance out the wind and drumline sections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.halftimemag.com/features/technology-on-and-off-the-field.html|title=Technology On and Off the Field|website=www.halftimemag.com|access-date=2018-09-13|date=2009-07-25}}</ref> The use of synthesizers and electronics in the front ensemble can not only help the front ensemble, or \"pit\", be heard better by the audience and judges, but it can add soundscapes such as voice-overs to help tell the story of a field show, or to add sound effects (for example, a show about nature could have bird/wind/rain sound samples performed by a front ensemble member playing the synthesizer).\n\n[[File:Umass-electrophones.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band|UMass Band]] has long used electronics in its performances.]]\nA rare inclusion in a marching band that is becoming more popular is the use of [[electrophone]]s in a marching band. The most common electric instrument seen is a [[bass guitar]], but some schools also use [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[lead guitar]]. To make the electric instruments usable, external power in the stadium is often used, but some groups may use a car-battery mechanism that requires a car battery and a converter to give the instruments and amplifiers remote power. Also, some groups may use a small gasoline-powered generator.\n\n===Auxiliaries===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nMany bands have auxiliaries that add a visual component to the performance. For ceremonial bands, this could be a traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]] or honor guard. For [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum & bugle corps]] and corps-style field bands, this could include Dance lines, [[majorettes]], Auxiliary units may be collectively referred to as [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]] or visual ensemble.\n\nAuxiliaries may perform as independent groups. In the early 1970s, color guards began to hold their own competitions in the winter (after the [[American football]] season, and before the beginning of the summer drum and bugle corps season). These became known as [[winter guard]]. There are also numerous dance competitions in the off-season.\n\nThe color guard of a marching band or drum and bugle corps may contain [[saber]]s, mock [[rifle]]s, and tall [[flags]]. In modern bands, other props are often used: [[flags]] of all sizes, horizontal banners, vertical banners, streamers, pom-poms, even tires, balls, and hula hoops or custom-built props. The color guard may also employ stage dressing such as backdrops, portable flats, or other structures. These can be used simply as static scenery or moved to emphasize drill, and are often used to create a \"backstage\" area to store equipment and hide personnel when necessary.\n\nWhile military color guards were typically male, band color guards tend to be primarily female, though it is becoming more common for men to join as well. A few independent units are all-male. Guard members nearly always wear a special uniform or costume that is distinctive from that of the band, not necessarily matching in design or color. The men's and women's guard uniforms are usually designed in one of two ways: nearly identically, but with gender-specific parts (i.e. skirts) adapted for the use of the opposite sex; or complimentarily, with the two uniforms designed similarly but with variations in color or form. The color guard uniform, especially in a high school marching band, need not be in school colors; in fact, they rarely are. These uniforms are designed to represent a certain aspect of the halftime show, characterize the guard members through costumes, or tell some sort of story, and can thus be in any design or color (a surprisingly common complaint among the high school audience is that guard uniforms and equipment \"aren't school colors\").\n\nIndoor color guards have become popular within high schools and universities throughout the United States. These groups perform a theme-based show in competitions after the outdoor marching band season ends. Indoor color guard shows are typically performed in school gymnasiums and are adjudicated.\n\n===Personnel===\nIrishman Patrick S. Gilmore started the concept of a bandleader.<ref>\"Band Leader\", London: Continuum, 2003{{full citation needed|date=January 2020}}</ref> A marching band is typically led by one or more [[Drum major (marching band)|drum majors]], also called field commanders, who are usually responsible for conducting the band (sometimes using a large [[Baton twirling|baton]] or [[Ceremonial mace|mace]], though such tools are used rarely in modern marching bands for conducting) and are commonly referred to as the leader of the band. When there is more than one drum major, one may be the head drum major, who often stands upon an elevated podium located on the 50-yard line while conducting, whereas the other(s) often conduct from convenient angles (should the marching block not be facing forward) and function as an apprentice of sorts. The number of members in the band often determines how many drum majors are needed, based on the complexity of the show (in which case, in a three-person scenario, one stands on the 50-yard line while another stands on the 30-yard line and the third stands on the other 30-yard line), and occasionally, additional individuals may be asked to perform brief conducting duties if beneficial in a particularly tricky part of the show (more often, such people are those on the sidelines or in the pit). The modern-day concept of the drum major has been exponentially expanded upon by George N. Parks, often known as the \"Dynamic Drum Major,\" through his Drum Major Academy. Bands may also be led by a more traditional [[Conducting|conductor]], especially during field shows, where a stationary conductor on a ladder or platform may be visible throughout the performance. Aural commands\u2014such as vocal orders, clapping, or a whistle\u2014may be used to issue commands as well. In show bands, particularly in HBCU and Big Ten bands, drum majors often have a visual on-field role with a baton or mace, with the job of conducting assigned to the band director(s). In these cases, the number of drum majors is often based on tradition, rather than being in proportion with the number of musicians. For example, the Florida A&M [[Marching 100]] fields one drum major for each president in the university's history. Other leaders within the band may include field lieutenants and captains of sections such as brass, drumline, and woodwinds, and members that lead a section, squad, row, etc.\n\nSome bands assign drum majors the dual role of leading and conducting the ensemble on the field. This is most common in traditional military-style groups, such as Texas A&M's Fightin' Texas Aggie Band: the drum majors march with the band, sound whistles to coordinate movement, and use maces to keep time by thrusting them up and down (rather than toward and away from the body, as is typical in American military bands).\n\nThe size of the band may not only determine how many drum majors there are, but how many section instructors are needed as well. Section instructors function like the music director but are mainly responsible for teaching members of a given section. Because they are commonly previous members of the section they teach, they can provide better instruction to combine the needs of the show with the characteristics of the given instrument.\n\nAs bands require leadership from within as well as from without, section leaders are usually selected from among the members of each instrumental section (a \"section\" comprises all the band members who play the same [[musical instrument]]). The section leader is always an experienced band member and is usually selected by the band director (rather than elected or self-appointed) for his or her leadership skills and experience. The section leader is responsible for the minute-to-minute instruction of his or her section members, and reports to the drum majors and the band director. Many larger bands appoint more than one section leader per section, with each having a \"head\" section leader, whether formally or informally designated as such. College-level military bands may use the term \"section sergeant\" or \"section officer\" in place of \"section leader.\"\n\nThe [[music director|director]] provides general guidance, selects the repertoire, interprets commentary and evaluations from judges, and auditions or recruits prospective members. What content is not provided by the director may be contracted from arrangers (who compose original works or adapt existing works) and copyists (who reproduce parts of the score), choreographers, and drill designers (primarily for field bands). With the assistance of section instructors, the director also teaches performance techniques\u2014musical, martial, and visual\u2014and assesses the pool of talent, choosing leaders and soloists as needed. The director also selects venues for public performance and oversees the staff that help provide funding and equipment. Many opportunities for member improvement are present: the director may organize clinics with various professionals, send representatives to specialty schools or camps, or plan trips abroad for education or exhibition.\n\nLarge bands also require many support staff who can move equipment, repair instruments, and uniforms, create and manipulate props used in performances, and provide food, water, and medical assistance. Additional staff may be utilized when the band hosts functions such as competitions and reviews. In high school bands, these activities are usually performed by volunteers, typically parents of band members or the band members of the lower grades. These people are often referred to as ''runners'' or ''boosters''. Significant support staff for college bands and independent corps are typically paid by the university or the corps organization, respectively.\n\n==Performance elements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nThe goal of each band's performance is different. Some aim for maximum uniformity and precision; others\u2014especially [[scramble band]]s\u2014want to be as entertaining as possible. Many U.S. university marching bands aim for maximum sound impact on the audience. Some bands perform primarily for the enjoyment of their members. However, there are some common elements in almost all band performances. The following overview is heavily focused on the U.S. marching band tradition.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:DGN marching band clip.jpg|left|thumb|Marching bands members may hold music on lyres attached to the instrument.]]\n\nThe traditional music of the marching band is the military [[march (music)|march]], but since show bands also evolved from the [[Concert band|concert]] and [[brass band]] traditions, music has always been varied. Often, music from other genres is adapted for the specific instrumentation of a marching band.\n\nCommercial [[arrangement]]s that are tailored for the average band instrumentation are also available. Many bands typically have a repertoire of traditional music associated with the organization they serve. Some competitive bands use an arrangement of popular music varied for marching band, as well as music from a movie or other such theme. However, the largest and most successful marching bands tend to steer clear of show tunes and popular music, instead preferring compilations or arrangements of classical or traditional concert pieces (i.e. [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' or [[Puccini]]'s ''[[Nessun Dorma]]'') or of entirely new compositions.\n\nMusic may be memorized, or it may be carried on flip folders, which are held by lyres that clip onto the instruments. Having music memorized is usually considered an advantage for competitive bands, and at competitions, there is usually a penalty for the use of the sheet music on the field written into the scoring rubric. Practically, memorization prevents obstruction of vision caused by the folders. The memorization of music is usually a matter of pride for the marching band, however, bands that regularly pull from expansive libraries and perform dozens of new works each season are more likely to utilize flip folders.\n\n=== Marching technique ===\n\n====Glide step====\n\nThe [[glide step]], also commonly known as the ''roll step,'' involves bringing the heel gently to the ground with the toe pointed up, and then rolling forward onto the toes before lifting the foot to continue forward. While marching to the rear, the weight is placed continually on the ball of the foot with the heel elevated. This style is used by both marching bands as well as drum and bugle corps. The style, in comparison to high step, gives drill formations a more fluid appearance, allowing for better control of more difficult formations and various styles of music. With this control also comes the ability to perform a much broader range of tempos. Proper execution of a roll step gives a player marching at 40 beats per minute the same smooth tone as a player marching at 180. The roll step allows for much better control of the upper body, and thus better control of the air support needed for playing.\n\nSome bands, and a select few drum and bugle corps, use a bent-knee variant of roll step, usually known simply as ''bent knee,'' in which the members roll from heel to toe but lead the next step with the knee instead of the foot, then planting the heel of the next foot by straightening the leg.\n\n====High step====\n\nThe high step is a style of marching used by many colleges and universities, including most bands of HBCUs and the Big Ten. Three primary sub-variants of the high are used:\n\n* The ''[[Ankle knee step|ankle-knee]]'' step involves bringing the foot up to the inside of the leg to the knee before coming down and forward. This is the style used by most bands from HBCUs.\n* The ''[[chair step]]'' involves lifting the knee until the thighs are parallel to the ground, and with toes pointed downward. When the leg is elevated to its maximum height, a ninety-degree angle exists between the torso and the thigh, as well as between the thigh and shin. The leg is then lowered, and this is repeated in an alternating fashion between the legs. This style is used by many schools in the Big Ten.\n* The ''extended high step'', much like the chair step, involves the thigh being parallel to the ground and perpendicular to the body, but instead with the shin extended outward at a forty-five-degree angle from the body and with toes pointed downward. The leg is then driven quickly back to the ground while the other leg repeats in this fashion.\n\nAn integral part of this style of marching is known as ''stop action,'' meaning that all movement ceases momentarily at the apex of each step. This requires a band to have a great deal of stamina, though is effective visually. High step marching is often accompanied by a horizontal swing of the player's body or instrument.\n\n====Lateral marching====\n\nWhen band members are marching in one direction but want to focus their sound in another, they may rotate their bodies at the waist, so that only the upper portion of the body faces in the direction of play. This is known as ''lateral marching'', but is more commonly known as either ''shifting'', ''traversing'', or ''sliding''. A lateral march is not a change in the direction of march, only in the direction the upper body faces. Percussion players, whose large drum harnesses often prevent them from twisting their torsos, and sometimes tuba and sousaphone players, instead uses a ''crab step'' when moving sideways. During a crab step, the musician crosses one leg over the other, either marching on the toes or rolling the foot sideways. Percussionists may also substitute roll step when their instruments would interfere with performing the high step.\n\n====Changing direction====\n\nA true direction change involving the feet moving in a new direction requires either a ''prep step'' or a ''pivot'', both of which are sometimes referred to as a ''flank'' or \u201cstab\u201d. To perform a prep step, on the last count of movement in the first direction a marcher plants the foot with the heel turned outward at half the angle of the turn desired, with the upper body still facing forward. On the next count, the other foot snaps into position completing the turn. The upper body may or may not turn with the lower body. Some bands plant the heel on the prep step rather than the toe but preserving the angle of the foot. To perform a pivot, the marcher pivots between directions over the ball of the foot on the last count instead of using a prep step.\n\n====Backward marching====\n\nA ''back march'' may be used when the band wishes to move in the opposite direction from where it is projecting its sound. There are several ways to back march, one of which is to walk backward, putting each foot down and rolling from the toe to the heel (the exact reverse of the roll step). Another variation involves marching on the platforms of the feet, dragging the toe of the moving foot on the ground. Backward marching usually employs the same preference for leg straightness as forward marching (if the band marches with legs completely straight while marching forwards, they also do so while marching backward, to preserve uniformity of style). Using peripheral vision to align oneself to formations or field markings is even more important during backward marching.\n\n====Marking time====\n\nWhen a band is not moving, the members may ''mark time'', or march in place. The step used usually resembles the step that is used for marching forward, though mixing a high step mark time with a roll step march (or vice versa) produces an interesting visual effect. For a typical mark time, the foot is raised to the ankle bone of the opposite leg. The toe should not come off the ground and the knee should not come out much past the still-straight leg.\n\nSome bands mark time by bringing their feet up to their knee\u2014known as ''high-mark time''. Some bands practice marking time during concert arch with the toes coming off of the ground to give the marcher a greater sense of marching while standing still. The heel should hit the ground on the beat. Some bands forgo marking time and instead come to a complete halt when not marching. Traditionally, the drumline would put their feet in a V-shape and lift their feet fully off the ground a few inches. This is to avoid hitting the drums.\n\n====Staying in step====\nEven when marking time, it is considered good form for all band members to stay ''in step''\u2014that is, step with the same foot at the same time. A large majority of bands ''step off'' with, or start marching on, the left foot. Staying in step is generally easier when the band is playing music or when the drums are playing a marching cadence.\n\nWhen the band and percussion are not playing, rhythm may be maintained in a variety of ways: a drummer may play taps or rim shots, the drum major may clap or use a woodblock, a drum major or band member may vocalize a sharp syllable like \"hit,\" \"hut,\" or \"dut,\" or band members may chant the military call of \"left, left, left right left.\" Band members may count the steps of the move out loud to keep the entire band together. Typically, most moves consist of any number of steps that are a multiples of two or four, due to most marching band music being in even-numbered [[time signature]]s. Even-numbered time signatures aid in staying in step because they assign odd-numbered counts to the left foot, and even-numbered counts to the right foot. If a band member is on the wrong foot, for instance, odd on the right foot and even on the left, this is referred to as being ''out of step''. When a band member is completely off tempo, it is referred to as being ''out of phase''.\n\n===Parade marching===\n[[File:The Pride of the Sunshine.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[University of Florida]]'s marching band, [[The Pride of the Sunshine]], performing in a parade]]\nIn [[parade]]s, bands usually line up in a marching block composed of [[Rank (formation)|ranks]] and [[File (formation)|files]]. Each member tries to stay within his or her given rank and file, and to maintain even spacing with neighboring musicians.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hindsley|first=Mark H.|date=1930|title=The Marching Band|journal=Music Supervisors' Journal|volume=17|issue=2|pages=15\u201317|doi=10.2307/3383449|issn=1559-2472|jstor=3383449}}</ref> It is traditionally the responsibility of the people at the end of each rank and the front of each file to be in the correct location; this allows other band members to use them as a reference, also known as ''guiding''.\n\nBand members also try to keep a constant pace or step size while marching in parade. Step sizes usually vary between 22 and 30 [[inch]]es (56\u201376 [[Centimetre|cm]]) per stride. A step size of 22.5&nbsp;inches is called an ''8-to-5'' step because the marcher covers five [[yard]]s (about 4.6 [[metre|m]]) in eight steps. A step size of 30&nbsp; inches is called ''6-to-5'' because five yards are covered in six steps. Because yard lines on an American football field are five yards apart, exact 8-to-5 and 6-to-5 steps are most useful for field shows.\n\nA [[drum cadence]], sometimes called a ''walk beat'' or ''street beat,'' is usually played when the band is marching, oftentimes alternating with a song, and is typically how a band keeps time while not playing music. Alternatively, a drum or rim shot may be given on the odd beats to keep the band in step. Between songs and cadences, a roll is usually given to indicate what beat in the measure the band is at. Cadence [[tempo]] varies from group to group but is generally between 112 and 144 [[beats per minute]] to facilitate marching.\n\n===Street performances===\n\nIn [[Minnesota]], [[Upstate New York]], and [[Wisconsin]], bands may perform on city streets with compact formation elements, sometimes referred to as a street show. These shows are judged using similar criteria as any other marching band competition. Elements of difficulty increase with street marching competitions because of the varying widths of streets in each community. Street marching is typical for bands who operate during the spring and early summer months. Typically, a band that performs in street marching competitions does not become involved with field marching, and vice versa. Various venues exist for street marching competitions between high school marching bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osseobandfestival.org|title=The Osseo Marching Band Festival in Osseo, Minnesota |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111191643/http://osseobandfestival.org/ |archive-date=2016-01-11 |author=|date=|website=osseobandfestival.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.vikinglandbandfestival.com Vikingland Band Festival] in Alexandria, Minnesota.</ref><ref>Other similar street marching events can be found at [http://www.marching.com Marching.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110073849/http://www.marching.com/ |date=2013-01-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Field marching===\n[[File:KSU MB block.jpg|thumb|[[Kansas State University Marching Band]] marching on the football field at [[Bill Snyder Family Stadium]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas]]]]\n\nWhile playing music during a field show, the band makes a series of formations, called drill, on the field, which may be pictures, geometric shapes, curvilinear designs, or blocks of musicians, although sometimes it may be pure abstract designs using no specific form.\n\nTypically, each band member has an assigned position in each formation. In many show bands and most drum corps, these positions are illustrated in a handheld booklet called a [[drill book]] (also known as a dot book). Drill books, or drill charts, show where each person stands during each set of the show. The drill charts include yard lines and hashes as they would be on an actual football field, which shows the band members where to stand relative to the yard lines and hashes. There are many ways of getting from one formation to the next:\n* Each member moves independently\u2014called ''scattering'' or ''scatter drill.''\n* All members move together without deforming the formation\u2014called ''floating.''\n* Members stay in their lines and arcs, but slowly deform the formation\u2014sometimes called ''rotating,'' ''expanding,'' or ''condensing.''\n* Members break into ranks or squads, each of which performs a maneuver (such as a ''[[follow-the-leader]]'') which may or may not be scripted. An unscripted move is sometimes called a ''rank option.''\n* Each member performs a specifically scripted move. In these cases, the desired visual effect is often the move itself and not the ending formation.\n* Members at an extended halt perform a stationary visual move, such as a ripple (like \"the wave\") or some sort of [[choreography]], that may propagate throughout the formation of band members\n\nPlayers may point the bells of their instruments in the direction they are moving, or ''slide'' (also called traverse) with all the bells facing in the same direction. They may also point it towards the center of the field. Bands that march in time with the music typically also synchronize the direction of individuals' turns and try to maintain even spacing between individuals in formations (called intervals). Sometimes bands specifically have wind players turn their instruments away from the audience to emphasize the dynamics of the music.\n\nAuxiliaries can also add to the visual effect. Backdrops and props (''scrims'') may be used on the field that fit the theme of the show or the music being performed. In comedic shows, particularly for university bands, an announcer may read jokes or a funny script between songs; formations that are words or pictures (or the songs themselves) may serve as punch lines.\n\n===Fundamental commands and drill down===\n\nIn some marching bands, the drum majors have the option to give out a set of commands to the rest of the band either vocally, by hand command, or by a whistle. These commands originated from the military history of marching band. Different bands might have different sets of procedures such as the number of counts it takes to carry out the command, but the overall result is the same.\n* To the ready/Standing by/Rest/Relax: the command tells the band to stand with heads slightly bowed, feet shoulder-width apart. The band often automatically does this when they first march onto a field at the beginning of their show.\n* Band atten-hut/Band ten-hut/Set: the command that tells the band to go into the position of attention, a military posture. The band usually responds with a loud verbal response, such as \"One!\", \"Hut!\" or \"Hit!\"\n* Mark time march: the command tells the band to march in place in rhythm to snare taps, normally before they march off.\n* Forward march, sometimes Forward [[Harch]]: This command tells the band to begin marching, in time, and in step. They step off on the left foot and end on the right.\n* Detail halt/Band halt: this command tells the band to stop marching. Normally they'll mark time for two beats, saying \"ONE, TWO\" or \"DUT, DUT\" on these beats, to ensure they end on the right foot.\n* At ease: this tells the band that they may completely relax.\n* Parade Rest: the command that tells the band to put their feet shoulder wide and join both hands in the front of their body or to put both feet together or in a V-formation and roll their elbows out and put both hands in fists resting on the hip (the upper-body portion is usually only utilized when marching without instruments, sometimes the second option's lower body form and the first option's upper-body form is used).\n* Left face: the command to turn the band 90 degrees to the left while at the position of attention.\n* Right face: the command to turn the band 90 degrees to the right while at the position of attention.\n* About face: the command to turn the band 180 degrees to the rear while at the position of attention.\n* Horns up: the command for wind players to bring their instruments to playing position (mouthpiece on or near the mouth).\n* Horns thrust: this command for wind players instructs the band to bring their horns to a ''thrust'' position where their instruments are perpendicular to the ground and their mouthpieces are level with their eyes.\n* Horns carry: this command for wind players instructs the band to put their instrument under their right arm.\n* Dismissed/Fall out: this command generally releases the band either for the day or for another portion of the rehearsal.\n* To the left flank: this command turns the band 90 degrees sinistrally while marking time. It is not to be executed until the director/drum major shouts the command \"hut\" or \"march.\"\n* To the right flank: this command turns the band 90 degrees dextrally while marking time. It is not to be executed until the director/drum major shouts the syllable \"hut\" or \"march.\"\n* To the rear: this command turns the band 180 degrees while marking time. It is not to be executed until the director/drum major shouts the syllable \"hut\" or \"march.\"\n* Dress center/right/left dress: this command has the band bring their hands together at eye-level and to turn their heads toward the center, right, or left of the block (if one is in the center, one simply puts one's head down). While dressing, the band can adjust the block to have better spacing. No commands other than \"Ready front\" (sometimes \"Eyes front\") can be executed while Dressing is in action.\n*Ready front/Eyes front: this command makes a band exit dress center for attention.\n* Cover down: this command tells the band to line up their files and make sure they are straight.\nAside from field show and parade, competitions among [[secondary school]]s can also have the ''march off'' (also ''concentration block'' or ''drill down''). This event involves all participants on the field following the commands of the director or a drum major. If a participant makes a mistake, either by execution or wrong timing, then the participant falls out of the field. A winner is crowned when there is only one participant left on the field.\n\n===Delay===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Phasing (disambiguation)]] -->\n\nEach musician in a marching band creates [[Sound wave#Longitudinal and transverse waves|sound waves]]. The waves from each musician, traveling at the speed of sound, reach the other musicians, field conductors, and listeners at slightly different times. If the distance between musicians is large enough, listeners may perceive waves to be [[Wiktionary:out of phase|out of phase]]. Typically, in this case, listeners perceive that one section of the band is playing their parts slightly after another section. This ''delay'' effect is informally referred to as ''ensemble tear'' or ''phasing'' (not to be confused with the [[Phasing|music composition technique of the same name]]).\n\nConsider also that viewers perceive the movement of marchers as light waves. Since light travels faster than sound, viewers may perceive that movement is out of phase with the sound. Sound waves may also reflect off parts of the stadium or nearby buildings.\n\nFor example, if two musicians, one standing on the front sideline of the football field and one on the back sideline, begin playing exactly when they see the beat of the conductor's baton or hand, the sound produced by the musician on the front sideline reaches listeners in the stands noticeably before the sound played by the back musician, and the musicians are seen to move before the sound reaches the stands.\n\nEnsemble tears can occur when musicians on the field listen to the pit. Because of the way sound waves travel, the sound pit produces first bounces off the back bleachers and then is heard by the ensemble. By the time the ensemble hears them, they are already late in timing. Because of this reason, the norm is to ignore the pit and let them listen to the ensemble for timing.\n\nDelay can be reduced in several ways, including:\n* using compact formations;\n* instructing players to watch field conductors, to get a uniform idea of tempo;\n* instructing musicians to make constant adjustments and watch or listen to sources of tempo to make their sound reach the audience at the same time as other musicians;\n* instructing players located near the back of the field watch the drum major, and all other players to ''listen back'', playing along with those watching the drum major;\n* instructing players to keep track of time and rhythm on their own (''internalize the tempo'');\n* instructing the percussion to call out counts, or do rimshots (sometimes called ''cheaters'') when they are not playing;\n* instructing players to ignore the delay and realize that listeners hear the sound waves in phase. This most often occurs when the band is spread out, but in groups (e.g., the four corners of the football field in 4 groups). In this case, the sound reaches the center of the stadium and the center of the stands at the same moment provided the band members are ''not'' correcting for each other.\n\n===Uniforms===\n[[File:Big Ten Conference Marching Band Uniforms West-East.png|right|thumb|700px|Diagrammed example of marching band uniforms of the [[Big Ten]] conference in the United States.]]\nNearly all marching band personnel wear some kind of [[uniform]]. Military-style uniforms are most common, but there are bands that use everything from matching T-shirts and shorts to formal wear. The school or organization's name, symbol, or colors are commonly applied to uniforms. Uniforms may also have substantially different colors on the front and back, so if band members turn suddenly (''flank''), the audience sees a striking change of color. Band members at many [[Ivy League]] schools wear a jacket and tie while performing. The [[Southern Methodist University]] band wear a different combination of jackets, vests, ties, shirts, and pants for each half (changing before halftime) of each game and no clothing or uniform combinations are repeated during the marching season. The [[Alma College]] Kiltie Marching Band is famous for wearing [[kilt]]s made of the official Alma College [[tartan]].\n\nThe components of a band uniform are numerous. Common design elements include hats (typically [[shako]]s, [[pith helmet]]s, [[Combination cap|combination hats]] or other styles of helmets) with feather plumes, capes, gloves, rank cords, and other embellishments. The [[University of Southern California|USC]] [[Spirit of Troy]] Marching Band and [[Troy University]]'s Sound of the South Marching Band wear traditional Trojan helmets. It is also common for band uniforms to have a stripe down the leg and light-colored shoes, or [[Spats (footwear)|spats]] over dark shoes to emphasize the movement of the legs while marching. Similarly, uniforms may feature additional components which highlight movement of the upper body, such as the \"wings\" worn by the [[University of Minnesota Marching Band|University of Minnesota]]'s marching band to highlight flanking movements on the field.<ref>{{Citation|last=The University of Minnesota Marching Band|title=New Uniform Video for the University of Minnesota Marching Band|date=2015-05-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn0hBLx-33k|accessdate=2017-08-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508090133/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn0hBLx-33k|archivedate=2018-05-08}}</ref> Competitive bands, however, many times opt for matching uniforms, especially pants and shoes (usually white or black) to hide the visual effect of members who are out of step as seen from a distance. Occasionally, a band forgoes traditional uniforms in favor of costumes that fit the theme of its field show. The costumes may or may not be uniform throughout the band. This kind of specialized uniform change is usually confined to competitive marching bands.\n\n[[Drum major (marching band)|Drum Major]]s, the field commanders and band directors, usually do not wear the regular band uniform, to better distinguish them from the rest of the band. Some wear more formal outfits or costumes that match the theme of the music, or most commonly a differently-designed version of the regular band uniform, often employing different colors (especially white) or features such as capes. Some (especially at the college level) still employ the tall wool-lined shako or much larger [[bearskin]] (both often derisively referred to as a \"Q-Tip hat\"). Sousaphone players may use a military-style beret or entirely forgo the use of a head covering, as most hats may be in the way of the bell. Some auxiliary groups use uniforms that resemble gymnastics outfits: Often, these uniforms are themed, drawing inspiration from the music. Many auxiliary groups change the outfits they use from season to season based on the needs of the band, although some that do also have a \"base\" uniform for occasions such as parades or other ceremonies.\n\n==Rehearsals==\n\nMusic for parade and show bands is typically learned separately, in a [[concert band]] setting. It may even be memorized before any of the marching steps are learned. When rehearsing drill, positions and maneuvers are usually learned without playing the music simultaneously\u2014a common technique for learning drill is to have members sing their parts or march to a recording produced during a music rehearsal. Many bands learn drill one ''picture'' or form at a time, and later combine these and add music.\n\nRehearsals may also include physical warm-up (calisthenics, running, etc.), ''music warm-up'' (generally consisting of breathing exercises, [[scale (music)|scales]], technical exercises, [[chorales]], and [[musical tuning|tuning]]), ''basics'' (simple marching in a block to practice proper technique), and ''sectionals'' (in which either staff or band members designated ''section leaders'' rehearse individual sections).\n\nWhen learning positions for drill, an [[American football]] field may be divided into a 5-yard grid, with the yard lines serving as one set of guides. The locations where the perpendicular grid lines cross the yard lines sometimes called ''zero points'' or gacks, may be marked on a practice field at eight-, four-, or two-step intervals. Alternately, band members may only use field markings\u2014yard lines, the centerline, hash marks, and yard numbers\u2014as guides (but note that different leagues put these markings in different places).\n\nFor members to learn their positions more quickly, they may be given ''drill charts'', which map their locations relative to the grid or field markings for each formation. In other groups, spray chalk or colored markers are used to mark the location of each person after each set of drill, with a different color and, sometimes, shape for each move.\n\nSome bands use small notebooks, also known as a [[dot book]] or [[drill book]], which they hang about their necks, on the drum harness, or around the waist. These contain pages of ''drill charts'', which often either give a picture or list coordinates that band members use to find 'pages' or 'sets' on the field. Coordinates are normally listed in 8-to-5 steps off the front sideline and front and back hashes, along with the number of 8\u20135 steps off of the yard line listed on each page. Some bands are even using small plastic pouches that hang about their neck on an adjustable strap, which has a zipper pocket for holding drill, flags to mark sets, and a pencil. There is also a clear plastic window in front to display the current part of drill being worked on at that point in time.\n\nMembers may also group into squads, ranks, sections, or (especially with [[scramble band]]s that primarily form words) letters. Instead of each member having an individual move, moves are then learned on a squad-by-squad (rank-by-rank) basis.\n\n===Band camp===\n\nMost bands meet in the summer, normally in August for summer training, or prior to the specific marching season (known as [[band camp]]). This involves learning basic marching fundamentals such as the type of marching step the band uses, commands from the drum major, and how to move on field. The band is also given music to learn for their show. Drill for the show may or may not be provided to learn during band camp. The camp takes place outdoors on the field for marching, and in a band hall for music-only rehearsals. Sectionals, or rehearsals including all of one instrument (e.g. flute sectional), take place during this time. Directors may use time during band camp to place band members in their sections based on playing or marching level and ability. This time can also be used for the potential drums majors to showcase their abilities and for the band director to choose who is head drum major. For bands that require auditions for the band, drumline, or auxiliary, auditions may happen the first few days for placement. Band camp usually lasts 1\u20132 weeks, but in the case of a more advanced marching band, camp may last up to a month. In most university bands, band camp means an earlier move-in date for university students in the band.\n\n==American football games==\n\nMarching bands serve as entertainment during [[American football]] games, which may also be known as pep band. For college and high school marching bands, this is the primary purpose of the ensemble. The home team's band plays the national anthem before kickoff (often as part of a pre-game show), as well as other music while in the stands during the game. Bands cheer with the cheerleaders, and some bands create their cheers. Marching bands then perform a show during halftime. When both teams' bands are present, it is a common protocol for the visiting band to perform first. After halftime, some high school bands use the third quarter of the game to take a break and get food. College bands and some high school bands do not have such breaks but continue playing in the stands during the entirety of the game. The band often stays the entire game, playing the school's fight song and alma mater at the end of the game regardless of the outcome.\n\nThree [[National Football League]] teams designate an official marching band: the [[Washington Redskins]], [[Buffalo Bills]] and [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Marching bands were once common fare during [[Super Bowl halftime show]]s during its earlier years but were later replaced by short [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] concerts from high-profile recording artists, some of which have incorporated marching bands into their performances. Marching bands are otherwise uncommon at the professional level.\n\n==Competition==\n\nIn competition, marching bands are usually judged on criteria such as musicality, uniformity, visual impact, artistic interpretation, and the difficulty of the music and drill. Competition exists at all levels but is most common in the U.S. among secondary school bands and drum and bugle corps. Performances designed for a competition setting usually include more esoteric music (including but not limited to adaptations of modern orchestral pieces). Many traditional-style bands compete in contests known as a Battle of the Bands, similar to the Atlanta Classic from the movie [[Drumline]]. There are also competitions at the national level, such as the [[Bands of America|Bands of America (BOA)]] Grand National Championships through [http://www.musicforall.org/ Music for All].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.musicforall.org/who-we-are/bands-of-america|title=Bands of America|last=Media|first=|date=|work=Music for All, Inc.|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>\n\nAlthough its legitimacy is often called into question, competitive marching band is sometimes considered a sport, due in large part to the physical exertion required in combination with teamwork. Many HBCU marching band fans refer to marching band as ''marching sport.'' [[Sports Illustrated]] considered the activity a sport in 1987, describing the Drum Corps International World Championships \u201cone of the biggest sporting events of the summer.\u201d<ref>{{Citation| title = Scorecard| newspaper = Sports Illustrated| date = 10 August 1987| url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066257/4/index.htm| accessdate = 19 July 2012| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131216032152/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066257/4/index.htm| archivedate = 16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name='Halftime Mag \"Musicians as Athletes\"'>{{cite web|last=Greenwald-Gonella|first=Haley|title=Musicians as Athletes|url=http://halftimemag.com/articles/09-2010/09-2010-features/musicians-as-athletes.html|work=Halftime Magazine|accessdate=19 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616043558/http://halftimemag.com/articles/09-2010/09-2010-features/musicians-as-athletes.html|archivedate=16 June 2012|date=2010-10-03}}</ref> In the same article, Sports Illustrated quoted basketball coach [[Bobby Knight]], \"If a basketball team trained as hard as these kids do, it would be unbelievable.

The findings were that the performer's metabolic rates matched those of marathon runners halfway through a marathon, while the heart rate was more along the lines of someone who was running a \"400 or 800-meter dash.\"<ref>{{cite video| people = Dr. Jeff Edwards | title = DCI Musical Athletes | medium = Television production | publisher = [[ESPN]] | location = Naperville, IL | date = 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Spring competitions===\n\nSpring and early summer parade marching (or street marching) are popular in the northern midwest and Upstate New York, where temperatures are moderate enough for students to march distances in standard uniforms. Performance styles range from traditional block marching to elaborate productions with evolving drill patterns.<ref>The [http://www.vikinglandbandfestival.com Vikingland Band Festival] parade marching championship in Alexandria, Minnesota, is held annually on the last Sunday of June. The event was founded in 1985 and has drawn parade bands from seven states, two Canadian provinces, and Norway.

Much like drum corps, these bands rehearse and tour full-time for about a month from mid-June to mid-August. Such circuits include the Mid-America Competing Band Directors Association, or MACBDA,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macbda.org |title=Mid-America Competing Band Directors Association |publisher=Macbda.org |accessdate=2014-05-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517143708/http://macbda.org/ |archivedate=2014-05-17 }}</ref> and the [[CYO|Catholic Youth Organization]] circuits.\n\n[[MACBDA]] is currently host to more than 20 actively competing, '''summer-only''' field show bands from the US (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan) and Canada (Saskatchewan and Alberta). The circuit sponsors fourteen field show competitions each summer and the circuit championships move on a three-year-rotation from Calgary, AB, Canada, to Traverse City, MI, to the Southern Wisconsin / Northern Illinois area.\n\nThe [[Honda Battle of the Bands]] is an annual marching band exhibition that features performances by HBCU bands. Seemingly contradictory to the name, Honda's \"battle\" is not a competition in the traditional sense. That is, no winner is crowned during the event. Rather, the bands compete for the favor of the audience, each other, and the greater community.\n\nWAMSB (World Association of Marching Show Bands) is an international organization holding many competitions throughout the world. Its World Championships are held annually in the summer in a different country. Past host nations include Canada, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, & Australia. WAMSB sanctioned events happen in 32 nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wamsb.org/about.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101214041/http://www.wamsb.org/about.htm |archivedate=2014-11-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe Central Indiana Track Show Association hosts contests in Indiana during the summer.

In the [[United States]], there are two national competition circuits in which bands can compete: [[Bands of America]] and the [[United States Scholastic Band Association]] (USSBA).\n\nThe USSBA was formed in 1988 through the help of the Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps. Over 700 high school bands compete during the Fall season with bands of similar size and talent. Each competition provides approximately 40 professional judges who give feedback on the show's programming and design. At the season's end, the top 50 bands are invited to compete in the US Scholastic Band Championship, which is hosted at a college or professional stadium.<ref>[http://www.yea.org/site/PageServer?pagename=USSBA Youth Education in the Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822025119/http://www.yea.org/site/PageServer?pagename=USSBA |date=2006-08-22 }}</ref>\n\nBands of America is the other major circuit that conducts several competitions throughout the fall season. Competitions include Regional Championships, held in collegiate stadiums in locations such as Pennsylvania, California, Ohio, Texas, and North Carolina, and Super Regional Championships held in NFL stadiums in cities such as Atlanta, Indianapolis, and St. Louis. The season accumulates with the holding of Grand National Championships, considered the top event for high school marching. Grand Nationals takes place in [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in Indianapolis, Indiana in early to mid-November. The three-day event concludes with the top 12 highest scoring high school bands, out of the more than 90 who participate, performing in Grand National Finals on Saturday night. Due to the stiff competition, with bands traveling to the event from throughout the country, many people consider the champion the best high school marching band in the country. There are no qualifications for any Bands of America events, including Grand Nationals. Admittance is based on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nMany states have their own competition circuits, as well as their own rules for competitions in their circuits. Several colleges host annual independent competitions, with varying degrees of prestige\u2014such as the Contest of Champions at [[Middle Tennessee State University]], which is the longest-running high school band contest in the United States.\n\nTo make competitions fair, bands normally split into different ''classes'' or ''divisions'' based on certain factors. One popular classification system uses the size of the school to split up the competing bands. This is the method used by [[Bands of America]], the [[Indiana State School Music Association]], [[Kentucky Music Educators Association]] and the [[University Interscholastic League]]. Alternatively, the number of band members determines the class\u2014with the largest bands being Division I, and smaller bands being classified as Division II, III, and IV.\n\n===Sudler Trophy and Sudler Shield===\n[[File:Sudler Trophy.JPG|thumb|The [[University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band]]'s Sudler Trophy]]\n{{Main|Sudler Trophy}}\n\nThe Sudler Trophy and Sudler Shields are awards bestowed each year by the [[John Philip Sousa Foundation]] on one university marching band and one high school marching band.

In the case of the aformentioned bands, their lineage is shared with the bands of [[The Ontario Regiment]], the 6th Northumberland Militia and the 2nd Armoured Divisional Signals Regiment respectively. In the early to mid 20th century, the [[Canadian Forces]] maintained drum and bugle corps, which were similar in instrumentation and organization to civilian marching bands.<ref>http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520Drum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS</ref>\n\n===Taiwan===\nIn [[Taiwan]], the National Marching Band Association is the main organizer of local marching bands in the country.

Although the Ministry of Education organizes most school marching bands, other organizations have made consistent efforts to organize local marching bands.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294088667_Developing_Malaysian_High_School_Marching_Bands_Issues_Challenges_and_Strategies Developing Malaysian High School Marching Bands Issues, Challenges, and Strategies]</ref>\n\n===Russia===\nIn [[Russia]], there are not many school or local marching bands in existence, with most being government-sponsored military and police bands, as well as several bands operated by the local governments.

These types of bands only came into existence after 1991 when the [[Soviet Union]] ceased to exist. During the Soviet era, civilian like marching bands were extremely rare, with one of the only non-military bands having been employed in the late 1930s and early 1940s during National Sports Day parades in the capital of [[Moscow]].<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=AmwiAQAAIAAJ&q=marching+band+of+russia&dq=marching+band+of+russia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0q-y7r6DnAhWCBs0KHYBrBeoQ6AEIRzAE</ref> Other Russian marching bands include the Drummers Group of the Boarding School for Girls of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the Moscow & District Pipe Band.

Instrumentation typically includes [[brass instrument|brass]], [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]], and [[percussion instruments|percussion]] instruments. Most marching bands wear a uniform, often of a military-style, that includes an associated organization's colors, name or symbol. Most [[High school (North America)|high school]] marching bands, and some [[college]] marching bands, are accompanied by a [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]], a group of performers who add a visual interpretation to the music through the use of props, most often flags, rifles, and sabres.\n\nMarching bands are generally categorized by function, size, age, instrumentation, marching style, and type of show they perform. In addition to traditional [[parade]] performances, many marching [[Musical ensemble|band]]s also perform field shows at sporting events and marching band [[competition]]s. Increasingly, marching bands perform indoor concerts that implement many songs, traditions, and flair from outside performances.

Barnes, page 231 \"A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army\", Sphere Books 1972</ref> who accompanied the unit on active service to provide morale enhancing music on the battlefield or, from the late nineteenth century on, to act as stretcher bearers. Instruments during the 18th century included fifes, drums, the oboe ([[hautbois]]), French horn, clarinet and bassoon. Drummers summoned men from their farms and ranches to muster for duty. In the chaotic environment of the battlefield, musical instruments were the only means of commanding the men to advance, stand or retire. In the mid 19th century each smaller unit had their own fifer and drummer, who sounded the daily routine. When units massed for battle a band of musicians was formed for the whole.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ammu/hd_ammu.htm |title=Military Music in American and European Traditions &#124; Thematic Essay &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-05-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626131610/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ammu/hd_ammu.htm |archivedate=2014-06-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], modern marching bands are most commonly associated with performing during [[American football]] games.

The first university fight song, ''[[For Boston]],'' was created at [[Boston College]]. Many more recognizable and popular university fight songs are borrowed and played by high schools across the United States. Four such fight songs commonly used by high schools are the [[University of Michigan]]'s ''[[The Victors]]'', the [[University of Illinois]]' ''[[Illinois Loyalty]]'', the [[University of Notre Dame]]'s ''[[Notre Dame Victory March|Victory March]]'', and the [[United States Naval Academy]]'s ''[[Anchors Aweigh]]''.

With high school programs on the rise, marching bands started to become competitive organizations, with the first national contest being held in 1923 in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. [[U.S. state|State]] and national contests became common, often featuring parades and mass-band concerts featuring all participating groups. By 1938, competitive band programs had become numerous and widespread, making a national contest too large to manage and leading to multiple state and regional contests in its place.

These bands are said to be ''corps-style'' bands. Areas where changes have been adopted from drum corps include:\n* Marching: instead of a traditional high step, drum corps tend to march with a fluid glide step, also known as a roll step, to keep musicians' torsos completely still.\n* Auxiliaries: adaptation of the [[Color guard (flag twirling)|flag]], [[rifle]], [[Baton twirling|baton]] and [[sabre]] units into ''auxiliaries'', who march with the band and provide visual flair by spinning and tossing flags or mock weapons and using dance in the performance.\n* Percussion: moving marching timpani and keyboard percussion into a stationary sideline percussion section, or \"[[front ensemble|pit]]\", which has since incorporated many different types of percussion instruments such as: tambourines, crash cymbals, suspended cymbals, bass drum and gong sets, chimes, EWI's (electronic woodwind instrument), and most keyboards.\n* Competitions: marching band competitions are judged using criteria similar to criteria used in drum corps competitions, with emphasis on individual aspects of the band (captions for music performance, visual performance, percussion, guard (auxiliary), and general effect are standard).\n\n==Styles==\nMarching bands are categorized by style based on primary function, instrumentation, and technique, although many organizations may fill multiple roles.\n\n===Military style===\n[[File:Aggie Band.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band|Texas A&M]]'s \"aTm\" formation during halftime]]\n\n[[Military band]]s or [[corps of drums]] were historically the first marching bands. Instrumentation in these bands varies but generally consists of brass, woodwinds, and percussion. Due to their original purpose, military marching bands typically march in a forward direction with consistent straight lines. Music is performed at a constant tempo (120\u2013140 [[BPM (music)|BPM]]) to facilitate the steady marching of the entire military group the band is playing with. The marching step size, or interval, is consistent, and usually at a ''6 to 5'' (six steps per five yards) or ''8 to 5'' (eight steps to five yards). This style includes field music units such as [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]] or bugle bands, [[pipe band]]s, and [[fife and drum corps]].\n\nActive duty military marching bands often perform in parades with other military units and march in the same manner as other military personnel. Due to a lack of appreciation, competition venues, and military personnel, almost all military marching bands have disappeared from schools in the United States, with exceptions including the [[Fightin' Texas Aggie Band]] from [[Texas A&M University]], the [[Highty-Tighties]] of the [[Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets]], and the Cadets of [[Norwich University]] Military College of Vermont. There is also a pocket of about 80 high school military-style marching bands in Eastern Texas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnlike in the United States, military-style marching bands have a strong presence in Latin American countries, especially those that have strong military traditions, most importantly of Prussian, French, Spanish and Portuguese origins. Such bands are found in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, and Peru. In Ecuador and Venezuela in particular, corps of drums is the main military-style band for schools. Military-style corps of drums are also seen in schools, colleges, and universities in Mexico and Mexican schools in the US using only the snare drum and the bugle (though in some schools the instrumentation can be larger). These bands also are present in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama, as well as in Commonwealth and ex-French nations in the Caribbean and Belize and Guayana, given British and French influences. Also, Vietnam has a strong military marching band tradition in schools, following the French and Soviet/Russian tradition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:British Youth Marching Band.jpg|thumb|The Brentwood Imperial Youth Band]]\n\nThe United Kingdom keeps the military-style tradition with many civil and youth bands in all of the UK keeping the military band traditions of the country, either as marching wind bands, Corps of Drums, bugle bands, pipe bands, and in Northern Ireland, fife and drum bands.

Unlike the military band style, drum corps style step sizes are constantly changing to accommodate the differing forms the band is creating on the field. Forms may be linear, curvilinear, or scatter. Music selections can include anything from symphonic music, film scores, to world music, jazz, rock, or pop music.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnlike a military band's use of baton twirlers, Corps Style bands may include a \"color guard\" that spin flags, rifles, sabres\u2014and may also incorporate dance. Other visual elements unique to the corps style is the usage of props, backdrops, and even costuming \u2013 to add more theatrical elements to the show.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:SOS2010.JPG|thumb|The [[Muncie Southside High School]] Spirit of South Marching Band performs at the Preliminary contest at the [[Indiana State Fair Band Day]] Competition in 2010.]]\n\nOther elements unique to the Corps Style bands are the incorporation of the ''front ensemble''. This includes the usage of keyboard percussion such as xylophone, marimba, and bells; or any other color percussion instruments such as timpani, cymbals, conga, tambourine, triangle, drum set, etc. The front ensemble may also use sound amplification or electronic instruments such as synthesizers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe ''corps style'' constantly evolves, with contributions from college bands, high school bands, and drum and bugle corps throughout the United States. Typically, corps style bands gear their performances for marching competitions and marching festivals. Competitions featuring the corps style on the national level include Drum Corps International, Winter Guard International, and Bands Of America. The competitive high school marching band is modeled after the corps style band.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nCorps style is a competitive style, judged in several \"captions\" that include Visual Analysis, Visual Proficiency, Color Guard, Music Analysis, Brass, Percussion, and General Effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dci.org/static/judging|title=Judging 'By the Numbers'|last=|first=|date=|website=www.dci.org|publisher=Drum Corps International|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>\n\n===Traditional style===\n\nTraditional style bands, also known as show bands, are marching bands geared primarily towards crowd entertainment and perform on football fields. Typically, they perform a routine before the game, another at halftime, and sometimes after the game as well. Competitive show bands perform only one show that is continually refined throughout a season, while bands that focus on entertainment rather than competition usually perform a unique show for each game. These shows normally consists of three to five musical pieces accompanied by formations rooted in origin from ''Patterns in Motion'',{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} a book penned by band director [[Bill Moffit|William C. \"Bill\" Moffit]], bandmaster of [[Purdue University]] [[All-American Marching Band]] and [[University of Houston]] [[Spirit of Houston]].\n\nA recognizable style of show band is the one fielded by [[HBCU band|historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs). HBCU bands utilize the traditional \"ankle-knee\" high step and music selections are largely based on R&B, hip-hop, and contemporary popular music. In addition to traditional drill formations, HBCU bands feature heavily choreographed dance routines as part of their performances. Many of these bands may have a twirler line or a dancer line, but not necessarily flag twirlers. One of the most notable depictions of HBCU bands is the 2002 film ''[[Drumline (film)|Drumline]]''. The history of African-American marching bands was explored through a 2018 exhibition called \"Marching On: The Politics of Performance\" in New York City.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://storefrontnews.org/programming/marching-on-the-politics-of-performance/|title=Marching On: The Politics of Performance|last=|first=|date=|website=Storefront for Art and Architecture|access-date=}}</ref> HBCU bands are a significant part of African-American musical culture and HBCU bands often surpass their associated football teams in popularity, a phenomenon that is uncommon among collegiate and high school marching bands. In 1989, as part of the celebrations for the bicentennial of the French Revolution, the [[Florida A&M University]] [[Marching 100]], one of the most prolific HBCU bands in the country, was selected as the official representative of the United States in the bicentennial parade.\n\nAnother style of show band is that used by many of the [[Big Ten Conference]] marching bands, a semi-military and semi-corps style. These bands perform a show that is designed to entertain the audience but feature more traditional symphonic styles of music (marches, film scores, jazz, or older pop music) as well as some contemporary music. Big Ten style show bands have been influential in creating some of the earliest marching band innovations, and the style is used in high schools throughout much of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1244213799&disposition=inline|title=A Descriptive Analysis of the Eleven Big Ten Conference Marching Band Programs|last=Fuller|first=John Allen|date=1995|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811184009/https://etd.ohiolink.edu/!etd.send_file?accession=osu1244213799&disposition=inline|archivedate=2017-08-11}}</ref>\n\nMost show bands of either type include the traditional military band instrumentation of woodwinds, brass, and battery percussion. Some also include the front ensemble keyboard percussion, and may also incorporate the use of a color guard for flag, and rifle routines as well as a dance line.\n\n===Carnival bands===\n[[File:Derby Midshipmen Band Parade.JPG|thumb|The Derby Midshipmen Band, a carnival band in the United Kingdom]]\nCarnival bands are a United Kingdom variant of show bands. Carnival bands typically march in time to the music, and may also participate in parades and competitions. They contain [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[percussion instruments|percussion]], but may or may not use [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]]s.<ref>[[:File:Derby Midshipmen Band 2005.jpg]]</ref> In The United States, specifically in California, carnival bands (known as Parade bands in the states) perform regularly in parades and parade competitions. These US bands are also modeled on the country's military band tradition.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Scramble bands===\n\n[[Scramble band]]s (also referred to as 'Scatter' bands) are a variation on show bands. They generally do not march in time with the music, but, as their name implies, scramble from design to design and often incorporate comedic elements into their performances. Most of the bands in the [[Ivy League]] use this style, excepting only [[Cornell University]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Scramble Bands | url = http://www.princeton.edu/~puband/about/scramble.html | accessdate = 2008-05-08 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080224041742/http://www.princeton.edu/~puband/about/scramble.html | archivedate = 2008-02-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mb.bigredbands.org/history.php |title=Cornell University Big Red Marching Band |publisher=Mb.bigredbands.org |accessdate=2014-05-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516151311/http://mb.bigredbands.org/history.php |archivedate=2014-05-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\nThe size and composition of a marching band can vary greatly. Some bands have fewer than twenty members, and some have over 500. American marching bands vary considerably in their instrumentation. Some bands omit some or all [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]]s, but it is not uncommon to see [[piccolo]]s, [[flute]]s, [[soprano clarinet]]s, [[alto saxophone]]s, and [[tenor saxophone]]s (woodwinds are not used in corps style marching). [[E-flat clarinet|E\u266d clarinets]], [[alto clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]]s, and [[baritone saxophone]]s are less common, but can be found in some bands. [[Bassoon]]s and [[oboe]]s are very seldom found on a field due to the risk of incidental damage, the impracticality of marching with an exposed double reed, and high sensitivity to weather.\n\nThe [[Brass instrument|brass section]] usually includes [[trumpet]]s or [[cornet]]s; [[French horn]]s, [[alto horn]]s, or [[mellophone]]s; [[Types of trombones#Tenor trombone|tenor trombone]]s; [[baritone horn]]s or [[euphonium]]s; and [[tuba]]s or [[sousaphone]]s. E\u266dsoprano [[cornet]]s are sometimes used to supplement or replace the high woodwinds, while the mellophone often is used in place of the French horn. Some especially large bands use [[flugelhorn]]s and bass trombones. Specially designed versions of the lower brass have been created for use while marching. These are typically wrapped in such a way that allows the bell to face toward the audience at all times. Bands may also modify their instrumentation to remove slide trombones completely and replace them with another instrument, such as a valved trombone or marching baritone horn.\n\n[[Marching percussion]] (often referred to as the [[drumline]], battery, or back battery) typically includes [[snare drum]]s, [[tenor drum]]s, [[bass drum]]s, and [[cymbal]]s and are responsible for keeping tempo for the band. All of these instruments have been adapted for mobile, outdoor use. Marching versions of the [[glockenspiel]] (bells), [[xylophone]], and [[marimba]] are also rarely used by some ensembles. Historically, the percussion section also employed mounted [[timpani]] that featured manual controls.\n\nFor bands that include a [[front ensemble]] (also known as the pit or auxiliary percussion), stationary instrumentation may include orchestral percussion such as [[timpani]], [[tambourine]]s, [[maraca]]s, [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]s, [[conga]]s, [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]]s, [[marimba]]s, [[xylophone]]s, [[bongo drum|bongo]]s, [[vibraphone]]s, [[timbales]], [[claves]], [[guiro]]s, and chimes or [[tubular bell]]s, concert bass drums, and [[gong]]s, as well as a multitude of auxiliary percussion equipment, all depending on the instrumentation of the field show. Drum sets, purpose-built drum racks, and other mounted instruments are also placed here. Until the advent of the pit in the early 1980s, many of these instruments were carried on the field by marching percussionists by hand or on mounting brackets. Some bands also include electronic instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s, [[electric guitar]]s, and [[bass guitar]], along with the requisite [[amplifier|amplification]]. If double-reed or string instruments are used, they are usually placed here, but even this usage is very rare due to their relative fragility. Unusual percussive instruments are sometimes used, including [[drum brake|brake drums]], empty propane tanks, trashcans, [[railroad tie]]s, stomping rigs, and other interesting sounds. In modern marching band, there is a use of amplification of the front ensemble to help balance out the wind and drumline sections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.halftimemag.com/features/technology-on-and-off-the-field.html|title=Technology On and Off the Field|website=www.halftimemag.com|access-date=2018-09-13|date=2009-07-25}}</ref> The use of synthesizers and electronics in the front ensemble can not only help the front ensemble, or \"pit\", be heard better by the audience and judges, but it can add soundscapes such as voice-overs to help tell the story of a field show, or to add sound effects (for example, a show about nature could have bird/wind/rain sound samples performed by a front ensemble member playing the synthesizer).\n\n[[File:Umass-electrophones.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band|UMass Band]] has long used electronics in its performances.]]\nA rare inclusion in a marching band that is becoming more popular is the use of [[electrophone]]s in a marching band. The most common electric instrument seen is a [[bass guitar]], but some schools also use [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[lead guitar]]. To make the electric instruments usable, external power in the stadium is often used, but some groups may use a car-battery mechanism that requires a car battery and a converter to give the instruments and amplifiers remote power. Also, some groups may use a small gasoline-powered generator.\n\n===Auxiliaries===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nMany bands have auxiliaries that add a visual component to the performance. For ceremonial bands, this could be a traditional [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]] or honor guard. For [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum & bugle corps]] and corps-style field bands, this could include Dance lines, [[majorettes]], Auxiliary units may be collectively referred to as [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]] or visual ensemble.\n\nAuxiliaries may perform as independent groups. In the early 1970s, color guards began to hold their own competitions in the winter (after the [[American football]] season, and before the beginning of the summer drum and bugle corps season). These became known as [[winter guard]]. There are also numerous dance competitions in the off-season.\n\nThe color guard of a marching band or drum and bugle corps may contain [[saber]]s, mock [[rifle]]s, and tall [[flags]]. In modern bands, other props are often used: [[flags]] of all sizes, horizontal banners, vertical banners, streamers, pom-poms, even tires, balls, and hula hoops or custom-built props. The color guard may also employ stage dressing such as backdrops, portable flats, or other structures. These can be used simply as static scenery or moved to emphasize drill, and are often used to create a \"backstage\" area to store equipment and hide personnel when necessary.\n\nWhile military color guards were typically male, band color guards tend to be primarily female, though it is becoming more common for men to join as well. A few independent units are all-male. Guard members nearly always wear a special uniform or costume that is distinctive from that of the band, not necessarily matching in design or color. The men's and women's guard uniforms are usually designed in one of two ways: nearly identically, but with gender-specific parts (i.e. skirts) adapted for the use of the opposite sex; or complimentarily, with the two uniforms designed similarly but with variations in color or form. The color guard uniform, especially in a high school marching band, need not be in school colors; in fact, they rarely are. These uniforms are designed to represent a certain aspect of the halftime show, characterize the guard members through costumes, or tell some sort of story, and can thus be in any design or color (a surprisingly common complaint among the high school audience is that guard uniforms and equipment \"aren't school colors\").\n\nIndoor color guards have become popular within high schools and universities throughout the United States. These groups perform a theme-based show in competitions after the outdoor marching band season ends. Indoor color guard shows are typically performed in school gymnasiums and are adjudicated.\n\n===Personnel===\nIrishman Patrick S. Gilmore started the concept of a bandleader.<ref>\"Band Leader\", London: Continuum, 2003{{full citation needed|date=January 2020}}</ref> A marching band is typically led by one or more [[Drum major (marching band)|drum majors]], also called field commanders, who are usually responsible for conducting the band (sometimes using a large [[Baton twirling|baton]] or [[Ceremonial mace|mace]], though such tools are used rarely in modern marching bands for conducting) and are commonly referred to as the leader of the band. When there is more than one drum major, one may be the head drum major, who often stands upon an elevated podium located on the 50-yard line while conducting, whereas the other(s) often conduct from convenient angles (should the marching block not be facing forward) and function as an apprentice of sorts. The number of members in the band often determines how many drum majors are needed, based on the complexity of the show (in which case, in a three-person scenario, one stands on the 50-yard line while another stands on the 30-yard line and the third stands on the other 30-yard line), and occasionally, additional individuals may be asked to perform brief conducting duties if beneficial in a particularly tricky part of the show (more often, such people are those on the sidelines or in the pit). The modern-day concept of the drum major has been exponentially expanded upon by George N. Parks, often known as the \"Dynamic Drum Major,\" through his Drum Major Academy. Bands may also be led by a more traditional [[Conducting|conductor]], especially during field shows, where a stationary conductor on a ladder or platform may be visible throughout the performance. Aural commands\u2014such as vocal orders, clapping, or a whistle\u2014may be used to issue commands as well. In show bands, particularly in HBCU and Big Ten bands, drum majors often have a visual on-field role with a baton or mace, with the job of conducting assigned to the band director(s). In these cases, the number of drum majors is often based on tradition, rather than being in proportion with the number of musicians. For example, the Florida A&M [[Marching 100]] fields one drum major for each president in the university's history. Other leaders within the band may include field lieutenants and captains of sections such as brass, drumline, and woodwinds, and members that lead a section, squad, row, etc.\n\nSome bands assign drum majors the dual role of leading and conducting the ensemble on the field. This is most common in traditional military-style groups, such as Texas A&M's Fightin' Texas Aggie Band: the drum majors march with the band, sound whistles to coordinate movement, and use maces to keep time by thrusting them up and down (rather than toward and away from the body, as is typical in American military bands).\n\nThe size of the band may not only determine how many drum majors there are, but how many section instructors are needed as well. Section instructors function like the music director but are mainly responsible for teaching members of a given section. Because they are commonly previous members of the section they teach, they can provide better instruction to combine the needs of the show with the characteristics of the given instrument.\n\nAs bands require leadership from within as well as from without, section leaders are usually selected from among the members of each instrumental section (a \"section\" comprises all the band members who play the same [[musical instrument]]). The section leader is always an experienced band member and is usually selected by the band director (rather than elected or self-appointed) for his or her leadership skills and experience. The section leader is responsible for the minute-to-minute instruction of his or her section members, and reports to the drum majors and the band director. Many larger bands appoint more than one section leader per section, with each having a \"head\" section leader, whether formally or informally designated as such. College-level military bands may use the term \"section sergeant\" or \"section officer\" in place of \"section leader.\"\n\nThe [[music director|director]] provides general guidance, selects the repertoire, interprets commentary and evaluations from judges, and auditions or recruits prospective members. What content is not provided by the director may be contracted from arrangers (who compose original works or adapt existing works) and copyists (who reproduce parts of the score), choreographers, and drill designers (primarily for field bands). With the assistance of section instructors, the director also teaches performance techniques\u2014musical, martial, and visual\u2014and assesses the pool of talent, choosing leaders and soloists as needed. The director also selects venues for public performance and oversees the staff that help provide funding and equipment. Many opportunities for member improvement are present: the director may organize clinics with various professionals, send representatives to specialty schools or camps, or plan trips abroad for education or exhibition.\n\nLarge bands also require many support staff who can move equipment, repair instruments, and uniforms, create and manipulate props used in performances, and provide food, water, and medical assistance. Additional staff may be utilized when the band hosts functions such as competitions and reviews. In high school bands, these activities are usually performed by volunteers, typically parents of band members or the band members of the lower grades. These people are often referred to as ''runners'' or ''boosters''. Significant support staff for college bands and independent corps are typically paid by the university or the corps organization, respectively.\n\n==Performance elements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nThe goal of each band's performance is different. Some aim for maximum uniformity and precision; others\u2014especially [[scramble band]]s\u2014want to be as entertaining as possible. Many U.S. university marching bands aim for maximum sound impact on the audience. Some bands perform primarily for the enjoyment of their members. However, there are some common elements in almost all band performances. The following overview is heavily focused on the U.S. marching band tradition.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:DGN marching band clip.jpg|left|thumb|Marching bands members may hold music on lyres attached to the instrument.]]\n\nThe traditional music of the marching band is the military [[march (music)|march]], but since show bands also evolved from the [[Concert band|concert]] and [[brass band]] traditions, music has always been varied. Often, music from other genres is adapted for the specific instrumentation of a marching band.\n\nCommercial [[arrangement]]s that are tailored for the average band instrumentation are also available. Many bands typically have a repertoire of traditional music associated with the organization they serve. Some competitive bands use an arrangement of popular music varied for marching band, as well as music from a movie or other such theme. However, the largest and most successful marching bands tend to steer clear of show tunes and popular music, instead preferring compilations or arrangements of classical or traditional concert pieces (i.e. [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' or [[Puccini]]'s ''[[Nessun Dorma]]'') or of entirely new compositions.\n\nMusic may be memorized, or it may be carried on flip folders, which are held by lyres that clip onto the instruments. Having music memorized is usually considered an advantage for competitive bands, and at competitions, there is usually a penalty for the use of the sheet music on the field written into the scoring rubric. Practically, memorization prevents obstruction of vision caused by the folders. The memorization of music is usually a matter of pride for the marching band, however, bands that regularly pull from expansive libraries and perform dozens of new works each season are more likely to utilize flip folders.\n\n=== Marching technique ===\n\n====Glide step====\n\nThe [[glide step]], also commonly known as the ''roll step,'' involves bringing the heel gently to the ground with the toe pointed up, and then rolling forward onto the toes before lifting the foot to continue forward. While marching to the rear, the weight is placed continually on the ball of the foot with the heel elevated. This style is used by both marching bands as well as drum and bugle corps. The style, in comparison to high step, gives drill formations a more fluid appearance, allowing for better control of more difficult formations and various styles of music. With this control also comes the ability to perform a much broader range of tempos. Proper execution of a roll step gives a player marching at 40 beats per minute the same smooth tone as a player marching at 180. The roll step allows for much better control of the upper body, and thus better control of the air support needed for playing.\n\nSome bands, and a select few drum and bugle corps, use a bent-knee variant of roll step, usually known simply as ''bent knee,'' in which the members roll from heel to toe but lead the next step with the knee instead of the foot, then planting the heel of the next foot by straightening the leg.\n\n====High step====\n\nThe high step is a style of marching used by many colleges and universities, including most bands of HBCUs and the Big Ten. Three primary sub-variants of the high are used:\n\n* The ''[[Ankle knee step|ankle-knee]]'' step involves bringing the foot up to the inside of the leg to the knee before coming down and forward. This is the style used by most bands from HBCUs.\n* The ''[[chair step]]'' involves lifting the knee until the thighs are parallel to the ground, and with toes pointed downward. When the leg is elevated to its maximum height, a ninety-degree angle exists between the torso and the thigh, as well as between the thigh and shin. The leg is then lowered, and this is repeated in an alternating fashion between the legs. This style is used by many schools in the Big Ten.\n* The ''extended high step'', much like the chair step, involves the thigh being parallel to the ground and perpendicular to the body, but instead with the shin extended outward at a forty-five-degree angle from the body and with toes pointed downward. The leg is then driven quickly back to the ground while the other leg repeats in this fashion.\n\nAn integral part of this style of marching is known as ''stop action,'' meaning that all movement ceases momentarily at the apex of each step. This requires a band to have a great deal of stamina, though is effective visually. High step marching is often accompanied by a horizontal swing of the player's body or instrument.\n\n====Lateral marching====\n\nWhen band members are marching in one direction but want to focus their sound in another, they may rotate their bodies at the waist, so that only the upper portion of the body faces in the direction of play. This is known as ''lateral marching'', but is more commonly known as either ''shifting'', ''traversing'', or ''sliding''. A lateral march is not a change in the direction of march, only in the direction the upper body faces. Percussion players, whose large drum harnesses often prevent them from twisting their torsos, and sometimes tuba and sousaphone players, instead uses a ''crab step'' when moving sideways. During a crab step, the musician crosses one leg over the other, either marching on the toes or rolling the foot sideways. Percussionists may also substitute roll step when their instruments would interfere with performing the high step.\n\n====Changing direction====\n\nA true direction change involving the feet moving in a new direction requires either a ''prep step'' or a ''pivot'', both of which are sometimes referred to as a ''flank'' or \u201cstab\u201d. To perform a prep step, on the last count of movement in the first direction a marcher plants the foot with the heel turned outward at half the angle of the turn desired, with the upper body still facing forward. On the next count, the other foot snaps into position completing the turn. The upper body may or may not turn with the lower body. Some bands plant the heel on the prep step rather than the toe but preserving the angle of the foot. To perform a pivot, the marcher pivots between directions over the ball of the foot on the last count instead of using a prep step.\n\n====Backward marching====\n\nA ''back march'' may be used when the band wishes to move in the opposite direction from where it is projecting its sound. There are several ways to back march, one of which is to walk backward, putting each foot down and rolling from the toe to the heel (the exact reverse of the roll step). Another variation involves marching on the platforms of the feet, dragging the toe of the moving foot on the ground. Backward marching usually employs the same preference for leg straightness as forward marching (if the band marches with legs completely straight while marching forwards, they also do so while marching backward, to preserve uniformity of style). Using peripheral vision to align oneself to formations or field markings is even more important during backward marching.\n\n====Marking time====\n\nWhen a band is not moving, the members may ''mark time'', or march in place. The step used usually resembles the step that is used for marching forward, though mixing a high step mark time with a roll step march (or vice versa) produces an interesting visual effect. For a typical mark time, the foot is raised to the ankle bone of the opposite leg. The toe should not come off the ground and the knee should not come out much past the still-straight leg.\n\nSome bands mark time by bringing their feet up to their knee\u2014known as ''high-mark time''. Some bands practice marking time during concert arch with the toes coming off of the ground to give the marcher a greater sense of marching while standing still. The heel should hit the ground on the beat. Some bands forgo marking time and instead come to a complete halt when not marching. Traditionally, the drumline would put their feet in a V-shape and lift their feet fully off the ground a few inches. This is to avoid hitting the drums.\n\n====Staying in step====\nEven when marking time, it is considered good form for all band members to stay ''in step''\u2014that is, step with the same foot at the same time. A large majority of bands ''step off'' with, or start marching on, the left foot. Staying in step is generally easier when the band is playing music or when the drums are playing a marching cadence.\n\nWhen the band and percussion are not playing, rhythm may be maintained in a variety of ways: a drummer may play taps or rim shots, the drum major may clap or use a woodblock, a drum major or band member may vocalize a sharp syllable like \"hit,\" \"hut,\" or \"dut,\" or band members may chant the military call of \"left, left, left right left.\" Band members may count the steps of the move out loud to keep the entire band together. Typically, most moves consist of any number of steps that are a multiples of two or four, due to most marching band music being in even-numbered [[time signature]]s. Even-numbered time signatures aid in staying in step because they assign odd-numbered counts to the left foot, and even-numbered counts to the right foot. If a band member is on the wrong foot, for instance, odd on the right foot and even on the left, this is referred to as being ''out of step''. When a band member is completely off tempo, it is referred to as being ''out of phase''.\n\n===Parade marching===\n[[File:The Pride of the Sunshine.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The [[University of Florida]]'s marching band, [[The Pride of the Sunshine]], performing in a parade]]\nIn [[parade]]s, bands usually line up in a marching block composed of [[Rank (formation)|ranks]] and [[File (formation)|files]]. Each member tries to stay within his or her given rank and file, and to maintain even spacing with neighboring musicians.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hindsley|first=Mark H.|date=1930|title=The Marching Band|journal=Music Supervisors' Journal|volume=17|issue=2|pages=15\u201317|doi=10.2307/3383449|issn=1559-2472|jstor=3383449}}</ref> It is traditionally the responsibility of the people at the end of each rank and the front of each file to be in the correct location; this allows other band members to use them as a reference, also known as ''guiding''.\n\nBand members also try to keep a constant pace or step size while marching in parade. Step sizes usually vary between 22 and 30 [[inch]]es (56\u201376 [[Centimetre|cm]]) per stride. A step size of 22.5&nbsp;inches is called an ''8-to-5'' step because the marcher covers five [[yard]]s (about 4.6 [[metre|m]]) in eight steps. A step size of 30&nbsp; inches is called ''6-to-5'' because five yards are covered in six steps. Because yard lines on an American football field are five yards apart, exact 8-to-5 and 6-to-5 steps are most useful for field shows.\n\nA [[drum cadence]], sometimes called a ''walk beat'' or ''street beat,'' is usually played when the band is marching, oftentimes alternating with a song, and is typically how a band keeps time while not playing music. Alternatively, a drum or rim shot may be given on the odd beats to keep the band in step. Between songs and cadences, a roll is usually given to indicate what beat in the measure the band is at. Cadence [[tempo]] varies from group to group but is generally between 112 and 144 [[beats per minute]] to facilitate marching.\n\n===Street performances===\n\nIn [[Minnesota]], [[Upstate New York]], and [[Wisconsin]], bands may perform on city streets with compact formation elements, sometimes referred to as a street show. These shows are judged using similar criteria as any other marching band competition. Elements of difficulty increase with street marching competitions because of the varying widths of streets in each community. Street marching is typical for bands who operate during the spring and early summer months. Typically, a band that performs in street marching competitions does not become involved with field marching, and vice versa. Various venues exist for street marching competitions between high school marching bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osseobandfestival.org|title=The Osseo Marching Band Festival in Osseo, Minnesota |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111191643/http://osseobandfestival.org/ |archive-date=2016-01-11 |author=|date=|website=osseobandfestival.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.vikinglandbandfestival.com Vikingland Band Festival] in Alexandria, Minnesota.</ref><ref>Other similar street marching events can be found at [http://www.marching.com Marching.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110073849/http://www.marching.com/ |date=2013-01-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Field marching===\n[[File:KSU MB block.jpg|thumb|[[Kansas State University Marching Band]] marching on the football field at [[Bill Snyder Family Stadium]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas]]]]\n\nWhile playing music during a field show, the band makes a series of formations, called drill, on the field, which may be pictures, geometric shapes, curvilinear designs, or blocks of musicians, although sometimes it may be pure abstract designs using no specific form.\n\nTypically, each band member has an assigned position in each formation. In many show bands and most drum corps, these positions are illustrated in a handheld booklet called a [[drill book]] (also known as a dot book). Drill books, or drill charts, show where each person stands during each set of the show. The drill charts include yard lines and hashes as they would be on an actual football field, which shows the band members where to stand relative to the yard lines and hashes. There are many ways of getting from one formation to the next:\n* Each member moves independently\u2014called ''scattering'' or ''scatter drill.''\n* All members move together without deforming the formation\u2014called ''floating.''\n* Members stay in their lines and arcs, but slowly deform the formation\u2014sometimes called ''rotating,'' ''expanding,'' or ''condensing.''\n* Members break into ranks or squads, each of which performs a maneuver (such as a ''[[follow-the-leader]]'') which may or may not be scripted. An unscripted move is sometimes called a ''rank option.''\n* Each member performs a specifically scripted move. In these cases, the desired visual effect is often the move itself and not the ending formation.\n* Members at an extended halt perform a stationary visual move, such as a ripple (like \"the wave\") or some sort of [[choreography]], that may propagate throughout the formation of band members\n\nPlayers may point the bells of their instruments in the direction they are moving, or ''slide'' (also called traverse) with all the bells facing in the same direction. They may also point it towards the center of the field. Bands that march in time with the music typically also synchronize the direction of individuals' turns and try to maintain even spacing between individuals in formations (called intervals). Sometimes bands specifically have wind players turn their instruments away from the audience to emphasize the dynamics of the music.\n\nAuxiliaries can also add to the visual effect. Backdrops and props (''scrims'') may be used on the field that fit the theme of the show or the music being performed. In comedic shows, particularly for university bands, an announcer may read jokes or a funny script between songs; formations that are words or pictures (or the songs themselves) may serve as punch lines.\n\n===Fundamental commands and drill down===\n\nIn some marching bands, the drum majors have the option to give out a set of commands to the rest of the band either vocally, by hand command, or by a whistle. These commands originated from the military history of marching band. Different bands might have different sets of procedures such as the number of counts it takes to carry out the command, but the overall result is the same.\n* To the ready/Standing by/Rest/Relax: the command tells the band to stand with heads slightly bowed, feet shoulder-width apart. The band often automatically does this when they first march onto a field at the beginning of their show.\n* Band atten-hut/Band ten-hut/Set: the command that tells the band to go into the position of attention, a military posture. The band usually responds with a loud verbal response, such as \"One!\", \"Hut!\" or \"Hit!\"\n* Mark time march: the command tells the band to march in place in rhythm to snare taps, normally before they march off.\n* Forward march, sometimes Forward [[Harch]]: This command tells the band to begin marching, in time, and in step. They step off on the left foot and end on the right.\n* Detail halt/Band halt: this command tells the band to stop marching. Normally they'll mark time for two beats, saying \"ONE, TWO\" or \"DUT, DUT\" on these beats, to ensure they end on the right foot.\n* At ease: this tells the band that they may completely relax.\n* Parade Rest: the command that tells the band to put their feet shoulder wide and join both hands in the front of their body or to put both feet together or in a V-formation and roll their elbows out and put both hands in fists resting on the hip (the upper-body portion is usually only utilized when marching without instruments, sometimes the second option's lower body form and the first option's upper-body form is used).\n* Left face: the command to turn the band 90 degrees to the left while at the position of attention.\n* Right face: the command to turn the band 90 degrees to the right while at the position of attention.\n* About face: the command to turn the band 180 degrees to the rear while at the position of attention.\n* Horns up: the command for wind players to bring their instruments to playing position (mouthpiece on or near the mouth).\n* Horns thrust: this command for wind players instructs the band to bring their horns to a ''thrust'' position where their instruments are perpendicular to the ground and their mouthpieces are level with their eyes.\n* Horns carry: this command for wind players instructs the band to put their instrument under their right arm.\n* Dismissed/Fall out: this command generally releases the band either for the day or for another portion of the rehearsal.\n* To the left flank: this command turns the band 90 degrees sinistrally while marking time. It is not to be executed until the director/drum major shouts the command \"hut\" or \"march.\"\n* To the right flank: this command turns the band 90 degrees dextrally while marking time. It is not to be executed until the director/drum major shouts the syllable \"hut\" or \"march.\"\n* To the rear: this command turns the band 180 degrees while marking time. It is not to be executed until the director/drum major shouts the syllable \"hut\" or \"march.\"\n* Dress center/right/left dress: this command has the band bring their hands together at eye-level and to turn their heads toward the center, right, or left of the block (if one is in the center, one simply puts one's head down). While dressing, the band can adjust the block to have better spacing. No commands other than \"Ready front\" (sometimes \"Eyes front\") can be executed while Dressing is in action.\n*Ready front/Eyes front: this command makes a band exit dress center for attention.\n* Cover down: this command tells the band to line up their files and make sure they are straight.\nAside from field show and parade, competitions among [[secondary school]]s can also have the ''march off'' (also ''concentration block'' or ''drill down''). This event involves all participants on the field following the commands of the director or a drum major. If a participant makes a mistake, either by execution or wrong timing, then the participant falls out of the field. A winner is crowned when there is only one participant left on the field.\n\n===Delay===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Phasing (disambiguation)]] -->\n\nEach musician in a marching band creates [[Sound wave#Longitudinal and transverse waves|sound waves]]. The waves from each musician, traveling at the speed of sound, reach the other musicians, field conductors, and listeners at slightly different times. If the distance between musicians is large enough, listeners may perceive waves to be [[Wiktionary:out of phase|out of phase]]. Typically, in this case, listeners perceive that one section of the band is playing their parts slightly after another section. This ''delay'' effect is informally referred to as ''ensemble tear'' or ''phasing'' (not to be confused with the [[Phasing|music composition technique of the same name]]).\n\nConsider also that viewers perceive the movement of marchers as light waves. Since light travels faster than sound, viewers may perceive that movement is out of phase with the sound. Sound waves may also reflect off parts of the stadium or nearby buildings.\n\nFor example, if two musicians, one standing on the front sideline of the football field and one on the back sideline, begin playing exactly when they see the beat of the conductor's baton or hand, the sound produced by the musician on the front sideline reaches listeners in the stands noticeably before the sound played by the back musician, and the musicians are seen to move before the sound reaches the stands.\n\nEnsemble tears can occur when musicians on the field listen to the pit. Because of the way sound waves travel, the sound pit produces first bounces off the back bleachers and then is heard by the ensemble. By the time the ensemble hears them, they are already late in timing. Because of this reason, the norm is to ignore the pit and let them listen to the ensemble for timing.\n\nDelay can be reduced in several ways, including:\n* using compact formations;\n* instructing players to watch field conductors, to get a uniform idea of tempo;\n* instructing musicians to make constant adjustments and watch or listen to sources of tempo to make their sound reach the audience at the same time as other musicians;\n* instructing players located near the back of the field watch the drum major, and all other players to ''listen back'', playing along with those watching the drum major;\n* instructing players to keep track of time and rhythm on their own (''internalize the tempo'');\n* instructing the percussion to call out counts, or do rimshots (sometimes called ''cheaters'') when they are not playing;\n* instructing players to ignore the delay and realize that listeners hear the sound waves in phase. This most often occurs when the band is spread out, but in groups (e.g., the four corners of the football field in 4 groups). In this case, the sound reaches the center of the stadium and the center of the stands at the same moment provided the band members are ''not'' correcting for each other.\n\n===Uniforms===\n[[File:Big Ten Conference Marching Band Uniforms West-East.png|right|thumb|700px|Diagrammed example of marching band uniforms of the [[Big Ten]] conference in the United States.]]\nNearly all marching band personnel wear some kind of [[uniform]]. Military-style uniforms are most common, but there are bands that use everything from matching T-shirts and shorts to formal wear. The school or organization's name, symbol, or colors are commonly applied to uniforms. Uniforms may also have substantially different colors on the front and back, so if band members turn suddenly (''flank''), the audience sees a striking change of color. Band members at many [[Ivy League]] schools wear a jacket and tie while performing. The [[Southern Methodist University]] band wear a different combination of jackets, vests, ties, shirts, and pants for each half (changing before halftime) of each game and no clothing or uniform combinations are repeated during the marching season. The [[Alma College]] Kiltie Marching Band is famous for wearing [[kilt]]s made of the official Alma College [[tartan]].\n\nThe components of a band uniform are numerous. Common design elements include hats (typically [[shako]]s, [[pith helmet]]s, [[Combination cap|combination hats]] or other styles of helmets) with feather plumes, capes, gloves, rank cords, and other embellishments. The [[University of Southern California|USC]] [[Spirit of Troy]] Marching Band and [[Troy University]]'s Sound of the South Marching Band wear traditional Trojan helmets. It is also common for band uniforms to have a stripe down the leg and light-colored shoes, or [[Spats (footwear)|spats]] over dark shoes to emphasize the movement of the legs while marching. Similarly, uniforms may feature additional components which highlight movement of the upper body, such as the \"wings\" worn by the [[University of Minnesota Marching Band|University of Minnesota]]'s marching band to highlight flanking movements on the field.<ref>{{Citation|last=The University of Minnesota Marching Band|title=New Uniform Video for the University of Minnesota Marching Band|date=2015-05-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn0hBLx-33k|accessdate=2017-08-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508090133/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn0hBLx-33k|archivedate=2018-05-08}}</ref> Competitive bands, however, many times opt for matching uniforms, especially pants and shoes (usually white or black) to hide the visual effect of members who are out of step as seen from a distance. Occasionally, a band forgoes traditional uniforms in favor of costumes that fit the theme of its field show. The costumes may or may not be uniform throughout the band. This kind of specialized uniform change is usually confined to competitive marching bands.\n\n[[Drum major (marching band)|Drum Major]]s, the field commanders and band directors, usually do not wear the regular band uniform, to better distinguish them from the rest of the band. Some wear more formal outfits or costumes that match the theme of the music, or most commonly a differently-designed version of the regular band uniform, often employing different colors (especially white) or features such as capes. Some (especially at the college level) still employ the tall wool-lined shako or much larger [[bearskin]] (both often derisively referred to as a \"Q-Tip hat\"). Sousaphone players may use a military-style beret or entirely forgo the use of a head covering, as most hats may be in the way of the bell. Some auxiliary groups use uniforms that resemble gymnastics outfits: Often, these uniforms are themed, drawing inspiration from the music. Many auxiliary groups change the outfits they use from season to season based on the needs of the band, although some that do also have a \"base\" uniform for occasions such as parades or other ceremonies.\n\n==Rehearsals==\n\nMusic for parade and show bands is typically learned separately, in a [[concert band]] setting. It may even be memorized before any of the marching steps are learned. When rehearsing drill, positions and maneuvers are usually learned without playing the music simultaneously\u2014a common technique for learning drill is to have members sing their parts or march to a recording produced during a music rehearsal. Many bands learn drill one ''picture'' or form at a time, and later combine these and add music.\n\nRehearsals may also include physical warm-up (calisthenics, running, etc.), ''music warm-up'' (generally consisting of breathing exercises, [[scale (music)|scales]], technical exercises, [[chorales]], and [[musical tuning|tuning]]), ''basics'' (simple marching in a block to practice proper technique), and ''sectionals'' (in which either staff or band members designated ''section leaders'' rehearse individual sections).\n\nWhen learning positions for drill, an [[American football]] field may be divided into a 5-yard grid, with the yard lines serving as one set of guides. The locations where the perpendicular grid lines cross the yard lines sometimes called ''zero points'' or gacks, may be marked on a practice field at eight-, four-, or two-step intervals. Alternately, band members may only use field markings\u2014yard lines, the centerline, hash marks, and yard numbers\u2014as guides (but note that different leagues put these markings in different places).\n\nFor members to learn their positions more quickly, they may be given ''drill charts'', which map their locations relative to the grid or field markings for each formation. In other groups, spray chalk or colored markers are used to mark the location of each person after each set of drill, with a different color and, sometimes, shape for each move.\n\nSome bands use small notebooks, also known as a [[dot book]] or [[drill book]], which they hang about their necks, on the drum harness, or around the waist. These contain pages of ''drill charts'', which often either give a picture or list coordinates that band members use to find 'pages' or 'sets' on the field. Coordinates are normally listed in 8-to-5 steps off the front sideline and front and back hashes, along with the number of 8\u20135 steps off of the yard line listed on each page. Some bands are even using small plastic pouches that hang about their neck on an adjustable strap, which has a zipper pocket for holding drill, flags to mark sets, and a pencil. There is also a clear plastic window in front to display the current part of drill being worked on at that point in time.\n\nMembers may also group into squads, ranks, sections, or (especially with [[scramble band]]s that primarily form words) letters. Instead of each member having an individual move, moves are then learned on a squad-by-squad (rank-by-rank) basis.\n\n===Band camp===\n\nMost bands meet in the summer, normally in August for summer training, or prior to the specific marching season (known as [[band camp]]). This involves learning basic marching fundamentals such as the type of marching step the band uses, commands from the drum major, and how to move on field. The band is also given music to learn for their show. Drill for the show may or may not be provided to learn during band camp. The camp takes place outdoors on the field for marching, and in a band hall for music-only rehearsals. Sectionals, or rehearsals including all of one instrument (e.g. flute sectional), take place during this time. Directors may use time during band camp to place band members in their sections based on playing or marching level and ability. This time can also be used for the potential drums majors to showcase their abilities and for the band director to choose who is head drum major. For bands that require auditions for the band, drumline, or auxiliary, auditions may happen the first few days for placement. Band camp usually lasts 1\u20132 weeks, but in the case of a more advanced marching band, camp may last up to a month. In most university bands, band camp means an earlier move-in date for university students in the band.\n\n==American football games==\n\nMarching bands serve as entertainment during [[American football]] games, which may also be known as pep band. For college and high school marching bands, this is the primary purpose of the ensemble. The home team's band plays the national anthem before kickoff (often as part of a pre-game show), as well as other music while in the stands during the game. Bands cheer with the cheerleaders, and some bands create their cheers. Marching bands then perform a show during halftime. When both teams' bands are present, it is a common protocol for the visiting band to perform first. After halftime, some high school bands use the third quarter of the game to take a break and get food. College bands and some high school bands do not have such breaks but continue playing in the stands during the entirety of the game. The band often stays the entire game, playing the school's fight song and alma mater at the end of the game regardless of the outcome.\n\nThree [[National Football League]] teams designate an official marching band: the [[Washington Redskins]], [[Buffalo Bills]] and [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Marching bands were once common fare during [[Super Bowl halftime show]]s during its earlier years but were later replaced by short [[Arena rock|stadium rock]] concerts from high-profile recording artists, some of which have incorporated marching bands into their performances. Marching bands are otherwise uncommon at the professional level.\n\n==Competition==\n\nIn competition, marching bands are usually judged on criteria such as musicality, uniformity, visual impact, artistic interpretation, and the difficulty of the music and drill. Competition exists at all levels but is most common in the U.S. among secondary school bands and drum and bugle corps. Performances designed for a competition setting usually include more esoteric music (including but not limited to adaptations of modern orchestral pieces). Many traditional-style bands compete in contests known as a Battle of the Bands, similar to the Atlanta Classic from the movie [[Drumline]]. There are also competitions at the national level, such as the [[Bands of America|Bands of America (BOA)]] Grand National Championships through [http://www.musicforall.org/ Music for All].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.musicforall.org/who-we-are/bands-of-america|title=Bands of America|last=Media|first=|date=|work=Music for All, Inc.|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref>\n\nAlthough its legitimacy is often called into question, competitive marching band is sometimes considered a sport, due in large part to the physical exertion required in combination with teamwork. Many HBCU marching band fans refer to marching band as ''marching sport.'' [[Sports Illustrated]] considered the activity a sport in 1987, describing the Drum Corps International World Championships \u201cone of the biggest sporting events of the summer.\u201d<ref>{{Citation| title = Scorecard| newspaper = Sports Illustrated| date = 10 August 1987| url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066257/4/index.htm| accessdate = 19 July 2012| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131216032152/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066257/4/index.htm| archivedate = 16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name='Halftime Mag \"Musicians as Athletes\"'>{{cite web|last=Greenwald-Gonella|first=Haley|title=Musicians as Athletes|url=http://halftimemag.com/articles/09-2010/09-2010-features/musicians-as-athletes.html|work=Halftime Magazine|accessdate=19 July 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616043558/http://halftimemag.com/articles/09-2010/09-2010-features/musicians-as-athletes.html|archivedate=16 June 2012|date=2010-10-03}}</ref> In the same article, Sports Illustrated quoted basketball coach [[Bobby Knight]], \"If a basketball team trained as hard as these kids do, it would be unbelievable.

The findings were that the performer's metabolic rates matched those of marathon runners halfway through a marathon, while the heart rate was more along the lines of someone who was running a \"400 or 800-meter dash.\"<ref>{{cite video| people = Dr. Jeff Edwards | title = DCI Musical Athletes | medium = Television production | publisher = [[ESPN]] | location = Naperville, IL | date = 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Spring competitions===\n\nSpring and early summer parade marching (or street marching) are popular in the northern midwest and Upstate New York, where temperatures are moderate enough for students to march distances in standard uniforms. Performance styles range from traditional block marching to elaborate productions with evolving drill patterns.<ref>The [http://www.vikinglandbandfestival.com Vikingland Band Festival] parade marching championship in Alexandria, Minnesota, is held annually on the last Sunday of June. The event was founded in 1985 and has drawn parade bands from seven states, two Canadian provinces, and Norway. Another popular street marching competition is [http://www.osseobandfestival.org The Osseo Marching Band Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111191643/http://osseobandfestival.org/ |date=2016-01-11 }} held on Saturday of the last full weekend in June.</ref>\n\n===Summer competitions===\n\nSome circuits in the United States continue to hold field show competitions during the summer months. Much like drum corps, these bands rehearse and tour full-time for about a month from mid-June to mid-August. Such circuits include the Mid-America Competing Band Directors Association, or MACBDA,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macbda.org |title=Mid-America Competing Band Directors Association |publisher=Macbda.org |accessdate=2014-05-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517143708/http://macbda.org/ |archivedate=2014-05-17 }}</ref> and the [[CYO|Catholic Youth Organization]] circuits.\n\n[[MACBDA]] is currently host to more than 20 actively competing, '''summer-only''' field show bands from the US (Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan) and Canada (Saskatchewan and Alberta). The circuit sponsors fourteen field show competitions each summer and the circuit championships move on a three-year-rotation from Calgary, AB, Canada, to Traverse City, MI, to the Southern Wisconsin / Northern Illinois area.\n\nThe [[Honda Battle of the Bands]] is an annual marching band exhibition that features performances by HBCU bands. Seemingly contradictory to the name, Honda's \"battle\" is not a competition in the traditional sense. That is, no winner is crowned during the event. Rather, the bands compete for the favor of the audience, each other, and the greater community.\n\nWAMSB (World Association of Marching Show Bands) is an international organization holding many competitions throughout the world. Its World Championships are held annually in the summer in a different country. Past host nations include Canada, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, & Australia. WAMSB sanctioned events happen in 32 nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wamsb.org/about.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101214041/http://www.wamsb.org/about.htm |archivedate=2014-11-01 }}</ref>\n\nThe Central Indiana Track Show Association hosts contests in Indiana during the summer.

In the [[United States]], there are two national competition circuits in which bands can compete: [[Bands of America]] and the [[United States Scholastic Band Association]] (USSBA).\n\nThe USSBA was formed in 1988 through the help of the Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps. Over 700 high school bands compete during the Fall season with bands of similar size and talent. Each competition provides approximately 40 professional judges who give feedback on the show's programming and design. At the season's end, the top 50 bands are invited to compete in the US Scholastic Band Championship, which is hosted at a college or professional stadium.<ref>[http://www.yea.org/site/PageServer?pagename=USSBA Youth Education in the Arts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822025119/http://www.yea.org/site/PageServer?pagename=USSBA |date=2006-08-22 }}</ref>\n\nBands of America is the other major circuit that conducts several competitions throughout the fall season. Competitions include Regional Championships, held in collegiate stadiums in locations such as Pennsylvania, California, Ohio, Texas, and North Carolina, and Super Regional Championships held in NFL stadiums in cities such as Atlanta, Indianapolis, and St. Louis. The season accumulates with the holding of Grand National Championships, considered the top event for high school marching. Grand Nationals takes place in [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] in Indianapolis, Indiana in early to mid-November. The three-day event concludes with the top 12 highest scoring high school bands, out of the more than 90 who participate, performing in Grand National Finals on Saturday night. Due to the stiff competition, with bands traveling to the event from throughout the country, many people consider the champion the best high school marching band in the country. There are no qualifications for any Bands of America events, including Grand Nationals. Admittance is based on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nMany states have their own competition circuits, as well as their own rules for competitions in their circuits. Several colleges host annual independent competitions, with varying degrees of prestige\u2014such as the Contest of Champions at [[Middle Tennessee State University]], which is the longest-running high school band contest in the United States.\n\nTo make competitions fair, bands normally split into different ''classes'' or ''divisions'' based on certain factors. One popular classification system uses the size of the school to split up the competing bands. This is the method used by [[Bands of America]], the [[Indiana State School Music Association]], [[Kentucky Music Educators Association]] and the [[University Interscholastic League]]. Alternatively, the number of band members determines the class\u2014with the largest bands being Division I, and smaller bands being classified as Division II, III, and IV.\n\n===Sudler Trophy and Sudler Shield===\n[[File:Sudler Trophy.JPG|thumb|The [[University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band]]'s Sudler Trophy]]\n{{Main|Sudler Trophy}}\n\nThe Sudler Trophy and Sudler Shields are awards bestowed each year by the [[John Philip Sousa Foundation]] on one university marching band and one high school marching band. The awards do not represent the winner of any championship, but rather a band surrounded by great tradition that has become respected nationally. No school may be honored with either award twice while under the same director.\n\n==Marching bands outside the U.S.==\n\n===Canada===\n[[File:2008 Toronto Santa Claus Parade IMG 0033 (3036149667).jpg|thumb|Defiance Band of Class marching during the 2008 Toronto Santa Claus Parade.]]\nMost marching bands in Canada are organized by the Canadian Band Association or by Canadian universities:\n\n*[[Royal Military College of Canada Bands]]\n*[[Simon Fraser University Pipe Band]] \n*[[Western Mustang Band]] \n*{{Not a typo|[[Lady Godiva Memorial Bnad]]}}\n\nAlthough many bands have still retained the British tradition for marching bands, most have also adopted the style utilized by their American counterparts. [[Canadian military bands]] are often associated with civilian marching bands. Many of the civilian marching bands that exist today, such as the [[Oshawa Civic Band]]<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/oshawa-ont-emc/ \"Music in Oshawa\"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'',  Margaret Drynan, 02/07/2006</ref>, The Concert Band of [[Cobourg]]<ref>http://www.theconcertbandofcobourg.com/?page_id=997</ref> and the [[Toronto Signals Band]], have military roots and were formerly Canadian Army bands. In the case of the aformentioned bands, their lineage is shared with the bands of [[The Ontario Regiment]], the 6th Northumberland Militia and the 2nd Armoured Divisional Signals Regiment respectively. In the early to mid 20th century, the [[Canadian Forces]] maintained drum and bugle corps, which were similar in instrumentation and organization to civilian marching bands.<ref>http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520Drum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjJw9qw5tPmAhUFXM0KHdBUBu4QFjARegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS</ref>\n\n===Taiwan===\nIn [[Taiwan]], the National Marching Band Association is the main organizer of local marching bands in the country.

The most common are found in the [[Malaysian Armed Forces]], however, in recent years, there has been a rise in the number of show bands and drum corps in the country. Although the Ministry of Education organizes most school marching bands, other organizations have made consistent efforts to organize local marching bands.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/294088667_Developing_Malaysian_High_School_Marching_Bands_Issues_Challenges_and_Strategies Developing Malaysian High School Marching Bands Issues, Challenges, and Strategies]</ref>\n\n===Russia===\nIn [[Russia]], there are not many school or local marching bands in existence, with most being government-sponsored military and police bands, as well as several bands operated by the local governments. The marching bands of the [[Russian Armed Forces]] are organized by the [[Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Russia|Military Band Service]] in the [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defence]].

These types of bands only came into existence after 1991 when the [[Soviet Union]] ceased to exist. During the Soviet era, civilian like marching bands were extremely rare, with one of the only non-military bands having been employed in the late 1930s and early 1940s during National Sports Day parades in the capital of [[Moscow]].<ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=AmwiAQAAIAAJ&q=marching+band+of+russia&dq=marching+band+of+russia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0q-y7r6DnAhWCBs0KHYBrBeoQ6AEIRzAE</ref> Other Russian marching bands include the Drummers Group of the Boarding School for Girls of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the Moscow & District Pipe Band.

The film depicts Knievel reflecting on major events in his life, particularly his relationship with his girlfriend/wife, Linda. The film opens with Knievel at the [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] in [[Ontario, California]]. Knievel is speaking directly to the camera describing his upcoming daredevil motorcycle jump:\n\n:''Ladies and gentlemen, you have no idea how good it makes me feel to be here today. It is truly an honor to risk my life for you. An honor. Before I jump this motorcycle over these 19 cars&nbsp;\u2014 and I want you to know there's not a Volkswagen or a Datsun in the row&nbsp;\u2014 before I sail cleanly over that last truck, I want to tell you that last night a kid came up to me and he said, \"Mr Knievel, are you crazy? That jump you're going to make is impossible, but I already have my tickets because I want to see you splatter.\" That's right, that's what he said. And I told that boy last night that nothing is impossible. Now they told Columbus to sail across the ocean was impossible. They told the settlers to live in a wild land was impossible. They told the [[Wright Brothers]] to fly was impossible. And they probably told [[Neil Armstrong]] a walk on the moon was impossible. They tell Evel Knievel to jump a motorcycle across the [[Grand Canyon]] is impossible, and they say that every day. A Roman General in the time of Caesar had the motto: \"If it is possible, it is done. If it is impossible, it will be done.\" And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I live by.''\n\nFollowing his introduction, the story follows a flashback narrative through Knievel's life.\n\nThe film ends with Knievel successfully completing the jump at the Ontario Motor Speedway and riding off onto a dirt road which leads to the edge of the Grand Canyon. (At the time of production, the real Evel Knievel was hyping a jump over the Grand Canyon.)\n\n==Monologue==\nAs the movie closes over the Grand Canyon, George Hamilton delivers a voice-over monologue in the Knievel character. In the monologue, he describes himself as the \"last gladiator\", which would later be used by the real Evel Knievel in his 1998 documentary, ''The Last of the Gladiators''.\n\nBelow is a transcript of the monologue from the movie:\n:''Important people in this country, celebrities like myself \u2014 [[Elvis]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[John Wayne]] \u2014 we have a responsibility. There are millions of people that look at our lives and it gives theirs some meaning. People come out from their jobs, most of which are meaningless to them, and they watch me jump 20 cars, maybe get splattered. It means something to them. They jump right alongside of me \u2014 they take the bars in their hands, and for one split second, they\u2019re all daredevils. I am the last gladiator in the new Rome. I go into the arena and I compete against destruction and I win. And next week, I go out there and I do it again. And this time \u2014 civilization being what it is and all \u2014 we have very little choice about our life. The only thing really left to us is a choice about our death. And mine will be \u2014 glorious.''\n\n==Cast==\n*[[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] as Evel Knievel\n*[[Sue Lyon]] as Linda\n*[[Bert Freed]] as Doc Kincaid\n*[[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]] as Charlie Knesson\n*[[Dub Taylor]] as Turquoise Smith\n*[[Ron Masak]] as Pete\n*[[Hal Baylor]] as The Sheriff\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nGeorge Hamilton was writing a story about a bronc rider who became a motorcycle rider. While preparing to film it, he interviewed various stunt men for the lead role and heard about Knievel. He visited the stuntman in a San Francisco hospital and found him more fascinating than what he was writing. In 1970, Hamilton stated that:\n<blockquote>In America we've long had a theory that all men have an equal right to become everything they want. But there's a new theory being pushed on us - that every man has to be something whether he wants to or not. That's what the theory of Evil Knievel is about. He's an individual who doesn't care about establishment or hippie, both have their phony sides. I'm not sure why Evil does what he does on a motorcycle. But I do know that by the time the picture is finished I'll be able to say it in one sentence.<ref name=\"george\">Hollywood Today: Norma Takes a Look at the Reasons Why Cutie-pie, Georgie Boy Survived the Survivors\nNorma Lee Browning. Chicago Tribune (1963-Current file) [Chicago, Ill] 08 Feb 1970: n2.</ref></blockquote>\nThe screenplay was originally written by [[Alan Caillou]] who had written the screenplay for [[Jack Starrett]]'s ''[[The Losers (1970 film)|The Losers]]'' also for Joe Solomon's Fanfare Films. However George Hamilton was not happy with it. He offered to pay [[John Milius]] $5,000 to write some lines in the script. Milius says he went to Hamilton's home at Palm Springs to read the script \"and it was terrible. So I threw the script in the pool and beat on it with an oar. And of course the script was waterlogged, so I just wrote another one. He later told me he knew that if I got down there with that script I'd write another one.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nMilius says Knievel \"saw himself as the new gladiator of the new Rome, something larger than a daredevil. He saw the whole spectacle of civilization and the absurdity of what it's turned into, and he fit into that.\"<ref name=\"nat\"/>\n\nMilius later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\"/>\n\nHamilton later recalled:\n<blockquote>Milius made me read the script to Evel. I realized he was kind of a sociopath and was totally messed. Then all of sudden Evel started to adopt lines out of the movie for himself. So his persona in the movie became more of his persona in real life. He would have been every kid\u2019s hero on one hand, but then he went and took that baseball bat and broke that guy\u2019s arm and that finished his career in the toy business. Evel was very, very difficult and he was jealous of anybody that was gonna play him. He wanted to portray himself and he did go and make his own movie later on. He had a great perception of this warrior that he thought he was and that was good. Then he had this other side of himself where he\u2019d turn on you in a minute. Success is something that you have earn. You have to have a humility for it, because it can leave you in a second. It may remember you but it can sure leave you. I think if you don\u2019t get that and you don\u2019t have gratitude for what you are and where you are it doesn\u2019t come back and it goes away forever.<ref>[http://www.popentertainment.com/georgehamilton.htm Interview with George Hamilton at Pop Entertainment] accessed 23 December 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Shooting===\nThe picture was directed by [[Marvin J. Chomsky]] and was released on September 10, 1971.\n\nMuch of the film was shot in [[Butte, Montana]]. Actual footage of Knievel jumping his motorcycle was used throughout the film.  Additionally, Knievel performed a series of new jumps at the Ontario Motor Speedway for the production, including a spectacular record jump of 129 feet over 19 cars that was included in the film (Knievel held the record for jumping a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle over 19 cars for 27 years, until broken by [[Bubba Blackwell]] in 1998).  Knievel received a flat rate of $25,000 for his rights and the consulting fee.<ref>Life of Evel Knievel, S. Baker, St. Martin's Press, 2008</ref>\n\nIn 1973 Milius said he preferred the film \"to the other movies from my scripts. They didn't restrain it or tone it down, they shot the script. The guy is just as obnoxious and full of hot air as he was in the script. Just as full of life and vitality too. He's Evel Knievel! He wouldn't take a dime off of anybody.\"<ref>Strawn, L. (1973, Aug 05). Movies. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/157337177</ref>\n\nThe music is conducted by [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Patrick Williams]]. The title song, \"I Do What I Please\", is played throughout the film, including the opening and closing credits, and the montage of the real Evel Knievel's stunt riding.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1971]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0067069}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=EvelKnievel|name=Evel Knievel}}\n\n{{John Milius}}\n{{Marvin J.

He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\"/>\n\nHamilton later recalled:\n<blockquote>Milius made me read the script to Evel. I realized he was kind of a sociopath and was totally messed. Then all of sudden Evel started to adopt lines out of the movie for himself. So his persona in the movie became more of his persona in real life. He would have been every kid\u2019s hero on one hand, but then he went and took that baseball bat and broke that guy\u2019s arm and that finished his career in the toy business. Evel was very, very difficult and he was jealous of anybody that was gonna play him. He wanted to portray himself and he did go and make his own movie later on. He had a great perception of this warrior that he thought he was and that was good. Then he had this other side of himself where he\u2019d turn on you in a minute. Success is something that you have earn. You have to have a humility for it, because it can leave you in a second. It may remember you but it can sure leave you. I think if you don\u2019t get that and you don\u2019t have gratitude for what you are and where you are it doesn\u2019t come back and it goes away forever.<ref>[http://www.popentertainment.com/georgehamilton.htm Interview with George Hamilton at Pop Entertainment] accessed 23 December 2014</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Shooting===\nThe picture was directed by [[Marvin J. Chomsky]] and was released on September 10, 1971.\n\nMuch of the film was shot in [[Butte, Montana]]. Actual footage of Knievel jumping his motorcycle was used throughout the film.  Additionally, Knievel performed a series of new jumps at the Ontario Motor Speedway for the production, including a spectacular record jump of 129 feet over 19 cars that was included in the film (Knievel held the record for jumping a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle over 19 cars for 27 years, until broken by [[Bubba Blackwell]] in 1998).  Knievel received a flat rate of $25,000 for his rights and the consulting fee.<ref>Life of Evel Knievel, S. Baker, St. Martin's Press, 2008</ref>\n\nIn 1973 Milius said he preferred the film \"to the other movies from my scripts. They didn't restrain it or tone it down, they shot the script. The guy is just as obnoxious and full of hot air as he was in the script. Just as full of life and vitality too. He's Evel Knievel! He wouldn't take a dime off of anybody.\"<ref>Strawn, L. (1973, Aug 05). Movies. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/157337177</ref>\n\nThe music is conducted by [[Patrick Williams (composer)|Patrick Williams]]. The title song, \"I Do What I Please\", is played throughout the film, including the opening and closing credits, and the montage of the real Evel Knievel's stunt riding.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American films of 1971]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0067069}}\n* {{Internet Archive film|id=EvelKnievel|name=Evel Knievel}}\n\n{{John Milius}}\n{{Marvin J.

Johansen]] (the [[TBX]] project.)\n}}\n\n'''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' are a [[Belgium|Belgian]] band that rose to prominence in the mid-'80s. Their [[Belgium|Belgian]] origins and tendency to develop a goth-oriented, synthetic, gloomy universe with low-pitched voices - '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' could translate by ''\"Black/Dark Poetry\"'' - had them categorized as [[Electronic body music|EBM]] such as other [[Belgium|Belgian]] members of the 1980s [[electronic music]] scene like [[\u00c0;GRUMH...]] or [[A Split-Second]]. However, much in the manner of various renowned [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Electronic body music|EBM]] bands like [[The Neon Judgement]] and, to some extent, [[Front 242]], they declared, through their music,\na will to step away from the usual [[industrial music|industrial]] aggressiveness that characterized [[Electronic body music]] and developed a more [[mainstream]] accessible dark pop sound that helped them to be regarded as plain [[New wave music|new wave]] or [[Darkwave]].<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/articles/div-GermanArticle/index.html Translation of a German article about the band's influences]</ref><ref>[http://www.lastfm.fr/music/+noredirect/poesie+noire Po\u00e9sie Noire short review at last.fm]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Band Members===\n\nInitially based on seven members, Po\u00e9sie Noire rapidly boiled down to just three hardcore members so as to be finally incarnated by [[Johan Casters]] aka ''\"La B\u00eate Noire\"'' - ''\"The Black/Dark Beast\"'' - (writer, composer and main male singer of the band),  [[Marianne Valvekens]] (co-writer, female vocalist up to the 1991 '''''Marianne''''' album  - and then back on '''''Sense Of Purpose''''' - and keyboard player) and [[Herman Gillis]] (co-writer and mainly the band's guitar player.) As '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' 's fanbase grew along the years, [[Johan Casters|Johan]] and [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] were soon to be given ''\"status nicknames\"'' (probably in tradition of some typically ''\"Goth-spirited\"'' symbolical hierarchy.) Consequently, it did not take long for [[Johan Casters|Casters]] to be considered the band's ''\"Master\"'' to the fans whereas [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] became their ''\"Goddess\"''.\n\nIn 1991, Irish vocalist [[Evanna]] joined the band for the '''''Marianne''''' album because producer [[Ludo Camberlin]] didn't feel [[Marianne Valverken|Marianne]]'s voice was right for the album and [[Evanna]]'s had more warmth and soul to it.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/faq/index.html Marianne and Jo answer to FAQ's]</ref><ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/band/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's band members]</ref>\n\n===Career summary===\n\nVery little is known about how the band actually started their career in music. Nevertheless, they are known to have won the 1985 Breekend Rock Festival (a long-lasting, reputed festival set in [[Bree, Belgium]] that hosted large amounts of prestigious bands such as [[The Smiths]] in 1984 or even [[Slade]] in 2009<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/venue/breekend-festival-bree-belgium-13d60da1.html The Smiths and Slade at Breekend Festival]</ref>) This domestic victory probably played a part in giving the band a flattering reputation because the following year, Po\u00e9sie Noire started supporting [[Dead Can Dance]]<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/giglist/19860521/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire supporting Dead Can Dance]</ref>\nand [[The Sisters of Mercy]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} on tour, seizing this great opportunity of getting in touch with those huge [[post-punk]], [[goth rock]] bands' audiences to display their own musical conception of darkness to them and have personal gigs set up in the meantime.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/introduction/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's Official Site : Introduction]</ref>\nAlong their years as Po\u00e9sie Noire, the band demonstrated qualities as a prolific act with intensive releases : in just seven years, [[Johan Casters|Casters]], [[Marianne Valvekens|Valvekens]] and [[Herman Gillis|Gillis]] offered their fans 9 albums and mini-albums, 2 official ''best of compilation'', 1 remix compilation and 15 singles which allowed them to appear on various [[Electronic body music|EBM]] or [[New wave music|new wave]] compilations and become genuine figures of the kind throughout their sphere of influence.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/php/disco.php?typeofrecord=A Po\u00e9sie Noire Official Site : Albums and Mini Albums Section]</ref><ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/php/disco.php?typeofrecord=S Po\u00e9sie Noire Official Site : Singles Section]</ref><ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/compilations/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire Official Site : Compilations Section]</ref>\n\n===TBX===\n\nBy 1992, it seems the relations between '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' and their label, Antler-Subway, were not as sound as they used to. Indeed, the record label promised the band they would release yet another album of the band's composition entitled '''''Delirious''''' but this never happened and Antler-Subway finally released [[Johan Casters|Jo]], [[Herman Gillis|Herman]] and newcomer [[Evanna]] from their recording contract instead.\n\nWith the help of [[Ludo Camberlin]] aka Carl S. Johansen, who had been their producer since the 1989 album '''''Love is Colder than Death''''',<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/band/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's band members]</ref> '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' changed their name to [[TBX]] (''\"To Be eXcited\"'', that is) and signed to larger label [[EMI]] Belgium that enabled them to release this '''''Delirious''''' album which had been the source of so many issues and changes. But unfortunately for the band, this ''\"new beginning\"'' rapidly ended up unsuccessful - because the band's ''\"music [was not] meant for [the] mass consumption [that ''[[EMI]]'' was used to aiming at]\"'', their official site explains  - and led [[EMI]] Belgium to delete [[TBX]] from their catalog promptly afterwards.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/introduction/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's Official Site : Introduction]</ref> Consequently, for '''Po\u00e9sie Noire/TBX''', the bell tolled although they finally returned in 2010 with a new album, '''''Sense Of Purpose'''''.\n\n===Sense Of Purpose===\n\nMore than a decade after the band split, they formed again and started working on a new album, '''''Sense Of Purpose''''',<ref>[http://www.e-musique.com/music/poesie-noire-sense-of-purpose/ e-musique's article about the release of \"Sense of Purpose\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210143634/http://www.e-musique.com/music/poesie-noire-sense-of-purpose/ |date=2010-12-10 }}</ref> finally released in October 2010 under the name that made them famous, '''Po\u00e9sie Noire'''.\n\nThe release of this new opus went along with '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' taking part in the Sinner's Day festival,<ref>[http://www.sinnersday.com/content/line-up Line-up of Sinner's Day festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907163328/http://www.sinnersday.com/content/line-up |date=2010-09-07 }}</ref> on October 31, 2010, together with such prestigious artists as [[Heaven 17]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Marc Almond]], [[The Psychedelic Furs]], [[Echo & the Bunnymen]], [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]], [[The Selecter]], [[Department S (TV series)|Department S]], [[Marky Ramone]], [[Jah Wobble]] or [[Young Gods]].\n\n==Side-Projects and Aftermath==\n\nAfter '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' disbanded, their members carried on musical projects they had been involved in while the band was active, developed new ones or radically turned over a new leaf.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/sideprojects/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire Side Projects]</ref>\n\n===Johan Casters===\n\nUsing different aliases (Morton, Joey Morton, Pateke Morton, Ilya Dimitrijevic,Jill (or Jille) Johnson or Alessandro Di Ravo), [[Johan Casters]] has extensively served as a writer, producer and even remixer or editor for various acts and artists. He has developed personal projects from the late 1980s onwards, either alone or with [[Herman Gillis]].\n\nAs a producer or executive producer, [[Johan Casters|Jo]] has been involved in several obscure projects such as [[The Passion of a Primitif]], [[Company of State]], [[Men 2nd]], [[In Sotto Voce]], [[Attrition (band)|Attrition]], [[Ei Mori]], [[Bulgarka]], [[Danse Macabre (music)|Danse Macabre]], [[Pussy Jew]], [[Dee Bass]], [[Translator (music)|Translator]], [[Minimalistix]], [[Orion Too feat. Caitlin]], [[Roxane (music)|Roxane]] and [[Biba Binoche]].\n\nAs a remixer or editor, once again, [[Johan Casters|Jo]] has linked up with a large selection of artists from very obscure to popular favourites as proved by the following list : [[The Neon Judgement]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], [[The Weathermen (Belgian band)|The Weathermen]], [[Jean-Jacques Smoothie]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]].\n\nThough [[Johan Casters|Jo]] and [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] seem to go on making music together, [[Johan Casters|Jo]] was known, in the late 1990s, to be working in the field of important musical events coordination and then as [[A&R]] for the Roadrunner turned Mostiko<ref>[http://www.mostiko.be/ Mostiko]</ref>  division of [[Arcade/CNR]].\n\n===Johan Casters and Herman Gillis (and sometimes, Marianne)===\n\nWhile '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' was still active, [[Johan Casters|Jo]] and [[Herman Gillis|Herman]] have been involved as writers and composers in the full or partial development of original or pre-existing projects (with the occasional help of [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]]). The two of them usually worked together though, every once in a while, only one of them would be involved. The massive list of projects the two happen to be behind includes [[In Sotto Voce]], [[Brothers on Acid]], [[Ei Mori]], [[Bulgarka]], [[Trio Balkana]], [[Fruit of Life (music)|Fruit of Life]], [[Erotic Dissidents]], [[Mission Impossible (music)|Mission Impossible]], [[The Brothers (music)|The Brothers]], [[Morton, Sherman and Bellucci]], [[Danse Macabre (music)|Danse Macabre]], [[Opium Monks]], [[Berliner Meisterschaft]], [[The Secrets of China]], [[Kings of Agreppo]], [[Explorers of the Nile]], [[Taste of Sugar feat. K. Finley]], [[TNT Clan]], [[The New Beat Sensation]], [[Msb Sound System]], [[Beat Professor]], [[The Freak Brothers]], [[Student Fashion]], [[Mr. Horse (music)|Mr. Horse]], [[Subway's new Acid House Techno Beat]], [[Balearic Beach]], [[M.S.B.]], [[Supernova (music)|Supernova]], [[Brotherhood of Sleep]], [[The Moneymakers]], [[The Airplane Crashers]], [[Voor Den Broode]], [[German Beat Syndrome]], [[Neue Beat Collectione]], [[Matt's Phantasy Club]], [[Serious ft.JJ Maurie]],  [[Boris Mikulic]], [[J.E.T.]], [[Strictly Nervous]].\n\n===Herman Gillis===\n\nSimilarly to [[Johan Casters|Casters]], while he was already busy co-writing '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' tracks and playing the guitar on them, [[Herman Gillis|Herman]] made sure to develop parallel activities as a producer, writer, composer, programmer and musician using, like his fellow singer, multiple nicknames : Sherman, Herman Sherman, Boris Mikulic and Tessa Rossa. Those activities can be traced back to 1987 until 1994.\n\nAmong the projects he worked for as a writer or co-writer, one should note that he regularly assumed the position of a musician in some of them and took care of programming, keyboards and guitar-playing. Included in this category are [[The Passion of a Primitif]] (1987), [[Company of State]] (1987; 1988), [[In Sotto Voce]] - actually, a genuine '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' side-project posing as a Yugoslavian act. It was incarnated by [[Johan Casters|Jo]] and [[Herman Gillis|Herman]], respectively pretending to be Ilya Dimitrijevic and Boris Mikulic.

Among the acts produced by him - either with or without [[Johan Casters|Jo]], once again - one can point out : [[Ei Mori]] (1988), [[Bulgarka]] (1988), [[Danse Macabre (music)|Danse Macabre]] (1988), [[Boris Mikulic]] (1990), [[Spectralyzer]] (1991), [[Trance Too]] (1991), [[Volt (music)|Volt]] (1993-1994) or [[Hypnotyz]] (199?).\n\n[[Herman Gillis]] is also reputed for working on a first hand-made filter known as the [[Sherman Filterbank]]<ref>[http://www.sherman.be/ Sherman Filterbank website]</ref> used by many renowned artists such as [[Air (French band)|Air]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] or [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/band/Herman/index.html Herman Gillis]</ref> After the band [[Volt (music)|Volt]] he was involved in split up, [[Herman Gillis|Gillis]] decided he would resign from the music scene and dedicate his energy to the conception of electronic filters and effect boxes of the same kind.\n\n===Marianne Valvekens===\n<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/faq/index.html Marianne and Jo answer to FAQ's]</ref>\n\nContrarily to Jo and Hermann, it seems that record production was never an ambition to Marianne which did not stop her from lending her voice to other '''Po\u00e9sie Noire'''-related projects - being sometimes credited as [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne ''\"the Ice Queen\"'' Valvekens]] - and taking part in the writing and composing of other projects, as well.\n\nAs a vocalist, [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]], along with [[Johan Casters|Jo]], took part in the 1986 '''''Mijn-Alarm''''' (''\"Mine-Alarm\"'' in Dutch) project which consisted in gathering the singers from 19 Belgian bands such as [[The Scabs]], [[The Pop Gun]] or [[Siglo XX (band)|Siglo XX]]: each of them were to sing a couple lines from the project's song so as to produce a record whose goal was to raise money for the [[Limburg, Belgium|Limburg]] mineworkers. Later, in 2001, she also gave her voice to [[M&M Project feat.M]]'s ''''''Wide anthem (Sometimes It Hurt)''''' - the final '\"M\"' stood for [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] - one of the many [[Johan Casters|Johan]]-related projects she contributed to also as a writer-composer.\n\nWhen she assumed those positions, [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] used two pseudonyms - Laura Furia and Mateke Porton - which she signed several contributions to various projects with : '''''Strictly Nervous, A Collection Of Acid Jazz - Jazzy House - Jazz Dance''''' (1993), [[M&M Project feat.M]]'s ''''''Wide anthem (Sometimes It Hurt)''''' (2001), [[Orion Too feat.Caitlin]]'s '''''Hope and Wait''''' (2002), '''''So Shy''''' (2002),'''''Travelling''''' (2003) and '''''Making Love For The First Time''''' (2003), [[Biba Binoche]]'s '''''Je Chante pour toi''''' (2004) and [[X3 vs Francis Goya]]'s '''''Rain, the guitar song''''' (2003).\n\nAround 2003, she was also said to be writing a book but no further piece of news has ever surfaced about it since then.\n\nHowever, it seems that from the late 1990s onwards, [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]]'s main occupation has been as a worker in some kind of employment agency.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/introduction/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's official site introduction]</ref>\n\n===Evanna===\n\nAfter her '''Po\u00e9sie Noire/TBX''' years, it seems [[Evanna]] has not been heard of again in the music-making business\n\n===Ludo Camberlin/Carl S.

Their [[Belgium|Belgian]] origins and tendency to develop a goth-oriented, synthetic, gloomy universe with low-pitched voices - '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' could translate by ''\"Black/Dark Poetry\"'' - had them categorized as [[Electronic body music|EBM]] such as other [[Belgium|Belgian]] members of the 1980s [[electronic music]] scene like [[\u00c0;GRUMH...]] or [[A Split-Second]]. However, much in the manner of various renowned [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[Electronic body music|EBM]] bands like [[The Neon Judgement]] and, to some extent, [[Front 242]], they declared, through their music,\na will to step away from the usual [[industrial music|industrial]] aggressiveness that characterized [[Electronic body music]] and developed a more [[mainstream]] accessible dark pop sound that helped them to be regarded as plain [[New wave music|new wave]] or [[Darkwave]].<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/articles/div-GermanArticle/index.html Translation of a German article about the band's influences]</ref><ref>[http://www.lastfm.fr/music/+noredirect/poesie+noire Po\u00e9sie Noire short review at last.fm]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Band Members===\n\nInitially based on seven members, Po\u00e9sie Noire rapidly boiled down to just three hardcore members so as to be finally incarnated by [[Johan Casters]] aka ''\"La B\u00eate Noire\"'' - ''\"The Black/Dark Beast\"'' - (writer, composer and main male singer of the band),  [[Marianne Valvekens]] (co-writer, female vocalist up to the 1991 '''''Marianne''''' album  - and then back on '''''Sense Of Purpose''''' - and keyboard player) and [[Herman Gillis]] (co-writer and mainly the band's guitar player.) As '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' 's fanbase grew along the years, [[Johan Casters|Johan]] and [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] were soon to be given ''\"status nicknames\"'' (probably in tradition of some typically ''\"Goth-spirited\"'' symbolical hierarchy.) Consequently, it did not take long for [[Johan Casters|Casters]] to be considered the band's ''\"Master\"'' to the fans whereas [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] became their ''\"Goddess\"''.\n\nIn 1991, Irish vocalist [[Evanna]] joined the band for the '''''Marianne''''' album because producer [[Ludo Camberlin]] didn't feel [[Marianne Valverken|Marianne]]'s voice was right for the album and [[Evanna]]'s had more warmth and soul to it.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/faq/index.html Marianne and Jo answer to FAQ's]</ref><ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/band/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's band members]</ref>\n\n===Career summary===\n\nVery little is known about how the band actually started their career in music. Nevertheless, they are known to have won the 1985 Breekend Rock Festival (a long-lasting, reputed festival set in [[Bree, Belgium]] that hosted large amounts of prestigious bands such as [[The Smiths]] in 1984 or even [[Slade]] in 2009<ref>[http://www.setlist.fm/venue/breekend-festival-bree-belgium-13d60da1.html The Smiths and Slade at Breekend Festival]</ref>) This domestic victory probably played a part in giving the band a flattering reputation because the following year, Po\u00e9sie Noire started supporting [[Dead Can Dance]]<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/giglist/19860521/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire supporting Dead Can Dance]</ref>\nand [[The Sisters of Mercy]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} on tour, seizing this great opportunity of getting in touch with those huge [[post-punk]], [[goth rock]] bands' audiences to display their own musical conception of darkness to them and have personal gigs set up in the meantime.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/introduction/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's Official Site : Introduction]</ref>\nAlong their years as Po\u00e9sie Noire, the band demonstrated qualities as a prolific act with intensive releases : in just seven years, [[Johan Casters|Casters]], [[Marianne Valvekens|Valvekens]] and [[Herman Gillis|Gillis]] offered their fans 9 albums and mini-albums, 2 official ''best of compilation'', 1 remix compilation and 15 singles which allowed them to appear on various [[Electronic body music|EBM]] or [[New wave music|new wave]] compilations and become genuine figures of the kind throughout their sphere of influence.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/php/disco.php?typeofrecord=A Po\u00e9sie Noire Official Site : Albums and Mini Albums Section]</ref><ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/php/disco.php?typeofrecord=S Po\u00e9sie Noire Official Site : Singles Section]</ref><ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/compilations/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire Official Site : Compilations Section]</ref>\n\n===TBX===\n\nBy 1992, it seems the relations between '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' and their label, Antler-Subway, were not as sound as they used to. Indeed, the record label promised the band they would release yet another album of the band's composition entitled '''''Delirious''''' but this never happened and Antler-Subway finally released [[Johan Casters|Jo]], [[Herman Gillis|Herman]] and newcomer [[Evanna]] from their recording contract instead.\n\nWith the help of [[Ludo Camberlin]] aka Carl S. Johansen, who had been their producer since the 1989 album '''''Love is Colder than Death''''',<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/band/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's band members]</ref> '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' changed their name to [[TBX]] (''\"To Be eXcited\"'', that is) and signed to larger label [[EMI]] Belgium that enabled them to release this '''''Delirious''''' album which had been the source of so many issues and changes. But unfortunately for the band, this ''\"new beginning\"'' rapidly ended up unsuccessful - because the band's ''\"music [was not] meant for [the] mass consumption [that ''[[EMI]]'' was used to aiming at]\"'', their official site explains  - and led [[EMI]] Belgium to delete [[TBX]] from their catalog promptly afterwards.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/introduction/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's Official Site : Introduction]</ref> Consequently, for '''Po\u00e9sie Noire/TBX''', the bell tolled although they finally returned in 2010 with a new album, '''''Sense Of Purpose'''''.\n\n===Sense Of Purpose===\n\nMore than a decade after the band split, they formed again and started working on a new album, '''''Sense Of Purpose''''',<ref>[http://www.e-musique.com/music/poesie-noire-sense-of-purpose/ e-musique's article about the release of \"Sense of Purpose\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210143634/http://www.e-musique.com/music/poesie-noire-sense-of-purpose/ |date=2010-12-10 }}</ref> finally released in October 2010 under the name that made them famous, '''Po\u00e9sie Noire'''.\n\nThe release of this new opus went along with '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' taking part in the Sinner's Day festival,<ref>[http://www.sinnersday.com/content/line-up Line-up of Sinner's Day festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907163328/http://www.sinnersday.com/content/line-up |date=2010-09-07 }}</ref> on October 31, 2010, together with such prestigious artists as [[Heaven 17]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Marc Almond]], [[The Psychedelic Furs]], [[Echo & the Bunnymen]], [[Peter Murphy (musician)|Peter Murphy]], [[The Selecter]], [[Department S (TV series)|Department S]], [[Marky Ramone]], [[Jah Wobble]] or [[Young Gods]].\n\n==Side-Projects and Aftermath==\n\nAfter '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' disbanded, their members carried on musical projects they had been involved in while the band was active, developed new ones or radically turned over a new leaf.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/sideprojects/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire Side Projects]</ref>\n\n===Johan Casters===\n\nUsing different aliases (Morton, Joey Morton, Pateke Morton, Ilya Dimitrijevic,Jill (or Jille) Johnson or Alessandro Di Ravo), [[Johan Casters]] has extensively served as a writer, producer and even remixer or editor for various acts and artists. He has developed personal projects from the late 1980s onwards, either alone or with [[Herman Gillis]].\n\nAs a producer or executive producer, [[Johan Casters|Jo]] has been involved in several obscure projects such as [[The Passion of a Primitif]], [[Company of State]], [[Men 2nd]], [[In Sotto Voce]], [[Attrition (band)|Attrition]], [[Ei Mori]], [[Bulgarka]], [[Danse Macabre (music)|Danse Macabre]], [[Pussy Jew]], [[Dee Bass]], [[Translator (music)|Translator]], [[Minimalistix]], [[Orion Too feat. Caitlin]], [[Roxane (music)|Roxane]] and [[Biba Binoche]].\n\nAs a remixer or editor, once again, [[Johan Casters|Jo]] has linked up with a large selection of artists from very obscure to popular favourites as proved by the following list : [[The Neon Judgement]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]], [[The Weathermen (Belgian band)|The Weathermen]], [[Jean-Jacques Smoothie]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]].\n\nThough [[Johan Casters|Jo]] and [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] seem to go on making music together, [[Johan Casters|Jo]] was known, in the late 90's, to be working in the field of important musical events coordination and then as [[A&R]] for the Roadrunner turned Mostiko<ref>[http://www.mostiko.be/ Mostiko]</ref>  division of [[Arcade/CNR]].\n\n===Johan Casters and Herman Gillis (and sometimes, Marianne)===\n\nWhile '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' was still active, [[Johan Casters|Jo]] and [[Herman Gillis|Herman]] have been involved as writers and composers in the full or partial development of original or pre-existing projects (with the occasional help of [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]]). The two of them usually worked together though, every once in a while, only one of them would be involved. The massive list of projects the two happen to be behind includes [[In Sotto Voce]], [[Brothers on Acid]], [[Ei Mori]], [[Bulgarka]], [[Trio Balkana]], [[Fruit of Life (music)|Fruit of Life]], [[Erotic Dissidents]], [[Mission Impossible (music)|Mission Impossible]], [[The Brothers (music)|The Brothers]], [[Morton, Sherman and Bellucci]], [[Danse Macabre (music)|Danse Macabre]], [[Opium Monks]], [[Berliner Meisterschaft]], [[The Secrets of China]], [[Kings of Agreppo]], [[Explorers of the Nile]], [[Taste of Sugar feat. K. Finley]], [[TNT Clan]], [[The New Beat Sensation]], [[Msb Sound System]], [[Beat Professor]], [[The Freak Brothers]], [[Student Fashion]], [[Mr. Horse (music)|Mr. Horse]], [[Subway's new Acid House Techno Beat]], [[Balearic Beach]], [[M.S.B.]], [[Supernova (music)|Supernova]], [[Brotherhood of Sleep]], [[The Moneymakers]], [[The Airplane Crashers]], [[Voor Den Broode]], [[German Beat Syndrome]], [[Neue Beat Collectione]], [[Matt's Phantasy Club]], [[Serious ft.JJ Maurie]],  [[Boris Mikulic]], [[J.E.T.]], [[Strictly Nervous]].\n\n===Herman Gillis===\n\nSimilarly to [[Johan Casters|Casters]], while he was already busy co-writing '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' tracks and playing the guitar on them, [[Herman Gillis|Herman]] made sure to develop parallel activities as a producer, writer, composer, programmer and musician using, like his fellow singer, multiple nicknames : Sherman, Herman Sherman, Boris Mikulic and Tessa Rossa. Those activities can be traced back to 1987 until 1994.\n\nAmong the projects he worked for as a writer or co-writer, one should note that he regularly assumed the position of a musician in some of them and took care of programming, keyboards and guitar-playing. Included in this category are [[The Passion of a Primitif]] (1987), [[Company of State]] (1987; 1988), [[In Sotto Voce]] - actually, a genuine '''Po\u00e9sie Noire''' side-project posing as a Yugoslavian act. It was incarnated by [[Johan Casters|Jo]] and [[Herman Gillis|Herman]], respectively pretending to be Ilya Dimitrijevic and Boris Mikulic. The point of creating those bogus identities and launching this project was to give a ''\"response to a belgian journalist who found Po\u00e9sie Noire too \"poppy\" \"'' (the official site claims)  - (1987; 1988; 1989), [[Boris Mikulic]] (1990), [[Volt (music)|Volt]] (formerly known as [[Running Cow]]) (1993)...\n\n[[Herman Gillis|Gillis]], much like [[Johan Casters|Casters]], also remixed or edited recordings by various artists either with or without [[Johan Casters|Jo]] : [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] (1989), [[Take 6 (music)|Take 6]] and [[Take 7]] (19??), [[DWF (music)|DWF]] (1990), [[Wire (band)|Wire]]...\n\nProducing records soon got [[Herman Gillis|Herman]] interested and he quickly had his own production company set up : [[Sherman Productions]]. Among the acts produced by him - either with or without [[Johan Casters|Jo]], once again - one can point out : [[Ei Mori]] (1988), [[Bulgarka]] (1988), [[Danse Macabre (music)|Danse Macabre]] (1988), [[Boris Mikulic]] (1990), [[Spectralyzer]] (1991), [[Trance Too]] (1991), [[Volt (music)|Volt]] (1993-1994) or [[Hypnotyz]] (199?).\n\n[[Herman Gillis]] is also reputed for working on a first hand-made filter known as the [[Sherman Filterbank]]<ref>[http://www.sherman.be/ Sherman Filterbank website]</ref> used by many renowned artists such as [[Air (French band)|Air]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] or [[The Rolling Stones]].<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/band/Herman/index.html Herman Gillis]</ref> After the band [[Volt (music)|Volt]] he was involved in split up, [[Herman Gillis|Gillis]] decided he would resign from the music scene and dedicate his energy to the conception of electronic filters and effect boxes of the same kind.\n\n===Marianne Valvekens===\n<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/faq/index.html Marianne and Jo answer to FAQ's]</ref>\n\nContrarily to Jo and Hermann, it seems that record production was never an ambition to Marianne which did not stop her from lending her voice to other '''Po\u00e9sie Noire'''-related projects - being sometimes credited as [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne ''\"the Ice Queen\"'' Valvekens]] - and taking part in the writing and composing of other projects, as well.\n\nAs a vocalist, [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]], along with [[Johan Casters|Jo]], took part in the 1986 '''''Mijn-Alarm''''' (''\"Mine-Alarm\"'' in Dutch) project which consisted in gathering the singers from 19 Belgian bands such as [[The Scabs]], [[The Pop Gun]] or [[Siglo XX (band)|Siglo XX]]: each of them were to sing a couple lines from the project's song so as to produce a record whose goal was to raise money for the [[Limburg, Belgium|Limburg]] mineworkers. Later, in 2001, she also gave her voice to [[M&M Project feat.M]]'s ''''''Wide anthem (Sometimes It Hurt)''''' - the final '\"M\"' stood for [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] - one of the many [[Johan Casters|Johan]]-related projects she contributed to also as a writer-composer.\n\nWhen she assumed those positions, [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]] used two pseudonyms - Laura Furia and Mateke Porton - which she signed several contributions to various projects with : '''''Strictly Nervous, A Collection Of Acid Jazz - Jazzy House - Jazz Dance''''' (1993), [[M&M Project feat.M]]'s ''''''Wide anthem (Sometimes It Hurt)''''' (2001), [[Orion Too feat.Caitlin]]'s '''''Hope and Wait''''' (2002), '''''So Shy''''' (2002),'''''Travelling''''' (2003) and '''''Making Love For The First Time''''' (2003), [[Biba Binoche]]'s '''''Je Chante pour toi''''' (2004) and [[X3 vs Francis Goya]]'s '''''Rain, the guitar song''''' (2003).\n\nAround 2003, she was also said to be writing a book but no further piece of news has ever surfaced about it since then.\n\nHowever, it seems that from the late 1990s onwards, [[Marianne Valvekens|Marianne]]'s main occupation has been as a worker in some kind of employment agency.<ref>[http://www.poesienoire.com/introduction/index.html Po\u00e9sie Noire's official site introduction]</ref>\n\n===Evanna===\n\nAfter her '''Po\u00e9sie Noire/TBX''' years, it seems [[Evanna]] has not been heard of again in the music-making business\n\n===Ludo Camberlin/Carl S. Johansen===\n\nWhile living the '''Po\u00e9sie Noire/TBX''' episode, [[Ludo Camberlin]] also worked as a producer on projects affiliated with [[Johan Casters|Jo]] ([[Attrition (band)|Attrition]]) and has kept producing other influential members of the [[Belgium|Belgian]] music scene such as [[The Lords of Acid]] ever since.
