It is surrounded by water on three sides, the [[Arthur Kill]], a [[tidal strait]] to the east, and [[tidal river]]s to the south, [[Raritan River]], and north, [[Rahway River]]; and, much of the developed land in Woodbridge has low elevations, as little as five feet above sea level.

Woodbridge streams and rivers have been described as having a \"high flow, flashy nature.\" The land is relatively impervious, and flooding is exacerbated by steep slopes and urban cover. Flooding in the South Branch Rahway River and [[Pumpkin Patch Brook]] hazard zones is predominantly fluvial.  Prolonged coastal storms ([[nor'easters]]), which combine tidal and fluvial flooding, along with flow constrictions, cause an increase in the duration of flooding of the [[Woodbridge River]] and its tributaries, [[Heards Brook]] and [[Wedgewood Brook]], which may last for days before water levels subside.<ref name=:\"S\"/> Frequency of flooding has increased over time. Sea levels are rising and residential areas have moved into previous marsh land, decreasing the ability of the land to absorb excess water.

It is surrounded by water on three sides, the [[Arthur Kill]], a [[tidal strait]] to the east, and [[tidal river]]s to the south, [[Raritan River]], and north, [[Rahway River]]; and, much of the developed land in Woodbridge has low elevations, as little as five feet above sea level.

Woodbridge streams and rivers have been described as having a \"high flow, flashy nature.\" The land is relatively impervious, and flooding is exacerbated by steep slopes and urban cover. Flooding in the South Branch Rahway River and [[Pumpkin Patch Brook]] hazard zones is predominantly fluvial.  Prolonged coastal storms ([[nor'easters]]), which combine tidal and fluvial flooding, along with flow constrictions, cause an increase in the duration of flooding of the [[Woodbridge River]] and its tributaries, [[Heards Brook]] and [[Wedgewood Brook]], which may last for days before water levels subside.<ref name=:\"S\"/> Frequency of flooding has increased over time. Sea levels are rising and residential areas have moved into previous marsh land, decreasing the ability of the land to absorb excess water.

The film was inspired by the 2003 American [[superhero film]] ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]''. ''Athisayan'' marked the debut of [[Bollywood]] actor Jackie Shroff in Malayalam cinema. The film was dubbed and released in Hindi as ''Naya Ajooba'' in 2009.The film was a great hit in malayalam cinema History. \n\n\n\n<br />\n\n==Plot==\nMaya ([[Kavya Madhavan]]),a young television reporter, works for New India Television. Radharamanan ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]), the Managing Director of the channel, has a fascination for Maya, who was brought up in an orphanage by Father Chanthakkadan ([[Thilakan]]).  Maya takes up the responsibility of bringing up a few orphans whom she has picked up from the streets. One of these kids is Devan (Master Murali K), who is sort of a child prodigy, with a computer-like mind and very good in studies and extra-curricular activities. R. C. Shekhar ([[Jackie Shroff]]), a scientist, lives very near their house, with his servant Damodaran ([[Harisree Ashokan]]). He is working on a project, which could help in making human beings invisible. On the very day that he successfully experiments his 'magic' [[potion]] on a rabbit, he is urgently called to the [[United States|U.S]] as his daughter, who is studying there, meets with an accident.\n\nMeanwhile, Maya's friend and lover Roy ([[Jayasurya]]), also a journalist, is in jail after having been framed in a murder case by some influential politicians including the State Revenue Minister Divakaran ([[Rajan P. Dev]]), another minister Yunus Kunju (Ramu), the Police Commissioner Shanmughan ([[Bheeman Raghu]]) and the very influential Kuwait Nazar ([[Devan (actor)|Devan]]). With the help of the newly appointed Collector Anita Williams ([[Karthika Mathew|Murali Bhai]]), Maya shoots a video of these baddies accepting millions of rupees as commission from some Arab businessmen, who are there to sign some business deals with the State Government.\nMaya immediately goes to Radharamanan and shows him the clip. Radharamanan is thrilled and agrees to telecast it, after discussing it with the Board of Directors. Somehow Nazar, Divakaran and others come to know of this and they go after Maya, in order to get from her the memory card containing the clipping. On the very same day that R.C.Shekhar goes to the U.S, Maya is [[Kidnapping|abducted]] by Nazar and group. The kids are baffled. Anita Williams, Father Chanthakkadan and Radharamanan know who are behind this, but nothing can be done without sufficient evidence. And then Devan, who had seen R.C. Shekhar conducting the experiment on the rabbit, steals into Shekhar's lab and drinks the potion. He becomes invisible and sets out to save Maya.\n\nDevan did manage to save Maya, but when yunus tries to shoot Maya, Devan comes in between and gets shot. Due to the potion he gets saved but as side effect of getting shot(which Shekhar warns no metallic objects should make a scratch on him) he turns into a gigantic monster and kills those who has done wrong to him and his family. After killing the baddies, Devan leaves Maya and the children and makes his abode in the deep ocean, with an end note saying that \"to fight for the Justice, Devan will come back as Athisayan\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]] as Managing Director Radharamanan\n* Master Devadas as Devan\n* [[Kavya Madhavan]] as Reporter Maya\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Scientist Sekhar\n* [[Karthika Mathew|Karthika]] as District Collector Anitha Williams\n* [[Jagadish]] as News-reader Koshy\n* [[Harisree Ashokan]] as Servant Damodaran\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as Kuwait Nazar\n* [[Thilakan]] as Fr.

The film was dubbed and released in Hindi as ''Naya Ajooba'' in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vijsonfilms.com/films/naya_ajooma.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504121652/http://vijsonfilms.com/films/naya_ajooma.htm |archivedate=4 May 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nMaya ([[Kavya Madhavan]]),a young television reporter, works for New India Television. Radharamanan ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]), the Managing Director of the channel, has a fascination for Maya, who was brought up in an orphanage by Father Chanthakkadan ([[Thilakan]]).  Maya takes up the responsibility of bringing up a few orphans whom she has picked up from the streets. One of these kids is Devan (Master Murali K), who is sort of a child prodigy, with a computer-like mind and very good in studies and extra-curricular activities. R. C. Shekhar ([[Jackie Shroff]]), a scientist, lives very near their house, with his servant Damodaran ([[Harisree Ashokan]]). He is working on a project, which could help in making human beings invisible. On the very day that he successfully experiments his 'magic' [[potion]] on a rabbit, he is urgently called to the [[United States|U.S]] as his daughter, who is studying there, meets with an accident.\n\nMeanwhile, Maya's friend and lover Roy ([[Jayasurya]]), also a journalist, is in jail after having been framed in a murder case by some influential politicians including the State Revenue Minister Divakaran ([[Rajan P. Dev]]), another minister Yunus Kunju (Ramu), the Police Commissioner Shanmughan ([[Bheeman Raghu]]) and the very influential Kuwait Nazar ([[Devan (actor)|Devan]]). With the help of the newly appointed Collector Anita Williams ([[Karthika Mathew|Murali Bhai]]), Maya shoots a video of these baddies accepting millions of rupees as commission from some Arab businessmen, who are there to sign some business deals with the State Government.\nMaya immediately goes to Radharamanan and shows him the clip. Radharamanan is thrilled and agrees to telecast it, after discussing it with the Board of Directors. Somehow Nazar, Divakaran and others come to know of this and they go after Maya, in order to get from her the memory card containing the clipping. On the very same day that R.C.Shekhar goes to the U.S, Maya is [[Kidnapping|abducted]] by Nazar and group. The kids are baffled. Anita Williams, Father Chanthakkadan and Radharamanan know who are behind this, but nothing can be done without sufficient evidence. And then Devan, who had seen R.C. Shekhar conducting the experiment on the rabbit, steals into Shekhar's lab and drinks the potion. He becomes invisible and sets out to save Maya.\n\nDevan did manage to save Maya, but when yunus tries to shoot Maya, Devan comes in between and gets shot. Due to the potion he gets saved but as side effect of getting shot(which Shekhar warns no metallic objects should make a scratch on him) he turns into a gigantic monster and kills those who has done wrong to him and his family. After killing the baddies, Devan leaves Maya and the children and makes his abode in the deep ocean, with an end note saying that \"to fight for the Justice, Devan will come back as Athisayan\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]] as Managing Director Radharamanan\n* Master Devadas as Devan\n* [[Kavya Madhavan]] as Reporter Maya\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Scientist Sekhar\n* [[Karthika Mathew|Karthika]] as District Collector Anitha Williams\n* [[Jagadish]] as News-reader Koshy\n* [[Harisree Ashokan]] as Servant Damodaran\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as Kuwait Nazar\n* [[Thilakan]] as Fr.

The target audience of the film were school children, whom the makers of the film expected to come in large numbers to the watch the new [[superhero]].\n\n''Athisayan'' was a flop at the box-office, despite the huge promotional activities prior to its release. The evident resemblance to ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' and the comparison to this proved costly for the film.

Many alliances started as only codeshare networks. Cost reductions come from the sharing of sales offices, maintenance facilities, operational facilities (e.g. catering or computer systems), operational staff (e.g. ground handling personnel, at check-in and boarding desks), investments and purchases (e.g. in order to negotiate extra volume discounts). Traveller benefits can include lower prices due to lowered operational costs for a given route, more departure times to choose from on a given route, more destinations within easy reach, shorter travel times as a result of optimised transfers, a wider range of [[airport lounge]]s shared with alliance members, fast track access on all alliance members if having frequent flyer status, faster mileage rewards by earning miles for a single account on several different carriers, [[round-the-world ticket]]s, enabling travellers to fly over the world for a relatively low price.\n\nAirline alliances may also create disadvantages for the traveller, such as higher prices when competition is erased on a certain route or less frequent flights; for instance, if two airlines separately fly three and two times a day respectively on a shared route, their alliance might fly less than 5 (3+2) times a day on the same route. This might be especially true between hub cities for each airline. e.g., flights between [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] (a Delta Air Lines [[fortress hub]]) and [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] (a KLM fortress hub).\n\n===Issues===\nThe ability of an airline to join an alliance may be restricted by laws and regulations or subject to approval by authorities. [[Competition law]] issues must also be considered in some countries.\n\n== History ==\nThe first airline alliance was formed in the 1930s, when [[Panair do Brasil]] and its parent company [[Pan American World Airways]] agreed to exchange routes to [[Latin America]]. In 1990, the African Joint Air Services (AJAS) Accord between Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia led to the launch of Alliance Air in 1994, with South African Airways, Air Tanzania, Uganda Airlines and the governments of Uganda and Tanzania as shareholders.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe first large alliance began in 1989, when [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[KLM]] agreed to large-scale codesharing. In 1992, the Netherlands signed the first [[open skies]] agreement with the United States, in spite of objections from the [[European Union]], which gave both countries unrestricted landing rights on the other's soil. Normally landing rights are granted for a fixed number of flights per week to a fixed destination. Each adjustment requires negotiations, often between governments rather than between the companies involved. In return, the United States granted antitrust immunity to the alliance between Northwest Airlines and KLM. Other alliances would struggle for years to overcome the transnational barriers and lack of antitrust immunity, and still do so.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[Star Alliance]] was founded in 1997,<ref name=\"A new alliance\">{{Cite news|last=BRYANT|first=ADAM|title=United and 4 Others to Detail Air Alliance Today|work=The New York Times|date=14 May 1997|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0071FFC345D0C778DDDAC0894DF494D81|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130132618/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0071FFC345D0C778DDDAC0894DF494D81|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 January 2013|accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> which brought competing airlines to form [[Oneworld]] in 1999 and [[SkyTeam]] in 2000.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 2010 [[Richard Branson]], chairman of the [[Virgin Group]], announced his intention to form a fourth alliance among Virgin branded airlines ([[Virgin Atlantic]]; [[Virgin America]]; and the [[Virgin Australia Holdings]] group of airlines).<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Perman | first = Stacy | date = 2010-09-05\n | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2015353-1,00.html\n | title = Virgin's Richard Branson Circles His Wagons | work = TIME | accessdate = 2011-03-04\n}}</ref> Then in September 2011, Branson said that Virgin Atlantic would join one of the existing alliances;<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonbruner/2011/09/14/virgin-atlantic-will-join-an-alliance-soon-says-richard-branson/\n | title = Virgin Atlantic Will Join an Alliance Soon, Says Richard Branson\n | first = Jon | last = Bruner | date = 2011-09-14 | work = Forbes\n}}</ref> this idea was repeated in October 2012.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/9636203/index.html\n | title = Virgin Atlantic to join global airline alliance, says Branson\n | first = James | last = Quinn | date = 2012-10-26 | work = Telegraph\n}}</ref> In December 2012, Delta Air Lines purchased Singapore Airlines' 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic for \u00a3224 million.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} [[Virgin America]] was absorbed into [[Alaska Airlines]], which is not a member of any alliance, in April 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/virgin-america-flights-become-alaska-next-april-441881/|title=Virgin America flights become Alaska next April|date=2017-10-05|work=Flightglobal.com|access-date=January 2, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nOn February 14, 2013, it was announced that [[American Airlines]] and [[US Airways]] would merge, retaining the American Airlines name and would remain in the Oneworld alliance.

Many alliances started as only codeshare networks. Cost reductions come from the sharing of sales offices, maintenance facilities, operational facilities (e.g. catering or computer systems), operational staff (e.g. ground handling personnel, at check-in and boarding desks), investments and purchases (e.g. in order to negotiate extra volume discounts). Traveller benefits can include lower prices due to lowered operational costs for a given route, more departure times to choose from on a given route, more destinations within easy reach, shorter travel times as a result of optimised transfers, a wider range of [[airport lounge]]s shared with alliance members, fast track access on all alliance members if having frequent flyer status, faster mileage rewards by earning miles for a single account on several different carriers, [[round-the-world ticket]]s, enabling travellers to fly over the world for a relatively low price.\n\nAirline alliances may also create disadvantages for the traveller, such as higher prices when competition is erased on a certain route or less frequent flights; for instance, if two airlines separately fly three and two times a day respectively on a shared route, their alliance might fly less than 5 (3+2) times a day on the same route. This might be especially true between hub cities for each airline. e.g., flights between [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] (a Delta Air Lines [[fortress hub]]) and [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] (a KLM fortress hub).\n\n===Issues===\nThe ability of an airline to join an alliance may be restricted by laws and regulations or subject to approval by authorities. [[Competition law]] issues must also be considered in some countries.\n\n== History ==\nThe first airline alliance was formed in the 1930s, when [[Panair do Brasil]] and its parent company [[Pan American World Airways]] agreed to exchange routes to [[Latin America]]. In 1990, the African Joint Air Services (AJAS) Accord between Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia led to the launch of Alliance Air in 1994, with South African Airways, Air Tanzania, Uganda Airlines and the governments of Uganda and Tanzania as shareholders.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe first large alliance began in 1989, when [[Northwest Airlines]] and [[KLM]] agreed to large-scale codesharing. In 1992, the Netherlands signed the first [[open skies]] agreement with the United States, in spite of objections from the [[European Union]], which gave both countries unrestricted landing rights on the other's soil. Normally landing rights are granted for a fixed number of flights per week to a fixed destination. Each adjustment requires negotiations, often between governments rather than between the companies involved. In return, the United States granted antitrust immunity to the alliance between Northwest Airlines and KLM. Other alliances would struggle for years to overcome the transnational barriers and lack of antitrust immunity, and still do so.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[Star Alliance]] was founded in 1997,<ref name=\"A new alliance\">{{Cite news|last=BRYANT|first=ADAM|title=United and 4 Others to Detail Air Alliance Today|work=The New York Times|date=14 May 1997|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0071FFC345D0C778DDDAC0894DF494D81|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130132618/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0071FFC345D0C778DDDAC0894DF494D81|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 January 2013|accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> which brought competing airlines to form [[Oneworld]] in 1999 and [[SkyTeam]] in 2000.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 2010 [[Richard Branson]], chairman of the [[Virgin Group]], announced his intention to form a fourth alliance among Virgin branded airlines ([[Virgin Atlantic]]; [[Virgin America]]; and the [[Virgin Australia Holdings]] group of airlines).<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Perman | first = Stacy | date = 2010-09-05\n | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2015353-1,00.html\n | title = Virgin's Richard Branson Circles His Wagons | work = TIME | accessdate = 2011-03-04\n}}</ref> Then in September 2011, Branson said that Virgin Atlantic would join one of the existing alliances;<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonbruner/2011/09/14/virgin-atlantic-will-join-an-alliance-soon-says-richard-branson/\n | title = Virgin Atlantic Will Join an Alliance Soon, Says Richard Branson\n | first = Jon | last = Bruner | date = 2011-09-14 | work = Forbes\n}}</ref> this idea was repeated in October 2012.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/9636203/index.html\n | title = Virgin Atlantic to join global airline alliance, says Branson\n | first = James | last = Quinn | date = 2012-10-26 | work = Telegraph\n}}</ref> In December 2012, Delta Air Lines purchased Singapore Airlines' 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic for \u00a3224 million.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} [[Virgin America]] was absorbed into [[Alaska Airlines]], which is not a member of any alliance, in April 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/virgin-america-flights-become-alaska-next-april-441881/|title=Virgin America flights become Alaska next April|date=2017-10-05|work=Flightglobal.com|access-date=January 2, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nOn February 14, 2013, it was announced that [[American Airlines]] and [[US Airways]] would merge, retaining the American Airlines name and would remain in the Oneworld alliance.

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls.

The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies.

[[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} Aurangzeb would enslave rebellious peasants.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=91}} [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king.

However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\n[[Kurds]] in the Ottoman-Persian frontier would enslave both Shias and Yazidis. The Ottoman jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi|Ebu Su'ud]] upheld the permissibility of wars against the Shia but he forbade the taking of Shias as captives. In particular, he also declared that sexual intercourse with Shia female captives was unlawful. However, he endorsed enslavement of Shias in a later fatwa.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=43}} In 1786-7 an Ottoman general enslaved the wives and children of [[Mamluk]] emirs. In the region of modern day [[Chad]], Muslim women and children from [[Sultanate of Bagirmi|Bagirmi]] were enslaved by the ruler of Wadai around 1800.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=44}} \n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her.

The female captives were used sexually. Their Muslim captors asserted that Islamic law allowed them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} Sudan's Arab government had recruited Arab troops.

This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} For example, [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran.

However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists.

His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\nAfter 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]].

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> A prophetic hadith permitted corporal punishment and [[Ibn al-Jawzi]] stated that both slaves and wives should put up with mistreatment.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=24}} The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of this practice.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite. [[Goitein]] says that monogamy was a feature of the \"progressive middle class\" Muslims.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Leila Ahmed|author2=Lail\u0101 \u02bfAbd-al-La\u1e6d\u012bf A\u1e25mad|title=Women and Gender in Islam: Historical Roots of a Modern Debate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0Grq2BzaUgC&pg=PA107|year=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-05583-2|pages=107\u2013}}</ref> Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived as lustful by others.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}} [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], who visited Egypt in the 1830s, noted that very few Egyptian men were polygamous and most of the men with only one wife did not keep concubines, usually for the sake of domestic peace. However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls.

If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims.

His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\nAfter 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic views on slavery]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[What your right hands possess]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Y.

This \u2018discovery-class-of-finding\u2019 by CHACE was achieved by direct in situ measurement of the lunar atmosphere during the descend journey of the MIP to the Lunar South Pole, while M3 discovered water in ice form by remote sensing techniques. As water cannot retain its liquid phase in the lunar environment because of its own vapour pressure and the ultra-high vacuum prevailing there, it can be found in solid (ice) and gaseous (vapour) phases. While the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), a payload by NASA, on board Chandrayaan I lunar orbiter has detected, by mapping almost 97% of the lunar surface using remote sensing techniques, the presence of water in ice form in higher latitudes especially in the polar caps, the CHACE payload in the lunar impactor (MIP) has directly detected water in its gaseous form along 14 degree E meridian from 45 degree N to 90 degree S latitude, with a latitudinal resolution of around 0.10 and altitudinal resolution of ~ 250 m from 98&nbsp;km altitude till impact .\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System|Spaceflight}}\n* [[Chandrayaan-1]]\n* [[LCROSS]]\n* [[List of current and future lunar missions]]\n* [[Lunar water]]\n* [[List of artificial objects on the Moon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Moon spacecraft}}\n{{Indian space programme}}\n{{Indian spacecraft}}\n{{Orbital launches in 2008}}\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 2008]]\n[[Category:2008 in India]]\n[[Category:2008 in science]]\n[[Category:ISRO space probes]]\n[[Category:Missions to the Moon]]\n[[Category:Destroyed space probes]]\n[[Category:Indian lunar exploration programme]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft that impacted the Moon]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched by PSLV rockets]]\n[[Category:Impactor spacecraft]]\n[[Category:LQ30 quadrangle]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Chandrayaan-1-MIP1.jpg|thumb|Moon Impact Probe being integrated with Chandrayaan-1 orbiter]]\n[[File:Chandrayaan-1-MIP2.jpg|thumb|Moon Impact Probe being worked on before integration with orbiter]]\nThe '''Moon Impact Probe''' ('''MIP''') developed by the [[Indian Space Research Organisation|Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)]], [[India]]'s national space agency, was a [[moon|lunar]] probe that was released by ISRO's [[Chandrayaan-1]] [[Exploration of the Moon|lunar remote sensing]] orbiter which in turn was launched, on 22 October 2008, aboard a modified version of ISRO's [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]].

This \u2018discovery-class-of-finding\u2019 by CHACE was achieved by direct in situ measurement of the lunar atmosphere during the descend journey of the MIP to the Lunar South Pole, while M3 discovered water in ice form by remote sensing techniques. As water cannot retain its liquid phase in the lunar environment because of its own vapour pressure and the ultra-high vacuum prevailing there, it can be found in solid (ice) and gaseous (vapour) phases. While the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), a payload by NASA, on board Chandrayaan I lunar orbiter has detected, by mapping almost 97% of the lunar surface using remote sensing techniques, the presence of water in ice form in higher latitudes especially in the polar caps, the CHACE payload in the lunar impactor (MIP) has directly detected water in its gaseous form along 14 degree E meridian from 45 degree N to 90 degree S latitude, with a latitudinal resolution of around 0.10 and altitudinal resolution of ~ 250 m from 98&nbsp;km altitude till impact .\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Solar System|Spaceflight}}\n* [[Chandrayaan-1]]\n* [[LCROSS]]\n* [[List of current and future lunar missions]]\n* [[Lunar water]]\n* [[List of artificial objects on the Moon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Moon spacecraft}}\n{{Indian space programme}}\n{{Indian spacecraft}}\n{{Orbital launches in 2008}}\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched in 2008]]\n[[Category:2008 in India]]\n[[Category:2008 in science]]\n[[Category:ISRO space probes]]\n[[Category:Missions to the Moon]]\n[[Category:Destroyed space probes]]\n[[Category:Indian lunar exploration programme]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft that impacted the Moon]]\n[[Category:Spacecraft launched by PSLV rockets]]\n[[Category:Impactor spacecraft]]\n[[Category:LQ30 quadrangle]]\n", "name_user": "70.70.39.1", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Impact_Probe"}

Thus, Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) identify them as dialects of a language. The speakers of this language reside mainly in [[Con Cu\u00f4ng District|Con Cu\u00f4ng]] and [[T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng District|T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng]] districts. It may also have close relation with [[Hung language]] (Toum) in [[Laos]].\n* '''[[Cuoi language|Cu\u1ed1i]]''', Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) pointed out that Cu\u1ed1i is a distinct language with Vietnamese, Muong and Po\u1ecdng-\u0110an Lai. This language have two dialects Cu\u1ed1i Ch\u0103m in T\u00e2n H\u1ee3p commune ([[T\u00e2n K\u1ef3 District|T\u00e2n K\u1ef3 district]]) and Cu\u1ed1i N\u1ebfp (or Cu\u1ed1i L\u00e0ng L\u1ee1) in [[Th\u00e1i H\u00f2a|Th\u00e1i H\u00f2a town]]. Because of sharing 66% basic lexicon with Po\u1ecdng, Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) proposed to group Cu\u1ed1i with T\u00e0y Po\u1ecdng-\u0110an Lai to form a subbranch in Vietic, parallel to Vi\u1ec7t-M\u01b0\u1eddng branch and Ch\u1ee9t branch. \n[[File:Th\u1ed5 language (Eng).png|thumb|The position of Th\u1ed5 languages in Vietic branch]]\n* '''[[M\u1ecdn language|M\u1ecdn]] and H\u1ecd''', The two dialects share 98% basic lexicon and have a closer relation with M\u01b0\u1eddng languages than Cu\u1ed1i and Po\u1ecdng.

Especially, M\u1ecdn and H\u1ecd are lexical closest with a M\u01b0\u1eddng language in Nh\u01b0 Xu\u00e2n district (84%). Therefore, Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) group them into a single language in Vi\u1ec7t-M\u01b0\u1eddng branch which have a closer relation with M\u01b0\u1eddng languages. Masp\u00e9ro (1912) named this language as [[Muong language|Southern M\u01b0\u1eddng language]]\n* '''K\u1eb9o''' share 99% lexicon with Ngh\u1ec7 An dialect of Vietnamese. Thus, Nguy\u1ec5n(2009) classified K\u1eb9o as a dialect of Vietnamese or even a sub-dialect of Ngh\u1ec7 An dialect  \n* '''[[Th\u1ed5 L\u00e2m La]] and [[Th\u1ed5 Nh\u01b0 Xu\u00e2n]]''' share respectively 94% and 95% basic lexicon with Ngh\u1ec7 An dialect. However, Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) argued that two Th\u1ed5 languages experienced a different phonological innovation with Vietnamese.

Thus, Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) identify them as dialects of a language. The speakers of this language reside mainly in [[Con Cu\u00f4ng District|Con Cu\u00f4ng]] and [[T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng District|T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng]] districts. It may also have close relation with [[Hung language]] (Toum) in [[Laos]].\n* '''[[Cuoi language|Cu\u1ed1i]]''', Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) pointed out that Cu\u1ed1i is a distinct language with Vietnamese, Muong and Po\u1ecdng-\u0110an Lai. This language have two dialects Cu\u1ed1i Ch\u0103m in T\u00e2n H\u1ee3p commune ([[T\u00e2n K\u1ef3 District|T\u00e2n K\u1ef3 district]]) and Cu\u1ed1i N\u1ebfp (or Cu\u1ed1i L\u00e0ng L\u1ee1) in [[Th\u00e1i H\u00f2a|Th\u00e1i H\u00f2a town]]. Because of sharing 66% basic lexicon with Po\u1ecdng, Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) proposed to group Cu\u1ed1i with T\u00e0y Po\u1ecdng-\u0110an Lai to form a subbranch in Vietic, parallel to Vi\u1ec7t-M\u01b0\u1eddng branch and Ch\u1ee9t branch. \n[[File:Th\u1ed5 language (Eng).png|thumb|The position of Th\u1ed5 languages in Vietic branch]]\n* '''[[M\u1ecdn language|M\u1ecdn]] and H\u1ecd''', The two dialects share 98% basic lexicon and have a closer relation with M\u01b0\u1eddng languages than Cu\u1ed1i and Po\u1ecdng. They share 77%, 79% and 71% core lexicon with M\u01b0\u1eddng Bi language, M\u01b0\u1eddng \u1ed0ng language and Ngh\u1ec7 An dialect of Vietnamese, respectively. Especially, M\u1ecdn and H\u1ecd are lexical closest with a M\u01b0\u1eddng language in Nh\u01b0 Xu\u00e2n district (84%). Therefore, Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) group them into a single language in Vi\u1ec7t-M\u01b0\u1eddng branch which have a closer relation with M\u01b0\u1eddng languages. Masp\u00e9ro (1912) named this language as [[Muong language|Southern M\u01b0\u1eddng language]]\n* '''K\u1eb9o''' share 99% lexicon with Ngh\u1ec7 An dialect of Vietnamese. Thus, Nguy\u1ec5n(2009) classified K\u1eb9o as a dialect of Vietnamese or even a sub-dialect of Ngh\u1ec7 An dialect  \n* '''[[Th\u1ed5 L\u00e2m La]] and [[Th\u1ed5 Nh\u01b0 Xu\u00e2n]]''' share respectively 94% and 95% basic lexicon with Ngh\u1ec7 An dialect. However, Nguy\u1ec5n (2009) argued that two Th\u1ed5 languages experienced a different phonological innovation with Vietnamese. Thus, he place it into a grey area between being dialects of Vietnamese or being member languages of Viet-Muong branch ([[Ngu\u1ed3n language|Ngu\u1ed3n]] has a similar status).\n\n==Distribution==\nAs of 2009, 80% (59,579 persons) of all ethnic Th\u1ed5 live in [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]], while 13% (9,652 persons) are found in [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province]] Qu\u00e1n Vi Mi\u00ean (2013:11).\n\nQu\u00e1n Vi Mi\u00ean (2013:12-13) lists ethnic Th\u1ed5 populations and branches (ethnic subdivisions) for the following districts of [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]].\n\n*''[[Qu\u1ef3 H\u1ee3p District]]'': 18,394 people; H\u1ecd, K\u1eb9o, M\u1ecdn branches, in the following communes:\n**Tam H\u1ee3p (5,515 ethnic Th\u1ed5)\n**Ngh\u0129a Xu\u00e2n (3,855 ethnic Th\u1ed5)\n**Minh H\u1ee3p (1,983 ethnic Th\u1ed5)\n**H\u1ea1 S\u01a1n (2,652 ethnic Th\u1ed5)\n**V\u0103n L\u1ee3i (2,403 ethnic Th\u1ed5)\n**Th\u1ecd H\u1ee3p (1,730 ethnic Th\u1ed5)\n**Qu\u1ef3 H\u1ee3p city (265 ethnic Th\u1ed5)\n*''[[Ngh\u0129a \u0110\u00e0n District]]'': 28,487 people; H\u1ecd, K\u1eb9o, M\u1ecdn, Cu\u1ed1i \u0110\u1ebfp branches\n*''[[T\u00e2n K\u1ef3 District]]'': 15,695 people; H\u1ecd, K\u1eb9o, M\u1ecdn, Cu\u1ed1i Ch\u0103m branches\n*''[[Con Cu\u00f4ng District]]'': 3,220 people; \u0110an Lai, Ly H\u00e0 branches\n*''[[T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng District]]'': 436 people; T\u00e0y Po\u1ecdng branch\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Qu\u00e1n Vi Mi\u00ean. 2013.
