E. B..jpg|thumb|W.E.B. Dubois, the namesake of the library]]\nThe '''W. E. B. Du Bois Library''' is one of the three [[Library|libraries]] of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], the others being the Science and Engineering Library, and the Wadsworth Library at the Mount Ida Campus. The W.E.B. Du Bois Library holds resources primarily in [[humanities]] and [[Social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]]. At 28 stories and 286 feet 4\u215b inches (roughly 88 m) tall, it is the third-tallest library in the world after the [[National Library of Indonesia]] in [[Jakarta]] at 414 feet (126 m) and [[Shanghai Library]] in [[China]] at 348 feet (106 m). Measuring taller purely by height, the libraries in [[Jakarta]] and [[Shanghai]] both only have 24 floors. The W.E.B. Du Bois Library is also considered to be the tallest academic research library<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/32939387/164/TenTallest-Library-Buildings \"Ten Tallest Library Buildings\"], Scribd.com</ref> and 23rd tallest educational building in the world. The building is so large that it maintains a security force, which is managed by various supervisors and student employees.\n\nPresent holdings at the UMass Libraries include over 5.9 million volumes and over nine million individual items, providing access to nearly 80,000 online journals, over 700,000 e-books, and more than 200 databases.\n\nAs part of the [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five College Consortium]], the UMass Amherst Libraries also have access to material from its partners in the Consortium: [[Amherst College]], [[Hampshire College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], and [[Smith College]]. Students can also take advantage of the Interlibrary Loan Services to obtain materials from libraries beyond the Five College system and from all over the world.\n\n==History==\nAs the University of Massachusetts Amherst began to grow exponentially in the 1960s it was decided by the Board of Trustees that a large University Library would be needed for the Library System to make the transition into the future. The designer was [[Edward Durrell Stone]] who followed recommendations by a Boston library consultant who recommended that the University would require a building of nearly 310,000 square feet to meet with the growing demands of students.<ref name=\"umass.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://scua.library.umass.edu/youmass/doku.php?id=d:du_bois_library|title=Du Bois Library [YouMass ]|website=scua.library.umass.edu|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref> Ground was broken in April 1969 and the building was opened to the public in 1973, with an official dedication taking place in 1974.\n\nThe building was ordered closed in September 1979 by then Chancellor [[Henry Koffler]] to address the serious issue of \"[[spall]]ing\" where bits of brick from the facade on the exterior building would fall away. The most important and most used volumes were removed to the former Goodell Library Stacks (located adjacent to the building) as well as the majority of the library departments. The building was closed to all except staff who were allowed to retrieve any books left in the building. In December 1979 the building was reopened with a maximum occupancy of 500 persons, and a special ticket was required for entry. In 1983, the university acquired $2.5 million from the state legislature to begin a major renovation of the building's brick veneer. The money would also be used to reconstruct the main lobby and resize the first few floors of the building. The building was restored to full usage in 1985 and students and staff led an initiative in 1986 called \"Mass Transformation\" to clean up and restore the interior of the building.<ref name=\"umass.edu\"/> This initiative also was responsible for establishing the campus competition to add murals to the library stairwells.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Library Mural Competition|date=11 September 1990|work=The Massachusetts Daily Collegian}}</ref>\n\nThe building was originally referred to as the University Tower Library, but was renamed the W.E.B. Du Bois Library following a popular student movement in 1994.<ref>\"W.E.B. Du Bois Library (Umass Amherst)\" from DuBoisopedia, University of Massachusetts Amherst Library.

Du Bois due to his ties to the Communist Party USA. University policy also dictated that dedications were to be made for those who made significant donations to the University.<ref>Scott, David K. \u201cLibrary Dedication.\u201d Received by Michael Hooker, 8 Sept. 1994.</ref> While administration focused on the more practical reasons for the dedication, students were focused on his communist leanings with fighting imperialism and capitalism.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Du Bois' Radicalism Forgotten|last=Elliot|first=Michael|date=21 February 1996|work=The Massachusetts Daily Collegian|last2=Brown|first2=Shea|page=1}}</ref> There were many conflicts between administration, students, and the general public on whether or not it was appropriate to dedicate the library after Du Bois, but ultimately, the dedication gathered enough support and was celebrated over a period of several days by the entire community.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ceremonies Mark Dedication of W.E.B.

E. B. Du Bois]], which were acquired by former Chancellor [[Randolph Bromery]], a friend of Du Bois.  The library is also the depository for other important collections relating to social issues, such as the papers of Congressman [[Silvio O. Conte]], [[Horace Mann Bond]], [[Kenneth R. Feinberg]], and [[Daniel Ellsberg]].\n\n==General information==\nThe library offers several computer labs, a tutoring center, the writing center, equipment lending from the Digital Media lab, the Digital Scholarship Center (formerly the Image Collection Library) and an IT Support Desk. The upper floors contain books from various academic fields focusing primarily on the humanities and social behavioral sciences, including a sizeable East Asian Collection, Art Collections, UMass Thesis Archive, and \"SCUA,\" the Special Collections and University Archives. Some floors also house special offices and study carrels that are available to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers seeking a private study area. The library offers tutoring, writing workshops, and supplemental instruction scattered among its 26 floors.\n\nThe topmost floors of the library are a popular destination for those wishing to see a panoramic view of the campus and surrounding [[Pioneer Valley]]. The 23rd has the best view as it is the highest floor from which patrons can view the Valley from each of the building's four sides.\n\nThe library is accessible to UMass Amherst and 5-College Students 24 hours for five days a week during the normal academic year. It is closed at 9:00 at night on Fridays, Saturdays, and select holidays.<ref>\"Library Hours.\" University of Massachusetts Amherst. Retrieved December 4, 2009 from [<http://www.library.umass.edu/assets/hours2014-15.pdf</ref> The building is a public library so citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who are 18 years of age can access the majority of the building and its materials. An application for a borrowers card can be made online or on-site.\n\nPeregrine falcons have nested atop the building since 2003 and a camera was installed so that their nest box could be live streamed to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umass.edu/news/announcements/falconcam2017/|title=The 2017 Du Bois Falcons' Season Has Begun - UMass Amherst Libraries|website=www.library.umass.edu|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Room 25 located on the Lower Level, was transformed into a \"Team Based Learning Classroom\" that can hold approximately 75 students.\n\nIn time for the fall 2017 semester, a refresh of the lobby was completed included the installation of new digital signage and a new information desk, the Graduate Commons was opened on the 5th floor, and a second teaching space was finished for the Archives.\n\nThe Science and Engineering Library, which holds the bulk of the STEM related collection is located at a separate location in the [[John W. Lederle Graduate Research Center|Lederle Graduate Research Center]] Lowrise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umass.edu/locations/science-and-engineering-library/|title=Science and Engineering Library - UMass Amherst Libraries|website=www.library.umass.edu|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Learning Commons==\nA prominent feature of the W.E.B. Du Bois Library is the Learning Commons, located on the Lower Level, which opened in 2005. The Learning Commons provides a central location for resources provided by many departments across campus including Circulations/Reserves/Interlibrary Loan, the International Programs Office, the Writing Center, Reference and Research Assistance, the Assistive Technologies Center, an Information Technologies Help Desk, and the Learning Commons and Technical Support desk.<ref>https://www.library.umass.edu/assets/Uploads/Learning-Commons/LCfactsheet2015.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Learning Commons has over 30,000 square feet, with 450 seats available. There are 18 group study rooms which can be reserved,<ref>{{cite web|author=My Account |url=http://www.library.umass.edu/locations/learningcommons/reserve-a-group-study-room/ |title=Reserve a Group Study Room &#124; UMass Amherst Libraries |publisher=Library.umass.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref> so students can work together without disturbing others, and there are over 200 work stations equipped with Mac and PC computers. The computers have a broad range of software installed,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.it.umass.edu/classrooms/software |title=Supported Software & Downloads &#124; UMass Amherst Information Technology &#124; UMass Amherst |publisher=It.umass.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref> and are arranged in a variety of configurations to allow both individual and collaborative work. The entire building gained wireless Internet access in 2008. The North End is also home to the micro climate area, which consists of many experimental seating arrangements and television screens for group work.\n\nAccess to the [[Oswald Tippo]] Library Courtyard is on this level, which contains the statue entitled ''Searching for Buddha in the Mountains,'' designed by Thomas Matsuda in 1999 and installed in 2000.\n\n==Building myths==\nThe building has fallen victim to several myths since its opening in 1973, the most popular of these being a variation of the \"Sinking Library Myth,\" where the architect supposedly forgot to account for the weight of the books in the buildings designs, resulting in a settling of the building. This is a popular myth attributed to many university libraries and is untrue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/college/halls/sinking.asp|title=The Sinking Library|publisher=|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe spalling of the bricks has also led to the common assumption that entire bricks fall away from the building, and invariably make contact with someone on the ground. While bits of material do occasionally break away, a full brick has never come away from the building, and a safety fence stands around the exterior of the building to keep passersby safe from the small chips which do.\n\nThe unusual inclusion of carrel floors bred the belief that the building was not originally designed to be a library, but was supposed to be an office building and the plans were mixed up. The building was designed to work in units of three, with two stacks floors holding similar subjects and a carrel floor to accommodate departments and librarians related to those materials. The plan never fully came to fruition, and carrels are used by graduate students and professors as quiet study spaces.

E. B..jpg|thumb|W.E.B. Dubois, the namesake of the library]]\nThe '''W. E. B. Du Bois Library''' is one of the three [[Library|libraries]] of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], the others being the Science and Engineering Library, and the Wadsworth Library at the Mount Ida Campus. The W.E.B. Du Bois Library holds resources primarily in [[humanities]] and [[Social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]]. At 28 stories and 286 feet 4\u215b inches (roughly 88 m) tall, it is the third-tallest library in the world after the [[National Library of Indonesia]] in [[Jakarta]] at 414 feet (126 m) and [[Shanghai Library]] in [[China]] at 348 feet (106 m). Measuring taller purely by height, the libraries in [[Jakarta]] and [[Shanghai]] both only have 24 floors. The W.E.B. Du Bois Library is also considered to be the tallest academic research library<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/32939387/164/TenTallest-Library-Buildings \"Ten Tallest Library Buildings\"], Scribd.com</ref> and 23rd tallest educational building in the world. The building is so large that it maintains a security force, which is managed by various supervisors and student employees.\n\nPresent holdings at the UMass Libraries include over 5.9 million volumes and over nine million individual items, providing access to nearly 80,000 online journals, over 700,000 e-books, and more than 200 databases.\n\nAs part of the [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five College Consortium]], the UMass Amherst Libraries also have access to material from its partners in the Consortium: [[Amherst College]], [[Hampshire College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], and [[Smith College]]. Students can also take advantage of the Interlibrary Loan Services to obtain materials from libraries beyond the Five College system and from all over the world.\n\n==History==\nAs the University of Massachusetts Amherst began to grow exponentially in the 1960s it was decided by the Board of Trustees that a large University Library would be needed for the Library System to make the transition into the future. The designer was [[Edward Durrell Stone]] who followed recommendations by a Boston library consultant who recommended that the University would require a building of nearly 310,000 square feet to meet with the growing demands of students.<ref name=\"umass.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://scua.library.umass.edu/youmass/doku.php?id=d:du_bois_library|title=Du Bois Library [YouMass ]|website=scua.library.umass.edu|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref> Ground was broken in April 1969 and the building was opened to the public in 1973, with an official dedication taking place in 1974.\n\nThe building was ordered closed in September 1979 by then Chancellor [[Henry Koffler]] to address the serious issue of \"[[spall]]ing\" where bits of brick from the facade on the exterior building would fall away. The most important and most used volumes were removed to the former Goodell Library Stacks (located adjacent to the building) as well as the majority of the library departments. The building was closed to all except staff who were allowed to retrieve any books left in the building. In December 1979 the building was reopened with a maximum occupancy of 500 persons, and a special ticket was required for entry. In 1983, the university acquired $2.5 million from the state legislature to begin a major renovation of the building's brick veneer. The money would also be used to reconstruct the main lobby and resize the first few floors of the building. The building was restored to full usage in 1985 and students and staff led an initiative in 1986 called \"Mass Transformation\" to clean up and restore the interior of the building.<ref name=\"umass.edu\"/> This initiative also was responsible for establishing the campus competition to add murals to the library stairwells.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Library Mural Competition|date=11 September 1990|work=The Massachusetts Daily Collegian}}</ref>\n\nThe building was originally referred to as the University Tower Library, but was renamed the W.E.B. Du Bois Library following a popular student movement in 1994.<ref>\"W.E.B. Du Bois Library (Umass Amherst)\" from DuBoisopedia, University of Massachusetts Amherst Library. Retrieved May 11, 2012 from [http://www.library.umass.edu/spcoll/duboisopedia/doku.php?id=about:w.e.b._du_bois_library]</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2018}} There was significant debate on whether or not it was appropriate to name the library after W.E.B. Du Bois due to his ties to the Communist Party USA. University policy also dictated that dedications were to be made for those who made significant donations to the University.<ref>Scott, David K. \u201cLibrary Dedication.\u201d Received by Michael Hooker, 8 Sept. 1994.</ref> While administration focused on the more practical reasons for the dedication, students were focused on his communist leanings with fighting imperialism and capitalism.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Du Bois' Radicalism Forgotten|last=Elliot|first=Michael|date=21 February 1996|work=The Massachusetts Daily Collegian|last2=Brown|first2=Shea|page=1}}</ref> There were many conflicts between administration, students, and the general public on whether or not it was appropriate to dedicate the library after Du Bois, but ultimately, the dedication gathered enough support and was celebrated over a period of several days by the entire community.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ceremonies Mark Dedication of W.E.B. DuBois Library|last=Scanlan|first=Kay|date=16 February 1996|work=The Campus Chronicle}}</ref>\n\nSpecial Collections is home to the memoirs and papers of the distinguished [[African-American]] scholar, writer, and activist, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], which were acquired by former Chancellor [[Randolph Bromery]], a friend of Du Bois.  The library is also the depository for other important collections relating to social issues, such as the papers of Congressman [[Silvio O. Conte]], [[Horace Mann Bond]], [[Kenneth R. Feinberg]], and [[Daniel Ellsberg]].\n\n==General information==\nThe library offers several computer labs, a tutoring center, the writing center, equipment lending from the Digital Media lab, the Digital Scholarship Center (formerly the Image Collection Library) and an IT Support Desk. The upper floors contain books from various academic fields focusing primarily on the humanities and social behavioral sciences, including a sizeable East Asian Collection, Art Collections, UMass Thesis Archive, and \"SCUA,\" the Special Collections and University Archives. Some floors also house special offices and study carrels that are available to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers seeking a private study area. The library offers tutoring, writing workshops, and supplemental instruction scattered among its 26 floors.\n\nThe topmost floors of the library are a popular destination for those wishing to see a panoramic view of the campus and surrounding [[Pioneer Valley]]. The 23rd has the best view as it is the highest floor from which patrons can view the Valley from each of the building's four sides.\n\nThe library is accessible to UMass Amherst and 5-College Students 24 hours for five days a week during the normal academic year. It is closed at 9:00 at night on Fridays, Saturdays, and select holidays.<ref>\"Library Hours.\" University of Massachusetts Amherst. Retrieved December 4, 2009 from [<http://www.library.umass.edu/assets/hours2014-15.pdf</ref> The building is a public library so citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts who are 18 years of age can access the majority of the building and its materials. An application for a borrowers card can be made online or on-site.\n\nPeregrine falcons have nested atop the building since 2003 and a camera was installed so that their nest box could be live streamed to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umass.edu/news/announcements/falconcam2017/|title=The 2017 Du Bois Falcons' Season Has Begun - UMass Amherst Libraries|website=www.library.umass.edu|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Room 25 located on the Lower Level, was transformed into a \"Team Based Learning Classroom\" that can hold approximately 75 students.\n\nIn time for the fall 2017 semester, a refresh of the lobby was completed included the installation of new digital signage and a new information desk, the Graduate Commons was opened on the 5th floor, and a second teaching space was finished for the Archives.\n\nThe Science and Engineering Library, which holds the bulk of the STEM related collection is located at a separate location in the [[John W. Lederle Graduate Research Center|Lederle Graduate Research Center]] Lowrise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umass.edu/locations/science-and-engineering-library/|title=Science and Engineering Library - UMass Amherst Libraries|website=www.library.umass.edu|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Learning Commons==\nA prominent feature of the W.E.B. Du Bois Library is the Learning Commons, located on the Lower Level, which opened in 2005. The Learning Commons provides a central location for resources provided by many departments across campus including Circulations/Reserves/Interlibrary Loan, the International Programs Office, the Writing Center, Reference and Research Assistance, the Assistive Technologies Center, an Information Technologies Help Desk, and the Learning Commons and Technical Support desk.<ref>https://www.library.umass.edu/assets/Uploads/Learning-Commons/LCfactsheet2015.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Learning Commons has over 30,000 square feet, with 450 seats available. There are 18 group study rooms which can be reserved,<ref>{{cite web|author=My Account |url=http://www.library.umass.edu/locations/learningcommons/reserve-a-group-study-room/ |title=Reserve a Group Study Room &#124; UMass Amherst Libraries |publisher=Library.umass.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref> so students can work together without disturbing others, and there are over 200 work stations equipped with Mac and PC computers. The computers have a broad range of software installed,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.it.umass.edu/classrooms/software |title=Supported Software & Downloads &#124; UMass Amherst Information Technology &#124; UMass Amherst |publisher=It.umass.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref> and are arranged in a variety of configurations to allow both individual and collaborative work. The entire building gained wireless Internet access in 2008. The North End is also home to the micro climate area, which consists of many experimental seating arrangements and television screens for group work.\n\nAccess to the [[Oswald Tippo]] Library Courtyard is on this level, which contains the statue entitled ''Searching for Buddha in the Mountains,'' designed by Thomas Matsuda in 1999 and installed in 2000.\n\n==Building myths==\nThe building has fallen victim to several myths since its opening in 1973, the most popular of these being a variation of the \"Sinking Library Myth,\" where the architect supposedly forgot to account for the weight of the books in the buildings designs, resulting in a settling of the building. This is a popular myth attributed to many university libraries and is untrue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/college/halls/sinking.asp|title=The Sinking Library|publisher=|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe spalling of the bricks has also led to the common assumption that entire bricks fall away from the building, and invariably make contact with someone on the ground. While bits of material do occasionally break away, a full brick has never come away from the building, and a safety fence stands around the exterior of the building to keep passersby safe from the small chips which do.\n\nThe unusual inclusion of carrel floors bred the belief that the building was not originally designed to be a library, but was supposed to be an office building and the plans were mixed up. The building was designed to work in units of three, with two stacks floors holding similar subjects and a carrel floor to accommodate departments and librarians related to those materials. The plan never fully came to fruition, and carrels are used by graduate students and professors as quiet study spaces. This myth gained further traction after the construction of the Standard Oil building (now [[Aon Center (Chicago)|Aon Center]]) by Durell's firm in Chicago which features a similar design with an exterior clad in marble.\n\n==Renovations==\nThroughout the years since the building was first built, many renovations and upgrades have been completed on the library. These renovations have included a new entryway, brand new elevator systems, a sprinkler system and fire suppression, a reconfigured cafe, as well as electrical upgrades and an HVAC system. There is also a new loading dock and service entrance being built in conjunction with the renovation of the South College Building on the west side of the Library.\n\nIn 2017, the Digital Scholarship Center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umass.edu/news/announcements/iclmove/|title=The Image Collection Library Has Moved to Du Bois - UMass Amherst Libraries|website=www.library.umass.edu|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref> and the Freshman Writing Program (both formerly located in Bartlett Hall) moved to the sixth and twelfth floors respectively, and renovations were completed to provide additional space to the Learning Resource Center on the thirteenth floor.\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.scribd.com/doc/32939387/164/TenTallest-Library-Buildings\n\n{{University of Massachusetts Amherst|state=expanded}}\n{{W.

He was the son of a well-known Dutch [[cello|cellist]] [[Isa\u00e4c Mossel]] ([[Rotterdam]], 1870 \u2013 [[Amsterdam]], 1923) and [[pianist]] Jeannette Belinfante (1868-1925).<ref>[http://www.mosselmonument.nl/ Herman Openneer (1935-2017), 1993.]</ref>  He spent his youth with his parents in [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]] in the Netherlands, where he lived on the Velthuijsenlaan.<ref>[https://historischekringlaren.nl/velthuijsenlaan-19/ The family house on the Velthuijsenlaan 19, Laren.]</ref> At a young age he was taught to play the piano. His father stimulated his love for [[jazz]]. In 1923 Mossel played as a [[drummer]] and pianist in the \u201cLarensche Jazz Band\u201d. A couple of years later he formed his own jazz band \u201cThe Indian Jazz Band\u201d. In 1931 Mossel was employed by the German violinist and bandleader [[Marek Weber]] and moved to [[Germany]].<ref>[http://www.mosselmonument.nl/ Herman Openneer (1935-2017), 1993.]</ref>\n\nBecause he was Jewish, Weber was targeted by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] who wanted to suppress the so called [[degenerate music]] (German: Entartete Musik), a label which had also been applied to jazz music. This was meant to isolate, discredit and ultimately ban this form of music. Towards the end of 1932 Marek left Germany and travelled via [[London]] to the [[United States]]. Mossel returned to the Netherlands.\n\n==The last ten years from 1935 until 1944==\nHans Mossel was considered to be among the most notable clarinetists and saxophonists performing in [[Europe]].<ref>[http://www.mosselmonument.nl/ Herman Openneer (1935-2017), 1993.]</ref>  In 1935 Mossel was employed by the Dutch broadcasting company the [[Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep|AVRO]] as a bandleader for the AVRO Dance Orchestra.<ref>[https://www.jazzarchief.nl/product/avro-dansorkest-o-l-v-hans-mossel Avro Dance Orchestra with band leader Hans Mossel.]</ref> In 1939 Mossel married Ada Elizabeth van Ollefen.

He was the son of a well-known Dutch [[cello|cellist]] [[Isa\u00e4c Mossel]] ([[Rotterdam]], 1870 \u2013 [[Amsterdam]], 1923) and [[pianist]] Jeannette Belinfante (1868-1925).<ref>[http://www.mosselmonument.nl/ Herman Openneer (1935-2017), 1993.]</ref>  He spent his youth with his parents in [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]] in the Netherlands, where he lived on the Velthuijsenlaan.<ref>[https://historischekringlaren.nl/velthuijsenlaan-19/ The family house on the Velthuijsenlaan 19, Laren.]</ref> At a young age he was taught to play the piano. His father stimulated his love for [[jazz]]. In 1923 Mossel played as a [[drummer]] and pianist in the \u201cLarensche Jazz Band\u201d. A couple of years later he formed his own jazz band \u201cThe Indian Jazz Band\u201d. In 1931 Mossel was employed by the German violinist and bandleader [[Marek Weber]] and moved to [[Germany]].<ref>[http://www.mosselmonument.nl/ Herman Openneer (1935-2017), 1993.]</ref>\n\nBecause he was Jewish, Weber was targeted by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] who wanted to suppress the so called [[degenerate music]] (German: Entartete Musik), a label which had also been applied to jazz music. This was meant to isolate, discredit and ultimately ban this form of music. Towards the end of 1932 Marek left Germany and travelled via [[London]] to the [[United States]]. Mossel returned to the Netherlands.\n\n==The last ten years from 1935 until 1944==\nHans Mossel was considered to be among the most notable clarinetists and saxophonists performing in [[Europe]].<ref>[http://www.mosselmonument.nl/ Herman Openneer (1935-2017), 1993.]</ref>  In 1935 Mossel was employed by the Dutch broadcasting company the [[Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep|AVRO]] as a bandleader for the AVRO Dance Orchestra.<ref>[https://www.jazzarchief.nl/product/avro-dansorkest-o-l-v-hans-mossel Avro Dance Orchestra with band leader Hans Mossel.]</ref> In 1939 Mossel married Ada Elizabeth van Ollefen.

Currently, the USF Tampa Library facilitates three main activities in order to promote textbook affordability: recommendations to faculty, Course Reserves, and the E-books for the Classroom database. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bozcar |first1=Jason |last2=Pascual |first2=Laura |title=E-books for the Classroom and Open Access Textbooks: Two Ways to Help Students Save Money on Textbooks |journal=The Serials Librarian |date=2017 |volume=72 |issue=1\u20134 |pages=95\u2013101 |doi=10.1080/0361526X.2017.1309830 |doi-access=free }}</ref> During the early years of TAP, staff was limited to two persons. As of 2018, over 6 full-time staff are dedicated to the Textbook Affordability project. TAP strives to provide affordable textbook options to students, and encourages professors to seek out more affordable options for their courses. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Cutillo |first1=Matthew |title=Textbook Affordability Project expands, advises faculty on cheaper options for classes |url=http://www.usforacle.com/2018/09/17/textbook-affordability-project-expands-advises-faculty-on-cheaper-options-for-classes/ |website=The Oracle |publisher=The USF Oracle |accessdate=2 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n\n\n*Ebooks for the Classroom+ - As part of its efforts to promote textbook affordability, TAP uses Ebooks for the Classroom to encourage the use of library-licensed resources in courses. This database was created in 2017, and serves the entire USF system. Within the database, professors can adopt Ebooks that the library has purchased rights to, so that students can access these books for free. This collection has contributed greatly to the efforts of the TAP initiative.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mi |first1=Xiying |last2=Pollock |first2=Bonita |title=\"Ebooks for the Classroom+\" at University of South Florida Libraries: A Case Study of Database Management. |journal=Journal of Web Librarianship |date=2019 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=95\u2013111 |doi=10.1080/19322909.2018.1555779 }}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n== Building configuration ==\n[[File:USF Tampa Library inside.jpg|thumb|An inside view of the USF Tampa Library]]\nThe library is located in a seven-story facility<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.lib.usf.edu/about/floor-plans/|title=Floor Plans - About our Library {{!}} USF Tampa Libraries|access-date=2016-11-29|language=en-US|newspaper=About our Library {{!}} USF Tampa Libraries}}</ref> on the main campus at 4101 USF Apple Drive, Tampa, FL 33620-5400.\n* Basement - Quiet zone comprising federal and state government documents, print collections, maps, and the Reference Annex.
