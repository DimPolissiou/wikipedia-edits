Trading is generally in the hands of women, and a husband has no control over his wife's money. Succession to most offices held by women and inheritance of women's property are by matrilineal descent. Inheritance of other property and succession to male-held public offices are by patrilineal descent. Men of the lineage live together in a men's compound, while women, even after marriage, live with their mothers and children in a women's compound.

About 70% of the Greater Accra Regional Land is owned by the Dangmes located in Dangme East and Dangme West Districts of Ghana. Also, in the Eastern Region and Volta Region of Ghana, about 15% of lands belong to the Dangme People. These are mainly in the Manya Krobo and Yilo Krobo Districts of the Eastern Region.\nIn the Agotime Area of Volta Region and the Dangme Area in the Southern part of Togo.\n\nDangme occupations are fishing, trading and farming which is based on the huza system. In this system a tract of land is acquired by a group of people, usually members of an extended family; the land is subdivided among them according to the amount each has paid, and each individual thereafter has complete control of his own section. Negotiations with the seller are carried out by an elected huzatse (\u201cfather of the huza\u201d), who later acts as the huza leader and representative. Millet was formerly the staple food, but more common crops now include cassava, yams, corn (maize), plantain, cocoa, and palm oil. Lineage members generally return to the traditional lineage home from the huza farms several times a year to participate in the festivals of their lineage gods. There are also many annual festivals.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe Ga-Dangme are organized into clans based on patrilineal descent; the clans are subdivided into localized patrilineages, the basic units of the Ga-Dangme historical, political, cultural Tribal group.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Language==\nLinguistically, the Ga-Dangbe speak the [[Kwa languages]] [[Ga language|Ga]] and [[Dangme language|Dangme]] and are a patrilineal people. \nDangme is exclusively closer to the original Ga\u2013Dangme languages than the Ga language.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Arts and culture==\nThe '''Ga''' people celebrate the [[Homowo]] festival, which literally means \"hooting at hunger.\" This festival originated several centuries ago. It is celebrated in remembrance of a great famine that hit the Ga people in the sixteenth century. It is mainly a food festival which celebrates the passing of that terrible period in Ga history. It takes place in August every year and is celebrated by all the Ga clans.\n\nThe '''Dangbe''' people from Ada celebrate the [[Asafotu]] festival, which is also called 'Asafotufiam', an annual warrior's festival celebrated by Ada people from the last Thursday of July to the first weekend of August. It commemorates the victories of the warriors in battle and is a memorial for those who fell on the battlefield. To re-enact these historic events, the warriors dress in traditional battle dress and stage a mock battle. This is also a time for male [[rites of passage]], when young men are introduced to warfare. The festival also coincides with the harvest cycle, when these special customs and ceremonies are performed. These include purification ceremonies. The celebration reaches its climax with a durbar of chiefs, a colourful procession of the Chiefs in palanquins with their retinue. They are accompanied by traditional military groups called '[[Asafo]] Companies' amidst drumming, singing and dancing through the streets and on the durbar grounds. At the durbar, greetings are exchanged between the chiefs, [[libations]] are poured and declarations of allegiance are made.\n\nThe Dangbe people from Odumase - Krobo also Celebrate the ['''Ngmayem'''] festival, An Annual Harvest festival to Celebrate the bounty harvest of their farmers is celebrated by the Krobo people throughout the last week (Seven days) of October with a visit to their famous Ancestral home, the Krobo Mountains ['''Kloyom'''] on the last Friday of October with a climax on the Saturday with a grand Durbar of Chiefs and People of the Krobo Traditional Area. the ['''Konor'''] who is the Paramount Chief sits in state as the overlord together with his sub-chiefs, Government officials, other traditional Authorities and Invited guests.\n\n===Music and sports===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lady Fighter.jpg|thumbnail|left|Lady Fighter in Bukom]] -->\n\nThe Ga-Dangbe music includes drumming and dancing. One of their traditional music and dance styles (albeit a fairly modern one) is ''[[kpanlogo]]'', a modernized traditional dance and music form developed around 1960.

The fishing community of [[Bukom]] on the outskirts of [[Accra]], is considered as the mecca of boxing in Ghana and has produced several notable boxers.

According researcher and author Priscilla Akua Boakye, \"[Dipo] was a form of vocational training for young women in which they were taught generally how to assume their roles as responsible women.\" Despite the ritual being designated for older teenaged girls, it is not uncommon for young pre-adolescent and even toddler aged girls to take part.<ref name=Bak/>\n\n=== Funerals and \"fantasy\" coffins ===\nThe Ga people are known for their [[funeral]] celebrations and [[procession]]s. The Ga believe that when someone dies, they move to another life. Therefore, special [[coffin]]s are often crafted by highly skilled [[carpenter]]s since this tradition spread in the 1950s. Pioneers were master craftsmen like [[Ataa Oko]] (1919-2012) from La, and [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop|Seth Kane Kwei]] (1925-1992) from Teshie.\n\nThe coffins can be anything wanted by relatives of the deceased from a pencil to any animal such as an elephant. Coffins are usually crafted to reflect an essence of the deceased, in forms such as a [[character trait]], an occupation, or a [[symbol]] of one's standing in the community.<ref name=\"styles\">\n[http://www.nmfh.org/exhibits/fantasy/index.html National Museum of Funeral History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211225512/http://www.nmfh.org/exhibits/fantasy/index.html |date=2007-02-11 }} .  Retrieved 20 September 07\n</ref>\nFor example, a [[taxicab driver]] is most likely to be buried in a coffin shaped as a [[car]]. Many families spend excessive amounts on coffins because they often feel that they have to pay their last respects to the deceased and being buried in a coffin of cultural, [[wikt:symbolic|symbolic]] as well expensive taste is seen as fitting. Prices of coffins can vary depending on what is being ordered. It is not unusual for a single coffin to cost [[United States dollar|$]]600. This is expensive for local families considering that it is not unusual to meet people with an income of only $50 a month. This means that funerals are often paid for by wealthier members of the family, if such a member exists, with smaller contributions coming from other working members of the family. This is needed as the coffin is only a portion of the total funeral cost that will be incurred.\nSome people foreign to Ghana are known to have been buried in Ga-styled coffins.<ref name=\"Ga-West\">\n[http://www.eshopafrica.com/acatalog/Ga_Coffins.html Fair trade arts and crafts direct from African artisans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314231757/http://eshopafrica.com/acatalog/Ga_Coffins.html |date=2007-03-14 }} .

Photo [[Regula Tschumi]]]]\n\nThe use of these [[fantasy coffin]]s is explained by the religious beliefs of the Ga people regarding their afterlife. They believe that death is not the end and that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also thought to be much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still living (lucky as they are). This is why families do everything they can to ensure that a dead person is sympathetic towards them as early as possible. The social status of the deceased depends primarily on the size and the success of the burial service and of course the usage of an exclusive coffin. \nDesign [[coffin]]s are only seen on the day of the [[burial]]s when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolise the dead people's professions, the purpose being to help them continue with their earthly profession in the [[afterlife]]. Certain shapes, such as a sword or chair coffin, represent royal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in these types of coffins. Various creatures, such as lions, cockerels and crabs represent clan [[totem]]s. Similarly, only the heads of the families concerned are permitted to be buried in coffins such as these. Many coffin shapes also evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. Design coffins have been used since around the 1950s, especially in rural Ga groups with traditional beliefs, and have now become an integral part of Ga burial culture.\nToday, figural coffins are made in several workshops in Togo and Greater Accra. Successful coffinmakers are for example Cedi and [[Eric Adjetey Anang]] of [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop]], [[Paa Joe]], [[Daniel Mensah]] and [[Kudjoe Affutu]]. Most of the figural coffins are used for funerals, only a few are exported for international art exhibitions.\n\n==Notable Ga-Dangbe people==\n{{col-begin}}\n*[[Ebenezer Ako-Adjei]] (17 June 1916 \u2013 14 January 2002)&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Ghanaian&nbsp;lawyer&nbsp;and&nbsp;politician&nbsp;who served as a&nbsp;foreign minister&nbsp;and in other leading cabinet roles during the first Republic of Ghana as a member of the&nbsp;[[Convention People's Party]].

Inheritance of other property and succession to male-held public offices are by patrilineal descent.

About 70% of the Greater Accra Regional Land is owned by the Dangmes located in Dangme East and Dangme West Districts of Ghana. Also, in the Eastern Region and Volta Region of Ghana, about 15% of lands belong to the Dangme People. These are mainly in the Manya Krobo and Yilo Krobo Districts of the Eastern Region.\nIn the Agotime Area of Volta Region and the Dangme Area in the Southern part of Togo.\n\nDangme occupations are fishing, trading and farming which is based on the huza system. In this system a tract of land is acquired by a group of people, usually members of an extended family; the land is subdivided among them according to the amount each has paid, and each individual thereafter has complete control of his own section. Negotiations with the seller are carried out by an elected huzatse (\u201cfather of the huza\u201d), who later acts as the huza leader and representative. Millet was formerly the staple food, but more common crops now include cassava, yams, corn (maize), plantain, cocoa, and palm oil. Lineage members generally return to the traditional lineage home from the huza farms several times a year to participate in the festivals of their lineage gods.

It is celebrated in remembrance of a great famine that hit the Ga people in the sixteenth century. It is mainly a food festival which celebrates the passing of that terrible period in Ga history. It takes place in August every year and is celebrated by all the Ga clans.\n\nThe '''Dangbe''' people from Ada celebrate the [[Asafotu]] festival, which is also called 'Asafotufiam', an annual warrior's festival celebrated by Ada people from the last Thursday of July to the first weekend of August. It commemorates the victories of the warriors in battle and is a memorial for those who fell on the battlefield. To re-enact these historic events, the warriors dress in traditional battle dress and stage a mock battle. This is also a time for male [[rites of passage]], when young men are introduced to warfare. The festival also coincides with the harvest cycle, when these special customs and ceremonies are performed. These include purification ceremonies. The celebration reaches its climax with a durbar of chiefs, a colourful procession of the Chiefs in palanquins with their retinue. They are accompanied by traditional military groups called '[[Asafo]] Companies' amidst drumming, singing and dancing through the streets and on the durbar grounds. At the durbar, greetings are exchanged between the chiefs, [[libations]] are poured and declarations of allegiance are made.\n\nThe Dangbe people from Odumase - Krobo also Celebrate the ['''Ngmayem'''] festival, An Annual Harvest festival to Celebrate the bounty harvest of their farmers is celebrated by the Krobo people throughout the last week (Seven days) of October with a visit to their famous Ancestral home, the Krobo Mountains ['''Kloyom'''] on the last Friday of October with a climax on the Saturday with a grand Durbar of Chiefs and People of the Krobo Traditional Area. the ['''Konor'''] who is the Paramount Chief sits in state as the overlord together with his sub-chiefs, Government officials, other traditional Authorities and Invited guests.\n\n===Music and sports===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lady Fighter.jpg|thumbnail|left|Lady Fighter in Bukom]] -->\n\nThe Ga-Dangbe music includes drumming and dancing.

The Ga believe that when someone dies, they move to another life. Therefore, special [[coffin]]s are often crafted by highly skilled [[carpenter]]s since this tradition spread in the 1950s. Pioneers were master craftsmen like [[Ataa Oko]] (1919-2012) from La, and [[Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop|Seth Kane Kwei]] (1925-1992) from Teshie.\n\nThe coffins can be anything wanted by relatives of the deceased from a pencil to any animal such as an elephant. Coffins are usually crafted to reflect an essence of the deceased, in forms such as a [[character trait]], an occupation, or a [[symbol]] of one's standing in the community.<ref name=\"styles\">\n[http://www.nmfh.org/exhibits/fantasy/index.html National Museum of Funeral History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211225512/http://www.nmfh.org/exhibits/fantasy/index.html |date=2007-02-11 }} .  Retrieved 20 September 07\n</ref>\nFor example, a [[taxicab driver]] is most likely to be buried in a coffin shaped as a [[car]]. Many families spend excessive amounts on coffins because they often feel that they have to pay their last respects to the deceased and being buried in a coffin of cultural, [[wikt:symbolic|symbolic]] as well expensive taste is seen as fitting. Prices of coffins can vary depending on what is being ordered. It is not unusual for a single coffin to cost [[United States dollar|$]]600. This is expensive for local families considering that it is not unusual to meet people with an income of only $50 a month. This means that funerals are often paid for by wealthier members of the family, if such a member exists, with smaller contributions coming from other working members of the family. This is needed as the coffin is only a portion of the total funeral cost that will be incurred.\nSome people foreign to Ghana are known to have been buried in Ga-styled coffins.<ref name=\"Ga-West\">\n[http://www.eshopafrica.com/acatalog/Ga_Coffins.html Fair trade arts and crafts direct from African artisans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314231757/http://eshopafrica.com/acatalog/Ga_Coffins.html |date=2007-03-14 }} .

Photo [[Regula Tschumi]]]]\n\nThe use of these [[fantasy coffin]]s is explained by the religious beliefs of the Ga people regarding their afterlife. They believe that death is not the end and that life continues in the next world in the same way it did on earth. Ancestors are also thought to be much more powerful than the living and able to influence their relatives who are still living (lucky as they are). This is why families do everything they can to ensure that a dead person is sympathetic towards them as early as possible. The social status of the deceased depends primarily on the size and the success of the burial service and of course the usage of an exclusive coffin. \nDesign [[coffin]]s are only seen on the day of the [[burial]]s when they are buried with the deceased. They often symbolise the dead people's professions, the purpose being to help them continue with their earthly profession in the [[afterlife]]. Certain shapes, such as a sword or chair coffin, represent royal or priestly insignia with a magical and religious function. Only people with the appropriate status are allowed to be buried in these types of coffins. Various creatures, such as lions, cockerels and crabs represent clan [[totem]]s. Similarly, only the heads of the families concerned are permitted to be buried in coffins such as these. Many coffin shapes also evoke proverbs, which are interpreted in different ways by the Ga. Design coffins have been used since around the 1950s, especially in rural Ga groups with traditional beliefs, and have now become an integral part of Ga burial culture.\nToday, figural coffins are made in several workshops in Togo and Greater Accra.

After this event, Sister [[Pascalina Lehnert]] said the Pope was convinced that while the Bishop's protest cost forty thousand lives, a protest by him would mean at least two hundred thousand innocent lives that he was not ready to sacrifice. While politicians, generals, and dictators might gamble with the lives of people, a Pope could not.

He further argues that [[Ludwig Kaas|Monsignor Kass]], who was involved in negotiations for the Reichskonkordat, and at that time the head of the Roman Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], persuaded his party members, with the acquiescence of Pacelli, in the summer of 1933 to enable Hitler to acquire dictatorial powers.

Only adult males have the distinctive small rusty brown throat patch which gives the species its common name and the absence of which makes the identification of females and juveniles more difficult. The upper part of the head, body, wings, and tail are a dark-brownish grey, particularly dark on the rump and tail. While the underbody is predominantly whitish-grey, with a more whitish belly and pale buff colour blending into the flanks and undertail-coverts. The tail is dark-brownish grey with prominent white patches on the tips of the outer tail feathers, which can be seen during flight and with the tail folded. Fine off-white scalloping is visible on the forehead, with off-white eye rings and lores merging into the lighter underparts of the body. May be confused with some [[Acanthiza|thornbill]] species, which are more compact with a shorter tail than the redthroat. Unlikely to be mistaken for fieldwrens or heathwrens, which have a more strongly upturned tail at rest.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic birds.

Only adult males have the distinctive small rusty brown throat patch which gives the species its common name and the absence of which makes the identification of females and juveniles more difficult. The upper part of the head, body, wings, and tail are a dark-brownish grey, particularly dark on the rump and tail. While the underbody is predominantly whitish-grey, with a more whitish belly and pale buff colour blending into the flanks and undertail-coverts. The tail is dark-brownish grey with prominent white patches on the tips of the outer tail feathers, which can be seen during flight and with the tail folded. Fine off-white scalloping is visible on the forehead, with off-white eye rings and lores merging into the lighter underparts of the body. May be confused with some [[Acanthiza|thornbill]] species, which are more compact with a shorter tail than the redthroat. Unlikely to be mistaken for fieldwrens or heathwrens, which have a more strongly upturned tail at rest.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic birds.

The series is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Arrow]], a costumed crime-fighter created by [[Mort Weisinger]] and [[George Papp]], and is set in the [[Arrowverse]], sharing continuity with other Arrowverse television series. The showrunners for this season were [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Marc Guggenheim]] and [[Andrew Kreisberg]].

In the second season, Oliver has vowed to stop crime without killing criminals, using \"The Arrow\" as his new name to represent that,<ref name=\"Alias: The Arrow 1\">{{Cite episode |title=City of Heroes |episode-link=City of Heroes (Arrow) |series=Arrow |series-link=Arrow (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |airdate=October 9, 2013 |season=2 |number=1 |time=40:25 |quote=I don't want to be called \"The Hood\" anymore.}}</ref><ref name=\"Alias: The Arrow 2\">{{Cite episode |title=Broken Dolls |episode-link=Broken Dolls (Arrow) |series=Arrow |series-link=Arrow (TV series) |network=[[The CW]] |airdate=October 23, 2013 |season=2 |number=3 |time=26:53 |quote=Last year you were working with \"The Arrow\", what a difference a few months make.}}</ref> and is aided with by allies, John and Felicity. Oliver's vow is tested when he comes under attack from [[Slade Wilson (Arrowverse)|Slade Wilson]] ([[Manu Bennett]]), a man from Oliver's time on the island who resurfaces with a vendetta against him. Oliver grows to accept aspiring vigilante Roy Harper as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and begins to receive assistance from Quentin. Oliver also gains another ally, [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]), who survived her ordeal at sea six years prior. The season features flashbacks to Oliver's second year on Lian Yu, where he faces a new threat from Dr [[Anthony Ivo (Arrowverse)|Anthony Ivo]] ([[Dylan Neal]]), whilst continuing to struggle to survive alongside allies Slade and Sara, and the archer [[Shado (Arrowverse)|Shado]] ([[Celina Jade]]). The origins of his feud with Slade is revealed.\n\nThe series was renewed for its second season on February 11, 2013. The second season received critical acclaim, and averaged 3.28 million viewers each week. The season would go on to be nominated for fifteen nominations in various categories.

As Oliver is embracing being a hero, being a hero means stepping out of the dark and being more of a symbol, so he has to take steps to conceal his identity more.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\" /> He added that it will \"allow the Arrow to interact with people who don't know his identity in a much more organic way than having him constantly keep his head down.\"<ref name=\"S2mask\" />\n\nCostume designer Maya Mani put together roughly 50 mask options for the producers.

However, two games later, Meulensteen was sacked and [[Felix Magath]] was placed in charge. Hangeland was reinstated to the team, and as a result, Sidwell lost the captaincy.
