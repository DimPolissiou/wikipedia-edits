The history of Albanian language orthography is closely related to the cultural orientation and knowledge of certain foreign languages among Albanian writers.{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=12}} The earliest written Albanian records come from the Gheg area in makeshift spellings based on Italian or Greek. Originally, the Tosk dialect was written in the [[Greek alphabet]] and the Gheg dialect was written in the [[Latin script]]. Both dialects had also been written in the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] version of the [[Arabic script]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and some local alphabets ([[Elbasan alphabet|Elbasan]], [[Vithkuqi alphabet|Vithkuqi]], [[Todhri alphabet|Todhri]], Veso Bey, Jan Vellara and others, see [[Albanian alphabet#Original Alphabets|original Albanian alphabets]]). More specifically, the writers from northern Albania and under the influence of the Catholic Church used Latin letters, those in southern Albania and under the influence of the Greek Orthodox church used Greek letters, while others throughout Albania and under the influence of Islam used Arabic letters. There were initial attempts to create an original Albanian alphabet during the 1750\u20131850 period. These attempts intensified after the [[League of Prizren]] and culminated with the [[Congress of Manastir]] held by Albanian intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Manastir (present day [[Bitola]]), which decided on which alphabet to use, and what the standardized spelling would be for standard Albanian. This is how the literary language remains. The alphabet is the Latin alphabet with the addition of the letters <[[\u00eb]]>, <[[\u00e7]]>, and ten [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: ''dh'', ''th'', ''xh'', ''gj'', ''nj'', ''ng'', ''ll'', ''rr'', ''zh'' and ''sh''.\n\nAccording to [[Robert Elsie]]:<ref name=Elsie2017/>\n<blockquote>The hundred years between 1750 and 1850 were an age of astounding orthographic diversity in Albania. In this period, the Albanian language was put to writing in at least ten different alphabets \u2013 most certainly a record for European languages. ... the diverse forms in which this old Balkan language was recorded, from the earliest documents to the beginning of the twentieth century ... consist of adaptations of the Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Cyrillic alphabets and (what is even more interesting) a number of locally invented writing systems. Most of the latter alphabets have now been forgotten and are unknown, even to the Albanians themselves.<ref name=Elsie2017>Elsie, Robert. (2017). ''Albanian Alphabets: Borrowed and Invented''.

For example, the word for 'fish' is borrowed from Latin, but not the word for 'gills', which is native. Indigenous are also the words for 'ship', 'raft', 'navigation', 'sea shelves' and a few names of fish kinds, but not the words for 'sail', 'row' and 'harbor' \u2013 objects pertaining to navigation itself and a large part of sea fauna. This rather shows that Proto-Albanians were pushed away from coastal areas in early times (probably after the Latin conquest of the region) thus losing large parts (or the majority) of sea environment lexicon. A similar phenomenon could be observed with agricultural terms. While the words for 'arable land', 'corn', 'wheat', 'cereals', 'vineyard', 'yoke', 'harvesting', 'cattle breeding', etc. are native, the words for 'ploughing', 'farm' and 'farmer', agricultural practices, and some harvesting tools are foreign.

===\n\nPhonologically, Albanian is not so conservative. Like many IE stocks, it has merged the two series of voiced stops (e.g. both *''d'' and *''d\u02b0'' became ''d''). In addition, voiced stops tend to disappear in between vowels. There is almost complete loss of final syllables and very widespread loss of other unstressed syllables (e.g. ''mik'' 'friend' from Lat. ''amicus''). PIE *''o'' appears as ''a'' (also as ''e'' if a high front vowel ''i'' follows), while *''\u0113'' and *''\u0101'' become ''o'', and PIE *''\u014d'' appears as ''e''. The palatals, velars, and labiovelars all remain distinct before front vowels, a conservation found otherwise in [[Luwian language|Luwian]] and related Anatolian languages. Thus PIE *''\u1e31'', *''k'', and *''k\u02b7'' become ''th'', ''q'', and ''s'', respectively (before back vowels *''\u1e31'' becomes ''th'', while *''k'' and *''k\u02b7'' merge as ''k'').{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} \n\nA minority of scholars reconstruct a fourth [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeal]] *''h\u2084'' allegedly surfacing as Alb.

Throughout this time, an intermediate subdialect spoken around [[Elbasan]] served as ''lingua franca'' among the Albanians, but was less prevalent in writing. The [[Congress of Manastir]] of Albanian writers held in 1908 recommended the use of the Elbasan subdialect for literary purposes and as a basis of a unified national language. While technically classified as a southern Gheg variety, the Elbasan speech is closer to Tosk in phonology and practically a hybrid between other Gheg subdialects and literary Tosk.<ref name=Agim />\n\nBetween 1916 and 1918, the [[Albanian Literary Commission]] met in Shkod\u00ebr under the leadership of [[Luigj Gurakuqi]] with the purpose of establishing a unified orthography for the language. The Commission, made up of representatives from the north and south of Albania, reaffirmed the Elbasan subdialect as the basis of a national tongue. The rules published in 1917 defined spelling for the Elbasan variety for official purposes. The Commission did not, however, discourage publications in one of the dialects, but rather laid a foundation for Gheg and Tosk to gradually converge into one.<ref name=\"Agim\"/>\n\nWhen the Congress of Lushnje met in the aftermath of World War I to form a new Albanian government, the 1917 decisions of the Literary Commission were upheld. The Elbasan subdialect remained in use for administrative purposes and many new writers embraced for creative writing.

Criticism of Standard Albanian has centred on the exclusion of the 'me+' infinitive and the Gheg lexicon. Critics say that Standard Albanian disenfranchises and stigmatizes Gheg speakers, affecting the quality of writing and impairing effective public communication. Supporters of the Tosk standard view the [[Albanian Orthography Congress|1972 Congress]] as a milestone achievement in Albanian history and dismiss calls for reform as efforts to \"divide the nation\" or \"create two languages.\" Moderates, who are especially prevalent in Kosovo, generally stress the need for a unified Albanian language, but believe that the 'me+' infinitive and Gheg words should be included. Proponents of the Elbasan dialect have been vocal, but have gathered little support in the public opinion. In general, those involved in the language debate come from diverse backgrounds and there is no significant correlation between one's political views, geographic origin, and position on Standard Albanian.\n\nMany writers continue to write in the Elbasan dialect but other Gheg variants have found much more limited use in literature. Most publications adhere to a strict policy of not accepting submissions that are not written in Tosk. Some print media even translate direct speech, replacing the 'me+' infinitive with other verb forms and making other changes in grammar and word choice. Even authors who have published in the Elbasan dialect will frequently write in the Tosk standard.\n\nIn 2013, a group of academics for Albania and Kosovo proposed minor changes to the orthography.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://plisi.org/gjuhsi/sugjerime-verejtje-ndryshimeve-drejtshkrim/|title=Sugjerime e v\u00ebrejtje rreth ndryshimeve n\u00eb drejtshkrim|last=Morina|first=Agim|date=16 March 2016|website=Plisi.org|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref> Hardline academics boycotted the initiative,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sot.com.al/kultura-intervista/emil-lafe-k%c3%abshilli-nd%c3%abrakademik-p%c3%abr-gjuh%c3%abn-shqipe-ec%c3%abn-pa-busull-ende-pa-nj%c3%ab|title=Emil Lafe: K\u00ebshilli Nd\u00ebrakademik p\u00ebr Gjuh\u00ebn Shqipe ec\u00ebn pa busull, ende pa nj\u00eb platform\u00eb shkencore t\u00eb miratuar nj\u00ebz\u00ebri|last=Vrapi|first=Julia|date=27 April 2013|website=Sot.com.al|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref> while other reformers have viewed it as well-intentioned but flawed and superficial.<ref name=\":0\" /> Media such as Rrokum and ''Java'' have offered content that is almost exclusively in the Elbasan dialect.

The literacy rate in Albania for the total population, age 9 or older, is about 99%. Elementary education is compulsory (grades 1\u20139), but most students continue at least until a secondary education. Students must pass graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade and at the end of the 12th grade in order to continue their education.\n\n== Phonology ==\nStandard Albanian has 7 [[vowel]]s and 29 [[consonant]]s. Like English, Albanian has dental fricatives {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} (like the ''th'' in ''thin'') and {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} (like the ''th'' in ''this''), written as ''th'' and ''dh,'' which are rare cross-linguistically.\n\n[[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] uses [[long vowel|long]] and [[nasal vowel]]s, which are absent in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], and the mid-central vowel ''\u00eb'' is lost at the end of the word. The stress is fixed mainly on the last syllable. Gheg ''n'' (''fem\u00ebn'': compare English ''feminine'') changes to ''r'' by [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]] in Tosk (''fem\u00ebr'').\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"  colspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Interdental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Postalveolar consonant|Post-<br />alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! {{small|plain}}\n! {{small|[[Velarization|velar.]]}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA|m}}\n|\n| {{IPA|n}}\n| ||\n| {{IPA|\u0272}}\n| ({{IPA|\u014b}})\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Stop consonant|Plosive]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA|p}}\n|\n| {{IPA|t}}\n| || ||\n| {{IPA|k}}\n|\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA|b}}\n|\n| {{IPA|d}}\n| || ||\n| {{IPA|\u0261}}\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| ||\n| {{IPA|t\u0361s}}\n|\n| {{IPA|t\u0361\u0283}}\n| {{IPA|c\u0361\u00e7}}\n| ||\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| ||\n| {{IPA|d\u0361z}}\n|\n| {{IPA|d\u0361\u0292}}\n| {{IPA|\u025f\u0361\u029d}}\n| ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA|f}}\n| {{IPA|\u03b8}}\n| {{IPA|s}}\n|\n| {{IPA|\u0283}}\n| ||\n| {{IPA|h}}\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA|v}}\n| {{IPA|\u00f0}}\n| {{IPA|z}}\n|\n| {{IPA|\u0292}}\n| || ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| ||\n| {{IPA|l}}\n| {{IPA|\u026b}}\n|\n| {{IPA|j}}\n| ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Flap consonant|Flap]]\n| ||\n| {{IPA|\u027e}}\n| || || || ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n| ||\n| {{IPA|r}}\n| || || || ||\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It is pronounced as one sound, not a nasal plus a glide.\n* The ''ll'' sound is a velarised lateral, close to English ''[[dark L]]''.\n* The letter ''\u00e7'' is sometimes written ''ch'' due to technical limitations because of its use in English sound and its analogy to the other [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s ''xh'', ''sh'', and ''zh''. Usually it is written simply ''c'' or more rarely ''q'' with context resolving any ambiguities.\n* The position of ''q'' and ''gj'' sound is not clear.

Its complex system of [[Grammatical mood|mood]]s (six types) and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]s (three simple and five complex constructions) is distinctive among [[Balkan languages]]. There are two general types of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]].\n\nAlbanian verbs, like those of other Balkan languages, have an \"[[admirative]]\" mood (''m\u00ebnyra habitore'') that is used to indicate surprise on the part of the speaker or to imply that an event is known to the speaker by report and not by direct observation.

The book was written in the [[Gheg]] dialect in the [[Latin script]] with some Slavic letters adapted for Albanian vowels. The book was discovered in 1740 by [[Gjon Nikoll\u00eb Kazazi]], the Albanian [[archbishop]] of [[Skopje]]. It contains the liturgies of the main [[holiday]]s. There are also texts of prayers and rituals and [[catechism|catechetical]] texts. The grammar and the vocabulary are more archaic than those in the Gheg texts from the 17th century. The 188 pages of the book comprise about 154,000 words with a total vocabulary of c. 1,500 different words. The text is archaic yet easily interpreted because it is mainly a translation of known texts, in particular portions of the [[Bible]]. The book also contains passages from the [[Psalm]]s, the [[Book of Isaiah]], the [[Book of Jeremiah]], the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Letters to the Corinthians]], and many illustrations. The uniformity of spelling seems to indicate an earlier tradition of writing.

The first and smallest occurred at the time of less significant interaction. The final period, probably preceding the [[Migration Period|Slavic or Germanic invasions]], also has a notably smaller number of borrowings. Each layer is characterized by a different treatment of most vowels: the first layer follows the evolution of Early Proto-Albanian into Albanian; while later layers reflect vowel changes endemic to Late Latin (and presumably [[Proto-Romance language|Proto-Romance]]). Other formative changes include the syncretism of several noun case endings, especially in the plural, as well as a large-scale palatalization.\n\nA brief period followed, between the 7th and the 9th&nbsp;centuries, that was marked by heavy borrowings from [[South Slavic languages|Southern Slavic]], some of which predate the \"o-a\" shift common to the modern forms of this language group. Starting in the latter 9th century, there was a period characterized by protracted contact with the [[Proto-Romanian language|Proto-Romanians]], or [[Vlachs]], though lexical borrowing seems to have been mostly one sided: from Albanian into Romanian. Such borrowing indicates that the [[Romanians]] migrated from an area where the majority was Slavic (i.e. Middle Bulgarian) to an area with a majority of Albanian speakers (i.e. [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]], where Vlachs are recorded in the 10th&nbsp;century).{{citation needed |date=May 2017}} Their movement is presumably related to the expansion of the [[Bulgarian Empire]] into Albania around that time.\n\n==== Early Greek loans ====\nThere are some 30 [[Ancient Greek]] loanwords in Albanian.<ref name=\"Linguistics p.412\"/> Many of these reflect a dialect which voiced its aspirants, as did the Macedonian dialect.

Meyer noted the similarity between the Albanian verbs ''shqipoj'' \"to speak clearly, enunciate\" and ''shqiptoj'' \"to pronounce, articulate\" and the Latin word ''excipio'' (meaning \"to welcome\"). Therefore, he believed that the word ''Shqiptar'' \"Albanian person\" was derived from ''shqipoj'', which in turn was derived from the Latin word ''excipere''.

The [[Romance languages]] inherited these words from Vulgar Latin: ''cingula'' became Romanian ''chinga'' \u2018girdle; saddle girth\u2019, and Vulgar Latin ''[[Veteranus|veter\u0101nus]]''  became Romanian ''b\u0103tr\u00e2n'' \u2018old\u2019.\n\nAlbanian, [[Basque language|Basque]], and the surviving [[Celtic languages]] such as [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] are the non-Romance languages today that have this sort of extensive Latin element dating from ancient Roman times, which has undergone the sound changes associated with the languages. Other languages in or near the former Roman area either came on the scene later (Turkish, the Slavic languages, Arabic) or borrowed little from Latin despite coexisting with it (Greek, German), although German does have a few such ancient Latin loanwords (''Fenster'' \u2018window\u2019, ''K\u00e4se'' \u2018cheese\u2019, ''K\u00f6ln'').\n\nRomanian scholars such as Vatasescu and Mihaescu, using lexical analysis of the Albanian language, have concluded that Albanian was heavily influenced by an extinct Romance language that was distinct from both Romanian and [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]]. Because the Latin words common to only Romanian and Albanian are significantly fewer in number than those that are common to only Albanian and Western Romance, Mihaescu argues that the Albanian language evolved in a region with much greater contact with Western Romance regions than with Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day Albania, Kosovo and Western Macedonia, spanning east to [[Bitola]] and [[Pristina]].<ref name=\"MadgearuAlbanianRomans\">{{cite book |author1=Madgearu, Alexandru |author2=Gordon, Martin |title=The Wars of the Balkan Peninsula: Their Medieval Origins |pages=146\u2013147}}</ref>\n\n==== Gothic loans ====\n\nSome [[Gothic language|Gothic]] loanwords were borrowed through [[Late Latin]], while others came from the Ostrogothic expansion into parts of Praevalitana around Nik\u0161i\u0107 and the Gulf of Kotor in Montenegro.\n\n* fat; \"groom, husband\" < Goth ''br\u016b\u00fe'''fa\u00fe'''s'' \"bridegroom\"<ref>The word ''fat'' has both the meaning of \"fate, luck\" and \"groom, husband\".

Examples of words borrowed from Latin: ''qytet < civitas'' (city), ''qiell < caelum'' (sky), ''mik < amicus'' (friend), ''kape dit\u00ebn < carpe diem'' (seize the day).\n\nAfter the [[Slavs]] arrived in the [[Balkans]], the [[Slavic languages]] became an additional source of loanwords. The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] meant an influx of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words; this also entailed the borrowing of Persian and Arabic words through Turkish. Some Turkish personal names, such as ''Altin'', are common. There are some loanwords from Modern Greek, especially in the south of Albania. Many borrowed words have been replaced by words with Albanian roots or modern Latinized (international) words.\n\n==== Patterns in loaning ====\nAlthough Albanian is characterized by the absorption of many loans, even, in the case of Latin, reaching deep into the core vocabulary, certain semantic fields nevertheless remained more resistant. Terms pertaining to social organization are often preserved, though not those pertaining to political organization, while those pertaining to trade are all loaned or innovated.<ref>Orel 2002: p263</ref>\n\nHydronyms present a complicated picture; the term for \"sea\" (''det'') is native and an \"Albano-Germanic\" innovation referring to the concept of depth, but a large amount of maritime vocabulary is loaned. Words referring to large streams and their banks tend to be loans, but ''lum\u00eb'' (\"river\") is native, as is ''rrym\u00eb'' (the flow of water). Words for smaller streams and stagnant pools of water are more often native, but the word for \"pond\", ''pellg'' is in fact a semantically shifted descendant of the old Greek word for \"high sea\", suggesting a change in location after Greek contact. Albanian has maintained since Proto-Indo-European a specific term referring to a riverside forest (''gjaz\u00eb''), as well as its words for marshes. Curiously, Albanian has maintained native terms for \"whirlpool\", \"water pit\" and (aquatic) \"deep place\", leading Orel to speculate that the Albanian [[Urheimat]] likely had an excess of dangerous whirlpools and depths.<ref>Orel 2002: p264-265</ref>\n\nRegarding forests, words for most conifers and shrubs are native, as are the terms for \"alder\", \"elm\", \"oak\", \"beech\", and \"linden\", while \"ash\", \"chestnut\", \"birch\", \"maple\", \"poplar\", and \"willow\" are loans.<ref>Orel pages 266\u2013267</ref>\n\nThe original kinship terminology of Indo-European was radically reshaped; changes included a shift from \"mother\" to \"sister\", and were so thorough that only three terms retained their original function, the words for \"son-in-law\", \"mother-in-law\" and \"father-in-law\". All the words for second-degree blood kinship, including \"aunt\", \"uncle\", \"nephew\", \"niece\", and terms for grandchildren, are ancient loans from Latin.<ref>Orel 2012: p262</ref>\n\nThe Proto-Albanians appear to have been cattle breeders given the vastness of preserved native vocabulary pertaining to cow breeding, milking and so forth, while words pertaining to dogs tend to be loaned. Many words concerning horses are preserved, but the word for horse itself is a Latin loan.<ref>Orel: p267-268</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Languages}}\n* [[Abetare]]\n* [[Arb\u00ebresh language]]\n* [[Arvanitika]] \n* [[Gheg Albanian]]\n* [[Illyrian languages]]\n* [[Help:IPA/Albanian|IPA/Albanian]]\n* [[Messapian language]]\n* [[Thraco-Illyrian]]\n* [[Tosk Albanian]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{note|a}} Co-official language.\n\n{| style=\"margin-left:13px; line-height:150%\"\n|align=\"right\" valign=\"top\"|a.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|{{note|status}}{{Kosovo-note}}\n|}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* Ajeti, Idriz. \u201cLa pr\u00e9sence de l\u2019albanais dans les parlers des populations slaves de la P\u00e9ninsule balkanique \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la langue et de la toponymie\u201d, ''[[Studia Albanica]]'' 2 (1968): 131\u20136.\n* Ajeti, Idriz. \u201cP\u00ebr historin\u00eb e marr\u00ebdh\u00ebnieve t\u00eb hershme gjuh\u00ebsore shqiptare-sllave\u201d, ''[[Studime Filologjike]]'' 4 (1972): 83\u201394 (reprint in ''Gjurmime albanologjike \u2013 Seria e shkencave filologjike II \u2013 1972''.

The history of Albanian language orthography is closely related to the cultural orientation and knowledge of certain foreign languages among Albanian writers.{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=12}} The earliest written Albanian records come from the Gheg area in makeshift spellings based on Italian or Greek. Originally, the Tosk dialect was written in the [[Greek alphabet]] and the Gheg dialect was written in the [[Latin script]]. Both dialects had also been written in the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] version of the [[Arabic script]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and some local alphabets ([[Elbasan alphabet|Elbasan]], [[Vithkuqi alphabet|Vithkuqi]], [[Todhri alphabet|Todhri]], Veso Bey, Jan Vellara and others, see [[Albanian alphabet#Original Alphabets|original Albanian alphabets]]). More specifically, the writers from northern Albania and under the influence of the Catholic Church used Latin letters, those in southern Albania and under the influence of the Greek Orthodox church used Greek letters, while others throughout Albania and under the influence of Islam used Arabic letters. There were initial attempts to create an original Albanian alphabet during the 1750\u20131850 period. These attempts intensified after the [[League of Prizren]] and culminated with the [[Congress of Manastir]] held by Albanian intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Manastir (present day [[Bitola]]), which decided on which alphabet to use, and what the standardized spelling would be for standard Albanian. This is how the literary language remains. The alphabet is the Latin alphabet with the addition of the letters <[[\u00eb]]>, <[[\u00e7]]>, and ten [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: ''dh'', ''th'', ''xh'', ''gj'', ''nj'', ''ng'', ''ll'', ''rr'', ''zh'' and ''sh''.\n\nAccording to [[Robert Elsie]]:<ref name=Elsie2017/>\n<blockquote>The hundred years between 1750 and 1850 were an age of astounding orthographic diversity in Albania. In this period, the Albanian language was put to writing in at least ten different alphabets \u2013 most certainly a record for European languages. ... the diverse forms in which this old Balkan language was recorded, from the earliest documents to the beginning of the twentieth century ... consist of adaptations of the Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Cyrillic alphabets and (what is even more interesting) a number of locally invented writing systems. Most of the latter alphabets have now been forgotten and are unknown, even to the Albanians themselves.<ref name=Elsie2017>Elsie, Robert. (2017). ''Albanian Alphabets: Borrowed and Invented''.

For example, the word for 'fish' is borrowed from Latin, but not the word for 'gills', which is native. Indigenous are also the words for 'ship', 'raft', 'navigation', 'sea shelves' and a few names of fish kinds, but not the words for 'sail', 'row' and 'harbor' \u2013 objects pertaining to navigation itself and a large part of sea fauna. This rather shows that Proto-Albanians were pushed away from coastal areas in early times (probably after the Latin conquest of the region) thus losing large parts (or the majority) of sea environment lexicon. A similar phenomenon could be observed with agricultural terms. While the words for 'arable land', 'corn', 'wheat', 'cereals', 'vineyard', 'yoke', 'harvesting', 'cattle breeding', etc. are native, the words for 'ploughing', 'farm' and 'farmer', agricultural practices, and some harvesting tools are foreign. This, again, points to intense contact with other languages and people, rather than providing evidence of a possible ''Urheimat''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n[[File:Revista Albania.jpg|upright=0.95|thumb|1905 issue of the magazine ''Albania'', the most important Albanian periodical of the early 20th century]]\n\nThe centre of Albanian settlement remained the [[Mat (river)|Mat]] river.

===\n\nPhonologically, Albanian is not so conservative. Like many IE stocks, it has merged the two series of voiced stops (e.g. both *''d'' and *''d\u02b0'' became ''d''). In addition, voiced stops tend to disappear in between vowels. There is almost complete loss of final syllables and very widespread loss of other unstressed syllables (e.g. ''mik'' 'friend' from Lat. ''amicus''). PIE *''o'' appears as ''a'' (also as ''e'' if a high front vowel ''i'' follows), while *''\u0113'' and *''\u0101'' become ''o'', and PIE *''\u014d'' appears as ''e''. The palatals, velars, and labiovelars all remain distinct before front vowels, a conservation found otherwise in [[Luwian language|Luwian]] and related Anatolian languages. Thus PIE *''\u1e31'', *''k'', and *''k\u02b7'' become ''th'', ''q'', and ''s'', respectively (before back vowels *''\u1e31'' becomes ''th'', while *''k'' and *''k\u02b7'' merge as ''k'').{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} \n\nA minority of scholars reconstruct a fourth [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeal]] *''h\u2084'' allegedly surfacing as Alb.

Throughout this time, an intermediate subdialect spoken around [[Elbasan]] served as ''lingua franca'' among the Albanians, but was less prevalent in writing. The [[Congress of Manastir]] of Albanian writers held in 1908 recommended the use of the Elbasan subdialect for literary purposes and as a basis of a unified national language. While technically classified as a southern Gheg variety, the Elbasan speech is closer to Tosk in phonology and practically a hybrid between other Gheg subdialects and literary Tosk.<ref name=Agim />\n\nBetween 1916 and 1918, the [[Albanian Literary Commission]] met in Shkod\u00ebr under the leadership of [[Luigj Gurakuqi]] with the purpose of establishing a unified orthography for the language. The Commission, made up of representatives from the north and south of Albania, reaffirmed the Elbasan subdialect as the basis of a national tongue. The rules published in 1917 defined spelling for the Elbasan variety for official purposes. The Commission did not, however, discourage publications in one of the dialects, but rather laid a foundation for Gheg and Tosk to gradually converge into one.<ref name=\"Agim\"/>\n\nWhen the Congress of Lushnje met in the aftermath of World War I to form a new Albanian government, the 1917 decisions of the Literary Commission were upheld. The Elbasan subdialect remained in use for administrative purposes and many new writers embraced for creative writing. Gheg and Tosk continued to develop freely and interaction between the two dialects increased.\n\n=== Tosk standard ===\n{{further|Albanian Orthography Congress}}At the end of World War II, however, the new communist regime radically imposed the use of the Tosk dialect in all facets of life in Albania: administration, education, and literature.

Criticism of Standard Albanian has centred on the exclusion of the 'me+' infinitive and the Gheg lexicon. Critics say that Standard Albanian disenfranchises and stigmatizes Gheg speakers, affecting the quality of writing and impairing effective public communication. Supporters of the Tosk standard view the [[Albanian Orthography Congress|1972 Congress]] as a milestone achievement in Albanian history and dismiss calls for reform as efforts to \"divide the nation\" or \"create two languages.\" Moderates, who are especially prevalent in Kosovo, generally stress the need for a unified Albanian language, but believe that the 'me+' infinitive and Gheg words should be included. Proponents of the Elbasan dialect have been vocal, but have gathered little support in the public opinion. In general, those involved in the language debate come from diverse backgrounds and there is no significant correlation between one's political views, geographic origin, and position on Standard Albanian.\n\nMany writers continue to write in the Elbasan dialect but other Gheg variants have found much more limited use in literature. Most publications adhere to a strict policy of not accepting submissions that are not written in Tosk. Some print media even translate direct speech, replacing the 'me+' infinitive with other verb forms and making other changes in grammar and word choice. Even authors who have published in the Elbasan dialect will frequently write in the Tosk standard.\n\nIn 2013, a group of academics for Albania and Kosovo proposed minor changes to the orthography.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://plisi.org/gjuhsi/sugjerime-verejtje-ndryshimeve-drejtshkrim/|title=Sugjerime e v\u00ebrejtje rreth ndryshimeve n\u00eb drejtshkrim|last=Morina|first=Agim|date=16 March 2016|website=Plisi.org|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref> Hardline academics boycotted the initiative,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sot.com.al/kultura-intervista/emil-lafe-k%c3%abshilli-nd%c3%abrakademik-p%c3%abr-gjuh%c3%abn-shqipe-ec%c3%abn-pa-busull-ende-pa-nj%c3%ab|title=Emil Lafe: K\u00ebshilli Nd\u00ebrakademik p\u00ebr Gjuh\u00ebn Shqipe ec\u00ebn pa busull, ende pa nj\u00eb platform\u00eb shkencore t\u00eb miratuar nj\u00ebz\u00ebri|last=Vrapi|first=Julia|date=27 April 2013|website=Sot.com.al|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref> while other reformers have viewed it as well-intentioned but flawed and superficial.<ref name=\":0\" /> Media such as Rrokum and ''Java'' have offered content that is almost exclusively in the Elbasan dialect.

The literacy rate in Albania for the total population, age 9 or older, is about 99%. Elementary education is compulsory (grades 1\u20139), but most students continue at least until a secondary education. Students must pass graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade and at the end of the 12th grade in order to continue their education.\n\n== Phonology ==\nStandard Albanian has 7 [[vowel]]s and 29 [[consonant]]s. Like English, Albanian has dental fricatives {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} (like the ''th'' in ''thin'') and {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} (like the ''th'' in ''this''), written as ''th'' and ''dh,'' which are rare cross-linguistically.\n\n[[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] uses [[long vowel|long]] and [[nasal vowel]]s, which are absent in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], and the mid-central vowel ''\u00eb'' is lost at the end of the word. The stress is fixed mainly on the last syllable. Gheg ''n'' (''fem\u00ebn'': compare English ''feminine'') changes to ''r'' by [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]] in Tosk (''fem\u00ebr'').\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"  colspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Interdental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Postalveolar consonant|Post-<br />alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n! {{small|plain}}\n! {{small|[[Velarization|velar.]]}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA|m}}\n|\n| {{IPA|n}}\n| ||\n| {{IPA|\u0272}}\n| ({{IPA|\u014b}})\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Stop consonant|Plosive]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA|p}}\n|\n| {{IPA|t}}\n| || ||\n| {{IPA|k}}\n|\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA|b}}\n|\n| {{IPA|d}}\n| || ||\n| {{IPA|\u0261}}\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| ||\n| {{IPA|t\u0361s}}\n|\n| {{IPA|t\u0361\u0283}}\n| {{IPA|c\u0361\u00e7}}\n| ||\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| ||\n| {{IPA|d\u0361z}}\n|\n| {{IPA|d\u0361\u0292}}\n| {{IPA|\u025f\u0361\u029d}}\n| ||\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA|f}}\n| {{IPA|\u03b8}}\n| {{IPA|s}}\n|\n| {{IPA|\u0283}}\n| ||\n| {{IPA|h}}\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA|v}}\n| {{IPA|\u00f0}}\n| {{IPA|z}}\n|\n| {{IPA|\u0292}}\n| || ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| ||\n| {{IPA|l}}\n| {{IPA|\u026b}}\n|\n| {{IPA|j}}\n| ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Flap consonant|Flap]]\n| ||\n| {{IPA|\u027e}}\n| || || || ||\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n| ||\n| {{IPA|r}}\n| || || || ||\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In most of the dialects, as also in standard Albanian, the single \"r\" changes from an alveolar flap {{IPA|/\u027e/}} into a retroflex flap {{IPA|[\u027d]}}, or even an alveolar approximant {{IPA|[\u0279]}} when it is at the end of a word.\n* The palatal nasal {{IPA|/\u0272/}} corresponds to the Spanish ''\u00f1'' and the French and Italian ''gn''. It is pronounced as one sound, not a nasal plus a glide.\n* The ''ll'' sound is a velarised lateral, close to English ''[[dark L]]''.\n* The letter ''\u00e7'' is sometimes written ''ch'' due to technical limitations because of its use in English sound and its analogy to the other [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s ''xh'', ''sh'', and ''zh''. Usually it is written simply ''c'' or more rarely ''q'' with context resolving any ambiguities.\n* The position of ''q'' and ''gj'' sound is not clear. Many speakers merge them into the palatoalveolar sounds ''\u00e7'' and ''xh''. This is especially common in Northern Gheg, but is increasingly the case in Tosk as well.<ref>Kolgjini, Julie M. (2004).

There are five [[declension]]s and six cases ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative]], and [[vocative]]), although the vocative only occurs with a limited number of words, and the forms of the genitive and dative are identical (a genitive is produced when the prepositions ''i/e/t\u00eb/s\u00eb'' are used with the dative). Some dialects also retain a locative case, which is not present in standard Albanian.

Its complex system of [[Grammatical mood|mood]]s (six types) and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]s (three simple and five complex constructions) is distinctive among [[Balkan languages]]. There are two general types of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]].\n\nAlbanian verbs, like those of other Balkan languages, have an \"[[admirative]]\" mood (''m\u00ebnyra habitore'') that is used to indicate surprise on the part of the speaker or to imply that an event is known to the speaker by report and not by direct observation. In some contexts, this mood can be translated using English \"apparently\".\n\n* ''Ti '''flet''' shqip.'' \"You '''speak''' Albanian.\" (indicative)\n* ''Ti '''fliske''' shqip!'' \"You '''(surprisingly) speak''' Albanian!\" (admirative)\n* ''Rruga '''\u00ebsht\u00eb''' e mbyllur.'' \"The street '''is''' closed.\" (indicative)\n* ''Rruga '''qenka''' e mbyllur.'' \"'''(Apparently,)''' The street '''is''' closed.\" (admirative)\n\nFor more information on verb conjugation and on inflection of other parts of speech, see [[Albanian morphology]].\n\n=== Word order ===\nAlbanian word order is relatively free.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} To say 'Agim ate all the oranges' in Albanian, one may use any of the following orders, with slight pragmatic differences:\n\n* [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]]: Agimi i h\u00ebngri t\u00eb gjith\u00eb portokall\u00ebt.\n* [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]]: Agimi t\u00eb gjith\u00eb portokall\u00ebt i h\u00ebngri.\n* [[Object\u2013verb\u2013subject|OVS]]: T\u00eb gjith\u00eb portokall\u00ebt i h\u00ebngri Agimi.\n* [[Object\u2013subject\u2013verb|OSV]]: T\u00eb gjith\u00eb portokall\u00ebt Agimi i h\u00ebngri.\n* [[Verb\u2013subject\u2013object|VSO]]: I h\u00ebngri Agimi t\u00eb gjith\u00eb portokall\u00ebt.\n\nHowever, the most common order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].\n\nThe verb can optionally occur in sentence-initial position, especially with verbs in the non-active form (''forma joveprore''):\n\n* '''''Parashikohet''' nj\u00eb nd\u00ebrprerje'' \"An interruption '''is anticipated'''\".\n\n=== Negation ===\nVerbal negation in Albanian is mood-dependent, a trait shared with some fellow [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\nIn indicative, conditional, or admirative sentences, negation is expressed by the particles ''nuk'' or ''s''' in front of the verb, for example:\n\n* ''Toni nuk flet anglisht'' \"Tony does not speak English\";\n* ''Toni s'flet anglisht'' \"Tony doesn't speak English\";\n* ''Nuk e di'' \"I do not know\";\n* ''S'e di'' \"I don't know\".\n\nSubjunctive, imperative, optative, or non-finite forms of verbs are negated with the particle ''mos'':\n\n* ''Mos harro'' \"do not forget!\".\n\n=== Numerals ===\n{|\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| nj\u00eb\u2014one\n| tet\u00ebmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014eighteen\n|-\n| dy\u2014two\n| n\u00ebnt\u00ebmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014nineteen\n|-\n| tri/tre\u2014three\n| nj\u00ebzet\u2014twenty\n|-\n| kat\u00ebr\u2014four\n| nj\u00ebzetenj\u00eb\u2014twenty-one\n|-\n| pes\u00eb\u2014five\n| nj\u00ebzetedy\u2014twenty-two\n|-\n| gjasht\u00eb\u2014six\n| tridhjet\u00eb\u2014thirty\n|-\n| shtat\u00eb\u2014seven\n| dyzet/kat\u00ebrdhjet\u00eb\u2014forty\n|-\n| tet\u00eb\u2014eight\n| pes\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014fifty\n|-\n| n\u00ebnt\u00eb\u2014nine\n| gjasht\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014sixty\n|-\n| dhjet\u00eb\u2014ten\n| shtat\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014seventy\n|-\n| nj\u00ebmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014eleven\n| tet\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014eighty\n|-\n| dymb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014twelve\n| n\u00ebnt\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014ninety\n|-\n| tremb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014thirteen\n| nj\u00ebqind\u2014one hundred\n|-\n| kat\u00ebrmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014fourteen\n| pes\u00ebqind\u2014five hundred\n|-\n| pes\u00ebmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014fifteen\n| nj\u00ebmij\u00eb\u2014one thousand\n|-\n| gjasht\u00ebmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014sixteen\n| nj\u00eb milion\u2014one million\n|-\n| shtat\u00ebmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb\u2014seventeen\n| nj\u00eb miliard\u2014one billion\n|}\n|}\n\n== Literary tradition ==\n\n=== Earliest undisputed texts ===\n[[File:Buzuku meshari.jpg|thumb|[[Meshari]] of [[Gjon Buzuku]] 1554\u20131555]]\nThe earliest known texts in Albanian:\n* the \"[[formula e pag\u00ebzimit]]\" (Baptismal Formula), which dates back to 1462 and was authored by [[Pal Engj\u00eblli]] (or Paulus Angelus) (c. 1417&nbsp;\u2013 1470), Archbishop of [[Durr\u00ebs]]. Engj\u00eblli was a close friend and counsellor of [[Skanderbeg]].{{sfn|Prifti|1982|p=3}} It was written in a pastoral letter for a synod at the Holy Trinity in Mat and read in Latin characters as follows: ''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et Spertit Senit'' (standard Albanian: \"Un\u00eb t\u00eb pag\u00ebzoj n\u00eb em\u00ebr t\u00eb Atit, t\u00eb Birit e t\u00eb Shpirtit t\u00eb Shenjt\u00eb\"; English: \"I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit\"). It was discovered and published in 1915 by [[Nicolae Iorga]].{{sfn|Iorga|1s971|p=102}}\n* the ''[[Fjalori i Arnold von Harfit]]'' ([[Arnold Ritter von Harff's lexicon]]), a short list of Albanian phrases with German glosses, dated 1496.{{sfn|Anamali|2002|p=311}}\n* a song, recorded in the Greek alphabet, retrieved from an old [[codex]] that was written in Greek.

Although the codex is dated to during the 14th century, the song, written in Albanian by an anonymous writer, seems to be a 16th-century writing. The document was found by [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb]] people who had emigrated to Italy in the 15th century.{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=97}}\n* The first book in Albanian is the [[Meshari]] (\"The Missal\"), written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] between 20 March 1554 and 5 January 1555. The book was written in the [[Gheg]] dialect in the [[Latin script]] with some Slavic letters adapted for Albanian vowels. The book was discovered in 1740 by [[Gjon Nikoll\u00eb Kazazi]], the Albanian [[archbishop]] of [[Skopje]]. It contains the liturgies of the main [[holiday]]s. There are also texts of prayers and rituals and [[catechism|catechetical]] texts. The grammar and the vocabulary are more archaic than those in the Gheg texts from the 17th century. The 188 pages of the book comprise about 154,000 words with a total vocabulary of c. 1,500 different words. The text is archaic yet easily interpreted because it is mainly a translation of known texts, in particular portions of the [[Bible]]. The book also contains passages from the [[Psalm]]s, the [[Book of Isaiah]], the [[Book of Jeremiah]], the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Letters to the Corinthians]], and many illustrations. The uniformity of spelling seems to indicate an earlier tradition of writing. The only known copy of the Meshari is held by the [[Vatican Library|Apostolic Library]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Meshari | url=http://www.bksh.al/gsdl/cgi-bin/library.exe?e=d-01000-00---off-0antikuar--00-1--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-about---00-3-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&a=d&c=antikuar&cl=CL2.3 | publisher=[[National Library of Albania]] | author= | date= | accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> In 1968 the book was published with transliterations and comments by linguists.\n\nAlbanian scripts were produced earlier than the first attested document, \u201cformula e pag\u00ebzimit\u201d, but none yet have been discovered.

The first and smallest occurred at the time of less significant interaction. The final period, probably preceding the [[Migration Period|Slavic or Germanic invasions]], also has a notably smaller number of borrowings. Each layer is characterized by a different treatment of most vowels: the first layer follows the evolution of Early Proto-Albanian into Albanian; while later layers reflect vowel changes endemic to Late Latin (and presumably [[Proto-Romance language|Proto-Romance]]). Other formative changes include the syncretism of several noun case endings, especially in the plural, as well as a large-scale palatalization.\n\nA brief period followed, between the 7th and the 9th&nbsp;centuries, that was marked by heavy borrowings from [[South Slavic languages|Southern Slavic]], some of which predate the \"o-a\" shift common to the modern forms of this language group. Starting in the latter 9th century, there was a period characterized by protracted contact with the [[Proto-Romanian language|Proto-Romanians]], or [[Vlachs]], though lexical borrowing seems to have been mostly one sided: from Albanian into Romanian. Such borrowing indicates that the [[Romanians]] migrated from an area where the majority was Slavic (i.e. Middle Bulgarian) to an area with a majority of Albanian speakers (i.e. [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]], where Vlachs are recorded in the 10th&nbsp;century).{{citation needed |date=May 2017}} Their movement is presumably related to the expansion of the [[Bulgarian Empire]] into Albania around that time.\n\n==== Early Greek loans ====\nThere are some 30 [[Ancient Greek]] loanwords in Albanian.<ref name=\"Linguistics p.412\"/> Many of these reflect a dialect which voiced its aspirants, as did the Macedonian dialect.

The hard pronunciations of Latin {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} are retained as palatal and velar stops in the Albanian loanwords. Gustav Meyer (1888){{sfn|Meyer|1888|p=805}} and [[Wilhelm Meyer-L\u00fcbke]] (1914){{sfn|Meyer-L\u00fcbke|1914|p=32}} later corroborated this. Meyer noted the similarity between the Albanian verbs ''shqipoj'' \"to speak clearly, enunciate\" and ''shqiptoj'' \"to pronounce, articulate\" and the Latin word ''excipio'' (meaning \"to welcome\"). Therefore, he believed that the word ''Shqiptar'' \"Albanian person\" was derived from ''shqipoj'', which in turn was derived from the Latin word ''excipere''. [[Johann Georg von Hahn]], an Austrian linguist, had proposed the same hypothesis in 1854.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wir sind die Deinen.

The [[Romance languages]] inherited these words from Vulgar Latin: ''cingula'' became Romanian ''chinga'' \u2018girdle; saddle girth\u2019, and Vulgar Latin ''[[Veteranus|veter\u0101nus]]''  became Romanian ''b\u0103tr\u00e2n'' \u2018old\u2019.\n\nAlbanian, [[Basque language|Basque]], and the surviving [[Celtic languages]] such as [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] are the non-Romance languages today that have this sort of extensive Latin element dating from ancient Roman times, which has undergone the sound changes associated with the languages. Other languages in or near the former Roman area either came on the scene later (Turkish, the Slavic languages, Arabic) or borrowed little from Latin despite coexisting with it (Greek, German), although German does have a few such ancient Latin loanwords (''Fenster'' \u2018window\u2019, ''K\u00e4se'' \u2018cheese\u2019, ''K\u00f6ln'').\n\nRomanian scholars such as Vatasescu and Mihaescu, using lexical analysis of the Albanian language, have concluded that Albanian was heavily influenced by an extinct Romance language that was distinct from both Romanian and [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]]. Because the Latin words common to only Romanian and Albanian are significantly fewer in number than those that are common to only Albanian and Western Romance, Mihaescu argues that the Albanian language evolved in a region with much greater contact with Western Romance regions than with Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day Albania, Kosovo and Western Macedonia, spanning east to [[Bitola]] and [[Pristina]].<ref name=\"MadgearuAlbanianRomans\">{{cite book |author1=Madgearu, Alexandru |author2=Gordon, Martin |title=The Wars of the Balkan Peninsula: Their Medieval Origins |pages=146\u2013147}}</ref>\n\n==== Gothic loans ====\n\nSome [[Gothic language|Gothic]] loanwords were borrowed through [[Late Latin]], while others came from the Ostrogothic expansion into parts of Praevalitana around Nik\u0161i\u0107 and the Gulf of Kotor in Montenegro.\n\n* fat; \"groom, husband\" < Goth ''br\u016b\u00fe'''fa\u00fe'''s'' \"bridegroom\"<ref>The word ''fat'' has both the meaning of \"fate, luck\" and \"groom, husband\".

Examples of words borrowed from Latin: ''qytet < civitas'' (city), ''qiell < caelum'' (sky), ''mik < amicus'' (friend), ''kape dit\u00ebn < carpe diem'' (seize the day).\n\nAfter the [[Slavs]] arrived in the [[Balkans]], the [[Slavic languages]] became an additional source of loanwords. The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] meant an influx of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words; this also entailed the borrowing of Persian and Arabic words through Turkish. Some Turkish personal names, such as ''Altin'', are common. There are some loanwords from Modern Greek, especially in the south of Albania. Many borrowed words have been replaced by words with Albanian roots or modern Latinized (international) words.\n\n==== Patterns in loaning ====\nAlthough Albanian is characterized by the absorption of many loans, even, in the case of Latin, reaching deep into the core vocabulary, certain semantic fields nevertheless remained more resistant. Terms pertaining to social organization are often preserved, though not those pertaining to political organization, while those pertaining to trade are all loaned or innovated.<ref>Orel 2002: p263</ref>\n\nHydronyms present a complicated picture; the term for \"sea\" (''det'') is native and an \"Albano-Germanic\" innovation referring to the concept of depth, but a large amount of maritime vocabulary is loaned. Words referring to large streams and their banks tend to be loans, but ''lum\u00eb'' (\"river\") is native, as is ''rrym\u00eb'' (the flow of water). Words for smaller streams and stagnant pools of water are more often native, but the word for \"pond\", ''pellg'' is in fact a semantically shifted descendant of the old Greek word for \"high sea\", suggesting a change in location after Greek contact. Albanian has maintained since Proto-Indo-European a specific term referring to a riverside forest (''gjaz\u00eb''), as well as its words for marshes. Curiously, Albanian has maintained native terms for \"whirlpool\", \"water pit\" and (aquatic) \"deep place\", leading Orel to speculate that the Albanian [[Urheimat]] likely had an excess of dangerous whirlpools and depths.<ref>Orel 2002: p264-265</ref>\n\nRegarding forests, words for most conifers and shrubs are native, as are the terms for \"alder\", \"elm\", \"oak\", \"beech\", and \"linden\", while \"ash\", \"chestnut\", \"birch\", \"maple\", \"poplar\", and \"willow\" are loans.<ref>Orel pages 266\u2013267</ref>\n\nThe original kinship terminology of Indo-European was radically reshaped; changes included a shift from \"mother\" to \"sister\", and were so thorough that only three terms retained their original function, the words for \"son-in-law\", \"mother-in-law\" and \"father-in-law\". All the words for second-degree blood kinship, including \"aunt\", \"uncle\", \"nephew\", \"niece\", and terms for grandchildren, are ancient loans from Latin.<ref>Orel 2012: p262</ref>\n\nThe Proto-Albanians appear to have been cattle breeders given the vastness of preserved native vocabulary pertaining to cow breeding, milking and so forth, while words pertaining to dogs tend to be loaned.

That was followed by land issued to Alan Robinet in 1822. In 1863, Orangeville was named after Orange Lawrence, a businessman born in Connecticut in 1796 who owned several mills in the village. As a young man, he moved to Canada and settled in Halton County. During [[Upper Canada Rebellion|Mackenzie's rebellion]] in 1837, he was a captain in the militia. Lawrence purchased the land that became Orangeville from Robert Hughson.<ref>Source: The Orangeville Banner, March 8, 1951</ref> Orange Lawrence committed suicide December 15, 1861.<ref>{{cite web |title=Orange Lawrence |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Orange-Lawrence/6000000011198110820 |website=geni.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Former residents of Orange Lawrence\u2019s historic home learn how he died 156 years later|url=https://www.orangeville.com/community-story/7995765-former-residents-of-orange-lawrence-s-historic-home-learn-how-he-died-156-years-later/|website=orangeville.com |accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> In 1873, the Act of Incorporation was passed and Orangeville was given town status on January 1, 1874.  The public library, located at Broadway and Mill Street, was completed in 1908. [[Andrew Carnegie]], well-known businessman and philanthropist, provided financial assistance for its construction.\n\n==Economy==\nOrangeville serves as an administrative and commercial hub for Dufferin County, the northern portion of [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]] and the surrounding area. Orangeville's downtown core is home to several retail stores, and there is a cluster of [[big-box store]]s in the Fairgrounds Shopping Centre. Many residents in and around Orangeville also commute to other areas of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] for work.\n\nThere are a number of manufacturing plants located in the town. Major industrial employers include Greening Donald (automotive airbag components), Resolve Corporation (computer outsourcing), [[Clorox]] Company of Canada ([[Glad (company)|Glad]] garbage bags), Relizon Canada (pressure-sensitive labels), Rochling Engineering Plastics (formerly Symplastics Limited) (plastic sheets) and Sanoh Canada (automotive components). Orangeville is also the main banking center for residents in the area.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Orangeville town hall nov 5 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Orangeville Town Hall.]]\nThe main intersection in the heart of the town is Broadway (formerly [[Ontario Highway 9]]) and First Street. [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway 10]] runs through Orangeville on its east side.\n\nBeginning in 2005, a major roadwork project was initiated to resurface Broadway through Orangeville. The downtown section was completed in early 2006, with extensive work still to be done on the west end in late 2006. In conjunction with this project, there was another one completed in late 2006 that involved building large planters in the middle of Broadway through the downtown section between First and Third Streets (West - East). The project was controversial, as safety concerns had been raised by the Fire Department because the new concrete planters in the middle of the road have made the rights of way too narrow for fire trucks to properly set up in case of a fire in a downtown building.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nConstruction of the South Arterial Road, often referred to as the 'Orangeville by-pass', was completed on August 3, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Certificates and Notices Under the Construction Lien Act |url=http://dcnonl.com/csp/63985 |website=Daily Commercial News and Construction Record |publisher=Reed Business Information a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. |accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728133034/http://dcnonl.com/csp/63985 |archivedate=28 July 2011 |date=September 2, 2005}}</ref> The road runs from east to west, connecting Highway 10 and County Road 109 (formerly [[Ontario Highway 9|Highway 9]]). Much of the eastern stretch runs through the Town of [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]], but officially enters into Orangeville at the Townline Road controlled intersection.\n\n[[Aecon]] Construction and Materials Limited was the successful bidder for the Design Build project with a price of $9.8 million. The project was completed in conjunction with Brampton-based Armbro Construction, TSH Engineers Architects Planners, Peto MacCallum Ltd. and Gartner Lee Ltd.\n\n[[Orangeville Transit]] is the town's own public transit system, and there is a commuter [[GO Transit]] bus service to [[Brampton]]. In the early 1990s, preliminary plans were drawn up for GO Transit rail service to Orangeville. However, it never got past the drawing board.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nIndustries in Orangeville are served by the [[Orangeville Brampton Railway]], which purchased {{convert|55|km|abbr=out}} of surplus track from the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. The railway connects with the CPR in Streetsville, and also services customers in Brampton to the south. From 2004 to 2018, a tourist train was operated on weekends in summer months.\n\nIn 1906, survey work was underway for an electric railway line which would serve Orangeville, to be called the Huron and Ontario Electric Railway.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dipping Into the Past - Survey under way for electric railway across Dufferin |url=http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2006/1123/Columns/045.html |publisher=Orangeville Citizen |accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203233059/http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2006/1123/Columns/045.html |archivedate=3 February 2009 |date=November 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       =\n|state       =\n|shading     =\n|percentages =\n|footnote    =\n|1871|1458\n|1881|2847\n|1891|2962\n|1901|2511\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|2340\n|1921|2187\n|1931|2614\n|1941|2718\n|1951|3249\n|1961|4593\n|1971|8074\n|1981|13740\n|1991|17921\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|21498\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|25248\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|26925\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|27975\n| [[Canada 2016 Census|2016]] | 28900\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Canadian Census]],<ref name=cp2016/> the population of Orangeville is 28,900, a 3.3% increase from 2011, with a {{PAGR|2011|27975|2016|28900}} per annum average growth rate over the same period.

That was followed by land issued to Alan Robinet in 1822. In 1863, Orangeville was named after Orange Lawrence, a businessman born in Connecticut in 1796 who owned several mills in the village. As a young man, he moved to Canada and settled in Halton County. During [[Upper Canada Rebellion|Mackenzie's rebellion]] in 1837, he was a captain in the militia. Lawrence purchased the land that became Orangeville from Robert Hughson.<ref>Source: The Orangeville Banner, March 8, 1951</ref> Orange Lawrence committed suicide December 15, 1861.<ref>{{cite web |title=Orange Lawrence |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Orange-Lawrence/6000000011198110820 |website=geni.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Former residents of Orange Lawrence\u2019s historic home learn how he died 156 years later|url=https://www.orangeville.com/community-story/7995765-former-residents-of-orange-lawrence-s-historic-home-learn-how-he-died-156-years-later/|website=orangeville.com |accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> In 1873, the Act of Incorporation was passed and Orangeville was given town status on January 1, 1874.  The public library, located at Broadway and Mill Street, was completed in 1908. [[Andrew Carnegie]], well-known businessman and philanthropist, provided financial assistance for its construction.\n\n==Economy==\nOrangeville serves as an administrative and commercial hub for Dufferin County, the northern portion of [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]] and the surrounding area. Orangeville's downtown core is home to several retail stores, and there is a cluster of [[big-box store]]s in the Fairgrounds Shopping Centre. Many residents in and around Orangeville also commute to other areas of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] for work.\n\nThere are a number of manufacturing plants located in the town. Major industrial employers include Greening Donald (automotive airbag components), Resolve Corporation (computer outsourcing), [[Clorox]] Company of Canada ([[Glad (company)|Glad]] garbage bags), Relizon Canada (pressure-sensitive labels), Rochling Engineering Plastics (formerly Symplastics Limited) (plastic sheets) and Sanoh Canada (automotive components). Orangeville is also the main banking center for residents in the area.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Orangeville town hall nov 5 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Orangeville Town Hall.]]\nThe main intersection in the heart of the town is Broadway (formerly [[Ontario Highway 9]]) and First Street. [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway 10]] runs through Orangeville on its east side.\n\nBeginning in 2005, a major roadwork project was initiated to resurface Broadway through Orangeville. The downtown section was completed in early 2006, with extensive work still to be done on the west end in late 2006. In conjunction with this project, there was another one completed in late 2006 that involved building large planters in the middle of Broadway through the downtown section between First and Third Streets (West - East). The project was controversial, as safety concerns had been raised by the Fire Department because the new concrete planters in the middle of the road have made the rights of way too narrow for fire trucks to properly set up in case of a fire in a downtown building.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nConstruction of the South Arterial Road, often referred to as the 'Orangeville by-pass', was completed on August 3, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Certificates and Notices Under the Construction Lien Act |url=http://dcnonl.com/csp/63985 |website=Daily Commercial News and Construction Record |publisher=Reed Business Information a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. |accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728133034/http://dcnonl.com/csp/63985 |archivedate=28 July 2011 |date=September 2, 2005}}</ref> The road runs from east to west, connecting [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway 10]] and County Road 109 (formerly [[Ontario Highway 9|Highway 9]]). Much of the eastern stretch runs through the Town of [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]], but officially enters into Orangeville at the Townline Road controlled intersection.\n\n[[Aecon]] Construction and Materials Limited was the successful bidder for the Design Build project with a price of $9.8 million. The project was completed in conjunction with Brampton-based Armbro Construction, TSH Engineers Architects Planners, Peto MacCallum Ltd. and Gartner Lee Ltd.\n\n[[Orangeville Transit]] is the town's own public transit system, and there is a commuter [[GO Transit]] bus service to [[Brampton]]. In the early 1990s, preliminary plans were drawn up for GO Transit rail service to Orangeville. However, it never got past the drawing board.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nIndustries in Orangeville are served by the [[Orangeville Brampton Railway]], which purchased {{convert|55|km|abbr=out}} of surplus track from the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. The railway connects with the CPR in Streetsville, and also services customers in Brampton to the south. From 2004 to 2018, a tourist train was operated on weekends in summer months.\n\nIn 1906, survey work was underway for an electric railway line which would serve Orangeville, to be called the Huron and Ontario Electric Railway.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dipping Into the Past - Survey under way for electric railway across Dufferin |url=http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2006/1123/Columns/045.html |publisher=Orangeville Citizen |accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203233059/http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2006/1123/Columns/045.html |archivedate=3 February 2009 |date=November 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       =\n|state       =\n|shading     =\n|percentages =\n|footnote    =\n|1871|1458\n|1881|2847\n|1891|2962\n|1901|2511\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|2340\n|1921|2187\n|1931|2614\n|1941|2718\n|1951|3249\n|1961|4593\n|1971|8074\n|1981|13740\n|1991|17921\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|21498\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|25248\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|26925\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|27975\n| [[Canada 2016 Census|2016]] | 28900\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Canadian Census]],<ref name=cp2016/> the population of Orangeville is 28,900, a 3.3% increase from 2011, with a {{PAGR|2011|27975|2016|28900}} per annum average growth rate over the same period.

Brian, who grew up influenced by 1950s [[rock and roll]] and [[jazz]]-based vocal groups, originally functioned as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. In 1964, he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and stopped touring with the group, which led to more personal work such as ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966) and the unfinished ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''. As his mental health deteriorated, his contributions to the band diminished, and over the next decade, he was reputed for his reclusive lifestyle and [[substance abuse]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198, 277}} Following a 1992 court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist [[Eugene Landy]], Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment, and in the late 1990s, he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist. He remains a member of the Beach Boys' corporation, [[Brother Records|Brother Records Inc]].\n\nWilson was the first [[pop music|pop]] artist credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material. He is considered a major innovator in the field of [[music production]], the principal originator of the [[California Sound]], one of the first [[music auteur|music producer auteurs]], and the first rock producer to [[Recording studio as an instrument|use the studio as its own instrument]]. The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his own records effectively set a precedent that allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or co-producers. Wilson's success also led to a proliferation of like-minded California producers who helped supplant New York as the center of popular records. The zeitgeist of the early 1960s is commonly associated with his early songs, and he was a major influence on the retrospectively-termed \"[[sunshine pop]]\" and [[Flower Power]] music that proceeded.\n\nIn later years, Wilson became influential to the spirit of [[punk rock]] and was regarded as \"godfather\" to an era of [[indie music]]ians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities, [[chamber pop]] orchestrations, and recording explorations. His honors include being inducted into the 1988 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] class and winning [[Grammy Award]]s for ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' (2011).

Murry Wilson said, \"He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him.\"{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=11}} At about age two, Wilson heard [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which had an enormous emotional impact on him.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=10}} A few years later, he was discovered to have diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from him simply being born partially [[Hearing loss|deaf]] to a blow to the head from his father, or a neighborhood bully being to blame.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=12}}\n\nA minor musician and songwriter, Wilson's father encouraged his children in the music field in numerous ways. At an early age, Wilson was given six weeks of lessons on a \"toy accordion\" and, at seven and eight, sang solos in church with a choir behind him.{{sfn|Leaf|1978|pp=15\u201317}} At [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]], Wilson was on the [[American football|football team]] as a [[quarterback]], played baseball and was a cross-country runner in his senior year.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=15}} He sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home, teaching his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice. He also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of [[the Four Freshmen]] by listening to short segments of their songs on a [[phonograph]], then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=18}} He received a [[Wollensak]] [[tape recorder]] on his 16th birthday, allowing him to experiment with recording songs and early group vocals.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=14}}\n\nOne of Wilson's earliest public performances was at a fall arts program at his high school. He enlisted his cousin and frequent singing partner [[Mike Love]], and to entice Carl into the group, named the newly formed membership \"Carl and the Passions.\" The performance featured tunes by [[Dion and the Belmonts]] and the Four Freshmen (\"It's a Blue World\"), the latter of which proved difficult for the ensemble. The event was notable for the impression which it made on another musician and classmate of Wilson's in the audience that night, [[Al Jardine]].  Jardine would join the three Wilson brothers and Mike Love a few years later in the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign = left\n|quote=I first felt I had a good voice when I was about seventeen or eighteen and was able to sing along well to records by [[the Four Freshmen]].

He continued his music studies at the [[community college]] as well.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=15}} At some point in 1961 he wrote his first all-original melody, loosely based on a Dion and the Belmonts version of \"[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]\". The song was eventually known as \"[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]\". Although an early demo of the song was recorded in February 1962 at World-Pacific Studios, it was not re-recorded and released until 1963, when it became a top-ten hit.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=27\u201331}}\n\nWilson, his brothers Carl and Dennis, Mike Love and Al Jardine first appeared as a music group in the summer of 1961, initially under the name the Pendletones. After being prodded by Dennis to write a song about the local water-sports craze, Wilson and Mike Love together created what became the first single for the band, \"[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]\". Over Labor Day weekend 1961, Wilson took advantage of the fact that his parents were in Mexico City for several days, and the boys used the emergency money his parents had left to rent an amplifier, a microphone, and a stand-up bass for Jardine to play. After the boys rehearsed for two days in the Wilsons' music room, his parents returned home from their trip. Eventually impressed, Murry Wilson proclaimed himself the group's manager and the band embarked on serious rehearsals for a proper studio session.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|right|Wilson (second-left) performing with the Beach Boys in [[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]] outfits at a local high school in late 1962]]\n\nRecorded by Hite and Dorinda Morgan and released on the small [[Candix Records]] label, \"Surfin'\" became a top local hit in Los Angeles and reached number seventy-five on the national [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] sales charts.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=30\u201331}} Dennis later described the first time that his older brother heard their song on the radio, as the three Wilson brothers and [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]] drove in Wilson's 1957 Ford in the rain: \"Nothing will ever top the expression on Brian's face, ever&nbsp;...

Without the band's knowledge or permission, Candix Records had changed their name to the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=16\u201317}} Wilson and his bandmates, following a set by [[Ike & Tina Turner]], performed their first major live show at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance on New Year's Eve, 1961. Three days previously, Wilson's father had bought him an electric bass and amplifier. Wilson had learned to play the instrument in that short period of time, with Al Jardine moving to rhythm guitar. On stage, Wilson provided many of the lead vocals, and often harmonized with the group in [[falsetto]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nLooking for a follow-up single for their radio hit, Wilson and Mike Love wrote \"[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]\", and attempts were made to record a usable take at World Pacific, including overdubs, on February 8, 1962, along with several other tunes including an early version of \"Surfer Girl\". Only a few days later, discouraged about the band's financial prospects, and objecting to adding some [[Chubby Checker]] songs to the Beach Boys live setlist, Al Jardine abruptly left the group, but rejoined shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=20}} When Candix Records ran into money problems and sold the Beach Boys' master recordings to another label, Wilson's father terminated the contract. As \"Surfin'\" faded from the charts, Wilson, who had forged a songwriting partnership with [[Gary Usher]], created several new songs, including a car song, \"[[409 (song)|409]]\", that Usher helped them write. Wilson and the Beach Boys cut new tracks at [[United Western Recorders|Western Recorders]] including an updated \"Surfin' Safari\" and \"409\". These songs convinced Capitol Records to release the demos as a single; they became a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double-sided]] national hit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=22\u201323}}\n\n===1962\u20131964: Success and record producing===\n[[File:The Beach Boys TV (cropped Brian).jpg|thumb|right|Wilson performing on electric bass with the Beach Boys, 1964]]\nRecording sessions for the band's first album took place in [[Capitol Studios|Capitol's basement studios]] in the [[Capitol Records Building|famous tower building]] in August 1962, but early on Wilson lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boy tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Wilson's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights, and in return the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Wilson fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production \u2013 though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=26}}\n\nIn January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, \"[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]\", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Hollywood's [[United Western Recorders]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. It was during the sessions for this single that Wilson made the production decision from that point on to use [[double tracking]] on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=32}} The [[Surfin' U.S.A.|''Surfin' U.S.A.'' album]] was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=40}}\n\nWilson was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the ''[[Surfer Girl]]'' album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Wilson decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'', which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the ''Surfer Girl'' LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Wilson was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=39\u201342}}\n\n{{listen|filename=The Honeys - He's A Doll.ogg|pos=left|title=The Honeys \u2013 \"He's a Doll\" (1964)|description=Written and produced by Brian Wilson, \"[[The Honeys|He's a Doll]]\" was one of several attempts by Wilson to branch away from the Beach Boys.<ref name=petp/>\n|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nFor much of the decade, Wilson attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists.

He formed a temporary songwriting partnership with lyricist [[Tony Asher]], who was suggested to Wilson by mutual friend Daro.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=194}} Wilson, who had recorded the album's instrumentation with [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]], then assembled the Beach Boys to record vocal [[overdub]]s, following their return from a tour of Japan. Upon hearing what Wilson had created for the first time in 1965,<ref name=\"AC interview\"/> the group, particularly [[Mike Love]], was somewhat critical of their leader's music,<ref name=\"A Boy's own story\"/> and expressed their dissatisfaction.<ref name=\"AC interview\"/> At this time, Wilson still had considerable control within the group and, according to Wilson, they eventually overcame their initial negative reaction, as his newly created music began to near completion.<ref name=\"AC interview\"/> The album was released May 16, 1966, and, despite modest sales figures at the time, has since become widely critically acclaimed, often being cited among the all-time greatest albums. Although the record was issued under the group's name, ''Pet Sounds'' is arguably seen as a Brian Wilson solo album. Wilson even toyed with the idea by releasing \"[[Caroline, No]]\" as a solo single in March 1966, it reaching number 32 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"Pet Sounds Billboard Singles\">{{cite web|title=Review: ''Pet Sounds, Charts & Awards, Billboard Singles''|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1420|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision Corporation]] |accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}\n\nDuring the ''Pet Sounds'' sessions, Wilson had been working on another song, which was held back from inclusion on the record as he felt that it was not sufficiently complete. The song \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" set a new standard for musicians and for what could be achieved in the recording studio. Recorded in multiple sessions and in numerous studios, the song eventually cost $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1966|fmt=eq}}) to record within a six-month period.<ref name=\"The nutty producers\">{{cite news|first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|title=Feature: ''The nutty producers''|newspaper=[[The Guardian#G2|G2]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=December 16, 1999|page=10}}</ref> In October 1966, it was released as a single, giving the Beach Boys their third US number-one hit after \"[[I Get Around]]\" and \"[[Help Me, Rhonda]]\". It sold over a million copies.\n\nSometime after ''Pet Sounds'' was released, the Beatles' press agent [[Derek Taylor]] started working as a publicist for the Beach Boys. He gradually became aware of Wilson's reputation as a genius among musician friends, a belief that wasn't widely held at the time.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}} Motivated by Wilson's musical merits, Taylor responded with a campaign that would reestablish the band's outdated surfing image, and was the first to tout Wilson as a genius.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}}{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63\u201364}} According to Van Dyke Parks, this was \"much to Brian's embarrassment\".{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nBy the time of the universal success of \"Good Vibrations\", Wilson was underway with his next project, ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', which Wilson described as a \"teenage symphony to God.\" \"Good Vibrations\" had been recorded in modular style, with separately written sections individually tracked and spliced together, and Wilson's concept for the new album was more of the same, representing a departure from the standard live-taped performances typical of studio recordings at that time. Having been introduced to [[Van Dyke Parks]] at a garden party at [[Terry Melcher]]'s home, Wilson liked Parks' \"visionary eloquence\" and began working with him in the fall of 1966.<ref name=\"The unknown surfer\">{{cite news|author=Hodgkinson, Will|title=Feature: ''The unknown surfer''|work=Friday Review|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=December 10, 1999|pages=16\u201317|authorlink=Will Hodgkinson}}</ref> After Wilson famously installed a sandbox and tent in his living room, the pair collaborated closely on several ''Smile'' tracks.

Wilson's interest in the Beach Boys began to wane. Carl explained: \"When we did ''Wild Honey'', Brian asked me to get more involved in the recording end. He wanted a break. He was tired. He had been doing it all too long.\"<ref name=\"MF1976\" />\n\nStill psychologically overwhelmed by the cancellation of ''Smile'' and the imminent birth of his first child [[Carnie Wilson]] in 1968 amid the looming financial insolvency of the Beach Boys, Wilson's creative directorship within the band became increasingly tenuous; additionally, [[cocaine]] had begun to supplement Wilson's regular use of amphetamines, marijuana, and psychedelics.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=139}} Shortly after abandoning an intricate arrangement of Kern and Hammerstein's \"Ol' Man River\" at the instigation of Mike Love,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=139, 141}} Wilson entered a [[psychiatric hospital]] for a brief period of time. Biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] has speculated that Wilson had self-admitted and may have been administered a number of treatments ranging from [[talking therapies]] to doses of [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] and [[electroconvulsive therapy]] during this stay.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=141}}\n\nIn his absence, 1969's ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' consisted substantially of key ''Smile'' outtakes (\"[[Cabinessence]]\" and \"[[Our Prayer]]\") along with the long-germinating \"Time to Get Alone\". The album's lead track, the Wilson/Love-authored \"[[Do It Again (Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]\", was an unabashed throwback to the band's earlier surf hits, and had been an international hit in the summer of 1968, reaching number 20 in the US charts and number 1 in the UK and Australia while also scoring well in other countries. During this phase, Wilson also collaborated with his father (credited under the pseudonym of Reggie Dunbar) on \"[[Break Away (The Beach Boys song)|Break Away]]\", the band's final single for Capitol Records under their original contract; although relatively unsuccessful in the US (peaking at number 63 in ''Billboard''), the song reached number 6 on the British singles chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAt a press conference ostensibly convened to promote \"Break Away\" to the European media shortly thereafter, Wilson intimated that \"We owe everyone money. And if we don't pick ourselves off our backsides and have a hit record soon, we will be in worse trouble&nbsp;... I've always said, 'Be honest with your fans.' I don't see why I should lie and say that everything is rosy when it's not.\" These incendiary remarks ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with [[Deutsche Grammophon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=149}} Although Murry Wilson's sale of the [[Sea of Tunes]] publishing company (including the majority of Wilson's oeuvre) to [[A&M Records]]' publishing division for $700,000 at the band's commercial nadir in 1969 renewed the longstanding animus{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=169}} between father and son, the younger Wilson stood in for Mike Love during a 1970 Northwest tour when Love was convalescing from illness. He also resumed writing and recording with the Beach Boys at a brisk pace; seven of the twelve new songs on the 1970 album ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' were either written or co-written by Wilson. Nevertheless, the album (retrospectively appraised as \"perhaps the strongest album they released post-''Pet Sounds''\" by [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11665-sunflowersurfs-up/|title=The Beach Boys: Sunflower/Surf's Up Album Review|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}</ref> was a commercial failure in the US, peaking at number 151 during a four-week ''Billboard'' chart stay in October 1970. Following the termination of the Capitol contract in 1969, the band's new contract with then-au courant [[Reprise Records]] (brokered by Van Dyke Parks, employed as a multimedia executive at the company at the time) stipulated Wilson's proactive involvement with the band in all albums,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=150}} a factor that would become hugely problematic for the band in the years to come.\n\n====Bedroom Tapes, American Spring, and the Radiant Radish====\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|image= right\n|quote=Even in those years when he was supposedly in seclusion, Brian came downstairs all the time, this great big guy in a bathrobe.

After signing with [[Capitol Records]] in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen [[Top 40]] hits for the group.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=34\u2013150}} In addition to his unorthodox [[Musicianship of Brian Wilson|approaches to pop composition and mastery of recording techniques]], Wilson is known for his lifelong struggles with [[Mental disorder|mental illness]]. He is often [[Brian Wilson is a genius|referred to as a genius]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Wilson (writer)|title=The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson: America's Mozart?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20150608-is-this-americas-mozart|publisher=BBC|date=June 9, 2015}}</ref> and is widely acknowledged as one of the most [[Cultural impact of the Beach Boys|innovative and significant]] songwriters of the late 20th century.<ref name=\"conversation2015\"/>\n\nThe Beach Boys were formed by Wilson with his brothers [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson|Carl]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and friend [[Al Jardine]]. Brian, who grew up influenced by 1950s [[rock and roll]] and [[jazz]]-based vocal groups, originally functioned as the band's songwriter, producer, co-lead vocalist, bassist, keyboardist, and de facto leader. In 1964, he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and stopped touring with the group, which led to more personal work such as ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966) and the unfinished ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''. As his mental health deteriorated, his contributions to the band diminished, and over the next decade, he was reputed for his reclusive lifestyle and [[substance abuse]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=198, 277}} Following a 1992 court-ordered removal from the care of psychologist [[Eugene Landy]], Wilson started receiving conventional medical treatment, and in the late 1990s, he began performing and recording consistently as a solo artist. He remains a member of the Beach Boys' corporation, [[Brother Records|Brother Records Inc]].\n\nWilson was the first [[pop music|pop]] artist credited for writing, arranging, producing, and performing his own material. He is considered a major innovator in the field of [[music production]], the principal originator of the [[California Sound]], one of the first [[music auteur|music producer auteurs]], and the first rock producer to [[Recording studio as an instrument|use the studio as its own instrument]]. The unusual creative control Capitol gave him over his own records effectively set a precedent that allowed other bands and artists to act as their own producers or co-producers. Wilson's success also led to a proliferation of like-minded California producers who helped supplant New York as the center of popular records. The zeitgeist of the early 1960s is commonly associated with his early songs, and he was a major influence on the retrospectively-termed \"[[sunshine pop]]\" and [[Flower Power]] music that proceeded.\n\nIn later years, Wilson became influential to the spirit of [[punk rock]] and was regarded as \"godfather\" to an era of [[indie music]]ians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities, [[chamber pop]] orchestrations, and recording explorations. His honors include being inducted into the 1988 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] class and winning [[Grammy Award]]s for ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' (2011). In lists published by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Wilson ranked 52 for the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\" in 2008<ref name=\"100greatest singers\"/> and 12 for the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]]\" in 2015.<ref name=\"RSsongwriters\"/> In 2012, music publication ''[[NME]]'' ranked Wilson number 8 in its \"50 Greatest Producers Ever\" list, elaborating \"few consider quite how groundbreaking Brian Wilson's studio techniques were in the mid-60s\".<ref name=\"50 Greatest Producers Ever\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/list/the-50-greatest-producers-ever/262849/article/265274#article|title=The 50 Greatest Producers Ever|year=2012|publisher=Nme.com|page=5|accessdate=July 6, 2013}}</ref> His life was dramatized in the 2014 [[biopic]] ''[[Love & Mercy (film)|Love & Mercy]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===1942\u20131962: Early years and performances===\n[[File:Brian Wilson 1960 yearbook.png|thumb|upright|left|Wilson's senior yearbook photo, 1960]]\n\nBrian Douglas Wilson was born on June 20, 1942, at Centinela Hospital in [[Inglewood, California]], the eldest son of Audree Neva (''n\u00e9e'' Korthof) and [[Murry Wilson]], a musician and machinist.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=40}} His two younger brothers were [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson|Carl]].

Murry Wilson said, \"He was very clever and quick. I just fell in love with him.\"{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=11}} At about age two, Wilson heard [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which had an enormous emotional impact on him.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=10}} A few years later, he was discovered to have diminished hearing in his right ear. The exact cause of this hearing loss is unclear, though theories range from him simply being born partially [[Hearing loss|deaf]] to a blow to the head from his father, or a neighborhood bully being to blame.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=12}}\n\nA minor musician and songwriter, Wilson's father encouraged his children in the music field in numerous ways. At an early age, Wilson was given six weeks of lessons on a \"toy accordion\" and, at seven and eight, sang solos in church with a choir behind him.{{sfn|Leaf|1978|pp=15\u201317}} At [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]], Wilson was on the [[American football|football team]] as a [[quarterback]], played baseball and was a cross-country runner in his senior year.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=15}} He sang with various students at school functions and with his family and friends at home, teaching his two brothers harmony parts that all three would then practice. He also played piano obsessively after school, deconstructing the harmonies of [[the Four Freshmen]] by listening to short segments of their songs on a [[phonograph]], then working to recreate the blended sounds note by note on the keyboard.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=18}} He received a [[Wollensak]] [[tape recorder]] on his 16th birthday, allowing him to experiment with recording songs and early group vocals.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=14}}\n\nOne of Wilson's earliest public performances was at a fall arts program at his high school. He enlisted his cousin and frequent singing partner [[Mike Love]], and to entice Carl into the group, named the newly formed membership \"Carl and the Passions.\" The performance featured tunes by [[Dion and the Belmonts]] and the Four Freshmen (\"It's a Blue World\"), the latter of which proved difficult for the ensemble. The event was notable for the impression which it made on another musician and classmate of Wilson's in the audience that night, [[Al Jardine]].  Jardine would join the three Wilson brothers and Mike Love a few years later in the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign = left\n|quote=I first felt I had a good voice when I was about seventeen or eighteen and was able to sing along well to records by [[the Four Freshmen]].

He continued his music studies at the [[community college]] as well.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=15}} At some point in 1961 he wrote his first all-original melody, loosely based on a Dion and the Belmonts version of \"[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]\". The song was eventually known as \"[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]\". Although an early demo of the song was recorded in February 1962 at World-Pacific Studios, it was not re-recorded and released until 1963, when it became a top-ten hit.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=27\u201331}}\n\nWilson, his brothers Carl and Dennis, Mike Love and Al Jardine first appeared as a music group in the summer of 1961, initially under the name the Pendletones. After being prodded by Dennis to write a song about the local water-sports craze, Wilson and Mike Love together created what became the first single for the band, \"[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]\". Over Labor Day weekend 1961, Wilson took advantage of the fact that his parents were in Mexico City for several days, and the boys used the emergency money his parents had left to rent an amplifier, a microphone, and a stand-up bass for Jardine to play. After the boys rehearsed for two days in the Wilsons' music room, his parents returned home from their trip. Eventually impressed, Murry Wilson proclaimed himself the group's manager and the band embarked on serious rehearsals for a proper studio session.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|right|Wilson (second-left) performing with the Beach Boys in [[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]] outfits at a local high school in late 1962]]\n\nRecorded by Hite and Dorinda Morgan and released on the small [[Candix Records]] label, \"Surfin'\" became a top local hit in Los Angeles and reached number seventy-five on the national [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] sales charts.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=30\u201331}} Dennis later described the first time that his older brother heard their song on the radio, as the three Wilson brothers and [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]] drove in Wilson's 1957 Ford in the rain: \"Nothing will ever top the expression on Brian's face, ever&nbsp;...

Three days previously, Wilson's father had bought him an electric bass and amplifier. Wilson had learned to play the instrument in that short period of time, with Al Jardine moving to rhythm guitar. On stage, Wilson provided many of the lead vocals, and often harmonized with the group in [[falsetto]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nLooking for a follow-up single for their radio hit, Wilson and Mike Love wrote \"[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]\", and attempts were made to record a usable take at World Pacific, including overdubs, on February 8, 1962, along with several other tunes including an early version of \"Surfer Girl\". Only a few days later, discouraged about the band's financial prospects, and objecting to adding some [[Chubby Checker]] songs to the Beach Boys live setlist, Al Jardine abruptly left the group, but rejoined shortly thereafter.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=20}} When Candix Records ran into money problems and sold the Beach Boys' master recordings to another label, Wilson's father terminated the contract. As \"Surfin'\" faded from the charts, Wilson, who had forged a songwriting partnership with [[Gary Usher]], created several new songs, including a car song, \"[[409 (song)|409]]\", that Usher helped them write. Wilson and the Beach Boys cut new tracks at [[United Western Recorders|Western Recorders]] including an updated \"Surfin' Safari\" and \"409\". These songs convinced Capitol Records to release the demos as a single; they became a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double-sided]] national hit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=22\u201323}}\n\n===1962\u20131964: Success and record producing===\n[[File:The Beach Boys TV (cropped Brian).jpg|thumb|right|Wilson performing on electric bass with the Beach Boys, 1964]]\nRecording sessions for the band's first album took place in [[Capitol Studios|Capitol's basement studios]] in the [[Capitol Records Building|famous tower building]] in August 1962, but early on Wilson lobbied for a different place to cut Beach Boy tracks. The large rooms were built to record the big orchestras and ensembles of the 1950s, not small rock groups. At Wilson's insistence, Capitol agreed to let the Beach Boys pay for their own outside recording sessions, to which Capitol would own all the rights, and in return the band would receive a higher royalty rate on their record sales. Additionally, during the taping of their first LP Wilson fought for, and won, the right to be in charge of the production \u2013 though this fact was not acknowledged with an album liner notes production credit.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=26}}\n\nIn January 1963, the Beach Boys recorded their first top-ten (cresting at number three in the United States) single, \"[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]\", which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts at Hollywood's [[United Western Recorders]] on [[Sunset Boulevard]]. It was during the sessions for this single that Wilson made the production decision from that point on to use [[double tracking]] on the group's vocals, resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=32}} The [[Surfin' U.S.A.|''Surfin' U.S.A.'' album]] was also a big hit in the United States, reaching number two on the national sales charts by early July 1963. The Beach Boys had become a top-rank recording and touring band.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=40}}\n\nWilson was for the first time officially credited as the Beach Boys' producer on the ''[[Surfer Girl]]'' album, recorded in June and July 1963 and released that September. This LP reached number seven on the national charts, containing singles that were top 15 hits. Feeling that surfing songs had become limiting, Wilson decided to produce a set of largely car-oriented tunes for the Beach Boys' fourth album, ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'', which was released in October 1963, only three weeks after the ''Surfer Girl'' LP. The departure of guitarist David Marks from the band that month meant that Wilson was forced to resume touring with the Beach Boys, for a time reducing his availability in the recording studio.{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=39\u201342}}\n\n{{listen|filename=The Honeys - He's A Doll.ogg|pos=left|title=The Honeys \u2013 \"He's a Doll\" (1964)|description=Written and produced by Brian Wilson, \"[[The Honeys|He's a Doll]]\" was one of several attempts by Wilson to branch away from the Beach Boys.<ref name=petp/>\n|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nFor much of the decade, Wilson attempted to establish himself as a record producer by working with various artists.

The resulting success pleased Wilson, but angered both Murry and Capitol Records. Murry went so far as to order his oldest son to sever any future collaborations with Jan and Dean. Wilson's other non-Beach Boy work in this period included tracks by [[the Castells]], [[Donna Loren]], Sharon Marie, the Timers, and the Survivors.

Sometime in April, Wilson experienced his first [[acid trip]], which had a profound effect on his musical and spiritual conceptions.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=136}} Again, Daro was hesitant to provide drugs to Wilson, which he did not feel he was ready for, but has recounted that his dosage was \"one hundred and twenty-five [[Microgram|mics]] of pure [[Owsley Stanley|Owsley]],\" and that \"he had the full-on [[ego death]].

He formed a temporary songwriting partnership with lyricist [[Tony Asher]], who was suggested to Wilson by mutual friend Daro.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=194}} Wilson, who had recorded the album's instrumentation with [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]], then assembled the Beach Boys to record vocal [[overdub]]s, following their return from a tour of Japan. Upon hearing what Wilson had created for the first time in 1965,<ref name=\"AC interview\"/> the group, particularly [[Mike Love]], was somewhat critical of their leader's music,<ref name=\"A Boy's own story\"/> and expressed their dissatisfaction.<ref name=\"AC interview\"/> At this time, Wilson still had considerable control within the group and, according to Wilson, they eventually overcame their initial negative reaction, as his newly created music began to near completion.<ref name=\"AC interview\"/> The album was released May 16, 1966, and, despite modest sales figures at the time, has since become widely critically acclaimed, often being cited among the all-time greatest albums. Although the record was issued under the group's name, ''Pet Sounds'' is arguably seen as a Brian Wilson solo album. Wilson even toyed with the idea by releasing \"[[Caroline, No]]\" as a solo single in March 1966, it reaching number 32 on the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"Pet Sounds Billboard Singles\">{{cite web|title=Review: ''Pet Sounds, Charts & Awards, Billboard Singles''|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1420|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision Corporation]] |accessdate=August 28, 2009}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2015}}\n\nDuring the ''Pet Sounds'' sessions, Wilson had been working on another song, which was held back from inclusion on the record as he felt that it was not sufficiently complete. The song \"[[Good Vibrations]]\" set a new standard for musicians and for what could be achieved in the recording studio. Recorded in multiple sessions and in numerous studios, the song eventually cost $50,000 ({{Inflation|US|50000|1966|fmt=eq}}) to record within a six-month period.<ref name=\"The nutty producers\">{{cite news|first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|title=Feature: ''The nutty producers''|newspaper=[[The Guardian#G2|G2]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=December 16, 1999|page=10}}</ref> In October 1966, it was released as a single, giving the Beach Boys their third US number-one hit after \"[[I Get Around]]\" and \"[[Help Me, Rhonda]]\". It sold over a million copies.\n\nSometime after ''Pet Sounds'' was released, the Beatles' press agent [[Derek Taylor]] started working as a publicist for the Beach Boys. He gradually became aware of Wilson's reputation as a genius among musician friends, a belief that wasn't widely held at the time.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}} Motivated by Wilson's musical merits, Taylor responded with a campaign that would reestablish the band's outdated surfing image, and was the first to tout Wilson as a genius.{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=27}}{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63\u201364}} According to Van Dyke Parks, this was \"much to Brian's embarrassment\".{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nBy the time of the universal success of \"Good Vibrations\", Wilson was underway with his next project, ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', which Wilson described as a \"teenage symphony to God.\" \"Good Vibrations\" had been recorded in modular style, with separately written sections individually tracked and spliced together, and Wilson's concept for the new album was more of the same, representing a departure from the standard live-taped performances typical of studio recordings at that time. Having been introduced to [[Van Dyke Parks]] at a garden party at [[Terry Melcher]]'s home, Wilson liked Parks' \"visionary eloquence\" and began working with him in the fall of 1966.<ref name=\"The unknown surfer\">{{cite news|author=Hodgkinson, Will|title=Feature: ''The unknown surfer''|work=Friday Review|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|issue=December 10, 1999|pages=16\u201317|authorlink=Will Hodgkinson}}</ref> After Wilson famously installed a sandbox and tent in his living room, the pair collaborated closely on several ''Smile'' tracks.

Wilson's interest in the Beach Boys began to wane. Carl explained: \"When we did ''Wild Honey'', Brian asked me to get more involved in the recording end. He wanted a break. He was tired. He had been doing it all too long.\"<ref name=\"MF1976\" />\n\nStill psychologically overwhelmed by the cancellation of ''Smile'' and the imminent birth of his first child [[Carnie Wilson]] in 1968 amid the looming financial insolvency of the Beach Boys, Wilson's creative directorship within the band became increasingly tenuous; additionally, [[cocaine]] had begun to supplement Wilson's regular use of amphetamines, marijuana, and psychedelics.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=139}} Shortly after abandoning an intricate arrangement of Kern and Hammerstein's \"Ol' Man River\" at the instigation of Mike Love,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=139, 141}} Wilson entered a [[psychiatric hospital]] for a brief period of time. Biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] has speculated that Wilson had self-admitted and may have been administered a number of treatments ranging from [[talking therapies]] to doses of [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] and [[electroconvulsive therapy]] during this stay.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=141}}\n\nIn his absence, 1969's ''[[20/20 (The Beach Boys album)|20/20]]'' consisted substantially of key ''Smile'' outtakes (\"[[Cabinessence]]\" and \"[[Our Prayer]]\") along with the long-germinating \"Time to Get Alone\". The album's lead track, the Wilson/Love-authored \"[[Do It Again (Beach Boys song)|Do It Again]]\", was an unabashed throwback to the band's earlier surf hits, and had been an international hit in the summer of 1968, reaching number 20 in the US charts and number 1 in the UK and Australia while also scoring well in other countries. During this phase, Wilson also collaborated with his father (credited under the pseudonym of Reggie Dunbar) on \"[[Break Away (The Beach Boys song)|Break Away]]\", the band's final single for Capitol Records under their original contract; although relatively unsuccessful in the US (peaking at number 63 in ''Billboard''), the song reached number 6 on the British singles chart.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAt a press conference ostensibly convened to promote \"Break Away\" to the European media shortly thereafter, Wilson intimated that \"We owe everyone money. And if we don't pick ourselves off our backsides and have a hit record soon, we will be in worse trouble&nbsp;... I've always said, 'Be honest with your fans.' I don't see why I should lie and say that everything is rosy when it's not.\" These incendiary remarks ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with [[Deutsche Grammophon]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=149}} Although Murry Wilson's sale of the [[Sea of Tunes]] publishing company (including the majority of Wilson's oeuvre) to [[A&M Records]]' publishing division for $700,000 at the band's commercial nadir in 1969 renewed the longstanding animus{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=169}} between father and son, the younger Wilson stood in for Mike Love during a 1970 Northwest tour when Love was convalescing from illness. He also resumed writing and recording with the Beach Boys at a brisk pace; seven of the twelve new songs on the 1970 album ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' were either written or co-written by Wilson. Nevertheless, the album (retrospectively appraised as \"perhaps the strongest album they released post-''Pet Sounds''\" by [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11665-sunflowersurfs-up/|title=The Beach Boys: Sunflower/Surf's Up Album Review|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=July 8, 2017}}</ref> was a commercial failure in the US, peaking at number 151 during a four-week ''Billboard'' chart stay in October 1970. Following the termination of the Capitol contract in 1969, the band's new contract with then-au courant [[Reprise Records]] (brokered by Van Dyke Parks, employed as a multimedia executive at the company at the time) stipulated Wilson's proactive involvement with the band in all albums,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=150}} a factor that would become hugely problematic for the band in the years to come.\n\n====Bedroom Tapes, American Spring, and the Radiant Radish====\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|image= right\n|quote=Even in those years when he was supposedly in seclusion, Brian came downstairs all the time, this great big guy in a bathrobe.

It is coordinated by the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), a [[nonprofit organization]] formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/13/how-powerball-manipulated-the-odds-to-make-a-1-5-billion-jackpot-happen |title=How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5864 billion jackpot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Each play costs $2 or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n=== Powerball begins ===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n=== 2009: Florida became host to drawings ===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion.

Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]]/[[Masury, Ohio]] border sold both Mega Millions (via the [[Ohio Lottery]]) and Powerball ([[Pennsylvania]]) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |title=Penn Ohio Lottery & Deli in Sharon, PA 16146 |publisher=Local.post-gazette.com |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203254/http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Illinois]] joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n=== 2012 format change ===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n=== Power Play ===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n=== Prizes and odds ===\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |title=Powerball - How To Play |publisher=Powerball.com |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115222858/http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |archive-date=January 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n=== Secondary prizes ===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n=== Notable wins ===\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n=== Powerball begins ===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n=== 2009: Florida became host to drawings ===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010, it joined [[Mega Millions]] (along with New York) years earlier, when ''The Big Game'' added ''Mega Millions'' to its name.\n\n=== 2010 cross-sell expansion ===\nIn March 2009, it was reported that [[New Jersey]], already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]]/[[Masury, Ohio]] border sold both Mega Millions (via the [[Ohio Lottery]]) and Powerball ([[Pennsylvania]]) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |title=Penn Ohio Lottery & Deli in Sharon, PA 16146 |publisher=Local.post-gazette.com |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203254/http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Illinois]] joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n=== 2012 format change ===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

This response is regarding the Corona Virus issue. <ref>{{cite web |title=POWERBALL 2020 changes |url=https://www.powerball.com/notice |website=Important Notice |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> Since there was a Powerball Jackpot winner that matched all 5 numbers 48, 54, 39, 2, 37 and the Powerball Number 5 in New Jersey on Wednesday April 8, 2020, then this game had to reset to $20 million dollars!\n\n=== Playing the game ===\n=== Basic game ===\nThe minimum Powerball bet is $2. In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n=== Power Play ===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n=== Prizes and odds ===\n\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |title=Powerball - How To Play |publisher=Powerball.com |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115222858/http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |archive-date=January 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\n\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n=== Secondary prizes ===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n=== Notable wins ===\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

[[Arlington National Cemetery]] is a [[United States national cemetery]] located in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], in the United States. It is managed by the [[United States Army]], rather than the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]].\n\nThe first major memorial in the cemetery was completed in 1866. Entry gates in the cemetery were later dedicated to [[Union Army]] generals. The [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and World War I led to the construction of several more major memorials. The [[Tomb of the Unknowns|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] was constructed in 1921, although the large sarcophagus above the burial vault was not dedicated until 1932. Almost a third of the cemetery's major memorials have been constructed since 1983.\n\nOwing to space constraints, Arlington National Cemetery does not permit the construction of large memorials or monuments without an act of Congress. The cemetery does, however, encourage the donation of trees (\"living memorials\") and permits small memorial plaques to be placed before these plantings. As of 2011, there were 142 such memorial plaques in the cemetery.\n\n==Memorials and monuments==\n\n===Creating Arlington National Cemetery===\nIn 1778, [[John Parke Custis]] purchased a {{convert|1100|acre|ha|adj=on}} tract of sylvan land on the [[Potomac River]] north of the town of Alexandria, Virginia.<ref name=\"Silber125\">Silber, p. 125.</ref><ref name=\"Arl77\">\"Arlington National Cemetery,\" p. 77.</ref> This land became the Arlington Estate.  In time, his granddaughter, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]], inherited the estate.<ref>Silber, p. 126.</ref> She married [[Robert E. Lee]], an impoverished lieutenant in the [[United States Army]], in June 1831.<ref name=\"Silber125\" /> With the outbreak of the American Civil War on April 12, 1861, Robert E. Lee resigned from the United States Army and took command of Virginia's armed forces on April 23.<ref name=\"Arl77\" /> Mary Custis Lee fled the house on May 17,<ref>McCaslin, p. 79-80.</ref><ref name=\"Atk25\">Atkinson, p. 25.</ref> and Union troops occupied Arlington Estate and Arlington House on May 24.<ref>Chase, p. 176.</ref>\n\nOn July 16, 1862, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation authorizing the purchase of land for national cemeteries for military dead.<ref name=\"Heidler77\">\"Arlington,\" p. 77.</ref> In May 1864, large numbers of Union forces died in the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], requiring a large new cemetery to be built near the District of Columbia.<ref name=\"Landscape84\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 84.] Accessed 2012-04-29.</ref> A study quickly determined that the Arlington Estate was the most suitable property for this purpose.<ref name=\"Landscape84\" /> Although the first military burial at Arlington occurred on May 13, 1864,<ref name=\"Arl77\" /> formal authorization for burials did not occur until June 15, 1864.<ref name=\"Atk25\" /><ref>McCaslin, p. 82.</ref>\n\n===First memorials and monuments===\n[[File:McClellan Gate - looking WNW - Arlington National Cemetery - 2011.JPG|thumb|right|The [[McClellan Gate]], erected in 1879, was the second memorial emplaced at Arlington National Cemetery.]]\n\nThe first memorials at Arlington National Cemetery were built during and immediately after the Civil War. These first memorials were small, as the federal government (burdened by the cost of the war) expended little money on the cemetery.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 97.] Accessed 2012-04-29.</ref>\n\nThe first memorial constructed was the [[Civil War Unknowns Monument]]. [[United States Army]] [[Quartermaster General (United States)|Quartermaster General]] [[Montgomery C.

Meigs ordered the construction of a red [[Seneca Quarry|Seneca]] [[sandstone]] wall around the cemetery. The construction of the wall (which would not be complete until 1897) necessitated the construction of gates as well.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 102.] Accessed 2012-04-29.</ref> Construction began on a memorial to [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George B.

This included the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which was dedicated on November 11, 1921. The cenotaph above the tomb is a later addition, and was dedicated on November 11, 1932.<ref name=\"Tomb\">\"Thousands at Arlington Cemetery Visit Shrine of the Unknown.\" ''Washington Post.''

Also completed in 1879, it was constructed from two salvaged War Department Building columns.<ref>Goode, p. 334.</ref> Like the Sheridan Gate, this gate was initially not dedicated to anyone.

In 1971, the cemetery expanded eastward to its present boundary (the [[Jefferson Davis Highway#Virginia|Jefferson Davis Highway]]). At that time, the Sheridan and Ord-Weitzel gates were dismantled and the columns, marble pediments, and iron gates put into outdoor storage. Unfortunately, both gates were severely damaged during their dismantling.  They were further damaged by inappropriate outdoor storage, and have been heavily vandalized.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/va/va1800/va1845/data/va1845data.pdf Historic American Buildings Survey, ''Arlington National Cemetery, Sheridan Gate'', p. 19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107155457/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/va/va1800/va1845/data/va1845data.pdf |date=2014-01-07 }}, accessed 2012-07-15; [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/va/va1800/va1846/data/va1846data.pdf Historic American Buildings Survey, ''Arlington National Cemetery, Ord-Weitzel Gate'', p. 5], accessed 2012-07-15.</ref>\n\nIn 1884, a Temple of Fame was erected in the center of the flower garden on the south side of Arlington House. The [[Old Patent Office Building|U.S. Patent Office building]] had suffered a fire in 1877, and it was torn down and rebuilt in 1879. In 1884, stone columns, pediments, and entablatures from this demolition were used to construct the Temple of Fame. The Temple was a round, [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], temple-like structure with [[Doric order|Doric]] columns supporting a central dome. Inscribed on the pediment supporting the dome were the last names of great Americans such as [[George Washington]], Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, and [[David Farragut]]. A year after it was built, the last names of several Union Civil War generals (such as [[George Meade]], [[James B. McPherson]], and [[James A.

Title VI, Section 604 of this legislation permits the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] to establish regulations for the erection at Arlington National Cemetery of memorials or monuments to an individual or military event if 25 years have passed. Such monuments may be placed only in areas designated by the Secretary of the Army, and must be paid for entirely by private donations. All alternative locations to Arlington National Cemetery must be ruled out, and the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]] must be consulted on the memorial's appropriateness. The 25-year requirement may be waived if the event or service is ongoing, or if a \"manifest injustice\" would occur. In such cases, Congress may override the waiver by [[joint resolution]] within 60 days.<ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-12tpubl154/pdf/PLAW-12tpubl154.pdf Honoring America\u2019s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012.

The memorial will be an [[ossuary]] designed to contain fragments of remains which are unidentifiable through DNA analysis. The legislation required that these remains be cremated before placement in the memorial. Cemetery officials said that Arlington National Cemetery has no means of receiving and burying these remains, and placing them in the Tomb of the Unknowns would be inappropriate.<ref>\"Fast Track: 'Place of Remembrance' Planned for Arlington.\" ''Navy Times.''

[[Arlington National Cemetery]] is a [[United States national cemetery]] located in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], in the United States. It is managed by the [[United States Army]], rather than the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]].\n\nThe first major memorial in the cemetery was completed in 1866. Entry gates in the cemetery were later dedicated to [[Union Army]] generals. The [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and World War I led to the construction of several more major memorials. The [[Tomb of the Unknowns|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] was constructed in 1921, although the large sarcophagus above the burial vault was not dedicated until 1932. Almost a third of the cemetery's major memorials have been constructed since 1983.\n\nOwing to space constraints, Arlington National Cemetery does not permit the construction of large memorials or monuments without an act of Congress. The cemetery does, however, encourage the donation of trees (\"living memorials\") and permits small memorial plaques to be placed before these plantings. As of 2011, there were 142 such memorial plaques in the cemetery.\n\n==Memorials and monuments==\n\n===Creating Arlington National Cemetery===\nIn 1778, [[John Parke Custis]] purchased a {{convert|1100|acre|ha|adj=on}} tract of sylvan land on the [[Potomac River]] north of the town of Alexandria, Virginia.<ref name=\"Silber125\">Silber, p. 125.</ref><ref name=\"Arl77\">\"Arlington National Cemetery,\" p. 77.</ref> This land became the Arlington Estate.  In time, his granddaughter, [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Mary Anna Randolph Custis]], inherited the estate.<ref>Silber, p. 126.</ref> She married [[Robert E. Lee]], an impoverished lieutenant in the [[United States Army]], in June 1831.<ref name=\"Silber125\" /> With the outbreak of the American Civil War on April 12, 1861, Robert E. Lee resigned from the United States Army and took command of Virginia's armed forces on April 23.<ref name=\"Arl77\" /> Mary Custis Lee fled the house on May 17,<ref>McCaslin, p. 79-80.</ref><ref name=\"Atk25\">Atkinson, p. 25.</ref> and Union troops occupied Arlington Estate and Arlington House on May 24.<ref>Chase, p. 176.</ref>\n\nOn July 16, 1862, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation authorizing the purchase of land for national cemeteries for military dead.<ref name=\"Heidler77\">\"Arlington,\" p. 77.</ref> In May 1864, large numbers of Union forces died in the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], requiring a large new cemetery to be built near the District of Columbia.<ref name=\"Landscape84\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 84.] Accessed 2012-04-29.</ref> A study quickly determined that the Arlington Estate was the most suitable property for this purpose.<ref name=\"Landscape84\" /> Although the first military burial at Arlington occurred on May 13, 1864,<ref name=\"Arl77\" /> formal authorization for burials did not occur until June 15, 1864.<ref name=\"Atk25\" /><ref>McCaslin, p. 82.</ref>\n\n===First memorials and monuments===\n[[File:McClellan Gate - looking WNW - Arlington National Cemetery - 2011.JPG|thumb|right|The [[McClellan Gate]], erected in 1879, was the second memorial emplaced at Arlington National Cemetery.]]\n\nThe first memorials at Arlington National Cemetery were built during and immediately after the Civil War. These first memorials were small, as the federal government (burdened by the cost of the war) expended little money on the cemetery.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 97.] Accessed 2012-04-29.</ref>\n\nThe first memorial constructed was the [[Civil War Unknowns Monument]]. [[United States Army]] [[Quartermaster General (United States)|Quartermaster General]] [[Montgomery C. Meigs]] ordered the construction of the monument in 1865.<ref name=\"Landscape96\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 96.] Accessed 2012-04-29.</ref> The bodies of 2,111 Union and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] dead were collected and placed in a vault beneath the monument, which was sealed in September 1866.<ref name=\"Landscape96\" />\n\nIn 1867, Congress enacted legislation requiring that all military cemeteries be fenced. Meigs ordered the construction of a red [[Seneca Quarry|Seneca]] [[sandstone]] wall around the cemetery. The construction of the wall (which would not be complete until 1897) necessitated the construction of gates as well.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 102.] Accessed 2012-04-29.</ref> Construction began on a memorial to [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George B. McClellan]] (the [[McClellan Gate]]) in 1870, but delays in obtaining high-quality red Seneca sandstone delayed its completion until 1879.<ref name=\"Hughes\">Hughes and Ware, p. 72.</ref>\n\nThe Spanish\u2013American War of 1898 led to the creation of several new memorials: The Spanish\u2013American War Memorial in 1902,<ref name=\"Spanish01\" /> the Spanish\u2013American War Nurses Memorial in 1905,<ref name=\"Spanish02\" /> and the Rough Riders Memorial in 1907.<ref name=\"Rough\" /> Two more major memorials were added prior to World War I:  The Confederate Monument in 1914,<ref name=\"Confederates\" /> and the USS ''Maine'' Memorial in 1915.<ref name=\"Maine\" />\n\nAnother nine memorials, most of them commemorating World War I, were added in the 1920s and 1930s.  This included the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, which was dedicated on November 11, 1921. The cenotaph above the tomb is a later addition, and was dedicated on November 11, 1932.<ref name=\"Tomb\">\"Thousands at Arlington Cemetery Visit Shrine of the Unknown.\" ''Washington Post.''

November 10, 1932.</ref> At the end of World War II, the cemetery had a total of 16 major memorials.  Another 12 major memorials were added after 1949, with eight of these constructed after 1983.\n\n===Former memorials and monuments===\n[[File:Sheridan Gate - Arlington National Cemetery - Arlington VA - 1900.jpg|thumb|right|The Sheridan Gate in 1900.]]\n[[File:Temple of Fame - Arlington National Cemetery - Arlington VA - 1903.jpg|thumb|The Temple of Fame in 1903.

Grant]], [[Edwin M.

Also completed in 1879, it was constructed from two salvaged War Department Building columns.<ref>Goode, p. 334.</ref> Like the Sheridan Gate, this gate was initially not dedicated to anyone.  But by 1902, with the passing of both Ord and Weitzel, their names were inscribed into left and right columns of the gate, respectively.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/va/va1800/va1846/data/va1846data.pdf Historic American Buildings Survey, ''Arlington National Cemetery, Ord-Weitzel Gate'', p. 3.] Accessed 2012-07-15.</ref> Arlington National Cemetery's easternmost boundary had, since 1864, been the [[Arlington Ridge Road]] (what is present-day Eisenhower Drive).  In 1971, the cemetery expanded eastward to its present boundary (the [[Jefferson Davis Highway#Virginia|Jefferson Davis Highway]]). At that time, the Sheridan and Ord-Weitzel gates were dismantled and the columns, marble pediments, and iron gates put into outdoor storage. Unfortunately, both gates were severely damaged during their dismantling.  They were further damaged by inappropriate outdoor storage, and have been heavily vandalized.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/va/va1800/va1845/data/va1845data.pdf Historic American Buildings Survey, ''Arlington National Cemetery, Sheridan Gate'', p. 19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107155457/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/va/va1800/va1845/data/va1845data.pdf |date=2014-01-07 }}, accessed 2012-07-15; [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/va/va1800/va1846/data/va1846data.pdf Historic American Buildings Survey, ''Arlington National Cemetery, Ord-Weitzel Gate'', p. 5], accessed 2012-07-15.</ref>\n\nIn 1884, a Temple of Fame was erected in the center of the flower garden on the south side of Arlington House. The [[Old Patent Office Building|U.S. Patent Office building]] had suffered a fire in 1877, and it was torn down and rebuilt in 1879. In 1884, stone columns, pediments, and entablatures from this demolition were used to construct the Temple of Fame. The Temple was a round, [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]], temple-like structure with [[Doric order|Doric]] columns supporting a central dome. Inscribed on the pediment supporting the dome were the last names of great Americans such as [[George Washington]], Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, and [[David Farragut]]. A year after it was built, the last names of several Union Civil War generals (such as [[George Meade]], [[James B. McPherson]], and [[James A. Garfield]]) were carved into the columns.<ref name=\"Landscape122\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 122.] Accessed 2012-04-29.</ref> Since there wasn't enough marble to rebuild the dome, a tin dome (molded and painted to look like marble) was installed instead.<ref>Poole, p. 120.</ref> The Temple of Fame was demolished in 1967.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/arho/clr.pdf Cultural Landscape Program, p. 164.] Accessed 2012-04-29.</ref>\n\n===New memorials and monuments===\nIn 1960, the [[United States Congress]] enacted \"The Act of 2 September 1960\" (74 Stat; 24 U.S.C. 295a).

On August 6, 2012, Congress enacted the \"Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012\" (P.L. 112-154; 126 Stat. 1165). Title VI, Section 604 of this legislation permits the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]] to establish regulations for the erection at Arlington National Cemetery of memorials or monuments to an individual or military event if 25 years have passed. Such monuments may be placed only in areas designated by the Secretary of the Army, and must be paid for entirely by private donations. All alternative locations to Arlington National Cemetery must be ruled out, and the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]] must be consulted on the memorial's appropriateness. The 25-year requirement may be waived if the event or service is ongoing, or if a \"manifest injustice\" would occur. In such cases, Congress may override the waiver by [[joint resolution]] within 60 days.<ref>[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-12tpubl154/pdf/PLAW-12tpubl154.pdf Honoring America\u2019s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012.

The memorial will be an [[ossuary]] designed to contain fragments of remains which are unidentifiable through DNA analysis. The legislation required that these remains be cremated before placement in the memorial. Cemetery officials said that Arlington National Cemetery has no means of receiving and burying these remains, and placing them in the Tomb of the Unknowns would be inappropriate.<ref>\"Fast Track: 'Place of Remembrance' Planned for Arlington.\" ''Navy Times.''

Among these were [[Arlington Memorial Bridge]] and the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway (now known as the George Washington Memorial Parkway). To link the Virginia landing of the bridge with Arlington National Cemetery, a wide avenue known as Memorial Avenue was constructed and a new entrance to the cemetery (the [[Women in Military Service for America Memorial|Hemicycle]]) constructed.\n\nMemorial Avenue is part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway.<ref>See: [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/pnp/habshaer/va/va1600/va1677/data/va1677data.pdf Historic American Engineering Record.

The university offers undergraduate and [[graduate degrees]], including [[Doctorate|doctoral]] and [[professional degree]]s and [[Online degree|online masters]] as well.\n\nThe university was founded in 1829 and is the tenth largest private university in the country in terms of full-time students. It is internationally known for its science, computer, engineering, and art programs, as well as for the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]], a leading deaf-education institution that provides educational opportunities to more than 1000 deaf and hard-of-hearing students. RIT is known for its Co-op program that gives students professional and industrial experience. It has the fourth oldest and one of the largest Co-op programs in the world.\n\nRIT student population is approximately 19,000 students, about 16,000 undergraduate and 3000 graduate. Demographically, students attend from all 50 states in the United States and from more than 100 countries around the world. The university has more than 4000 active faculty and staff members who engage with the students in a wide range of academic activities and research projects. It also has branches abroad, its global campuses, located in China, Croatia, United Arab Emirates ([[Dubai]]), and Kosovo.\n\nThirteen RIT alumni and faculty members have been recipients of the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rit.edu/about-rit#key-facts| title = Key facts about RIT|website=rit.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe university began as a result of an 1891 merger between '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um''', a [[literary society]] founded in 1829 by [[Nathaniel Rochester|Colonel Nathaniel Rochester]] and associates, and '''The Mechanics Institute''', a Rochester school of practical [[Vocational education|technical training]] for local residents founded in 1885 by a consortium of local businessmen including [[Henry Lomb|Captain Henry Lomb]], co-founder of [[Bausch & Lomb]]. The name of the merged institution at the time was called '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um and Mechanics Institute''' (RAMI), despite that The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school by taking over The Athenaeum's charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, the school celebrating Mechanics' founding year of 1885. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-establish its 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged [[research university]].\n\n[[File:Rochester Institute of Technology seal.png|thumb|left|RIT's traditional seal]]\nThe university originally resided within the city of [[Rochester, New York]], proper, on a block bounded by the [[Erie Canal]], South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately {{coord|43.152632|-77.615157|scale:5000}}). Its art department was originally located in the [[Bevier Memorial Building]]. By the middle of the twentieth century, RIT began to outgrow its facilities, and surrounding land was scarce and expensive; additionally, in 1959, the [[New York (state)|New York]] Department of Public Works announced a new freeway, the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], was to be built through the city along a path that bisected the university's campus and required demolition of key university buildings. In 1961, an unanticipated donation of $3.27&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3270000|1961|r=0}}}} today) from local Grace Watson, for whom RIT's dining hall was later named, allowed the university to purchase land for a new {{convert|1300|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus several miles south along the east bank of the [[Genesee River]] in suburban [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta]]. Upon completion in 1968, the university moved to the new suburban campus, where it resides today.<ref name=\"gordon\">{{Cite book|last=Gordon|first=Dane R.|title=Rochester Institute of Technology: Industrial Development and Educational Innovation in an American City, 1829\u20132006|year=2007|publisher=RIT Cary Graphic Arts Press|isbn=978-1-933360-23-2}}</ref><ref name=\"rit_timeline\">{{cite web | url=http://www2.rit.edu/175/timeline.html | title=RIT Timeline | author=Rochester Institute of Technology | accessdate=December 26, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226103733/http://www2.rit.edu/175/timeline.html | archive-date=February 26, 2008 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, RIT was selected by the [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] to be the site of the newly founded [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]] (NTID).<ref>{{Cite news | title=ROCHESTER TO GET U.S. DEAF COLLEGE | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 15, 1966 | page=22  }}</ref> NTID admitted its first students in 1968, concurrent with RIT's transition to the Henrietta campus.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Marschark | first = Marc | last2 = Lang | first2 = Harry G. | year = 2002 | title = Educating Deaf Students: From Research to Practice | location = [[New York City]] | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | page = 35 | isbn = 978-0-19-512139-1 | oclc = 45668968 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, RIT took over [[Eisenhower College]], a liberal arts college located in [[Seneca Falls (town), New York|Seneca Falls, New York]].

Demographically, students attend from all 50 states in the United States and from more than 100 countries around the world. The university has more than 4000 active faculty and staff members who engage with the students in a wide range of academic activities and research projects. It also has branches abroad, its global campuses, located in China, Croatia, United Arab Emirates ([[Dubai]]), and Kosovo.\n\nThirteen RIT alumni and faculty members have been recipients of the [[Pulitzer Prize]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rit.edu/about-rit#key-facts| title = Key facts about RIT|website=rit.edu}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe university began as a result of an 1891 merger between '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um''', a [[literary society]] founded in 1829 by [[Nathaniel Rochester|Colonel Nathaniel Rochester]] and associates, and '''The Mechanics Institute''', a Rochester school of practical [[Vocational education|technical training]] for local residents founded in 1885 by a consortium of local businessmen including [[Henry Lomb|Captain Henry Lomb]], co-founder of [[Bausch & Lomb]]. The name of the merged institution at the time was called '''Rochester Athen\u00e6um and Mechanics Institute''' (RAMI), despite that The Mechanics Institute was considered as the surviving school by taking over The Athenaeum's charter. From the time of the merger until 1944, the school celebrating Mechanics' founding year of 1885. In 1944, the school changed its name to Rochester Institute of Technology, re-establish its 1829 founding charter and became a full-fledged [[research university]].\n\n[[File:Rochester Institute of Technology seal.png|thumb|left|RIT's traditional seal]]\nThe university originally resided within the city of [[Rochester, New York]], proper, on a block bounded by the [[Erie Canal]], South Plymouth Avenue, Spring Street, and South Washington Street (approximately {{coord|43.152632|-77.615157|scale:5000}}). Its art department was originally located in the [[Bevier Memorial Building]]. By the middle of the twentieth century, RIT began to outgrow its facilities, and surrounding land was scarce and expensive; additionally, in 1959, the [[New York (state)|New York]] Department of Public Works announced a new freeway, the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], was to be built through the city along a path that bisected the university's campus and required demolition of key university buildings. In 1961, an unanticipated donation of $3.27&nbsp;million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3270000|1961|r=0}}}} today) from local Grace Watson, for whom RIT's dining hall was later named, allowed the university to purchase land for a new {{convert|1300|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus several miles south along the east bank of the [[Genesee River]] in suburban [[Henrietta, New York|Henrietta]].
