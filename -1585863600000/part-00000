Tatakae! Ouendan]]'' while incorporating many of the improvements in gameplay made in ''[[Elite Beat Agents]]''. The game has 4-player wireless play,<ref>[http://www.joystiq.com/2007/02/21/elite-beat-agents-sequel-is-on-oh-yes/ Joystiq - Elite Beat Agents sequel is on (oh yes)]</ref> supports the [[Rumble Pak#Nintendo DS|Nintendo DS Rumble Pak]] accessory, and was released in Japan on May 17, 2007.<ref>[http://kotaku.com/gaming/inis/ouendan-2-coming-next-month-251288.php Ouendan 2 Coming Next Month]</ref>\n\n==Storyline==\n\n''Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii'' follows more or less the storyline from the original ''[[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan]]'', and is set roughly six years after the original game based on the game manual and the age differences of returning characters. Players act as the leader of a three-person cheerleading squad. Whenever someone is stressed out or backed into a corner, all they need to do is shout \"Ouendan!\" (Japanese for \"Cheer Squad\"). Then, the Ouendan appear (usually out of a place like a closet or waiting there while eating ramen) and use cheering and dance to help that someone through their troubles.  The map of the territory that the Ouendan patrol within ''Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii'' is the same as that found in the original game, although it has been turned ninety degrees and is now rendered using 3D graphics.\n\nThe original Ouendan (signified by wearing their long [[Japanese school uniform#Gakuran|Gakuran]] jackets) are still present in this game, cheering people on. However, a new rival Ouendan appear that challenge the original Ouendan in skill and cheering (the \"new\" Ouendan are signified by their blue military-style outfits.) The individual stories are all unrelated, but characters featured in one stage may appear as background or supporting characters in another.  One can also see characters from the first ''Ouendan'' game as lead, supporting or background characters, such as the pottery maker from the first game that appears as a guest at a hot springs, and gifts the hot springs family with new pottery work should the player be successful in the stage.  In the final stage, all of the characters in the game unite when the two Ouendan join together and once again lead the entire world in a cheer to save Earth when the sun's activity stops, plunging Earth into another ice age.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n{{Further2|[[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan#Gameplay|Gameplay in Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan]] and [[Elite Beat Agents#Gameplay|Gameplay in Elite Beat Agents]]}}\n\nAs in the original game, this sequel is played almost entirely via touch screen (the only actual face button used is the Start button for pausing the game). The player acts as the Ouendan, who cheer on the people that are in turmoil and shout out for them (the original \"Black\" Ouendan control the west side of that world, Y\u016bhi Town, and the new \"Blue\" Ouendan control the east side, Asahi Town.) The gameplay plays out identically to that found in the first ''Ouendan''; the player must tap colored circles in precise time with the music in order to cheer the character through his or her problems. There are three types of marker:\n*'''Hit Markers''': These need to be tapped to the beat.\n*'''Phrase Markers''': When this is tapped, the stylus must be held down and follow a ball sliding along a track. If an arrow appears at the end of the track, the player must run the stylus back in the opposite direction.\n*'''Spin Markers''': At certain points, a large wheel appears. Players must spin the wheel by making circular motions on the screen (either direction will do.) Once the required amount of spin has been cleared, further spinning will earn bonus points.\n\nThe top screen displays the stage's protagonist overcoming his or her dilemma. If the player's cheering is good, then the meter at the top of the touch screen stays in the yellow, and the character is seen triumphing over whatever it is holding him or her back. If the player's cheering is bad, then the meter on the top of the screen falls to the red and the character struggles. If the player's performance is particularly poor, the meter will hit the bottom and the mission will end in failure. Then, the player can either try again, quit to do something else, or review the last five seconds of gameplay up to where he or she lost.\n\nAt intervals in the song, the story progresses on the top screen. If the meter remains in the yellow, then the story will progress positively (scoring an \"O\") and if the meter is in the red, it will progress negatively (scoring an \"X\"). The number of Os and Xs given will determine the story's outcome from one of three possibilities: a good ending, which results in a special illustration, an average ending, or a bad ending. The final two levels do not adhere to this pattern.\n\n''Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii'' contains multiple enhancements over the original game, many of which were first featured in ''[[Elite Beat Agents]]''. These features include the ability to save stage replay data and use it later in a \"ghost versus\" mode, 4-player wireless play, Rumble Pak compatibility, multiple stage endings depending on the player's performance, and the ability to skip intro and epilogue sections of each stage. Also, as the player earns new ranks by achieving cumulative high score totals across all stages and difficulties, three additional bonus stages are unlocked when specific ranks are earned.\n\nBrand-new features introduced to the series for the first time in ''Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii'' include the ability to save 20 replay data files: in ''Elite Beat Agents'', players could only save one replay for each song regardless of difficulty, and saving a new one would overwrite it. Moreover, on the easiest difficulty, the player can continue a failed stage from the point the failure occurred, beginning with half of the life bar. It is also possible to unlock a mode in which the game's timer circles/markers are disabled, forcing the player to hit the markers with only the rhythm of the music as a guide. On the Kigaru ni \u014cen mode, only the timer circles are missing. On all other difficulty levels, the whole marker disappears, and as the player moves up the difficulty levels, the markers disappear faster. The game also includes an unlockable gallery featuring pictures of the various cheer teams unlocked each time a specific player rank is reached, the \"end of stage\" images, and the Story mode scenes. The multiplayer mode has also been upgraded, as players are now allowed to use the male cheerleaders on Karei ni \u014cen mode. They retain their male animations, except their dancing corresponds to the positioning of the Very Hard markers. Likewise, the player is allowed to use a Cheer Girl on the easier difficulties, retaining the female moves, but the dances correspond to the male markers. As well as being able to skip song intros, players can now skip the ending sequence of songs they have previously completed.\n\n===''Elite Beat Agents'' characters===\nBetween June 28 and July 11, 2007, players could use a Japanese DS Download Station to unlock additional characters from ''[[Elite Beat Agents]]''. This can also be achieved with an [[Action Replay DS]]. This provides an \"EBA Mode\" which replaces both Ouendan squads in the single-player game with the Elite Beat Agents or the Elite Beat Divas (although cutscenes and pictures are unaltered), and also allows the use of ''Agent J'' and the Ramen Shop Cat in multiplayer matches. In the final stage, the Elite Beat Agents replace the original Ouendan, while the backup dancers of the Blue Ouendan are led by the Ramen Shop Cat.

Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii'' follows more or less the storyline from the original ''[[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan]]'', and is set roughly six years after the original game based on the game manual and the age differences of returning characters. Players act as the leader of a three-person cheerleading squad. Whenever someone is stressed out or backed into a corner, all they need to do is shout \"Ouendan!\" (Japanese for \"Cheer Squad\"). Then, the Ouendan appear (usually out of a place like a closet or waiting there while eating ramen) and use cheering and dance to help that someone through their troubles.  The map of the territory that the Ouendan patrol within ''Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii'' is the same as that found in the original game, although it has been turned ninety degrees and is now rendered using 3D graphics.\n\nThe original Ouendan (signified by wearing their long [[Japanese school uniform#Gakuran|Gakuran]] jackets) are still present in this game, cheering people on. However, a new rival Ouendan appear that challenge the original Ouendan in skill and cheering (the \"new\" Ouendan are signified by their blue military-style outfits.) The individual stories are all unrelated, but characters featured in one stage may appear as background or supporting characters in another.  One can also see characters from the first ''Ouendan'' game as lead, supporting or background characters, such as the pottery maker from the first game that appears as a guest at a hot springs, and gifts the hot springs family with new pottery work should the player be successful in the stage.  In the final stage, all of the characters in the game unite when the two Ouendan join together and once again lead the entire world in a cheer to save Earth when the sun's activity stops, plunging Earth into another ice age.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n{{Further2|[[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan#Gameplay|Gameplay in Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan]] and [[Elite Beat Agents#Gameplay|Gameplay in Elite Beat Agents]]}}\n\nAs in the original game, this sequel is played almost entirely via touch screen (the only actual face button used is the Start button for pausing the game). The player acts as the Ouendan, who cheer on the people that are in turmoil and shout out for them (the original \"Black\" Ouendan control the west side of that world, Y\u016bhi Town, and the new \"Blue\" Ouendan control the east side, Asahi Town.) The gameplay plays out identically to that found in the first ''Ouendan''; the player must tap colored circles in precise time with the music in order to cheer the character through his or her problems. There are three types of marker:\n*'''Hit Markers''': These need to be tapped to the beat.\n*'''Phrase Markers''': When this is tapped, the stylus must be held down and follow a ball sliding along a track. If an arrow appears at the end of the track, the player must run the stylus back in the opposite direction.\n*'''Spin Markers''': At certain points, a large wheel appears. Players must spin the wheel by making circular motions on the screen (either direction will do.) Once the required amount of spin has been cleared, further spinning will earn bonus points.\n\nThe top screen displays the stage's protagonist overcoming his or her dilemma. If the player's cheering is good, then the meter at the top of the touch screen stays in the yellow, and the character is seen triumphing over whatever it is holding him or her back. If the player's cheering is bad, then the meter on the top of the screen falls to the red and the character struggles. If the player's performance is particularly poor, the meter will hit the bottom and the mission will end in failure. Then, the player can either try again, quit to do something else, or review the last five seconds of gameplay up to where he or she lost.\n\nAt intervals in the song, the story progresses on the top screen. If the meter remains in the yellow, then the story will progress positively (scoring an \"O\") and if the meter is in the red, it will progress negatively (scoring an \"X\"). The number of Os and Xs given will determine the story's outcome from one of three possibilities: a good ending, which results in a special illustration, an average ending, or a bad ending. The final two levels do not adhere to this pattern.\n\n''Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii'' contains multiple enhancements over the original game, many of which were first featured in ''[[Elite Beat Agents]]''. These features include the ability to save stage replay data and use it later in a \"ghost versus\" mode, 4-player wireless play, Rumble Pak compatibility, multiple stage endings depending on the player's performance, and the ability to skip intro and epilogue sections of each stage. Also, as the player earns new ranks by achieving cumulative high score totals across all stages and difficulties, three additional bonus stages are unlocked when specific ranks are earned.\n\nBrand-new features introduced to the series for the first time in ''Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii'' include the ability to save 20 replay data files: in ''Elite Beat Agents'', players could only save one replay for each song regardless of difficulty, and saving a new one would overwrite it. Moreover, on the easiest difficulty, the player can continue a failed stage from the point the failure occurred, beginning with half of the life bar. It is also possible to unlock a mode in which the game's timer circles/markers are disabled, forcing the player to hit the markers with only the rhythm of the music as a guide. On the Kigaru ni \u014cen mode, only the timer circles are missing. On all other difficulty levels, the whole marker disappears, and as the player moves up the difficulty levels, the markers disappear faster. The game also includes an unlockable gallery featuring pictures of the various cheer teams unlocked each time a specific player rank is reached, the \"end of stage\" images, and the Story mode scenes. The multiplayer mode has also been upgraded, as players are now allowed to use the male cheerleaders on Karei ni \u014cen mode. They retain their male animations, except their dancing corresponds to the positioning of the Very Hard markers. Likewise, the player is allowed to use a Cheer Girl on the easier difficulties, retaining the female moves, but the dances correspond to the male markers. As well as being able to skip song intros, players can now skip the ending sequence of songs they have previously completed.\n\n===''Elite Beat Agents'' characters===\nBetween June 28 and July 11, 2007, players could use a Japanese DS Download Station to unlock additional characters from ''[[Elite Beat Agents]]''. This can also be achieved with an [[Action Replay DS]]. This provides an \"EBA Mode\" which replaces both Ouendan squads in the single-player game with the Elite Beat Agents or the Elite Beat Divas (although cutscenes and pictures are unaltered), and also allows the use of ''Agent J'' and the Ramen Shop Cat in multiplayer matches. In the final stage, the Elite Beat Agents replace the original Ouendan, while the backup dancers of the Blue Ouendan are led by the Ramen Shop Cat. Animations do not change, other than the fact that their right hands never open due to the microphone's presence.\n\n== Track list==\n\nMoero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii features 19 tracks in total, most of which are cover versions.

It was Murdoch's fifth published novel.\n\nPrimary themes include marriage, [[adultery]], and [[incest]] within a group of civilised and educated people. Set in and around London, it depicts a power struggle between grown-up middle-class people who are lucky to be free of real problems. ''A Severed Head'' was a harbinger of the [[sexual revolution]] that was to hit Britain in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Plot==\n\nMartin Lynch-Gibbon is a well-to-do 41-year-old wine merchant whose childless marriage to an older woman called Antonia has been one of convenience rather than love. It never occurs to him that his ongoing secret affair with Georgie, a young academic in her twenties, could be [[sexual morality|immoral]]. Martin is shocked when his wife tells him that she has been having an affair with Palmer Anderson, her [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] and a friend of the couple. Antonia informs Martin that she wants to divorce him and marry Anderson.\n\nMartin moves out of their London house in [[Hereford Square]]. Before officially moving, Martin visits his brother Alexander's home near Oxford. While there he learns that Antonia has already written to Alexander about the divorce, leaving Alexander quite shaken. Later Martin returns to Hereford Square, where Antonia, now acting as a mother figure for him, tries to set up his new accommodation. After arguing with Antonia, he goes to the station to pick up Palmer's half-sister Honor Klein, a lecturer in [[anthropology]] who is visiting from Cambridge.\n\nMartin still does not want to publicly acknowledge his affair with Georgie, let alone become engaged to her. A few days later, Martin finally visits Georgie. While Georgie wants to publicize their affair, Martin refuses because he believes it will \"hurt\" Antonia. However, they decide to go to Hereford Square so that Georgie can see the house. While Martin is showing her around, they hear someone arrive at the house. Assuming it is Antonia, Martin rushes Georgie out the back door, despite her protests that she wishes to meet Antonia. The unexpected visitor turns out to be Honor, who notices Georgie's handbag that was left behind in her rush out the door. After the event, Martin tries to contact Georgie but is unsuccessful and soon returns to the house. There he finds out that Palmer and Antonia know about his relationship with Georgie. Martin finds Georgie and learns that Honor Klein has exposed their secret. Soon after Georgie meets Antonia in an awkward situation.\n\nLater, after a breakfast with Antonia, where they decide that Martin should take a short vacation, Martin calls on Georgie, only to discover his brother Alexander there. Martin is made even more furious when he discovers that Honor Klein was the person who introduced them to each other. After drunkenly returning to Hereford Square, Martin gets into a fight with Honor. After writing apology letters and waiting two days, Martin tries to find Antonia and Honor, only to find out that Antonia has gone and Honor is back in Cambridge.\n\nAround this time, Martin also realizes that he is now madly in love with Honor. He follows her to [[Cambridge]] and, in the middle of the night, breaks into her house, only to find her in bed with her half-brother Palmer. Even though Martin doesn't tell Antonia of this incestuous encounter, Palmer believes he has, and begins to act strangely around Antonia. Antonia decides that she should be with Martin instead, causing Martin to cut off his affair with Georgie. A few days later, Alexander comes by to inform Martin that he has become engaged to Georgie, rekindling Martin's feelings for her and making him very upset.\n\nAfter an angry confrontation with Palmer, who announces that he and Honor will be travelling abroad, Martin receives a package of hair from Georgie. Martin discovers an unconscious Georgie, who has attempted suicide, and is joined by Honor while waiting for the ambulance. After a scene in the hospital where everyone is gathered, Martin confesses his love to Honor. Honor says she knows but it does not matter because she is going away. Shortly afterwards, Antonia confesses to Martin that she has also been sleeping with his older brother Alexander ever since he introduced them, and that they will be getting married. In the end, Palmer and Georgie go away together, Alexander and Antonia are together, and Honor stays in England with Martin.\n\n==Themes==\n\nIn ''A Severed Head'', Murdoch succeeds in presenting a middle-aged [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] who initially thinks of himself as a survivor but realises that he is in fact a victim. Throughout the novel, all the main characters insist that they have long overcome conventional morality, that they are [[free agent]]s in the truest sense of the word, but in spite of his [[hedonism]] Lynch-Gibbon's residual moral posture just will not go away. Murdoch is particularly good at conveying the atmosphere of benevolence and the apparent lack of hard feelings among the individuals that have wronged and been wronged.

It was Murdoch's fifth published novel.\n\nPrimary themes include marriage, [[adultery]], and [[incest]] within a group of civilised and educated people. Set in and around London, it depicts a power struggle between grown-up middle-class people who are lucky to be free of real problems. ''A Severed Head'' was a harbinger of the [[sexual revolution]] that was to hit Britain in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Plot==\n\nMartin Lynch-Gibbon is a well-to-do 41-year-old wine merchant whose childless marriage to an older woman called Antonia has been one of convenience rather than love. It never occurs to him that his ongoing secret affair with Georgie, a young academic in her twenties, could be [[sexual morality|immoral]]. Martin is shocked when his wife tells him that she has been having an affair with Palmer Anderson, her [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] and a friend of the couple. Antonia informs Martin that she wants to divorce him and marry Anderson.\n\nMartin moves out of their London house in [[Hereford Square]]. Before officially moving, Martin visits his brother Alexander's home near Oxford. While there he learns that Antonia has already written to Alexander about the divorce, leaving Alexander quite shaken. Later Martin returns to Hereford Square, where Antonia, now acting as a mother figure for him, tries to set up his new accommodation. After arguing with Antonia, he goes to the station to pick up Palmer's half-sister Honor Klein, a lecturer in [[anthropology]] who is visiting from Cambridge.\n\nMartin still does not want to publicly acknowledge his affair with Georgie, let alone become engaged to her. A few days later, Martin finally visits Georgie. While Georgie wants to publicize their affair, Martin refuses because he believes it will \"hurt\" Antonia. However, they decide to go to Hereford Square so that Georgie can see the house. While Martin is showing her around, they hear someone arrive at the house. Assuming it is Antonia, Martin rushes Georgie out the back door, despite her protests that she wishes to meet Antonia. The unexpected visitor turns out to be Honor, who notices Georgie's handbag that was left behind in her rush out the door. After the event, Martin tries to contact Georgie but is unsuccessful and soon returns to the house. There he finds out that Palmer and Antonia know about his relationship with Georgie. Martin finds Georgie and learns that Honor Klein has exposed their secret. Soon after Georgie meets Antonia in an awkward situation.\n\nLater, after a breakfast with Antonia, where they decide that Martin should take a short vacation, Martin calls on Georgie, only to discover his brother Alexander there. Martin is made even more furious when he discovers that Honor Klein was the person who introduced them to each other. After drunkenly returning to Hereford Square, Martin gets into a fight with Honor. After writing apology letters and waiting two days, Martin tries to find Antonia and Honor, only to find out that Antonia has gone and Honor is back in Cambridge.\n\nAround this time, Martin also realizes that he is now madly in love with Honor. He follows her to [[Cambridge]] and, in the middle of the night, breaks into her house, only to find her in bed with her half-brother Palmer. Even though Martin doesn\u2019t tell Antonia of this incestuous encounter, Palmer believes he has, and begins to act strangely around Antonia. Antonia decides that she should be with Martin instead, causing Martin to cut off his affair with Georgie. A few days later, Alexander comes by to inform Martin that he has become engaged to Georgie, rekindling Martin's feelings for her and making him very upset.\n\nAfter an angry confrontation with Palmer, who announces that he and Honor will be travelling abroad, Martin receives a package of hair from Georgie. Martin discovers an unconscious Georgie, who has attempted suicide, and is joined by Honor while waiting for the ambulance. After a scene in the hospital where everyone is gathered, Martin confesses his love to Honor. Honor says she knows but it does not matter because she is going away. Shortly afterwards, Antonia confesses to Martin that she has also been sleeping with his older brother Alexander ever since he introduced them, and that they will be getting married. In the end, Palmer and Georgie go away together, Alexander and Antonia are together, and Honor stays in England with Martin.\n\n==Themes==\n\nIn ''A Severed Head'', Murdoch succeeds in presenting a middle-aged [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] who initially thinks of himself as a survivor but realises that he is in fact a victim. Throughout the novel, all the main characters insist that they have long overcome conventional morality, that they are [[free agent]]s in the truest sense of the word, but in spite of his [[hedonism]] Lynch-Gibbon's residual moral posture just will not go away. Murdoch is particularly good at conveying the atmosphere of benevolence and the apparent lack of hard feelings among the individuals that have wronged and been wronged. (\"It is not at all our idea that you should leave us. In a strange and rather wonderful way we can't do without you. We shall hold on to you, we shall look after you,\" Anderson says to Lynch-Gibbon, who sees himself as a [[cuckold]] rather than anything else.) At times funny, sad at others, ''A Severed Head'' also deals with more serious issues such as abortion (Georgie terminates her pregnancy at an early stage of her relationship with Lynch-Gibbon) and attempted suicide (again it is Georgie who tries to take her own life after being rejected by both Lynch-Gibbon and his brother).\n\nDespite these serious overtones, ''A Severed Head'' is regarded by many readers as the most entertaining of Murdoch's novels.

{"title_page": "Pierre et Jean", "text_new": "{{for|the 1943 French film adaptation|Pierre and Jean (film)}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=October 2011}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Pierre et Jean''''' is a [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] or [[psychological fiction|psycho-realist]] work written by [[Guy de Maupassant]] in \u00c9tretat in his native Normandy between June and September 1887 . This was Maupassant's shortest novel. It appeared in three instalments in the Nouvelle Revue and then in volume form in 1888, together with the essay \u201cLe Roman\u201d [\u201cThe Novel\u201d]. ''Pierre et Jean'' is a realist work, notably so by the subjects on which it treats, including knowledge of one's heredity (whether one is a legitimate son or a bastard), the bourgeoisie, and the problems stemming from money.\n\n==Plot==\nPierre and Jean are the sons of G\u00e9r\u00f4me Roland, a jeweller who has retired to [[Le Havre]], and his wife Louise. Pierre works as a doctor, and Jean is a lawyer. It recounts the story of a middle-class French family whose lives are changed when L\u00e9on Mar\u00e9chal, a deceased family friend, leaves his inheritance to Jean. This provokes Pierre to doubt the fidelity of his mother and the legitimacy of his brother. Pierre discovers that his theories about his brother's illegitimacy are correct when he discovers his mother has hid and lied about an incriminating portrait of Mar\u00e9chal and his love letters to her, some of which she burns when she realizes Pierre is learning of her past infidelity. This investigation sparks violent reactions in Pierre, whose external appearance vis-a-vis his mother visibly changes. In his anguish, most notably shown during family meals, he tortures her with allusions to the past that he has now uncovered. Meanwhile, Jean's career and love life improve over the course of the novel while Pierre's life gets significantly worse.

This was Maupassant\u2019s shortest novel. It appeared in three instalments in the Nouvelle Revue and then in volume form in 1888, together with the essay \u201cLe Roman\u201d [\u201cThe Novel\u201d]. ''Pierre et Jean'' is a realist work, notably so by the subjects on which it treats, including knowledge of one's heredity (whether one is a legitimate son or a bastard), the bourgeoisie, and the problems stemming from money.\n\n==Plot==\nPierre and Jean are the sons of G\u00e9r\u00f4me Roland, a jeweller who has retired to [[Le Havre]], and his wife Louise. Pierre works as a doctor, and Jean is a lawyer. It recounts the story of a middle-class French family whose lives are changed when L\u00e9on Mar\u00e9chal, a deceased family friend, leaves his inheritance to Jean. This provokes Pierre to doubt the fidelity of his mother and the legitimacy of his brother. Pierre discovers that his theories about his brother's illegitimacy are correct when he discovers his mother has hid and lied about an incriminating portrait of Mar\u00e9chal and his love letters to her, some of which she burns when she realizes Pierre is learning of her past infidelity. This investigation sparks violent reactions in Pierre, whose external appearance vis-a-vis his mother visibly changes. In his anguish, most notably shown during family meals, he tortures her with allusions to the past that he has now uncovered. Meanwhile, Jean's career and love life improve over the course of the novel while Pierre's life gets significantly worse. Provoked by his brother's accusations of jealousy, Pierre reveals to Jean what he has learned. However, unlike Pierre, Jean offers his mother love and protection. The novel closes with Pierre\u2019s departure on an oceanliner. Thus the novel is organised around the unwelcome appearance of a truth (Jean\u2019s illegitimacy), its suppression for the sake of family continuity and the acquisition of wealth, and the expulsion from the family of the legitimate son.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe novel was adapted into the 1943 French film ''[[Pierre and Jean (film)|Pierre and Jean]]'', and into the 2015 American drama film ''[[Peter and John]]''.\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource}}\n*[http://www.guydemaupassant.fr Free audiobook : Pierre et Jean (in French)]\n*[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3804 Free text : Pierre & Jean (in English)]\n\n{{Guy de Maupassant}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1888 French novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Guy de Maupassant]]\n[[Category:Naturalist novels]]\n[[Category:Psychological novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in 19th-century France]]\n[[Category:Novels first published in serial form]]\n[[Category:Le Havre]]\n[[Category:Adultery in novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Normandy]]\n[[Category:French novels adapted into films]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_et_Jean"}

It tells the story of Benjamin Braddock, who, while pondering his future after his graduation, has an affair with the older Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner.\n\nIt was adapted into the highly successful 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'',  directed by [[Mike Nichols]] and with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in the title role. Webb has stated he never felt comfortable with the attention the film brought him because he felt it distracted from his status as a serious artist. He did not receive any royalties from the film and has stated he is glad it happened that way.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/05/31/graduate.sequel.ap/index.html \"''Graduate'' author to write sequel\", CNN.com]</ref>\n\nOn the episode of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''Movies That Shook the World'' devoted to the film adaptation, Webb revealed the identity of the real-life inspiration for Mrs. Robinson: Jane Ericson (exact spelling unknown), the wife of an associate of Webb's father.  However, that was the extent of any similarity with the novel; Webb denied having a relationship with her.\n\nA sequel titled ''[[Home School (novel)|Home School]]'', which takes place ten years after the ending of the first novel, was published by [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] in June 2007.\n\nThe book's creation serves as the centerpiece of the 2005 film ''[[Rumor Has It (film)|Rumor Has It...]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Part 1===\nBenjamin Braddock has recently graduated from a small Eastern college and has returned home to a suburb of Los Angeles. Suffering a small identity crisis, Benjamin, visibly uncomfortable as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans, evades those who try to congratulate him.\n\nHe insists that he wants to be alone and to go on a walk, but eventually gives up and returns to his room. Mrs. Robinson enters his room, claiming to be looking for the bathroom, but stays with Ben, asking him strange questions and probing into his life. At the insistence of the neglected wife of his father's law partner, he drives Mrs. Robinson home. Once at the house, Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. Benjamin rebuffs her and quickly goes downstairs as he hears Mr. Robinson arriving home. During the next week, a day after his 21st birthday, Benjamin announces his intention to go on a road trip in order to cast off the societal expectations to spend his life \u201camongst the common people.\u201d\n\n===Part 2===\nAfter the trip he decides to begin his affair with Mrs. Robinson and meets her at the Taft Hotel. In mid-September, Benjamin spends the time drifting around in the pool by day, purposefully neglecting to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. One evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she is in a loveless marriage, because in the 1940s, she became pregnant with her daughter, Elaine, and married to avoid scandal.\n\nAfter being increasingly pressured by his parents and Mr. Robinson to go on a date with Elaine, he takes her out but deliberately sabotages the date by driving recklessly and taking her to two clubs and a strip show. Elaine suggests going to the Taft Hotel, and Benjamin becomes visibly uncomfortable. The hotel staff recognizes him, causing Elaine to be suspicious. He tells Elaine that he had an affair with an older married woman with a husband and a son. Benjamin discovers that Elaine is someone he is comfortable with, and agrees to ask Elaine out again the next day. The next morning, Mrs. Robinson threatens to expose their relationship to Elaine if Benjamin ever sees Elaine again. Benjamin decides to tell Elaine everything. Elaine is furious and wants nothing to do with him and returns to Berkeley. After many months pass, Benjamin decides to marry Elaine.\n\n===Part 3===\nBenjamin goes to Berkeley and moves into a rooming house near Elaine's dormitory.  Elaine is uneasy in his presence and tells him that she has started dating Carl Smith, a medical student. Elaine accuses him of taking advantage of her mother's drunken state and raping her, refusing to believe that it was her mother who initiated the affair. Elaine eventually realizes that her mother was lying, and makes him promise that he won't leave Berkeley until he has any definite plans. \n \nWhen Benjamin proposes marriage, Elaine says she is concerned about graduating from college and her relationship with her parents if she continues to see him. Benjamin receives a telegram from Mrs. Robinson, telling him to get out of town immediately. Mr. Robinson arrives at the college and tells Benjamin that he is divorcing his wife and terminating his partnership with Mr. Braddock. Then he warns him not to get close to Elaine again, otherwise he will prosecute him. He forces his daughter to drop out of school and takes her away. Benjamin's father arrives the following day and wants to take him back home to see a psychiatrist. Benjamin returns to his hometown and sneaks into the Robinsons' home but encounters both Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, who calls the police and claims that a man has broken into their house. He escapes from the house and returns to Berkeley to find Elaine.\n\nBenjamin lands in San Francisco. He finds Carl's apartment address in the directory and heads over. There he finds a letter and learns that Carl will marry Elaine that very morning. Benjamin takes a plane to Santa Barbara and finds the church, where the ceremony is already taking place. He tries the doors to the church, all of which are locked, except for a side door that leads to the balcony. As he sees Elaine walking down the aisle, he interrupts the ceremony, slamming his hands on the railing and calling her name. He runs downstairs to the sanctuary. Using a cross as a weapon, he intimidates Carl, grabs Elaine, and they ride off on the nearest bus to elope.\n\n==Stage adaptation==\n[[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]] produced a play in 2000, adapted from the original novel and the movie, which was a hit both in London's West End and on Broadway and has toured the United States. There is a [[Brazil]]ian version adapted by [[Miguel Falabella]]. Several actresses have starred as Mrs. Robinson, including [[Kathleen Turner]], [[Lorraine Bracco]], [[Jerry Hall]], [[Amanda Donohoe]], [[Morgan Fairchild]], [[Anne Archer]], [[Vera Fischer (actress)|Vera Fischer]] and [[Linda Gray]]. The Broadway production in 2002 starred [[Kathleen Turner]], [[Jason Biggs]], and [[Alicia Silverstone]].\n\nThe stage production adds several scenes that are not in the novel or the film.  It also uses songs by [[Simon & Garfunkel]] not used in the film, such as \"[[Bridge Over Troubled Water|Baby Driver]]\" as well as music from other popular musicians from the era such as [[The Byrds]] and [[The Beach Boys]].\n\n==Sequel==\n{{main|Home School (novel)}}\nIn ''Home School'', Ben and Elaine, now married and living in Westchester County, are fighting to allow for their child to be [[homeschooled]]. They turn to Mrs. Robinson to help them. The novel is set in the 1970s. In real life, Webb himself had fought to have his boys homeschooled.

It tells the story of Benjamin Braddock, who, while pondering his future after his graduation, has an affair with the older Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner.\n\nIt was adapted into the highly successful 1967 film ''[[The Graduate]]'',  directed by [[Mike Nichols]] and with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in the title role. Webb has stated he never felt comfortable with the attention the film brought him because he felt it distracted from his status as a serious artist. He did not receive any royalties from the film and has stated he is glad it happened that way.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/books/05/31/graduate.sequel.ap/index.html \"''Graduate'' author to write sequel\", CNN.com]</ref>\n\nOn the episode of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] television series ''Movies That Shook the World'' devoted to the film adaptation, Webb revealed the identity of the real-life inspiration for Mrs. Robinson: Jane Ericson (exact spelling unknown), the wife of an associate of Webb's father.  However, that was the extent of any similarity with the novel; Webb denied having a relationship with her.\n\nA sequel titled ''[[Home School (novel)|Home School]]'', which takes place ten years after the ending of the first novel, was published by [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]] in June 2007.\n\nThe book's creation serves as the centerpiece of the 2005 film ''[[Rumor Has It (film)|Rumor Has It...]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{long plot|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Part 1===\nBenjamin Braddock has recently graduated from a small Eastern college and has returned home to a suburb of Los Angeles. Suffering a small identity crisis, Benjamin, visibly uncomfortable as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans, evades those who try to congratulate him.\n\nHe insists that he wants to be alone and to go on a walk, but eventually gives up and returns to his room. Mrs. Robinson enters his room, claiming to be looking for the bathroom, but stays with Ben, asking him strange questions and probing into his life. At the insistence of the neglected wife of his father\u2019s law partner, he drives Mrs. Robinson home. Once at the house, Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. Benjamin rebuffs her and quickly goes downstairs as he hears Mr. Robinson arriving home. During the next week, a day after his 21st birthday, Benjamin announces his intention to go on a road trip in order to cast off the societal expectations to spend his life \u201camongst the common people.\u201d\n\n===Part 2===\nAfter the trip he decides to begin his affair with Mrs. Robinson and meets her at the Taft Hotel. In mid-September, Benjamin spends the time drifting around in the pool by day, purposefully neglecting to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. One evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she is in a loveless marriage, because in the 1940s, she became pregnant with her daughter, Elaine, and married to avoid scandal.\n\nAfter being increasingly pressured by his parents and Mr. Robinson to go on a date with Elaine, he takes her out but deliberately sabotages the date by driving recklessly and taking her to two clubs and a strip show. Elaine suggests going to the Taft Hotel, and Benjamin becomes visibly uncomfortable. The hotel staff recognizes him, causing Elaine to be suspicious. He tells Elaine that he had an affair with an older married woman with a husband and a son. Benjamin discovers that Elaine is someone he is comfortable with, and agrees to ask Elaine out again the next day. The next morning, Mrs. Robinson threatens to expose their relationship to Elaine if Benjamin ever sees Elaine again. Benjamin decides to tell Elaine everything. Elaine is furious and wants nothing to do with him and returns to Berkeley. After many months pass, Benjamin decides to marry Elaine.\n\n===Part 3===\nBenjamin goes to Berkeley and moves into a rooming house near Elaine\u2019s dormitory.  Elaine is uneasy in his presence and tells him that she has started dating Carl Smith, a medical student. Elaine accuses him of taking advantage of her mother\u2019s drunken state and raping her, refusing to believe that it was her mother who initiated the affair. Elaine eventually realizes that her mother was lying, and makes him promise that he won\u2019t leave Berkeley until he has any definite plans. \n \nWhen Benjamin proposes marriage, Elaine says she is concerned about graduating from college and her relationship with her parents if she continues to see him. Benjamin receives a telegram from Mrs. Robinson, telling him to get out of town immediately. Mr. Robinson arrives at the college and tells Benjamin that he is divorcing his wife and terminating his partnership with Mr. Braddock. Then he warns him not to get close to Elaine again, otherwise he will prosecute him. He forces his daughter to drop out of school and takes her away. Benjamin's father arrives the following day and wants to take him back home to see a psychiatrist. Benjamin returns to his hometown and sneaks into the Robinsons' home but encounters both Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, who calls the police and claims that a man has broken into their house. He escapes from the house and returns to Berkeley to find Elaine.\n\nBenjamin lands in San Francisco. He finds Carl\u2019s apartment address in the directory and heads over. There he finds a letter and learns that Carl will marry Elaine that very morning. Benjamin takes a plane to Santa Barbara and finds the church, where the ceremony is already taking place. He tries the doors to the church, all of which are locked, except for a side door that leads to the balcony. As he sees Elaine walking down the aisle, he interrupts the ceremony, slamming his hands on the railing and calling her name. He runs downstairs to the sanctuary. Using a cross as a weapon, he intimidates Carl, grabs Elaine, and they ride off on the nearest bus to elope.\n\n==Stage adaptation==\n[[John Reid (music manager)|John Reid]] produced a play in 2000, adapted from the original novel and the movie, which was a hit both in London's West End and on Broadway and has toured the United States. There is a [[Brazil]]ian version adapted by [[Miguel Falabella]]. Several actresses have starred as Mrs. Robinson, including [[Kathleen Turner]], [[Lorraine Bracco]], [[Jerry Hall]], [[Amanda Donohoe]], [[Morgan Fairchild]], [[Anne Archer]], [[Vera Fischer (actress)|Vera Fischer]] and [[Linda Gray]]. The Broadway production in 2002 starred [[Kathleen Turner]], [[Jason Biggs]], and [[Alicia Silverstone]].\n\nThe stage production adds several scenes that are not in the novel or the film.  It also uses songs by [[Simon & Garfunkel]] not used in the film, such as \"[[Bridge Over Troubled Water|Baby Driver]]\" as well as music from other popular musicians from the era such as [[The Byrds]] and [[The Beach Boys]].\n\n==Sequel==\n{{main|Home School (novel)}}\nIn ''Home School'', Ben and Elaine, now married and living in Westchester County, are fighting to allow for their child to be [[homeschooled]]. They turn to Mrs. Robinson to help them. The novel is set in the 1970s. In real life, Webb himself had fought to have his boys homeschooled. The poorly received sequel was written about forty years after the original book.<ref>Glitz, Michael. \"[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/charles-webb-writes-graduate-sequel-article-1.340211 Charles Webb writes 'Graduate' sequel].\" ''[[New York Daily News]]''.
