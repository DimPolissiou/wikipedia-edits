In 1943, Japan required Hong Kong to use [[Japanese military yen]] to exchange inter-medium. In 1945, the Japanese announced surrender in the Second World War, and the [[Japanese military yen]] became useless paper. Most people go to a pawnbroker and have some Hong Kong Dollars for their daily life. To circulate funds and jump-start the economy, the Hong Kong Government urged the pawn industry to revive itself. With government support, The Hong Kong & Kowloon Pawnbrokers' Association Limited was set up in 1947. There were only 11 members at the time. Between 1950 and 1960, the number of members increased to more than 90, reaching 138 in 1994. Today the Association has more than 161 members and combined with non-member pawn shops, there are approximately 250 pawn shops in Hong Kong. Pawn shops are mainly located on [[Hong Kong Island]], particularly [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] and [[Kowloon]].

He specialises in [[drum and bass]] and [[jungle music]].\n\n==Biography==\nShy FX's debut record was \"Jungle Love\", released in 1992 on the Permission to Dance label. Soon after, he signed to Sound of the Underground Records (often abbreviated as S.O.U.R.) and in 1994 released the breakthrough ragga jungle track \"Original Nuttah\" (featuring vocals from MC UK Apache) which helped to cement his position as a mainstay producer of the jungle/drum & bass scene.\n\nThroughout his career, he has collaborated with [[T Power]], both as Ebony Dubsters and Shy FX and T Power; their 2001 breakthrough track \"[[Shake Ur Body]]\" with vocalist Di (real name [[Truce (group)|Dianne Joseph]]) was a number 7 hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Released on EMI subsidiary [[Positiva]], it gained widespread support from both club and commercial radio DJs and helped to further popularise drum & bass as a mainstream music genre.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 497}}</ref>\n\nThe success of \"Shake Ur Body\" was followed by the duo's album ''Set It Off'', released in 2002 on [[Pete Tong]]'s label [[FFRR Records|FFRR]]. Several EPs and single releases followed; by 2005, Shy FX had made the decision to consolidate his releases onto his own label and founded Digital Soundboy Recordings. In collaboration with T Power, they subsequently released the album ''Diary of a Digital Sound Boy'' on 17 October 2005, featuring the songs \"Feelings\", \"On The Run\" and \"Plastic Soul\". Shy FX and T Power also released \"Don't Wanna Know\" featuring Di and [[Skibadee|MC Skibadee]]. The song was notably used on the UK television programme ''Soccer AM'' as part of the 'Skills Skool' feature.\n\nShy FX produced \"Da Feelin\" for [[Dizzee Rascal]]'s 2007 album, ''[[Maths + English]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title=Dizzee Rascal, Maths and English Review | work=The Guardian |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,2087180,00.html | accessdate=7 June 2007 | location=London | first=Alex | last=MacPherson | date=25 May 2007}}</ref> He also produced \"Can't Tek No More\" on Dizzee Rascal's 2009 album, ''[[Tongue N' Cheek]]''. His remix of [[Naughty Boy]], [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]] and [[Emeli Sand\u00e9]]'s song \"[[Never Be Your Woman]]\" was released as the single rather than the original mix. Shy's remix charted at number eight on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. He [[remix]]ed \"She Said\", a number 3 UK chart single by [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]]. His remix was released on both the \"She Said\" single and on the deluxe edition of Plan B's ''[[The Defamation of Strickland Banks]]''.\n\nMore recently, he produced \"Raver\" featuring [[Kano]], [[Donae'o]] and Roses Gabor, plus the UK artist Yasmin's first single, \"On My Own\".

He specialises in [[drum and bass]] and [[jungle music]].\n\n==Biography==\nShy FX's debut record was \"Jungle Love\", released in 1992 on the Permission to Dance label. Soon after, he signed to Sound of the Underground Records (often abbreviated as S.O.U.R.) and in 1994 released the breakthrough ragga jungle track \"Original Nuttah\" (featuring vocals from MC UK Apache) which helped to cement his position as a mainstay producer of the jungle/drum & bass scene.\n\nThroughout his career, he has collaborated with [[T Power]], both as Ebony Dubsters and Shy FX and T Power; their 2001 breakthrough track \"[[Shake Ur Body]]\" with vocalist Di (real name [[Truce (group)|Dianne Joseph]]) was a number 7 hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Released on EMI subsidiary [[Positiva]], it gained widespread support from both club and commercial radio DJs and helped to further popularise drum & bass as a mainstream music genre.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited \n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 497}}</ref>\n\nThe success of \"Shake Ur Body\" was followed by the duo's album ''Set It Off'', released in 2002 on [[Pete Tong]]'s label [[FFRR Records|FFRR]]. Several EPs and single releases followed; by 2005, Shy FX had made the decision to consolidate his releases onto his own label and founded Digital Soundboy Recordings. In collaboration with T Power, they subsequently released the album ''Diary of a Digital Sound Boy'' on 17 October 2005, featuring the songs \"Feelings\", \"On The Run\" and \"Plastic Soul\". Shy FX and T Power also released \"Don't Wanna Know\" featuring Di and [[Skibadee|MC Skibadee]]. The song was notably used on the UK television programme ''Soccer AM'' as part of the 'Skills Skool' feature.\n\nShy FX produced \"Da Feelin\" for [[Dizzee Rascal]]'s 2007 album, ''[[Maths + English]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title=Dizzee Rascal, Maths and English Review | work=The Guardian |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,2087180,00.html | accessdate=7 June 2007 | location=London | first=Alex | last=MacPherson | date=25 May 2007}}</ref> He also produced \"Can't Tek No More\" on Dizzee Rascal's 2009 album, ''[[Tongue N' Cheek]]''.
