Initially known as 'Squaw Bonnet', its summit is the highest point in the county.  While most maps show the elevation as 3899 feet, some suggest that more recent surveys have it as 3904 feet or even 3908 feet.\n \nThe mountain is the highest in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] south of the {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Adirondack High Peaks|High Peaks]] region. It is one of thirteen mountains in New York with more than {{convert|2000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} of [[topographic prominence]]. Snowy Mountain is flanked to the northeast by [[Squaw Mountain]] (3239 feet), and to the southwest by [[Lewey Mountain]] (3742 feet).  A subsidiary ridge comes off the summit to the east ending at unnamed 'Peak 3149' (3149 feet) which forms the head of a large bowl overlooking the Griffin Brook drainage.\n\nSnowy Mountain stands within the [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the [[Hudson River]], which drains into [[New York Bay]]. The south end of the northwest side of Snowy Mountain drains into Little Squaw Brook, thence into the [[Cedar River (New York)|Cedar River]], and the [[Hudson River]]. The north side of Snowy Mountain drains into Squaw Brook, thence into [[Indian Lake, New York|Indian Lake]], [[Lake Abanakee]], the [[Indian River (Hudson River tributary)|Indian River]], and the Hudson River. The northeast end of Snowy Mountain drains into Beaver Brook, thence into Indian Lake. The southeast slopes of Snowy Mountain drain into Indian Lake via Griffin Brook, Forks Brook, Willow Brook, and Falls Brook.\n\nIt is the location of the recently restored [[Snowy Mountain Fire Observation Station]], i.e. 'fire tower', listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> In 1909, after the disastrous forest fires of 1903 and 1908, New York State began erecting observation towers on strategically located peaks, such as Snowy Mountain, as part of a comprehensive forest fire suppression program for the Adirondack Mountains.  That year a fifteen foot high log tower and a small log cabin were erected on the summit of Snowy Mountain.  A telephone line was strung from the tower to Indian Lake village, a distance of 11 1/2 miles.  Upon sighting smoke, the observer would call in the location of a suspected forest fire.  With reports from observers on other nearby mountains, the exact location of the fire could be calculated by triangulation and fire suppression crews dispatched most expeditiously.  In 1917, a steel tower 22 feet high replaced the log tower.  In 1933, the steel tower was raised 33 feet so observers could see over the surrounding trees (one must assume that Verplanck Colvin and his men cleared the summit of most, if not all, trees in 1872 for triangulation sightings to distant peaks during the Adirondack Survey).  In 1971, the Snowy Mountain fire tower was closed when NYS decided that it was unnecessary for protecting the Adirondack Park from forest fires (airplanes could do the job equally well).<ref>Podskoch, Martin, 2003.

While the trip is nearly an eight-mile walk involving more than 2000 feet of elevation gain, many find its views well worth the effort.\n\nWhile the history of ascending this peak is surely incomplete, this much is known: The earliest known ascent is said to have been in 1771 by Archibald Campbell, a surveyor from Albany, NY.  In that year, Joseph Totten and Stephen Crossfield were negotiating the purchase of a huge land tract from the Mohawk Nation (Six Nation Confederacy) for Edward and Ebenezer Jessup who had great influence with Sir William Johnson, NY Governor Dunmore and General Tryon.  One can imagine that Campbell was dispatched to the area to find out something about what was being purchased.  Verplanck Colvin and his crew climbed it on 4 August 1872 for the Adirondack Survey.  Mills Blake, Colvin's assistant, and his crew climbed it again ten years later on 7 November 1882 to complete some triangulations, again for the Adirondack Survey.  One might wonder about their itinerary for they were again on the summit on 9 and 10 November.  Due to the four mile approach, it seems likely that the survey crew bivouacked on the summit at least for the last two days.  There is some speculation that Colvin may have been among the group on the 9th.  While technically not 'winter', some consider this to be the earliest known 'winter' ascent. Colvin made his second (perhaps 3rd) ascent of this peak on 22 June 1885 when he certainly bivouacked on the summit.<ref>Rosevear, Francis B., 1992.

Initially known as 'Squaw Bonnet', its summit is the highest point in the county.  While most maps show the elevation as 3899 feet, some suggest that more recent surveys have it as 3904 feet or even 3908 feet.\n \nThe mountain is the highest in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] south of the {{convert|4000|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Adirondack High Peaks|High Peaks]] region. It is one of thirteen mountains in New York with more than {{convert|2000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} of [[topographic prominence]]. Snowy Mountain is flanked to the northeast by [[Squaw Mountain]] (3239 feet), and to the southwest by [[Lewey Mountain]] (3742 feet).  A subsidiary ridge comes off the summit to the east ending at unnamed 'Peak 3149' (3149 feet) which forms the head of a large bowl overlooking the Griffin Brook drainage.\n\nSnowy Mountain stands within the [[drainage basin|watershed]] of the [[Hudson River]], which drains into [[New York Bay]]. The south end of the northwest side of Snowy Mountain drains into Little Squaw Brook, thence into the [[Cedar River (New York)|Cedar River]], and the [[Hudson River]]. The north side of Snowy Mountain drains into Squaw Brook, thence into [[Indian Lake, New York|Indian Lake]], [[Lake Abanakee]], the [[Indian River (Hudson River tributary)|Indian River]], and the Hudson River. The northeast end of Snowy Mountain drains into Beaver Brook, thence into Indian Lake. The southeast slopes of Snowy Mountain drain into Indian Lake via Griffin Brook, Forks Brook, Willow Brook, and Falls Brook.\n\nIt is the location of the recently restored [[Snowy Mountain Fire Observation Station]], i.e. 'fire tower', listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2001.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref> In 1909, after the disastrous forest fires of 1903 and 1908, New York State began erecting observation towers on strategically located peaks, such as Snowy Mountain, as part of a comprehensive forest fire suppression program for the Adirondack Mountains.  That year a fifteen foot high log tower and a small log cabin were erected on the summit of Snowy Mountain.  A telephone line was strung from the tower to Indian Lake village, a distance of 11 1/2 miles.  Upon sighting smoke, the observer would call in the location of a suspected forest fire.

From the sources I have read, it appears that the Battle of Narbonne happened at the mouth of the River Berre, rather than the river near Marseilles. I also removed the part about both commanders being killed, because this does not appear to have been the case. I might be wrong and I'm not an expert, so I would welcome any advice on the matter.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD_737"}
