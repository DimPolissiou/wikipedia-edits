These psychologists worked at National Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Statens Senter for Barne- og Ungdomspsykiatri (the SSBU). They had placed a care order for the boy but this wasn't carried out by [[Barnevernet]], Norway's state Child Welfare Service. After the attacks on the 22nd of July 2011 one of the psychologists who had observed Breivik as a child stated that \"If Anders had been removed from his abusive home he would have developed altogether differently. His actions are essentially an extreme expression of the price society has to pay for the inadequacy of the Child Welfare Services.\" \n\nDuring that time the three-generation hypothesis was applied to explain why some children develop severe mental issues. This hypothesis states that if the parents had a difficult childhood and a bad relationship with the grandparents and because of that failure to develop a healthy bond with their children, the third generation develops severe issues. Breivik's mother had had to take care of her disabled mother starting from age eight. The grandmother had contracted polio and became paralysed and wheelchair-bound. Wenche also lost her father as he died when she was eight years old. The people surrounding the family and social services failed to provide help to the family so that Wenche was constantly overstrained with having to watch her disabled mother while still being a child herself. On top of her handicap, the grandmother developed psychosis and constantly blamed her daughter for her illness. She made Wenche completely sacrifice her life for her so that she wasn't allowed to develop as a normal child at all and didn't attend school regularly or built a stable group of friends. She fled her abusive home at age 17 and soon after that became a teenage mother. Some time later she met Jens Breivik who later became Anders' father.<ref name=\"tv2\">{{cite news |last1=Olsen |first1=Asbj\u00f8rn |title=Breivik was 'already damaged by the age of two' |url=https://www.tv2.no/a/8241631/ |accessdate=1 December 2019 |agency=TV2 |date=20 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring her pregnancy Breivik mother already developed a disdain for him. She claimed that he was a \"nasty child\" and that he was \"kicking her on purpose\". She had wanted to abort him but at the time that she returned to Norway from the UK, she had already passed the three months threshold for an abortion. Psychologists reports stated that she thought that Breivik was a \"fundamentally nasty and evil child and determined to destroy her.\" She stopped breastfeeding her son pretty early on because he was \"sucking the life out of her.\"<ref name=\"tv2\"/>\n\nBreivik's mother moved back to Oslo in no. 18, Fritznersgate, where Jens Breivik had an apartment. The neighbors claimed that there were noises of fights and that the mother left her children completely alone for extended periods of time, while she was working as a nurse. In 1981 Breivik's mother applied for economic help and in 1982 she applied for [[Respite care|respite care]] for her son. She says that she was overwhelmed with the boy and unable to care for him. She described him to be \"clingy and demanding.\" Breivik was then placed with a young couple. This couple later told police that the mother, when bringing two-year-old Breivik to the house, had asked that he be allowed to touch the man's penis because he had no one to compare himself to in terms of appearance. 'All he ever saw were girls' parts. This suggests that Breivik had been sexually abused by the age of two already. \n\nIn February 1983, on the advice of her neighbors, Breivik's mother sought help from the National Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (SSBU) in Oslo. There the mother then stayed during the day with Breivik and was observed by psychiatrists for about one month. The conclusion of the stay from the psychiatrists was that Breivik should be placed in the foster care system and had to be removed from his mother for him to develop normally. The justification for this was several observations. Breivik was almost completely void of any emotional engagement. He didn't show joy. He didn't cry when he was hurt. He made no attempts to play with other children. He was also extremely clean and became anxious when his toys weren't in order. Psychologists believed that he had become this way because of the negative reactions his mother displayed to any emotion he showed. They thought that she had punished him and reacted extremely negatively to him displaying emotions that had led him to become devoid of any visible emotions. His mother had also claimed that he is uncleanly and that she constantly had to care for him and run after him. Psychologists believed that Breivik had become this cleanly because of fear of punishment from his mother. He didn't show the normal level of uncleanliness of a four-year-old. Breivik seemed extremely careful and controlled. He had no repertoire on how to express emotions normally. During long phases of emotional voidness he would rarely erupt and display extreme uncontrolled emotions.<ref name=\"tv2\"/>\n\nReports of the staff said that his mother had told Breivik while she knew that she was being observed by health personnel that she \"wished that he was dead\". At the same time, she tied him to her and switched from being very affectionate to being extremely cruel from one minute to the other. This was an unacceptable situation for a four-year-old to be in, according to the psychiatrists. The report from 1983 stated \"Anders is a victim of his mother's projections of paranoid-aggressive and sexual fears toward men in general\", and \"she projects onto him her own primitive, aggressive and sexual fantasies; all the qualities in men that she regards as dangerous and aggressive.\" Breivik reacted very negatively to his mother. He alternated between clinginess, petty aggression and extreme childishness.<ref name=\"tv2\"/>\nThe final conclusion of the observation was that \"The family is in dire need of help. Anders should be removed from the family and given a better standard of care; the mother is provoked by him and remains in an ambivalent position which prevents him from developing on his own terms. Anders has become an anxious, passive child that averts making contact. He displays a manic defense mechanism of restless activity and a feigned, deflecting smile. Considering the profoundly pathological relationship between Anders and his mother it is crucial to make an early effort to ward off a severely skewed development in the boy.\"\nHowever, Child Welfare Services did not follow this recommendation. They did not understand how harmful the treatment of his mother was for Breivik. Instead, he was placed in respite care only during the weekends. SSBU hoped that eventually he would be fully placed into foster care.<ref name=\"tv2\"/>\n\nHowever when Breivik's father, Jens Breivik, learned of the situation he filed for custody. Although Breivik's mother had agreed to have him put in respite care, after Jens had filed for custody she demanded that Breivik be put back into full custody with her. Both the mother and father got lawyers involved. Eventually, the case was dropped because the Welfare Services thought that they wouldn't be able to provide enough evidence in court to warrant the placement of Breivik in foster care. One of the main reasons for this was the testimony of staff from the Vigelandsparken nursery, which Breivik had been attending since 1981. They described him as a happy child and claimed that nothing was wrong or had been wrong with him all along. During all of this the SSBU maintained their stances and said \"urgent action is crucially needed to prevent a severely skewed development in the boy\". The SSBU wrote Child Welfare Services a letter claiming that an order should be placed to have Breivik be removed by force. In 1984 a hearing in front of Barnevernsnemnda (the municipal child welfare committee) took place on whether Breivik's mother should lose custody of him. During the hearing, a young social worker who had never represented a case in court before was up against the experienced lawyer hired by Breivik's mother. She naturally won the case. It was ruled that the family should be supervised. However after only three visits the supervision was discontinued. Breivik was never again put into respite care or foster care.<ref name=\"tv2\"/> \n\nSSBU heavily criticised the decision stating \"The family's situation was deeply troubling. The boy was at risk of developing serious issues, and had the Child Welfare Service deliberately chosen to do nothing, they would have failed him. If however, they rejected to act on the SSBU's suggestions, the SSBU cannot be faulted. They did not have authority to make formal decisions.

Breivik described these two forms of \"extra punishment\", saying: \"it is quite demeaning to be exposed to this every day, so I countered by not leaving my prison cell. I did not want to exercise in the fresh air, [I did not want to] train, or use my study [prison-] cell.\"<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*On paper he had three prison cells, but because of the government's actions he hardly used the training cell and the study cell.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*Prison officers at Ila Prison were not to speak to him during his [first] stay there, and this was the case for parts of his stay at Skien [prison]; only the chief of the section was supposed to speak to Breivik. He said that he had not said \"no\" to the prison offering him activities such as playing [[floorball]] or [[chess]], but asked to be offered other activities. He said that starting in March 2014 he finally received the one hour of fellowship with prison officers; he said that claims had been made that he was allowed to prepare food, but that he was permitted only to press an egg cooker, and was not permitted to put frozen [[pizza]] in the oven\u2014that he had only done once.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*He still received a [[prison visitor]] twice a month\u2014an officer of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*Regarding recreation in fresh air, Breivik said: \"Until December 2015 all outdoors recreation was in a concrete box.

Thereafter I was permitted to recreate there every other week.\"<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*Regarding being awoken at night, Breivik said: \"There are inspections through the slot [of the door to the prison cell] every 40 minutes. Every time the slot was opened they demanded a sign of life. They wanted me to shake a leg every time the slot opened\". He felt humiliated that the prison officers made such a demand and said \"They shined a flashlight into the bed, depending on the prison officer. Called into the cell ''Are you alive, are you alive'', until I woke up. Then they had the sign of life that they needed. Countless times I was awoken at night.\"<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*After he came to Skien Prison, only 5 out of 300 letters that Breivik sent, had not been confiscated.

I have been thinking that visits without a glass wall could be something [to consider]. I don't think that with his image, he would be violent to someone he has [some sort of] a [working-] relationship to.\" Storrvik read out loud, recommendations by Rosenqvist, including \"Retired police officers could, for example, come [to socialise with Breivik], drink coffee, play games\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\n[[NRK]] reported that \"The [[Parliamentary Ombudsman]] has previously reported that the regimen for serving a prison sentence at the level of ''particularly high security''\" constitutes a heightened risk of inhumane treatment. Now it appears that Parliamentary Ombudsman will not testify\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> This was despite the fact that one of its leaders was on the list of witnesses summoned to testify.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nAt the start of the third day of the trial, Storrvik introduced a report from the \"prevention section\" at [the office of] the Parliamentary Ombudsman, dated 11 November 2015, regarding a series of visits that year by the ombudsman; the report said that Breivik was being held at a section where sometimes there was only one prisoner.<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> Storrvik read from the report that \"The limitations on visits at the time of the inspection [by the Parliamentary Ombudsman] seemed quite strict\". He said that in that section of the prison, it should expand the planned community between prisoners and employees and consider other measures to minimise the risk of isolation damage. At that section the prison should evaluate alternative possibilities for recreation in fresh air, in addition to the concrete exercise yard. The report recommended that the prison should discontinue the visual surveillance of health-related conversations that occur with a glass wall between prisoner and health personnel.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe second witness was Knut Bjarkeid, [[Superintendent (jail)|Chief Warden]] at Ila Prison. Storrvik confronted Bjarkeid with a document regarding [prison] Section G being turned [in part] into a \"particularly high security department\". He read: \"There are obvious limits to how long he can be in Section G\"; the document was written by Bjarkeid. Storrvik said that \"The words are here, obviously there are limits to how long he shall be isolated. This was in 2012. He is still in total isolation\". After Bjarkeid left the witness stand, Emberland read out loud from a letter that Breivik had written, dated 29 September 2013; in the letter Breivik reported several persons to the police; the [[Asker]] and [[B\u00e6rum]] Police District investigated and later dropped the investigation; Breivik's letter detailed the number of [[strip search]]es, \"grip manoeuvres\", and handcuffings he had undergone.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe third witness was Bj\u00f8rn Draugedalen, a [[general practitioner]] working one day per week at Skien Prison.<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> His first consultation with Breivik was held in a [[recreation room]] in ''avdeling for s\u00e6rlig h\u00f8y sikkerhet'', a high-security unit.  Draugedalen shook hands with Breivik, with five prison officers present; all the later consultations (until the trial) were held with a glass wall separating them.<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> Storrvik asked \"This change, when another prisoner arrived [and started to live in the same prison section], which resulted in Breivik's movement being restricted\u2014did you consider to go up there to view [his living conditions or] how things were\"?; Draugedalen answered \"We have to deal with changes done by the Corrections Services\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> The judge interjected, and she said that the Correction Services likely would listen to health care workers; Draugedalen replied that \"We did not see any extra value then, regarding visiting him in the [prison] section\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> At 12:36 Draugedalen said that he has not been notified that Breivik has discontinued his [college/university] studies.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe fourth witness was Haukeland, an MD for prisoners at Ila Prison. At 13:46 Storrvik read from [Breivik's medical] record dated 5 February 2013 that Breivik intends to recreate less in fresh air because of the strip searches that follow; Storrvik asked Haukeland: \"The fact that he goes outside less, to avoid being strip searched, was that discussed as a problem?; Haukeland answered \"No, that was not discussed [among the health care workers or] in the health section\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> At 13:51 the judge referred to nightly inspections every half hour, and Haukeland answers that he cannot remember; the judge asked \"Were you the ones who recommended that\"?; Haukeland replied \"No (...)\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe fifth witness was Margit Kise, a section leader at Skien Prison, who served from September 2013 to May 2015 in section A and H. The sixth witness was [[Tore Stenshagen]], also a section leader at Skien, who served during the third quarter of 2015. Stenshagen testified that sometimes he sits down [in Breivik's cell] and talks with Breivik, and sometimes they are accompanied by only one prison officer.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe seventh witness was J\u00f8rgen Spangen Iversen, an advisor at the Correctional Agency. Iversen was asked why Breivik was transferred to Skien rather than to [[Ringerike Prison]]; Iversen answered that he became a case-worker in 2014, and he was not involved in the transfer.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\n====Closing arguments====\nSumming up the case for Breivik, Storrvik said: \"For some reason, in Norway it has been established that in a female prison, a male prison officer cannot strip search a prisoner, but in a male prison it is ok that females are present. This is offensive\u2014I do not see any alternatives\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> He then talked about the case of strip searches of prisoner Piechowicz<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/CP_Poland_ENG.pdf |title=ECHR |format=PDF |website=Echr.coe.int |date= |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> in [[Poland]].<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> In that case the court was not convinced by the Polish government's arguments that the systematic, humiliating, daily searches were necessary to secure the prison. He continued: \"He was also awoken at night, but he had 147 visits that compensated\", and Piechowicz's isolation lasted for a shorter period; Storrvik said: \"Note that one calls it ''isolation'', even though he had one cellmate\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> Storrvik said that \"the verdict [of] Piechowicz vs. Poland point to a breach of [[European Convention on Human Rights|EMK]] in our case\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nStorrvik said: \"In my opinion there is not a complete concurrence between risk analyses and measures in our case. Risk analyses have at an early stage come with suggestions for measures [and these have not been followed up] (...) For example, removing the glass wall during visits and the possibility of introducing fellow prisoner, has been discussed at such an early stage that there should be a good reason for why Rosenqvist's advice has not been followed\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> Storrvik said that \"The main problem for the government in this case is that the discrepancies between well-founded\u2014in the context of security\u2014suggestions from one of those who knows this case the best has not been followed\".<ref name=saksoker2>[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/breivik-saksoker-staten-1.12617825 Breivik suing the government] \"Storrvik: \u2013 Hovedproblemet for Staten i denne saken her er avvik mellom sikkerhetsmessige, godt funderte forslag fra en av dem som kjenner denne saken aller best, ikke er fulgt.\"</ref>\n\nStorrvik compared Breivik's position as a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]] situation: if Breivik says that he has psychiatric problems, then he has picked them out of a book; if he says that he doesn't have psychiatric problems, then he doesn't have psychiatric problems.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nStorrvik said that there had been no inspections by agencies tasked with [[Separation of powers|oversight]], as far as he knew, until the Parliamentary Ombudsman came.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />  Breivik's lawyer referred to anal inspections [\u2014[[Natural orifices|visual or manual body cavity searches]]]; he disagreed with Emberland's view that there was a difference regarding ''anal inspection'' as referred to in ECHR verdicts in other cases, and the squats that Breivik must perform while naked; Storrvik's opinion is that Ila lacks concrete reasons for all the inspections.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nMestad said that \"The government's primary task is to protect its citizens.

But those who think that Breivik is not suffering have made themselves unavailable for the documented pain that Anders partook in [during childhood] ... The problem is that Breivik ... expresses his affliction in a manner that does not get captured particularly well by [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|diagnostics manual]]s.

These psychologists worked at National Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Statens Senter for Barne- og Ungdomspsykiatri (the SSBU). They had placed a care order for the boy but this wasn't carried out by [[Barnevernet]], Norway's state Child Welfare Service. After the attacks on the 22nd of July 2011 one of the psychologists who had observed Breivik as a child stated that \"If Anders had been removed from his abusive home and he would have developed altogether differently. His actions are essentially an extreme expression of the price society has to pay for the inadequacy of the Child Welfare Services.\" \n\nDuring that time the three generation hypothesis was applied to explain why some children develop severe mental issues. This hypothesis states that if the parents had a difficult childhood and a bad relationship with the grandparents and because of that fail to develop a healthy bond with their children, the third generation develops severe issues. Breivik mother had had to take care of her disabled mother starting from age eight. The grandmother had contracted polio and became paralysed and wheelchair bound. Wenche also lost her father as he died when she was eight years old. The people surrounding the family and social services failed to provide help to the family so that Wenche was constantly overstrained with having to watch her disabled mother while still being a child herself. On top of her handicap the grandmother developed a psychosis and constantly blamed her daughter for her illness. She made Wenche completely sacrifice her life for her so that she wasn't allowed to develop as a normal child at all and didn't attend school regularly or built a stable group of friends. She fled her abusive home at age 17 and soon after that became a teenage mother. Some time later she met Jens Breivik who later became Anders' father.<ref name=\"tv2\">{{cite news |last1=Olsen |first1=Asbj\u00f8rn |title=Breivik was 'already damaged by the age of two' |url=https://www.tv2.no/a/8241631/ |accessdate=1 December 2019 |agency=TV2 |date=20 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring her pregnancy Breivik mother already developed a disdain for him. She claimed that he was a \"nasty child\" and that he was \"kicking her on purpose\". She had wanted to abort him but at the time that she returned to Norway from the UK she had already passed the three months threshold for an abortion. Psychologists reports stated that she thought that Breivik was a \"fundamentally nasty and evil child and determined to destroy her.\" She stopped breastfeeding her son pretty early on because he was \"sucking the life out of her.\"<ref name=\"tv2\"/>\n\nBreivik's mother moved back to Oslo in no. 18, Fritznersgate, where Jens Breivik had an apartment. The neighbors claimed that there were noises of fights and that the mother left her children completely alone for extended periods of time, while she was working as a nurse. In 1981 Breivik's mother applied for economic help and in 1982 she applied for [[Respite care|respite care]] for her son. She says that she was overwhelmed with the boy and unable to care for him. She described him to be \"clingy and demanding.\" Breivik was then placed with a young couple. This couple later told police that the mother, when bringing two year old Breivik to the house, had asked that he be allowed to touch the man's penis, because he had no one to compare himself to in terms of appearance. 'All he ever saw were girls' parts. This suggests that Breivik had been sexually abused by the age of two already. \n\nIn February 1983, on advice of her neighbors, Breivik's mother sought help from the National Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (SSBU) in Oslo. There the mother then stayed during the day with Breivik and was observed by psychiatrists for about one month. The conclusion of the stay from the psychiatrists was that Breivik should be placed in the foster care system and had to be removed from his mother for him to develop normally. The justification for this were several observations. Breivik was almost completely void of any emotional engagement. He didn't show joy. He didn't cry when he was hurt. He made no attempts to play with other children. He was also extremely clean and became anxious when his toys weren't in order. Psychologists believed that he had become this way because of negative reactions his mother displayed to any emotion he showed. They thought that she had punished him and reacted extremely negative to him displaying emotions which had led him to become devoid of any visible emotions. His mother had also claimed that he is uncleanly and that she constantly had to care for him and run after him. Psychologists believed that Breivik had become this cleanly because of fear of punishment from his mother. He didn't show the normal level of uncleanliness of a four year old. Breivik seemed extremely careful and controlled. He had no repertoire on how to express emotions normally. During long phases of emotional voidness he would rarely erupt and display extreme uncontrolled emotions.<ref name=\"tv2\"/>\n\nReports of the staff said that his mother had told Breivik while she knew that she was being observed by health personnel that she \"wished that he was dead\". At the same time she tied him to her and switched from being very affectionate to being extremely cruel from one minute to the other. This was an unacceptable situation for a four year old to be in, according to the psychiatrists. The report from 1983 stated \"Anders is a victim of his mother's projections of paranoid-aggressive and sexual fears toward men in general\", and \"she projects onto him her own primitive, aggressive and sexual fantasies; all the qualities in men that she regards as dangerous and aggressive.\" Breivik reacted very negative to his mother. He alternated between clinginess, petty aggression and extreme childishness.<ref name=\"tv2\"/>\nThe final conclusion of the observation was that, \"The family is in dire need of help. Anders should be removed from the family and given a better standard of care; the mother is provoked by him and remains in an ambivalent position which prevents him from developing on his own terms. Anders has become an anxious, passive child that averts making contact. He displays a manic defense mechanism of restless activity and a feigned, deflecting smile. Considering the profoundly pathological relationship between Anders and his mother it is crucial to make an early effort to ward off a severely skewed development in the boy.\"\nHowever Child Welfare Services did not follow this recommendation. They did not understand how harmful the treatment of his mother was for Breivik. Instead he was placed in respite care only during the weekends. SSBU hoped that eventually he would be fully placed into foster care.<ref name=\"tv2\"/>\n\nHowever when Breivik's father, Jens Breivik, learned of the situation he filed for custody. Although Breivik's mother had agreed to have him put in respite care, after Jens had filed for custody she demanded that Breivik be put back into full custody with her. Both the mother and father got lawyers involved. Eventually the case was dropped because the Welfare Services thought that they wouldn't be able to provide enough evidence in court to warrant the placement of Breivik in foster care. One of the main reasons for this was the testimony of staff from the Vigelandsparken nursery, which Breivik had been attending since 1981. They described him as a happy child and claimed that nothing was wrong or had been wrong with him all along. During all of this the SSBU maintained their stances and said \"urgent action is crucially needed to prevent a severely skewed development in the boy\". The SSBU wrote Child Welfare Services a letter claiming that an order should be placed to have Breivik be removed be force. In 1984 a hearing in front of Barnevernsnemnda (the municipal child welfare committee) took place on whether Breivik's mother should lose custody of him. During the hearing a young social worker who had never represented a case in court before was up against the experienced lawyer hired by Breivik's mother. She naturally won the case. It was ruled that the family should be supervised. However after only three visits the supervision was discontinued. Breivik was never again put into respite care of foster care.<ref name=\"tv2\"/> \n\nSSBU heavily criticised the decision stating \"The family's situation was deeply troubling. The boy was at risk of developing serious issues, and had the Child Welfare Service deliberately chosen to do nothing, they would have failed him. If however they rejected to act on the SSBU's suggestions, the SSBU cannot be faulted. They did not have authority to make formal decisions. Only the Child Welfare Service could do that.\"<ref name=\"tv2\"/>\n\n==Adulthood==\nBreivik was exempt from [[conscription]] to [[Military service#Norway|military service]] in the Norwegian Army and had no military training.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/norge/1.7723548|newspaper=NRK|title=32-\u00e5ringen skal tilh\u00f8re h\u00f8yreekstremt milj\u00f8|last=Aune|first=Oddvin|place=Oslo|issue=special|quote=\"Etter det NRK f\u00e5r opplyst, har ikke den p\u00e5grepne noen yrkesmilit\u00e6r bakgrunn.

Breivik described these two forms of \"extra punishment\", saying: \"it is quite demeaning to be exposed to this every day, so I countered by not leaving my prison cell. I did not want to exercise in the fresh air, [I did not want to] train, or use my study [prison-] cell.\"<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*On paper he had three prison cells, but because of the government's actions he hardly used the training cell and the study cell.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*Prison officers at Ila Prison were not to speak to him during his [first] stay there, and this was the case for parts of his stay at Skien [prison]; only the chief of the section was supposed to speak to Breivik. He said that he had not said \"no\" to the prison offering him activities such as playing [[floorball]] or [[chess]], but asked to be offered other activities. He said that starting in March 2014 he finally received the one hour of fellowship with prison officers; he said that claims had been made that he was allowed to prepare food, but that he was permitted only to press an egg cooker, and was not permitted to put frozen [[pizza]] in the oven\u2014that he had only done once.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*He still received a [[prison visitor]] twice a month\u2014an officer of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n*Regarding recreation in fresh air, Breivik said: \"Until December 2015 all outdoors recreation was in a concrete box.

Every time the slot was opened they demanded a sign of life. They wanted me to shake a leg every time the slot opened\". He felt humiliated that the prison officers made such a demand and said \"They shined a flashlight into the bed, depending on the prison officer. Called into the cell ''Are you alive, are you alive'', until I woke up. Then they had the sign of life that they needed.

I have been thinking that visits without a glass wall could be something [to consider]. I don't think that with his image, he would be violent to someone he has [some sort of] a [working-] relationship to.\" Storrvik read out loud, recommendations by Rosenqvist, including \"Retired police officers could, for example, come [to socialise with Breivik], drink coffee, play games\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\n[[NRK]] reported that \"The [[Parliamentary Ombudsman]] has previously reported that the regimen for serving a prison sentence at the level of ''particularly high security''\" constitutes a heightened risk of inhumane treatment. Now it appears that Parliamentary Ombudsman will not testify\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> This was despite the fact that one of its leaders was on the list of witnesses summoned to testify.<ref name=\"nytimes1\"/>\n\nAt the start of the third day of the trial, Storrvik introduced a report from the \"prevention section\" at [the office of] the Parliamentary Ombudsman, dated 11 November 2015, regarding a series of visits that year by the ombudsman; the report said that Breivik was being held at a section where sometimes there was only one prisoner.<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> Storrvik read from the report that \"The limitations on visits at the time of the inspection [by the Parliamentary Ombudsman] seemed quite strict\". He said that in that section of the prison, it should expand the planned community between prisoners and employees and consider other measures to minimise the risk of isolation damage. At that section the prison should evaluate alternative possibilities for recreation in fresh air, in addition to the concrete exercise yard. The report recommended that the prison should discontinue the visual surveillance of health-related conversations that occur with a glass wall between prisoner and health personnel.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe second witness was Knut Bjarkeid, [[Superintendent (jail)|Chief Warden]] at Ila Prison. Storrvik confronted Bjarkeid with a document regarding [prison] Section G being turned [in part] into a \"particularly high security department\". He read: \"There are obvious limits to how long he can be in Section G\"; the document was written by Bjarkeid. Storrvik said that \"The words are here, obviously there are limits to how long he shall be isolated. This was in 2012. He is still in total isolation\". After Bjarkeid left the witness stand, Emberland read out loud from a letter that Breivik had written, dated 29 September 2013; in the letter Breivik reported several persons to the police; the [[Asker]] and [[B\u00e6rum]] Police District investigated and later dropped the investigation; Breivik's letter detailed the number of [[strip search]]es, \"grip manoeuvres\", and handcuffings he had undergone.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe third witness was Bj\u00f8rn Draugedalen, a [[general practitioner]] working one day per week at Skien Prison.<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> His first consultation with Breivik was held in a [[recreation room]] in ''avdeling for s\u00e6rlig h\u00f8y sikkerhet'', a high-security unit.  Draugedalen shook hands with Breivik, with five prison officers present; all the later consultations (until the trial) were held with a glass wall separating them.<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> Storrvik asked \"This change, when another prisoner arrived [and started to live in the same prison section], which resulted in Breivik's movement being restricted\u2014did you consider to go up there to view [his living conditions or] how things were\"?; Draugedalen answered \"We have to deal with changes done by the Corrections Services\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> The judge interjected, and she said that the Correction Services likely would listen to health care workers; Draugedalen replied that \"We did not see any extra value then, regarding visiting him in the [prison] section\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> At 12:36 Draugedalen said that he has not been notified that Breivik has discontinued his [college/university] studies.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe fourth witness was Haukeland, an MD for prisoners at Ila Prison. At 13:46 Storrvik read from [Breivik's medical] record dated 5 February 2013 that Breivik intends to recreate less in fresh air because of the strip searches that follow; Storrvik asked Haukeland: \"The fact that he goes outside less, to avoid being strip searched, was that discussed as a problem?; Haukeland answered \"No, that was not discussed [among the health care workers or] in the health section\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> At 13:51 the judge referred to nightly inspections every half hour, and Haukeland answers that he cannot remember; the judge asked \"Were you the ones who recommended that\"?; Haukeland replied \"No (...)\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe fifth witness was Margit Kise, a section leader at Skien Prison, who served from September 2013 to May 2015 in section A and H. The sixth witness was [[Tore Stenshagen]], also a section leader at Skien, who served during the third quarter of 2015. Stenshagen testified that sometimes he sits down [in Breivik's cell] and talks with Breivik, and sometimes they are accompanied by only one prison officer.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nThe seventh witness was J\u00f8rgen Spangen Iversen, an advisor at the Correctional Agency. Iversen was asked why Breivik was transferred to Skien rather than to [[Ringerike Prison]]; Iversen answered that he became a case-worker in 2014, and he was not involved in the transfer.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\n====Closing arguments====\nSumming up the case for Breivik, Storrvik said: \"For some reason, in Norway it has been established that in a female prison, a male prison officer cannot strip search a prisoner, but in a male prison it is ok that females are present. This is offensive\u2014I do not see any alternatives\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> He then talked about the case of strip searches of prisoner Piechowicz<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/CP_Poland_ENG.pdf |title=ECHR |format=PDF |website=Echr.coe.int |date= |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> in [[Poland]].<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> In that case the court was not convinced by the Polish government's arguments that the systematic, humiliating, daily searches were necessary to secure the prison. He continued: \"He was also awoken at night, but he had 147 visits that compensated\", and Piechowicz's isolation lasted for a shorter period; Storrvik said: \"Note that one calls it ''isolation'', even though he had one cellmate\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> Storrvik said that \"the verdict [of] Piechowicz vs. Poland point to a breach of [[European Convention on Human Rights|EMK]] in our case\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nStorrvik said: \"In my opinion there is not a complete concurrence between risk analyses and measures in our case. Risk analyses have at an early stage come with suggestions for measures [and these have not been followed up] (...) For example, removing the glass wall during visits and the possibility of introducing fellow prisoner, has been discussed at such an early stage that there should be a good reason for why Rosenqvist's advice has not been followed\".<ref name=\"sksoker\" /> Storrvik said that \"The main problem for the government in this case is that the discrepancies between well-founded\u2014in the context of security\u2014suggestions from one of those who knows this case the best has not been followed\".<ref name=saksoker2>[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/breivik-saksoker-staten-1.12617825 Breivik suing the government] \"Storrvik: \u2013 Hovedproblemet for Staten i denne saken her er avvik mellom sikkerhetsmessige, godt funderte forslag fra en av dem som kjenner denne saken aller best, ikke er fulgt.\"</ref>\n\nStorrvik compared Breivik's position as a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]] situation: if Breivik says that he has psychiatric problems, then he has picked them out of a book; if he says that he doesn't have psychiatric problems, then he doesn't have psychiatric problems.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nStorrvik said that there had been no inspections by agencies tasked with [[Separation of powers|oversight]], as far as he knew, until the Parliamentary Ombudsman came.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />  Breivik's lawyer referred to anal inspections [\u2014[[Natural orifices|visual or manual body cavity searches]]]; he disagreed with Emberland's view that there was a difference regarding ''anal inspection'' as referred to in ECHR verdicts in other cases, and the squats that Breivik must perform while naked; Storrvik's opinion is that Ila lacks concrete reasons for all the inspections.<ref name=\"sksoker\" />\n\nMestad said that \"The government's primary task is to protect its citizens.

Their image revolves around the South African [[counterculture]] [[Social movement|movement]] known as ''[[zef]]'' and has incorporated work by other artists associated with the movement, such as photographer [[Roger Ballen]].\n\n==Background==\nDie Antwoord's male vocalist, [[Watkin Tudor Jones|Watkin Tudor \"Ninja\" Jones]], was part of the South African hip-hop scene for many years, fronting acts such as The Original Evergreen, [[MaxNormal.TV]] and [[The Constructus Corporation]]. Their debut album ''$O$'' relates to their earlier work, specifically ''Good Morning South Africa''. In the album, multiple tracks are sampled from, or are exact copies of songs on ''Good Morning South Africa'', such as the \"Rap Rave Megamix\" (where the first glimpses of Jones's Ninja character was seen) were later reformed into the \"Zef Side\" video, featuring a few verses from \"Beat Boy\".<ref name=\"Channel24\">{{cite news| date =28 February 2010|last=Barker|first=Jean|title=24 Facts: Die Antwoord|url=http://www.channel24.co.za/Music/FeaturesInterviews/24-Facts-Die-Antwoord-20100204|newspaper=Channel24}}</ref> Ninja told ''Rolling Stone'', \"Everything I did before Die Antwoord was me experimenting, messing around and trying to find ''Die Antwoord'' . . . everything before it was disposable.

Aconcagua used to be an active stratovolcano (from the Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene through the Miocene) and consisted of several volcanic complexes on the edge of a basin with a shallow sea. However, sometime in the Miocene, about 8 to 10 million years ago, the subduction angle started to decrease resulting in a stop of the melting and more horizontal stresses between the oceanic plate and the continent, causing the thrust faults that lifted Aconcagua up off its volcanic root. The rocks found on Aconcagua's flanks are all volcanic and consist of lavas, breccias and pyroclastics. The shallow marine basin had already formed earlier (Triassic), even before Aconcagua arose as a volcano. However, volcanism has been present in this region for as long as this basin was around and volcanic deposits interfinger with marine deposits throughout the sequence. The colorful greenish, blueish and grey deposits that can be seen in the Horcones Valley and south of Puente Del Inca, are carbonates, limestones, turbidites and evaporates that filled this basin. The red colored rocks are intrusions, cinder deposits and conglomerates of volcanic origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/24836826/Geology-of-Aconcagua|title=Geology of Aconcagua - Volcano - Plate Tectonics|website=Scribd|accessdate=5 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Climbing==\n[[File:Monte Aconcagua.jpg|thumb|left|250px|From park entrance]]\n\nIn [[mountaineering]] terms, Aconcagua is technically an easy mountain if approached from the north, via the [[normal route]].

Aconcagua used to be an active stratovolcano (from the Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene through the Miocene) and consisted of several volcanic complexes on the edge of a basin with a shallow sea. However, sometime in the Miocene, about 8 to 10 million years ago, the subduction angle started to decrease resulting in a stop of the melting and more horizontal stresses between the oceanic plate and the continent, causing the thrust faults that lifted Aconcagua up off its volcanic root. The rocks found on Aconcagua's flanks are all volcanic and consist of lavas, breccias and pyroclastics. The shallow marine basin had already formed earlier (Triassic), even before Aconcagua arose as a volcano. However, volcanism has been present in this region for as long as this basin was around and volcanic deposits interfinger with marine deposits throughout the sequence. The colorful greenish, blueish and grey deposits that can be seen in the Horcones Valley and south of Puente Del Inca, are carbonates, limestones, turbidites and evaporates that filled this basin. The red colored rocks are intrusions, cinder deposits and conglomerates of volcanic origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/24836826/Geology-of-Aconcagua|title=Geology of Aconcagua - Volcano - Plate Tectonics|website=Scribd|accessdate=5 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Climbing==\n[[File:Monte Aconcagua.jpg|thumb|left|250px|From park entrance]]\n\nIn [[mountaineering]] terms, Aconcagua is technically an easy mountain if approached from the north, via the [[normal route]].

As on other mountains (e.g. [[Ampato]]), places of worship were built here and sacrifices, including [[Human sacrifice|human sacrifices]], were made. The sites discovered in 1985 at an altitude of 5167 m are among the highest in the world and are the most difficult of all Inca sites to reach. Here, the remains of a child bedded on grass, cloth and feathers were found inside stone walls ([[Aconcagua mummy]]). The clothing indicates that the child was a member of the highest social class. Other offerings found included figures and [[coca leaves]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aconcagua mummy]]\n* [[Ojos del Salado]]\n* [[Las Heras, Mendoza]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Biggar|first=John|title=The Andes: A Guide for Climbers|edition=3|publisher=Andes Publishing|location=Scotland|year=2005|url=http://www.andes.org.uk/andes-guidebooks.asp|isbn=978-0-9536087-2-0}}\n* {{cite book|first=Ed|last=Darack|title=Wild Winds: Adventures in the Highest Andes|publisher=Cordee / DPP|year=2001|isbn=978-1884980817|language=English}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n{{Commons and category|Aconcagua}}\n* [http://www.andeshandbook.org/en/montanismo/cerro/25/Aconcagua  Aconcagua in Andeshandbook]\n* {{cite summitpost|id=150197|title=Aconcagua|accessdate=26 October 2010}}\n* [http://cima-aconcagua.com Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n en Medicina de Altura (CIMA) de Aconcagua], a consortium of researchers and mountaineers working to improve the understanding of high altitude illness.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090223113058/http://www.purebound.com/aconcagua/ Blog with information from a successful Aconcagua ascent]\n* [http://www.aconcaguanow.com/ Live webcam from Aconcagua base camp] (December to March)\n\n{{Seven Summits}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Aconcagua| ]]\n[[Category:Seven Summits]]\n[[Category:Mountains of Mendoza Province]]\n[[Category:Highest points of countries]]\n[[Category:Six-thousanders of the Andes]]\n[[Category:Principal Cordillera]]\n", "name_user": "MAXIMOKAUSCH", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed coordinates", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aconcagua"}

Enclosing the city are the mouths of the river [[River Plym|Plym]] and river [[River Tamar|Tamar]], which are naturally incorporated into [[Plymouth Sound]] to form a boundary with [[Cornwall]].\n\nPlymouth's early history extends to the [[Bronze Age]] when a first settlement emerged at [[Mount Batten]]. This settlement continued as a trading post for the [[Roman Empire]], until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton founded in the ninth century, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] departed Plymouth for the [[New World]] and established [[Plymouth Colony]], the second English settlement in what is now the [[United States|United States of America]]. During the [[English Civil War]], the town was held by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and was besieged between 1642 and 1646.\n\nThroughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals ([[tin]], [[copper]], [[lime (material)|lime]], [[china clay]] and [[arsenic]]). The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the [[county borough]] of Plymouth, the county borough of [[County Borough of Devonport|Devonport]], and the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[East Stonehouse]] were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II, an act known as the [[Plymouth Blitz]]. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of [[Plympton]] and [[Plymstock]] along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.\n\nThe city is home to {{English district population|GSS=E06000026}} ({{United Kingdom statistics year}}) people, making it the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|30th-most populous built-up area]] in the United Kingdom and the second-largest city in the South West, after [[Bristol]]. It is governed locally by [[Plymouth City Council]] and is represented nationally by three [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MPs]]. Plymouth's economy remains strongly influenced by shipbuilding and seafaring including ferry links to Brittany ([[Roscoff]] and [[St Malo]]) and Spain ([[Santander, Spain|Santander]]), but has tended toward a service-based economy since the 1990s. It has the largest operational naval base in Western Europe, [[HMNB Devonport]], and is home to the [[University of Plymouth]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Plymouth}}\n{{See also|Timeline of Plymouth}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[Upper Palaeolithic]] deposits, including bones of [[Homo sapiens]], have been found in local caves,<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Andrew T.

Enclosing the city are the mouths of the river [[River Plym|Plym]] and river [[River Tamar|Tamar]], which are naturally incorporated into [[Plymouth Sound]] to form a boundary with [[Cornwall]].\n\nPlymouth's early history extends to the [[Bronze Age]] when a first settlement emerged at [[Mount Batten]]. This settlement continued as a trading post for the [[Roman Empire]], until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton founded in the ninth century, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] departed Plymouth for the [[New World]] and established [[Plymouth Colony]], the second English settlement in what is now the [[United States|United States of America]]. During the [[English Civil War]], the town was held by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and was besieged between 1642 and 1646.\n\nThroughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals ([[tin]], [[copper]], [[lime (material)|lime]], [[china clay]] and [[arsenic]]). The neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the [[county borough]] of Plymouth, the county borough of [[County Borough of Devonport|Devonport]], and the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[East Stonehouse]] were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its being targeted by the German military and partially destroyed by bombing during World War II, an act known as the [[Plymouth Blitz]]. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of [[Plympton]] and [[Plymstock]] along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.\n\nThe city is home to {{English district population|GSS=E06000026}} ({{United Kingdom statistics year}}) people, making it the [[List of urban areas in the United Kingdom|30th-most populous built-up area]] in the United Kingdom and the second-largest city in the South West, after [[Bristol]]. It is governed locally by [[Plymouth City Council]] and is represented nationally by three [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MPs]]. Plymouth's economy remains strongly influenced by shipbuilding and seafaring including ferry links to Brittany ([[Roscoff]] and [[St Malo]]) and Spain ([[Santander, Spain|Santander]]), but has tended toward a service-based economy since the 1990s. It has the largest operational naval base in Western Europe, [[HMNB Devonport]], and is home to the [[University of Plymouth]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Plymouth}}\n{{See also|Timeline of Plymouth}}\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[Upper Palaeolithic]] deposits, including bones of [[Homo sapiens]], have been found in local caves,<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Andrew T.

{"title_page": "Violet Club", "text_new": "'''Violet Club''' was a [[nuclear weapon]] deployed by the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[Cold War]]. It was Britain's first operational \"high [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]]\" weapon, and was intended to provide an emergency capability until a [[thermonuclear weapon]] could be developed from the 1956\u20131958 [[Operation Grapple]] tests.\n\n==Conception, design and development==\nIn 1953, shortly after the Americans tested a thermonuclear weapon in 1952, followed by the Soviets with [[Joe 4]], and before the UK government took a decision in July 1954 to develop a thermonuclear weapon, the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]] was asked about the possibilities for a very large pure fission bomb with a yield of one megaton. This study<ref>Public Record Office, London. AIR 2/13759 E8A. (PRO)</ref> referred to the Zodiak Mk.3 bomb, but progressed no further than a rudimentary study.

The internal and external diameters can be computed from the 450 kg weight of the steel balls. First published in Synergy Magazine, published Southampton, UK, No3, 2003]]\nViolet Club (and to a lesser degree Yellow Sun Mk.1) was not considered a satisfactory design and suffered from numerous design defects.  An [[implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion design]], the fissile core of the weapon was a hollow sphere of highly enriched uranium ([[enriched uranium|HEU]]) which was surrounded by a [[high-explosive]] supercharge and 72-lens implosion system.<ref>PRO. AVIA 65/1218 E183 (a)</ref>  The HEU core was greater than one uncompressed critical mass and to maintain it in a sub-critical condition AWRE fashioned it into a hollow thin-walled sphere.  The HEU sphere was collapsed inwards by the supercharge and 72 [[explosive lens]]es.  However, a fire in the bomb store or a traffic collision on the airfield could easily lead to a partial crushing or collapse of the unremovable uranium shell, and in turn a spontaneous nuclear chain reaction.  AWRE responded by inserting (through a hole in the shell) a rubber bag, rather akin to an outsize [[female condom]], and filled this with 20,000 steel [[ball bearings]] of {{convert|0.375|in|mm}}, weighing around {{convert|70|kg|lb|-1}}.<ref>PRO. AVIA 65/777 E38 Section 5.</ref>  Subsequently, the number of these steel balls was increased to 133,000,<ref>David J.Hawkins, ''Keeping the Peace, The Aldermaston Story,'' p52. Published Pen and Sword  in association with AWE, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-85052-775-9}}</ref> with a reduction in size to approx {{convert|5|mm|in}} diameter.  The balls were retained in the device by sealing the hole with a plastic [[bung]].\n\nThe steel balls were intended to prevent a nuclear detonation even if the explosives fired accidentally, or in any conceivable accident. The ball bearings had to be removed through the hole in the bomb casing during flight preparation, and after the bomb was winched into the aircraft. The ball bearings then had to be re-inserted into the lowered and upturned bomb before transport back to the bomb store. Quite obviously, without the ball bearings installed, these weapons were armed and live, and too dangerous to allow to be flown on exercises. Bomber Command exercises demonstrated that flight preparation followed by a scramble take-off could not be reduced below thirty minutes,<ref>PRO. AIR 2/13705 E36A (c).</ref> and on exercises in bad weather and at night a ninety-minute scramble was the norm.<ref>PRO. AIR 2/13705 E62A page 1.</ref> At least one accident, dated 1960, was reported in the press when the plastic bung was removed and 133,000 steel ball bearings exited onto the aircraft hangar floor, leaving the bomb armed and vulnerable.<ref>Sunday Telegraph, London, 28 June 1998, p13.</ref> The Royal Air Force were so nervous of the outcome of a fire in storage that permission was sought to store the bombs inverted, so that a loss of the plastic bung could not end with the steel balls on the floor, leaving the HEU unprotected against a subsequent explosion.<ref>PRO.

AIR 2/13718 E249 page 2.</ref>\n\nAWRE's trickery with the steel balls had other unintended outcomes. Even an event as inconsequential as early morning frost was an issue. Violet Club could be loaded into a bomber for up to thirty days on standby while parked overnight on a remote base where the bomb could get very cold. If the steel balls froze together inside the bomb cavity and could not be removed, the bomb was useless. AWRE's solution was to fit the bomb with an electric blanket. Because the bombs were armed before flight, the take-off was hazardous; the bombs could not be jettisoned, and landing with an armed bomb on return to base was too hazardous to contemplate. As a consequence, Violet Club could not be used on an airborne alert,<ref>PRO. AIR 2/13705 E36A.</ref> or even flown to a remote dispersal base.\n\nOther design flaws centred on a requirement for a strip-down and inspection at six-monthly intervals, this took three weeks per weapon using AWRE civilian staff. The unstable nature of the bomb required that the work be done in-situ at RAF facilities, causing considerable disruption to operational duties. There were three main reasons for the strip-down and these were deterioration of the rubber bag, corrosion of the steel balls, and deterioration of the HE, which was prone to cracking. Replacement of a weapon's HE would cost the RAF in excess of \u00a390,000 adjusted to 2006 prices.<ref>PRO. AVIA 65/1155 E194 para 11.</ref>\n\nGreen Grass/Violet Club was the first UK-deployed weapon to dispense with the crude [[polonium]] and [[beryllium]] impact or crush type initiators used in Fat Man and other early US weapons together with the British Blue Danube and Red Beard. Instead it used an [[Neutron generator|electronic neutron initiator]] (ENI) known as [[Blue Stone (neutron initiator)|Blue Stone]]. This had the great advantage of being adjustable, allowing the neutron burst to be triggered at precisely the right moment. The burst heights of Green Grass were optimized for either maximum overpressure without allowing fireball contact with the ground, or to maximise the ground area subjected to a 6 psi overpressure; respectively {{convert|3500|ft|m}} and {{convert|6200|ft|m}} above ground level<ref>PRO. AIR 2/13705 E58A.</ref> A barometric fuze was used, backed-up by an adjustable clockwork timer fuze<ref>PRO. AIR 2/13718 E7A (4)</ref> with impact fuses as a final fail-safe. Most of these mechanisms originated from Blue Danube although the radar altimeter fuze was omitted.<ref>PRO. AIR 2/13718 E21B (3)</ref> The electrical power for these fuzing mechanisms and the firing mechanisms of the 72-lens, {{convert|45|in|cm|adj=on}} implosion device came from lead-acid accumulators located in the tail of the Blue Danube casing. These were commercially sourced six-volt motorcycle batteries.\n\n==Controversy==\nGreen Grass struggled to meet the Chiefs of Staff requirement for an Interim Megaton [yield] Weapon. It was never tested, and initially, AWRE estimated its yield at 500 kt based on the Orange Herald test of 720kt, and non-nuclear tests of the HE implosion sphere fitted with non-fissile cores. A Mr Challens of AWRE who later became the Director of AWRE then claimed to the Air Staff that\n{{cquote|A weapon of one half megaton was considered to be in the megaton range.<ref>At a conference recorded in PRO. AVIA 65/1218</ref><ref>[[Talk:Ivy King]]</ref>}}\n\nA play-on-words that later returned to haunt AWRE when later estimates revised the yield to 400kt. Challens also stated on behalf of AWRE that\n{{cquote|AWRE were almost completely sure that a nuclear explosion would not occur if the balls are in, - but in the absence of trial proof, he could not guarantee it.}}\n\nThe Royal Air Force was not amused, with Bomber Command Staff officers minuting their seniors with remarks like this one.<ref>PRO. AIR 2/13705 E59A</ref>\n{{cquote|This [minute] means that Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1 are not \"in the megaton range\" at all, notwithstanding the extraordinary measures taken, and costs involved for what we had thought to be a megaton capability.

I cannot imagine any commercial organisation continuing to buy a device that so patently fails to meet the requirement, or to be misled without protest as the Air Ministry has so consistently been [misled] by AWRE.}}\n\nSumming up, senior levels of the RAF believed they had been sold a 'lemon', and this further extract from the archives does much to illustrate the uncertain safety of the weapon in the hands of the inexperienced RAF.\n{{cquote|Aircraft engines must not be run with Violet Club loaded on the aircraft with the safety device [of steel balls] in place.

The cost of HEU to the Royal Air Force{{Clarify|RAF wouldn't buy weapons per se - is the Ministry of Defence meant?|date=March 2009}} was (at 1958-9 prices) \u00a319,200 per kg, with plutonium priced at \u00a3143,000 per kg.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Although a HEU weapon needed more fissile material for a given yield than a plutonium weapon,<ref>Charles S.Grace, ''Nuclear Weapons: Principles, Effects and Survivability.'' Published: Royal College of Military Science, Shrivenham, Wilts, and Brasseys, 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-08-040992-4}}</ref> a saving per weapon was of the order of \u00a322.7M at 2006 prices. Thirty-seven Green Grass warheads were built (twelve as Violet Club) saving the Treasury \u00a3840M. The influence of the Treasury on weapons procurement should not be underestimated: it reaches even into weapons design. Clearly, there were economic benefits in building large and dirty U-235 fission bombs, rather than cleaner, but more expensive plutonium weapons, especially given the shortage of plutonium. By 1958 Britain's accumulated production of plutonium was only 472.2&nbsp;kg<ref>PRO AB 16/3878 various enclosures.</ref> and a proportion of that was bartered to the United States in exchange for HEU and other items. Up to 1958, British output of HEU was only 860&nbsp;kg,<ref>PRO. AB 16/3878 various enclosures.</ref> while the United States supplied the UK with approximately seven tons of HEU from their less costly production process. So HEU used for Green Grass was purchased cheaply from the U.S. while selling to the U.S. the unwanted and high-priced weapons-grade plutonium.\n\nKnobkerry, alias Green Grass, alias Interim Megaton Weapon, alias Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1, had one other distinction. It was the last entirely British nuclear weapon deployed with the UK Armed Services. The British [[Operation Grapple]] thermonuclear weapon tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 were the end of evolution. There were no more wholly home-grown designs. Britain never deployed a true thermonuclear weapon of wholly home-grown design. All the weapons tested at Operation Grapple were abandoned, because AWRE no longer needed them, although some of their features were undoubtedly incorporated into later weapons. These Granite-type devices were all experimental devices, needing to be developed further into reliable Service-engineered warheads at considerable cost in time and money. The U.S. designs offered after 1958 were fully tested and engineered, and cheap to produce.<ref>PRO. AVIA 65/1771 E24 page 1 para 3, and PRO. AVIA 65/1792.</ref> They were manufactured in Britain from British materials and U.S. blueprints. They were British property and there were no American political constraints on their use, they were a favourable deal for the Treasury, and Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1 bridged the gap until the American designs could be manufactured.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Norris, Burrows and Fieldhouse, ''Nuclear Weapons Databook Vol.5, British, French and Chinese Nuclear Weapons.''

AIR 2/13718 E21B (3)</ref> The electrical power for these fuzing mechanisms and the firing mechanisms of the 72-lens, {{convert|45|in|cm|adj=on}} implosion device came from lead-acid accumulators located in the tail of the Blue Danube casing. These were commercially sourced six-volt motorcycle batteries.\n\n==Controversy==\nGreen Grass struggled to meet the Chiefs of Staff requirement for an Interim Megaton [yield] Weapon. It was never tested, and initially, AWRE estimated its yield at 500 kt based on the Orange Herald test of 720kt, and non-nuclear tests of the HE implosion sphere fitted with non-fissile cores. A Mr Challens of AWRE who later became the Director of AWRE then claimed to the Air Staff that\n{{cquote|A weapon of one half megaton was considered to be in the megaton range.<ref>At a conference recorded in PRO. AVIA 65/1218</ref><ref>[[Talk:Ivy King]]</ref>}}\n\nA play-on-words that later returned to haunt AWRE when later estimates revised the yield to 400kt. Challens also stated on behalf of AWRE that\n{{cquote|AWRE were almost completely sure that a nuclear explosion would not occur if the balls are in, - but in the absence of trial proof, he could not guarantee it.}}\n\nThe Royal Air Force was not amused, with Bomber Command Staff officers minuting their seniors with remarks like this one.<ref>PRO. AIR 2/13705 E59A</ref>\n{{cquote|This [minute] means that Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1 are not \"in the megaton range\" at all, notwithstanding the extraordinary measures taken, and costs involved for what we had thought to be a megaton capability. This ... lead me to the belief that production of Green Grass be curtailed. I cannot imagine any commercial organisation continuing to buy a device that so patently fails to meet the requirement, or to be misled without protest as the Air Ministry has so consistently been [misled] by AWRE.}}\n\nSumming up, senior levels of the RAF believed they had been sold a 'lemon', and this further extract from the archives does much to illustrate the uncertain safety of the weapon in the hands of the inexperienced RAF.\n{{cquote|Aircraft engines must not be run with Violet Club loaded on the aircraft with the safety device [of steel balls] in place.

They were only used by the [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| last = Donald\n| first = David\n| title = Handley Page Victor\n| journal = International Air Power Review\n| volume = 25\n| page = 131\n| year = 2008\n| postscript = {{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>\n\n==Conclusion==\nThese very large and dirty fission bombs were the largest pure-fission bombs deployed by any state, and unlike their predecessors, Blue Danube and Red Beard, they used HEU as a fissile material rather than plutonium, the reason being primarily economic. The cost of HEU to the Royal Air Force{{Clarify|RAF wouldn't buy weapons per se - is the Ministry of Defence meant?|date=March 2009}} was (at 1958-9 prices) \u00a319,200 per kg, with plutonium priced at \u00a3143,000 per kg.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Although a HEU weapon needed more fissile material for a given yield than a plutonium weapon,<ref>Charles S.Grace, ''Nuclear Weapons: Principles, Effects and Survivability.'' Published: Royal College of Military Science, Shrivenham, Wilts, and Brasseys, 1994. {{ISBN|978-0-08-040992-4}}</ref> a saving per weapon was of the order of \u00a322.7M at 2006 prices. Thirty-seven Green Grass warheads were built (twelve as Violet Club) saving the Treasury \u00a3840M. The influence of the Treasury on weapons procurement should not be underestimated: it reaches even into weapons design. Clearly, there were economic benefits in building large and dirty U-235 fission bombs, rather than cleaner, but more expensive plutonium weapons, especially given the shortage of plutonium. By 1958 Britain's accumulated production of plutonium was only 472.2&nbsp;kg<ref>PRO AB 16/3878 various enclosures.</ref> and a proportion of that was bartered to the United States in exchange for HEU and other items. Up to 1958, British output of HEU was only 860&nbsp;kg,<ref>PRO. AB 16/3878 various enclosures.</ref> while the United States supplied the UK with approximately seven tons of HEU from their less costly production process. So HEU used for Green Grass was purchased cheaply from the U.S. while selling to the U.S. the unwanted and high-priced weapons-grade plutonium.\n\nKnobkerry, alias Green Grass, alias Interim Megaton Weapon, alias Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1, had one other distinction. It was the last entirely British nuclear weapon deployed with the UK Armed Services. The British [[Operation Grapple]] thermonuclear weapon tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 were the end of evolution. There were no more wholly home-grown designs. Britain never deployed a true thermonuclear weapon of wholly home-grown design. All the weapons tested at Operation Grapple were abandoned, because AWRE no longer needed them, although some of their features were undoubtedly incorporated into later weapons. These Granite-type devices were all experimental devices, needing to be developed further into reliable Service-engineered warheads at considerable cost in time and money. The U.S. designs offered after 1958 were fully tested and engineered, and cheap to produce.<ref>PRO. AVIA 65/1771 E24 page 1 para 3, and PRO. AVIA 65/1792.</ref> They were manufactured in Britain from British materials and U.S. blueprints. They were British property and there were no American political constraints on their use, they were a favourable deal for the Treasury, and Violet Club and Yellow Sun Mk.1 bridged the gap until the American designs could be manufactured.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Norris, Burrows and Fieldhouse, ''Nuclear Weapons Databook Vol.5, British, French and Chinese Nuclear Weapons.''

It was known as '''Ping Chau''' ({{zh|c=\u5e73\u6d32}}). ''Tung'' ({{zh|c=\u6771}}, meaning ''east'') is prepended to the name so as to avoid possible confusion with ''[[Peng Chau]]'', another island in Hong Kong with an identically pronounced name in the [[Cantonese language]]. Administratively, the island is part of the [[Tai Po District]] in the [[New Territories]].\n\n==Geography==\nGeographically, Ping Chau is an offshore island located in the northeast corner of Hong Kong in [[Mirs Bay]],<ref name=\"Marine Park\"/> close to the border with [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in [[mainland China]]. The island has an area of 1.16&nbsp;km\u00b2<ref>Survey and Mapping Office, Lands Department: [http://www.landsd.gov.hk/mapping/en/publications/hk_geographic_data_sheet.pdf Hong Kong geographic data sheet]</ref> and consists of [[shale]] rock. The island is the most easterly point of the Hong Kong territory and is much closer to mainland China (4&nbsp;km) than to the main landmass of Hong Kong. It is close to [[Nan'ao Subdistrict|Nan'ao]] of [[Dapeng Peninsula|Dapeng]].\n\nThe island has the shape of a [[kidney bean]] with its concave side facing northeast. Its name \"Ping Chau\" means \"flat island\" in Chinese.<ref name=\"Plover Cove (Ext.)\"/> The highest points on the island are {{convert|48|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the south and {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the north. The eastern inner shore of the crescent hugs Ping Chau Hoi (\u5e73\u6d32\u6d77) with [[Beaches of Hong Kong|a few beaches]], including Cheung Sha Wan (\u9577\u6c99\u7063) in the northeast. In contrast, the western coast of the island is fairly rocky as a result of the greater wave action taking its toll on the inclined [[siltstone]] there.\n\nThe island's largest village, Sha Tau (\u6c99\u982d), is something of a ghost town, with many cottages boarded up. A large part of the island is [[Conservation_in_Hong_Kong#Country_parks|country parkland]],<ref name=\"showing\"/> with footpaths overgrown with orchids, wild mint<!--needs link to one of \u2018Mentha arvensis\u2019 or \u2018Mentha longifolia\u2019 - but which is it?--> and [[morning glory]].<ref name=\"island_hopping\"/>\n\n==History==\nPing Chau has a checkered history.

It was known as '''Ping Chau''' ({{zh|c=\u5e73\u6d32}}). ''Tung'' ({{zh|c=\u6771}}, meaning ''east'') is prepended to the name so as to avoid possible confusion with ''[[Peng Chau]]'', another island in Hong Kong with an identically pronounced name in the [[Cantonese language]]. Administratively, the island is part of the [[Tai Po District]] in the [[New Territories]].\n\n==Geography==\nGeographically, Ping Chau is an offshore island located in the northeast corner of Hong Kong in [[Mirs Bay]],<ref name=\"Marine Park\"/> close to the border with [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in [[mainland China]]. The island has an area of 1.16&nbsp;km\u00b2<ref>Survey and Mapping Office, Lands Department: [http://www.landsd.gov.hk/mapping/en/publications/hk_geographic_data_sheet.pdf Hong Kong geographic data sheet]</ref> and consists of [[shale]] rock. The island is the most easterly point of the Hong Kong territory and is much closer to mainland China (4&nbsp;km) than to the main landmass of Hong Kong. It is close to [[Nan'ao Subdistrict|Nan'ao]] of [[Dapeng Peninsula|Dapeng]].\n\nThe island has the shape of a [[kidney bean]] with its concave side facing northeast. Its name \"Ping Chau\" means \"flat island\" in Chinese.<ref name=\"Plover Cove (Ext.)\"/> The highest points on the island are {{convert|48|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the south and {{convert|37|m|ft|abbr=off}} in the north. The eastern inner shore of the crescent hugs Ping Chau Hoi (\u5e73\u6d32\u6d77) with [[Beaches of Hong Kong|a few beaches]], including Cheung Sha Wan (\u9577\u6c99\u7063) in the northeast. In contrast, the western coast of the island is fairly rocky as a result of the greater wave action taking its toll on the inclined [[siltstone]] there.\n\nThe island's largest village, Sha Tau (\u6c99\u982d), is something of a ghost town, with many cottages boarded up. A large part of the island is country parkland,<ref name=\"showing\"/> with footpaths overgrown with orchids, wild mint<!--needs link to one of \u2018Mentha arvensis\u2019 or \u2018Mentha longifolia\u2019 - but which is it?--> and [[morning glory]].<ref name=\"island_hopping\"/>\n\n==History==\nPing Chau has a checkered history.
