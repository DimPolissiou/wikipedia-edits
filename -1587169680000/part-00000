A famous [[model (person)|model]], Misa seeks out Kira ([[Light Yagami]]) as she supports his cause to [[utopia|\"cleanse the world of evil\"]]. Using her own Death Note, a notebook that allows its owner to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face that she received from the [[Shinigami (Death Note)|Shinigami]] [[Rem (Death Note)|Rem]], Misa does everything she can to aid Light. This includes shortening her own lifespan by half, twice, in order to receive the eyes of a Shinigami, giving her the ability to learn a person's name just by looking at their face.

He felt that having the story solely consist of males would be \"boring\" and wanted \"a cute female\". Ohba, intending to introduce her with the Shinigami Eyes, described Misa as having to be \"spontaneous and not too bright\" and that he determined her personality from the start. Since Light Yagami would never want to trade for the Shinigami Eyes, Ohba needed another character to make the eye trade and so decided to use Misa.<ref name=\"EnglishHTR62\">\"How to Think.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''.

Misa's personality is altered slightly from the manga. In addition, her appearance is slightly modified: while Misa has blonde hair in the manga and anime, she has brown hair in the films. She is first seen filming a [[dorama]] called \"Misa-Misa's Happy Sweets\", where she states that she is baking treats to make her enemies fat. After filming of that section ends, she expresses support for Kira to a journalist. Her supervisor asks that the statement be cut due to controversies. Misa's attacker, Ryotaro Sakajo, the [[assistant director]] for \"Happy Sweets\", dies from a heart attack when Gelus writes his name inside of his Death Note. Gelus' Death Note then falls in front of Misa, who immediately picks it up. After reading the notebook, she finds Rem.\n\nIn the second film, [[List of Death Note characters#Kanzo Mogi|Mogi]] replaces Ukita as Misa's victim during the Sakura TV incident. Additionally, Misa first learns of Light's identity as Kira when Soichiro rescues Sayu who was at the TV station attending a fair. Misa is present at the final confrontation between Light and the police force, though she is handcuffed and restrained by another officer. When Light dies after Ryuk writes his name down in the Death Note, Misa breaks down emotionally. Her memory of the Death Note is erased, but she retains her obsession with Light, wishing him a happy birthday through a mini-[[shrine]] dedicated to him. Erika Toda said that, prior to filming, she felt \"a lot of pressure\" due to the character's popularity with audiences. She said the pressure vanished when filming began. In an article in ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', a [[Malaysia]]n newspaper, writer Kitty Sensei theorized that Toda did not have \"the time to think much about how fans would react\", citing film shoots that Kitty Sensei described as \"physically and mentally exhausting\" such as the [[straitjacket]] scene. Toda said that undoing the straitjacket took a lot of time, and at times she waited in the jacket between takes. Toda also said that on one occasion, she wore a blindfold for an hour during filming.<ref name=\"LastbutnotleastMalaysiaStar\">{{cite web|author=Kitty Sensei |url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2007/1/14/movies/16541015&sec=movies |title=Here're a few hints of the second and concluding part of Death Note the movie, The Last Name |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=January 14, 2007 |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802220209/http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F1%2F14%2Fmovies%2F16541015&sec=movies |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nToda reprises the role  once again in ''[[Death Note: Light Up the New World]]''.<ref name=\"films\"/> Ten years have passed since Light died. Misa continues her work as an actress while her activities are secretly supervised by police officers. She regains her memories after cyber-terrorist Yuki Shien gives her a Death Note. Initially refusing to cooperate with him, due to Light's death, she makes another eye trade from Ryuk and helps Yuki escape with the six Death Notes he collected by killing two of the Task Force investigators. Although she fails to kill Ryuzaki (whose name was written on a Death Note prior similar to L), she commits suicide by writing her own name, scribbled \"Misa Amane dies in Light Yagami's hands\".\n\n===In other media===\nIn [[Death Note (2015 TV series)|the live-action television drama]], Misa is portrayed by [[Hinako Sano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-31/live-action-death-note-show-casts-misa-light-father/.88767|title=Live-Action Death Note Show Casts Misa, Light's Father|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2015-05-31|accessdate=2016-04-06}}</ref> Unlike the manga and anime, she has a red death note. Her hair is also brown instead of blonde, similarly to the live-action films. When she goes to dig up her buried Death Note, Mikami's assistant steals it, and Mikami uses it to help Kira. Her Death Note is burned by a fire set by Mikami; consequently, her memory of the Death Note is erased.\n\nIn [[Death Note: The Musical|the musical adaptation]], Misa is portrayed by Fuka Yuzuki.\n\n==Reception==\nBriana Lawrence of [[Anime News Network]] felt that even though Misa was the typical annoying girl clinging to the main character, \"In a series full of geniuses it was amazing to see an average person get a hold of the Death Note. Her presence made things even more complicated for Light and she kept him on his toes as much as L did (maybe even more than L did).\" Lawrence was disappointed that the epilogue of the series did not show Misa's ultimate fate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12|title=Death Note GN 12 - Review|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2007-08-05|accessdate=2016-04-06}}</ref>\n\nIn a ''[[Salon.com]]'' article, Douglas Wolk describes Misa as being drawn in a \"Japanese comics' tradition of cute, tiny, airhead girls with big eyes\" and being a \"lot cannier than she pretends to be\".

Pepirium points out the tone in which the character is written, feeling that her motivation and obsession with Kira are \"in league with ''Death Note''{{'}}s dark sensibilities\". He says that when Misa spouts her deep and fully realized affection for Kira in \"her wacky, excited, [[poodle]]-like way\", the information \"loses all impact\". Pepirium uses \"girly sophomoric pink fluff\" and \"Jar Jar\" (a reference to [[Jar Jar Binks]]) as figurative descriptors for Misa.<ref>Pepirium, Tom S. \"[http://tv.ign.com/articles/860/860774p1.html Death Note: \"Performance\" Review]\".

Ohba stated that this was simply because he did not have a situation to fit her in.<ref name=\"EnglishHTRTwoHundred\">\"The 13 Truths About Chapter 108.\" ''Death Note 13: How to Read''.

The official anime guidebook lists her date of death as unknown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ohba|first=Tsugumi|title=Death Note A Animation Official Analysis Guide|year=2007|publisher=Shueisha|isbn=9784088741970|page=9}}</ref>\n\n===In film===\n[[Image:Dn Misa film.jpg|thumb|[[Erika Toda]] as Misa in the [[Death Note (2006 film)|''Death Note'' film series]]]]\nMisa is portrayed in the films by [[Erika Toda]].<ref name=\"films\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-03-08/2016-death-note-film-brings-back-erika-toda-as-misa/.99555|title=2016 Death Note Film Brings Back Erika Toda as Misa|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2016-03-08|accessdate=2016-04-06}}</ref> In the film continuity, Misa has a brother, who is murdered along with her parents.  Misa's personality is altered slightly from the manga. In addition, her appearance is slightly modified: while Misa has blonde hair in the manga and anime, she has brown hair in the films. She is first seen filming a [[dorama]] called \"Misa-Misa's Happy Sweets\", where she states that she is baking treats to make her enemies fat. After filming of that section ends, she expresses support for Kira to a journalist. Her supervisor asks that the statement be cut due to controversies. Misa's attacker, Ryotaro Sakajo, the [[assistant director]] for \"Happy Sweets\", dies from a heart attack when Gelus writes his name inside of his Death Note. Gelus' Death Note then falls in front of Misa, who immediately picks it up. After reading the notebook, she finds Rem.\n\nIn the second film, [[List of Death Note characters#Kanzo Mogi|Mogi]] replaces Ukita as Misa's victim during the Sakura TV incident. Additionally, Misa first learns of Light's identity as Kira when Soichiro rescues Sayu who was at the TV station attending a fair. Misa is present at the final confrontation between Light and the police force, though she is handcuffed and restrained by another officer. When Light dies after Ryuk writes his name down in the Death Note, Misa breaks down emotionally. Her memory of the Death Note is erased, but she retains her obsession with Light, wishing him a happy birthday through a mini-[[shrine]] dedicated to him. Erika Toda said that, prior to filming, she felt \"a lot of pressure\" due to the character's popularity with audiences. She said the pressure vanished when filming began. In an article in ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', a [[Malaysia]]n newspaper, writer Kitty Sensei theorized that Toda did not have \"the time to think much about how fans would react\", citing film shoots that Kitty Sensei described as \"physically and mentally exhausting\" such as the [[straitjacket]] scene. Toda said that undoing the straitjacket took a lot of time, and at times she waited in the jacket between takes. Toda also said that on one occasion, she wore a blindfold for an hour during filming.<ref name=\"LastbutnotleastMalaysiaStar\">{{cite web|author=Kitty Sensei |url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2007/1/14/movies/16541015&sec=movies |title=Here're a few hints of the second and concluding part of Death Note the movie, The Last Name |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=January 14, 2007 |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802220209/http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F1%2F14%2Fmovies%2F16541015&sec=movies |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nToda reprises the role  once again in ''[[Death Note: Light Up the New World]]''.<ref name=\"films\"/> Ten years have passed since Light died. Misa continues her work as an actress while her activities are secretly supervised by police officers. She regains her memories after cyber-terrorist Yuki Shien gives her a Death Note. Initially refusing to cooperate with him, due to Light's death, she makes another eye trade from Ryuk and helps Yuki escape with the six Death Notes he collected by killing two of the Task Force investigators. Although she fails to kill Ryuzaki (whose name was written on a Death Note prior similar to L), she commits suicide by writing her own name, scribbled \"Misa Amane dies in Light Yagami's hands\".\n\n===In other media===\nIn [[Death Note (2015 TV series)|the live-action television drama]], Misa is portrayed by [[Hinako Sano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-31/live-action-death-note-show-casts-misa-light-father/.88767|title=Live-Action Death Note Show Casts Misa, Light's Father|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2015-05-31|accessdate=2016-04-06}}</ref> Unlike the manga and anime, she has a red death note. Her hair is also brown instead of blonde, similarly to the live-action films. When she goes to dig up her buried Death Note, Mikami's assistant steals it, and Mikami uses it to help Kira. Her Death Note is burned by a fire set by Mikami; consequently, her memory of the Death Note is erased.\n\nIn [[Death Note: The Musical|the musical adaptation]], Misa is portrayed by Fuka Yuzuki.\n\n==Reception==\nBriana Lawrence of [[Anime News Network]] felt that even though Misa was the typical annoying girl clinging to the main character, \"In a series full of geniuses it was amazing to see an average person get a hold of the Death Note. Her presence made things even more complicated for Light and she kept him on his toes as much as L did (maybe even more than L did).\" Lawrence was disappointed that the epilogue of the series did not show Misa's ultimate fate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/death-note/gn-12|title=Death Note GN 12 - Review|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2007-08-05|accessdate=2016-04-06}}</ref>\n\nIn a ''[[Salon.com]]'' article, Douglas Wolk describes Misa as being drawn in a \"Japanese comics' tradition of cute, tiny, airhead girls with big eyes\" and being a \"lot cannier than she pretends to be\". Wolk added that the reader could \"watch her measuring how much quasi-innocent charm to pour on in every situation\".<ref name=\"WolkSalon\">Wolk, Douglas. \"[http://www.salon.com/2007/07/26/death_note/ Death strip]\".

Pepirium, an editor of ''[[IGN]]'' website, describes Misa in a review of the ''Death Note'' anime episode \"Performance\" as being the \"show's weakest and most annoying character\". Pepirium points out the tone in which the character is written, feeling that her motivation and obsession with Kira are \"in league with ''Death Note''{{'}}s dark sensibilities\". He says that when Misa spouts her deep and fully realized affection for Kira in \"her wacky, excited, [[poodle]]-like way\", the information \"loses all impact\". Pepirium uses \"girly sophomoric pink fluff\" and \"Jar Jar\" (a reference to [[Jar Jar Binks]]) as figurative descriptors for Misa.<ref>Pepirium, Tom S. \"[http://tv.ign.com/articles/860/860774p1.html Death Note: \"Performance\" Review]\".

Toda said that she does not comprehend why a person would willingly use a Death Note, but added that she admired the fact that Misa \"does everything she sets out to do\", though that the actions of Light and Misa are criminal.<ref name=\"LastbutnotleastMalaysiaStar\"/>\n\nChristy Lee S.W. of ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'' said that Toda's portrayal of Misa in the second film \"may seem rather annoying for being overly bubbly and cute at first\" and that the character grows on the viewer \"after a while\". Lee stated that at the end of the film she saw the character of Misa as \"quite endearing\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Lee S.W., Christy |url=http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2007/1/28/movies/16676327&sec=movies |title=A Name to Remember |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |date=January 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 8, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219014803/http://www.star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F1%2F28%2Fmovies%2F16676327&sec=movies |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Anime and manga}}\n* [[List of Death Note characters|List of ''Death Note'' characters]]\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{Death Note}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amane, Misa}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2004]]\n[[Category:Death Note characters]]\n[[Category:Female characters in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fictional actors]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional models]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Kansai]]\n", "name_user": "2600:8803:7880:fcd:d09d:b86a:26bd:a451", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misa_Amane"}

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

Small numbers inhabit eastern [[Poland]] and the south-eastern part of [[Finland]].<ref>Substantial numbers (possibly several millions) of maghrebis of the former Ottoman colonies in North Africa are of Ottoman Turkish descent. [[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins. The Karakalpaks have a somewhat greater bias towards the eastern markers than the Uzbeks.<ref>''The Karakalpak Gene Pool'' (Spencer Wells, 2001); and discussion and conclusions at www.karakalpak.com/genetics.html</ref>\n\n'''Historical population:'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Turks mostly herded [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[horse]]s. Dairy was a staple of the nomadic diet and there are many Turkic words for various dairy products such as ''s\u00fct'' (milk), ''yagh'' (butter), [[ayran]], ''[[kaymak|qaymaq]]'' (similar to [[clotted cream]]), [[Kumis|qi\u0305mi\u0305z]] (fermented mare's milk) and ''[[qurut]]'' (dried yoghurt).

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]]. The Turks in Turkey are over 60 million<!-- According to a 2008 report prepared for the [[National Security Council (Turkey) of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern Anatolia, there were approximately 50 to 55 million ethnic Turks --><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/turkiye-deki-kurtlerin-sayisi--magazin-873452/|title=T\u00fcrkiye'deki K\u00fcrtlerin say\u0131s\u0131!|trans-title=The number of Kurds in Turkey!|language=tr|newspaper=[[Milliyet]]|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref> to 70 million worldwide, while the second largest Turkic people are the [[Azerbaijanis]], numbering 22 to 38 million worldwide; most of them live in Azerbaijan and Iran.\n\nIn the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] there are several Turkic national subdivisions,<ref>[http://www.sonsoftheconquerors.com/16501.html?*session*id*key*=*session*id*val* Across Central Asia], a New Bond Grows \u2013 Iron Curtain's Fall Has Spawned a Convergence for Descendants of Turkic Nomad Hordes</ref> including [[Bashkortostan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Chuvash Republic|Chuvashia]], [[Khakassia]], [[Tuva]], [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]], the [[Altai Republic]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], and [[Karachayevo-Cherkessiya]]. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

It was also a continuation of the broader trend of Islamic revival in India in the wake of the collapse of [[Mughal Empire|Muslim political hegemony]] to the [[Maratha Empire]] and the subsequent consolidation of the [[British raj]].\n\nThe emergence of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely with the rise of various Hindu revivalist movements such as ''[[Shuddhi]]'' (purification) and ''Sanghatan'' (consolidation) launched in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity.<ref name=\"Ballard 1994 64\">{{harvnb|Ballard|1994|p=64}}</ref>\n\n===Origin===\nMuhammad Ilyas, the founder of Tablighi Jamaat, wanted to create a movement that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the [[Quran]] decreed,<ref name=\"Quran\">{{cite quran|3|104 |s=ns}}</ref><ref name=p65/> as his teacher [[Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi]] dreamed of doing.<ref>{{harvnb|Masud|2000|p=xiii}}</ref> The inspiration for this came during his second [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] in 1926.<ref name='Agwani'>{{Cite book |last=Agwani |first=Mohammad Shafi |year=1986 |title=Islamic Fundamentalism in India |publisher=Twenty First Century Indian Society |page=41 |ref=harv }}</ref> What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal.<ref name=AMFO1994:513>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=513}}</ref> He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the [[Mewati]] Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices.

This was different from the other Islamic movements which were mainly [[ulama]]-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for proselytising, and promote ''dawah'' as a mechanism of self-reform.<ref name=AMFO1994:515>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=515}}</ref>\n\nLike Salafists, Tabligh seek a \"separation in their daily life from the `impious` society that surrounded them\".

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations.

One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements.

The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals.

Already the smaller 8th-century [[Tell Tayinat]] temple, discovered during excavations in 1936 and located about {{convert|50|miles}} away, had \"caused a sensation because of its similarities to Solomon\u2019s Temple.\"<ref name=\"Hess1999\"/><ref name=Monson/>\n\nThere are many features in common with Solomon's Temple as described in the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]]. The layout of Dara is similar to that of the Biblical temple, which was also of a long room plan with the three-room configuration of a portico at the entrance followed by the main chamber with the shrine.  The difference is in the antechamber, which is an add-on in the Ain Dara temple. The size of the Solomon temple was {{convert|35|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} while that of the Ain Dara is {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} wide without side chambers. Other similarities include:  location on a high raised site overlooking a city; erected on a raised platform, with a narrow portico and a roof supported on pillars flanked by reliefs on the walls, and carvings of similar motifs; and the raised podium. In brief, 33 of the architectural elements found in Ain Dara are tallied with 65 of the features mentioned in the Biblical description of Solomon's Temple.<ref name=Monson/><ref>{{cite web|title=Searching for the Temple of King Solomon|url=http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-sites-places/temple-at-jerusalem/searching-for-the-temple-of-king-solomon/|publisher=Biblical Archaeology Society|accessdate=23 January 2014|date=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Destruction in 2018\u20132019==\n===Destruction by Turkish military in 2018===\nIn late January 2018, both the [[Syria]]n [[Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums]] and pro-rebel [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] reported major destruction of the temple following [[airstrike]]s by the [[Turkish Air Force]] in the course of their [[Turkish military operation in Afrin|Afrin offensive]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-turkey-temple/syrian-government-says-turkish-shelling-damaged-ancient-temple-idUSKBN1FH08F | title=Syrian government says Turkish shelling damaged ancient temple | work=reuters.com | date=28 January 2018 | agency=[[Reuters]] | accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/28/c_136931429.htm | title=Syria condemns Turkey's attacks on ancient sites in Afrin | work=xinhuanet.com | date=28 January 2018 | agency=[[Xinhua]] | accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> Aerial bombardments of the Ain Dara site were first reported by a local resident via Dutch news network [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] on 23 January 2018.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://nos.nl/artikel/2213464-burgers-in-afrin-over-turkse-bombardementen-niemand-kijkt-naar-ons-om.html | title=Burgers in Afrin over Turkse bombardementen: niemand kijkt naar ons om | work=nos.nl | date=23 January 2018 | agency=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] | accessdate=28 January 2018 | language=nl}}</ref>\n\nAs reported on MSN news, with the headline \"Blown to bits\", it is clear the temple was heavily damaged. \"For 3,000 years, the lion sculptures of Syria's Ain Dara stood as testaments to the Iron Age.
