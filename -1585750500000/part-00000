Later, around 530, [[Benedict of Nursia|St. Benedict]] would arrange the weekly order of monastic psalmody in his ''[[Rule of St Benedict|Rule]]''. Later, in the 6th century, [[Venantius Fortunatus]] created some of Christianity's most enduring hymns, including \"[[Vexilla regis|Vexilla regis prodeunt]]\" which would later become the most popular hymn of the [[Crusades]].{{sfn|McKinnon|1991|pp=318\u2013320}}\n\n[[File:Guidonian hand.jpg|thumb|The Guidonian Hand]]\nThe earliest extant music in the West is ''[[plainsong]]'',{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=27}} a kind of [[texture (music)|monophonic]], unaccompanied, early Christian singing performed by Roman Catholic monks, which was largely developed roughly between the 7th and 12th centuries. Although [[Gregorian chant]] has its roots in Roman chant and is popularly associated with Rome, it is not indigenous to Italy, nor was it the earliest nor the only Western plainchant tradition. Ireland, Spain, and France each developed a local plainchant tradition, but only in Italy did several chant traditions thrive simultaneously: [[Ambrosian chant]] in [[Milan]], [[Old Roman chant]] in [[Rome]], and [[Beneventan chant]] in [[Benevento]] and [[Montecassino]]. Gregorian chant, which supplanted the indigenous Old Roman and Beneventan traditions, derived from a synthesis of Roman and [[Gallican chant]] in [[Carolingian]] France. Gregorian chant later came to be strongly identified with Rome, especially as musical elements from the north were added to the [[Roman Rite]], such as the [[Credo]] in 1014. This was part of a general trend wherein the manuscript tradition in Italy weakened and Rome began to follow northern plainchant traditions. Gregorian chant supplanted all the other Western plainchant traditions, Italian and non-Italian, except for Ambrosian chant, which survives to this day. The native Italian plainchant traditions are notable for a systematic use of ornate, [[steps and skips|stepwise]] melodic motion within a generally narrower range, giving the Italian chant traditions a smoother, more undulating feel than the Gregorian.{{sfn|Hiley|1995|p=546}} Crucial in the transmission of chant were the innovations of [[Guido d'Arezzo]], whose ''Micrologus'', written around 1020, described the [[musical staff]], [[solmization]], and the [[Guidonian hand]]. This early form of do-re-mi created a technical revolution in the speed at which chants could be learned, memorized, and recorded. Much of the European classical musical tradition, including [[opera]] and [[symphony|symphonic]] and [[chamber music]] can be traced back to these Italian medieval developments in [[musical notation]],{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=33}} formal [[music education]] and construction techniques for [[musical instrument]]s.\n\nEven as the northern chant traditions were displacing indigenous Italian chant, displaced musicians from the north contributed to a new thriving musical culture in 12th-century Italy. The [[Albigensian Crusade]], supposedly to attack Cathar heretics, brought southern France under northern French control and crushed Occitan culture and language. Most [[troubadour]]s fled, especially to Spain and Italy. Italy developed its own counterparts to troubadours, called ''trovatori'', including [[Sordello]] of [[Mantua]]. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the last great [[Hohenstaufen]] Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, encouraged music at the Sicilian court, which became a refuge for these displaced troubadours, where they contributed to a melting pot of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim musical styles. Italian secular music was largely the province of these jongleurs, troubadors, and mimes.{{sfn|Gallo|1995|p={{page needed|date=December 2018}}}} One important consequence of the troubadour influence during this period, in Italy and across Europe, was the gradual shift from writing strictly in [[Latin language|Latin]] to the local language, as championed by [[Dante]] in his treatise ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]''; this development extended to the lyrics of popular songs and forms such as the [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]],{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=185}} meaning \"in the mother tongue.\" Also around this time, Italian [[flagellant]]s developed the Italian folk hymns known as spiritual [[lauda (song)|laude]].\n\nBetween 1317 and 1319, [[Marchetto da Padova|Marchettus of Padua]] wrote the ''Lucidarium in artae musicae planae'' and the ''Pomerium artis musicae mensuratae'', major treatises on [[plainchant]] and [[polyphony]], expounding a theory of rhythmic notation that paved the way for [[music of the Trecento|Trecento music]] (Italian ''[[ars nova]]''). Around 1335, the ''[[Rossi Codex]]'', the earliest extant collection of Italian secular polyphony, included examples of indigenous Italian genres of the [[Trecento]] including early ''[[Madrigal (Trecento)|madrigal]]s'', ''[[Caccia (music)|cacce]]'', and ''[[ballata|ballate]]''. The early madrigal was simpler than the more well-known later madrigals, usually consisting of tercets arranged polyphonically for two voices, with a refrain called a ''ritornello''. The caccia was often in three-part harmony, with the top two lines set to words in musical canon. The early ballata was often a poem in the form of a [[virelai]] set to a [[monophony|monophonic]] melody.{{sfn|Hoppin|1978|p=438}} The Rossi Codex included music by [[Jacopo da Bologna]], the first famous Trecento composer.\n\nThe ''Ivrea Codex'', dated around 1360, and the ''[[Squarcialupi Codex]]'', dated around 1410, were major sources of late Trecento music, including the music of [[Francesco Landini]], the famous blind composer. Landini's name was attached to his characteristic \"[[Landini cadence]]\" in which the final note of the melody dips down two notes before returning, such as C\u2013B\u2013A\u2013C. Trecento music influenced northern musicians such as [[Johannes Ciconia]], whose synthesis of the French and Italian styles presaged the \"international\" music typical of the Renaissance.\n\nDuring the 15th century, Italy entered a slow period in native composition, with the exception of a few bright lights such as the performer and anthologist Leonardo Giustinian. As the powerful northern families such as the [[d'Este]] and [[Medici]] built up powerful political dynasties, they brought northern composers of the [[Dutch school (music)|Franco-Flemish]] school such as [[Josquin]] and [[Loyset Comp\u00e8re|Comp\u00e8re]] to their courts. Starting in the last decades of the century, Italian composers such as [[Marchetto Cara]] and [[Bartolomeo Tromboncino]] wrote light, courtly songs called ''[[frottola|frottole]]'' for the [[Mantua]]n court of [[Isabella d'Este]]. With the support of the Medici, the [[Florence|Florentine]] Mardi Gras season led to the creation of witty, earthy carnival songs called ''canti carnascialeschi''.\n\n== Renaissance era, 16th century ==\n{{details|Roman School|Venetian School (music)|Venetian polychoral style|Music of Venice}}\n\n[[File:San Marco (evening view).jpg|left|thumb|300px|Saint Mark's in Venice. The spacious, resonant interior was one of the inspirations for the music of the Venetian School.]]\nThe 16th century saw the advent of printed polyphonic music and advances in instrumental music, which contributed to the international distribution of music characteristic of the Renaissance. In 1501, [[Ottaviano dei Petrucci]] published the ''Harmonice Musices Odhecaton'', the first substantial collection of printed polyphonic music, and in 1516, Andrea Antico published the ''Frottole intablate da sonari organi'', the earliest printed Italian music for keyboard. Italy became the primary center of harpsichord construction, violin production started in [[Cremona]] in the workshop of [[Andrea Amati]], and lutenist Francesco Canova da Milano earned Italy an international reputation for virtuosic musicianship.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=494}}\n\n[[File:Gesualdo2.jpg|upright|thumb|Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa]]\nMusic achieved new heights of cultural respectability. [[Baldassare Castiglione|Castiglione]]'s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' recommended proficiency at music as a courtly virtue, and ''Santa Maria di Loreto'', the first music conservatory, was built in [[Naples]]. [[Adrian Willaert]] developed music for double chorus at [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Mark's]] in [[Venice]]. This tradition of Venetian polychoral music would reach its height in the early baroque music of [[Giovanni Gabrieli]]. Unlike the earlier, simpler madrigals of the [[Trecento]], madrigals of the 16th century were written for several voices, often by non-Italians brought into the wealthy northern courts. Madrigalists aspired to create high art, often using the refined poetry of [[Petrarchan sonnet]]s, and utilizing musically sophisticated techniques such as text painting. Composers such as [[Cipriano de Rore]] and [[Orlando di Lasso]] experimented with increasing [[chromaticism]], which would culminate in the [[mannerist]] music of [[Carlo Gesualdo]]. In 1558, [[Gioseffo Zarlino]], the premier musical theorist of the period, wrote the ''Istitutioni harmoniche'', which addressed such practical musical issues as invertible [[counterpoint]]. Lighter music was represented by the ''[[villanella]]'', which originated in popular songs of [[Naples]] and spread throughout Italy.\n\nMusic was not immune to the politically charged atmosphere of Renaissance Italy. In 1559, Antonio Gardano published ''Musica nova'', whose politically pro-republican partisan songs pleased the northern Italian republics and riled the Church.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=406}} In 1562/1563, the third portion of the [[Council of Trent]] addressed issues of music in the Church. Most paraliturgical music, including all but four [[Sequence (poetry)|Sequence]]s were banned. An outright ban on polyphonic music was debated behind the scenes, and guidelines were issued requiring that church music have clear words and a pure, uplifting style. Although the tales of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]] \"rescuing\" polyphony with the ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars, Palestrina's music remains the paradigm of the musical aesthetic promoted by the Church.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=583}} Shortly afterwards, in 1614, the ''Editio medicea'' (Medicean Edition) of Gregorian chant was released, rewriting the Gregorian chant repertory to purge it of perceived corruptions and barbarisms, and return it to a \"purer\" state closer in style to Palestrinian melodies.\n\nIn the late 16th century and early 17th century, composers began pushing the limits of the Renaissance style. Madrigalism reached new heights of emotional expression and chromaticism in what [[Claudio Monteverdi]] called his ''seconda pratica'' (second practice), which he saw originating with [[Cipriano de Rore]] and developing in the music of composers such as [[Luca Marenzio]] and [[Giaches de Wert]]. This music was characterized by increased dissonance and by sections of [[homophony]], which led to such traits of the early baroque as unequal voices where the bass line drove the harmonies and the treble melody became more prominent and soloistic. This transitional period between the Renaissance and baroque included the development of the Sicilian polyphonic school in the works of Pietro Vinci, the first extant polyphony written by women, the fusion of Hebrew texts and European music in the works of [[Salomone Rossi]], and the virtuosic women's music of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]] performed by the [[Concerto delle donne]] in [[Ferrara]].\n\n== Baroque era, 16th &ndash; 18th centuries ==\n\n[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Claudio Monteverdi]]\nThe exact nature of [[Ancient Greek music|ancient Greek musical drama]] is a matter of dispute. What is important, however, for the later development of Italian and European music is that poets and musicians of the [[Florentine Camerata]] in the late 16th century thought\u2014in the words of one of them, [[Jacopo Peri]]\u2014that the \"ancient Greeks sang entire tragedies on the stage\".{{sfn|Paliska|1985|p=408}} Thus was born the musical version of the Italian Renaissance: paying tribute to [[History of Greece|classical Greece]] by retelling Greek myths within a staged musical context\u2014the first operas. The works emerged in this period with relatively simple melodies and the texts about Greek mythology sung in Italian. (Opera may have deeper roots in the Tuscan ''[[maggio drammatico]]'' tradition.<ref>Lomax, p. 126. {{incomplete short citation|date=December 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Magrini|1992|p={{page number needed|date=December 2018}}}} Three cities are especially important in this period in Italy: [[Venice]], as the birthplace of commercial opera; [[Rome]], for [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]'s school of [[Renaissance]] polyphony; and [[Naples]], as the birthplace of church-sponsored [[Music Conservatories of Naples|music conservatories]]. These conservatories evolved into training grounds, providing composers and musicians for Italy and, indeed, Europe as a whole. [[Claudio Monteverdi]] is considered the first great composer of the new musical form, opera, the person who turned Florentine novelty into a \"unified musical drama with a planned structure.\"{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=220}}\n\nThe years 1600 to 1750 encompass the [[Baroque music|musical Baroque]]. A new dominance of melody within harmony at the expense of text led to great changes, including the expansion of instrumental resources of the orchestra. The keyboard was extended, and the making of stringed instruments by [[Antonio Stradivari]] became a great industry in [[Cremona]]. Instrumental music started to develop as a separate \"track,\" quite apart from the traditional role of accompanying the human voice. Instrumental forms include such things as the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], [[symphony]], and [[concerto]]. Important names in music within this period in Italy are [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and [[Antonio Vivaldi]], representing the importance of Naples and Venice, respectively, within this period.\n\n[[File:Napoli - Teatro San CarlodaViaSanCarlo.jpg|thumb|Teatro San Carlo, Naples]]\nThe physical resources for music advanced greatly during the 18th century. The great opera houses in Naples and Milan were built: the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] and [[La Scala]], respectively. It is the age, as well, of the rise to prominence of the Neapolitan\u2014and then Italian\u2014[[Comic opera]]. Important, too, is the restoring of balance between text and music in opera, largely through the librettos of Pietro Trapassi, called [[Metastasio]].{{sfn|Crocker|1966|p=341}}\n\nImportant Italian composers in this century are: [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Benedetto Marcello]], [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], and [[Luigi Cherubini]]. It is also the age in which Italian music became international, so to speak, with many Italian composers beginning to work abroad.\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi]]\n\n== 19th century ==\n\nThe 19th century is the age of Romanticism in European literature, art, and music. Italian opera forsakes the [[Comic opera]] for the more  the generally light-hearted and ever-popular [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] was certainly an exception to that, Italian music of the 19th century is dominated at the beginning by the likes of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], giving to Italian music the lyrical melodies that have remained associated with it ever since. Then, the last fifty years of the century were dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], the greatest musical icon in Italian history. Verdi's music \"sought universality within national character\";{{sfn|Crocker|1966|p=473}} that is, much of what he composed in terms of historical themes could be related to his pan-Italian vision. Verdi was the composer of the Italian [[Risorgimento]], the movement to unify Italy in the 19th century. Later in the century is also the time of the early career of [[Giacomo Puccini]], perhaps the greatest composer of pure melody in the history of Italian music.\n\n[[File:cavrust.jpg|right|thumb|Frontispiece from the score of ''Cavalleria rusticana'', a masterpiece of Italian ''Verismo'' from 1890]]\nPerhaps the most noteworthy feature of Italian musical form in the 19th century, and that which distinguishes it from musical developments elsewhere, is that it remained primarily operatic. All significant Italian composers of the century wrote opera almost to the exclusion of other forms, such as the symphony.{{sfn|Crocker|1966|loc=ch. 13}} There are no Italian symphonists in this century, the way one might speak of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] in Germany, for example. Many Italian composers, however, did write significant sacred music, such as Rossini a ''Stabat Mater'' and his late ''[[Petite messe solennelle]]'' and Verdi ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Messa da Requiem]]'' and ''[[Quattro pezzi sacri]]''.\n\nRomanticism in all European music certainly held on through the start of the 20th century. In Italy, the music of Verdi and Puccini continued to dominate for a number of years. Even the realistic plots and more modern compositional techniques of the operas of Italian [[verismo]], such as [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', did not greatly affect the extremely melodic nature of Italian music.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n|first     = Allan W.\n|last      = Atlas\n|title     = Renaissance Music\n|publisher = W.

Unlike the earlier, simpler madrigals of the [[Trecento]], madrigals of the 16th century were written for several voices, often by non-Italians brought into the wealthy northern courts. Madrigalists aspired to create high art, often using the refined poetry of [[Petrarchan sonnet]]s, and utilizing musically sophisticated techniques such as text painting. Composers such as [[Cipriano de Rore]] and [[Orlando di Lasso]] experimented with increasing [[chromaticism]], which would culminate in the [[mannerist]] music of [[Carlo Gesualdo]]. In 1558, [[Gioseffo Zarlino]], the premier musical theorist of the period, wrote the ''Istitutioni harmoniche'', which addressed such practical musical issues as invertible [[counterpoint]]. Lighter music was represented by the ''[[villanella]]'', which originated in popular songs of [[Naples]] and spread throughout Italy.\n\nMusic was not immune to the politically charged atmosphere of Renaissance Italy. In 1559, Antonio Gardano published ''Musica nova'', whose politically pro-republican partisan songs pleased the northern Italian republics and riled the Church.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=406}} In 1562/1563, the third portion of the [[Council of Trent]] addressed issues of music in the Church. Most paraliturgical music, including all but four [[Sequence (poetry)|Sequence]]s were banned. An outright ban on polyphonic music was debated behind the scenes, and guidelines were issued requiring that church music have clear words and a pure, uplifting style. Although the tales of [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]] \"rescuing\" polyphony with the ''[[Missa Papae Marcelli]]'' are no longer accepted by scholars, Palestrina's music remains the paradigm of the musical aesthetic promoted by the Church.{{sfn|Atlas|1998|p=583}} Shortly afterwards, in 1614, the ''Editio medicea'' (Medicean Edition) of Gregorian chant was released, rewriting the Gregorian chant repertory to purge it of perceived corruptions and barbarisms, and return it to a \"purer\" state closer in style to Palestrinian melodies.\n\nIn the late 16th century and early 17th century, composers began pushing the limits of the Renaissance style. Madrigalism reached new heights of emotional expression and chromaticism in what [[Claudio Monteverdi]] called his ''seconda pratica'' (second practice), which he saw originating with [[Cipriano de Rore]] and developing in the music of composers such as [[Luca Marenzio]] and [[Giaches de Wert]]. This music was characterized by increased dissonance and by sections of [[homophony]], which led to such traits of the early baroque as unequal voices where the bass line drove the harmonies and the treble melody became more prominent and soloistic. This transitional period between the Renaissance and baroque included the development of the Sicilian polyphonic school in the works of Pietro Vinci, the first extant polyphony written by women, the fusion of Hebrew texts and European music in the works of [[Salomone Rossi]], and the virtuosic women's music of [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]] performed by the [[Concerto delle donne]] in [[Ferrara]].\n\n== Baroque era, 16th &ndash; 18th centuries ==\n\n[[File:Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Claudio Monteverdi]]\nThe exact nature of [[Ancient Greek music|ancient Greek musical drama]] is a matter of dispute. What is important, however, for the later development of Italian and European music is that poets and musicians of the [[Florentine Camerata]] in the late 16th century thought\u2014in the words of one of them, [[Jacopo Peri]]\u2014that the \"ancient Greeks sang entire tragedies on the stage\".{{sfn|Paliska|1985|p=408}} Thus was born the musical version of the Italian Renaissance: paying tribute to [[History of Greece|classical Greece]] by retelling Greek myths within a staged musical context\u2014the first operas. The works emerged in this period with relatively simple melodies and the texts about Greek mythology sung in Italian. (Opera may have deeper roots in the Tuscan ''[[maggio drammatico]]'' tradition.<ref>Lomax, p. 126. {{incomplete short citation|date=December 2018}}</ref>{{sfn|Magrini|1992|p={{page number needed|date=December 2018}}}} Three cities are especially important in this period in Italy: [[Venice]], as the birthplace of commercial opera; [[Rome]], for [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]]'s school of [[Renaissance]] polyphony; and [[Naples]], as the birthplace of church-sponsored [[Music Conservatories of Naples|music conservatories]]. These conservatories evolved into training grounds, providing composers and musicians for Italy and, indeed, Europe as a whole. [[Claudio Monteverdi]] is considered the first great composer of the new musical form, opera, the person who turned Florentine novelty into a \"unified musical drama with a planned structure.\"{{sfn|Ulrich|Pisk|1963|p=220}}\n\nThe years 1600 to 1750 encompass the [[Baroque music|musical Baroque]]. A new dominance of melody within harmony at the expense of text led to great changes, including the expansion of instrumental resources of the orchestra. The keyboard was extended, and the making of stringed instruments by [[Antonio Stradivari]] became a great industry in [[Cremona]]. Instrumental music started to develop as a separate \"track,\" quite apart from the traditional role of accompanying the human voice. Instrumental forms include such things as the [[sonata (music)|sonata]], [[symphony]], and [[concerto]]. Important names in music within this period in Italy are [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], and [[Antonio Vivaldi]], representing the importance of Naples and Venice, respectively, within this period.\n\n[[File:Napoli - Teatro San CarlodaViaSanCarlo.jpg|thumb|Teatro San Carlo, Naples]]\nThe physical resources for music advanced greatly during the 18th century. The great opera houses in Naples and Milan were built: the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] and [[La Scala]], respectively. It is the age, as well, of the rise to prominence of the Neapolitan\u2014and then Italian\u2014[[Comic opera]]. Important, too, is the restoring of balance between text and music in opera, largely through the librettos of Pietro Trapassi, called [[Metastasio]].{{sfn|Crocker|1966|p=341}}\n\nImportant Italian composers in this century are: [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Benedetto Marcello]], [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni]], [[Giovanni Paisiello]], [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], and [[Luigi Cherubini]]. It is also the age in which Italian music became international, so to speak, with many Italian composers beginning to work abroad.\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi by Giovanni Boldini.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi]]\n\n== 19th century ==\n\nThe 19th century is the age of Romanticism in European literature, art, and music. Italian opera forsakes the [[Comic opera]] for the more serious fare of Italian lyric Romanticism. Although the generally light-hearted and ever-popular [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] was certainly an exception to that, Italian music of the 19th century is dominated at the beginning by the likes of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], giving to Italian music the lyrical melodies that have remained associated with it ever since. Then, the last fifty years of the century were dominated by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], the greatest musical icon in Italian history. Verdi's music \"sought universality within national character\";{{sfn|Crocker|1966|p=473}} that is, much of what he composed in terms of historical themes could be related to his pan-Italian vision. Verdi was the composer of the Italian [[Risorgimento]], the movement to unify Italy in the 19th century. Later in the century is also the time of the early career of [[Giacomo Puccini]], perhaps the greatest composer of pure melody in the history of Italian music.\n\n[[File:cavrust.jpg|right|thumb|Frontispiece from the score of ''Cavalleria rusticana'', a masterpiece of Italian ''Verismo'' from 1890]]\nPerhaps the most noteworthy feature of Italian musical form in the 19th century, and that which distinguishes it from musical developments elsewhere, is that it remained primarily operatic. All significant Italian composers of the century wrote opera almost to the exclusion of other forms, such as the symphony.{{sfn|Crocker|1966|loc=ch. 13}} There are no Italian symphonists in this century, the way one might speak of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] in Germany, for example. Many Italian composers, however, did write significant sacred music, such as Rossini a ''Stabat Mater'' and his late ''[[Petite messe solennelle]]'' and Verdi ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Messa da Requiem]]'' and ''[[Quattro pezzi sacri]]''.\n\nRomanticism in all European music certainly held on through the start of the 20th century. In Italy, the music of Verdi and Puccini continued to dominate for a number of years. Even the realistic plots and more modern compositional techniques of the operas of Italian [[verismo]], such as [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]]'s ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', did not greatly affect the extremely melodic nature of Italian music.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n|first     = Allan W.\n|last      = Atlas\n|title     = Renaissance Music\n|publisher = W.

Due to a lack of historical records, it is not known exactly when the fort was constructed, but estimates based off of stone inscriptions suggests that the fort was most likely built during the rule of Chinna Bommi Nayak between 1526 and 1595. The fort is a good example of [[Architecture of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu military architecture]], while the [[Jalakandeswarar Temple, Vellore|Jalakandeswarar Temple]] within the fort represents [[Vijayanagara architecture]].\n\n[[Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore|Christian Medical College & Hospital]], founded in 1900 by the American medical missionary [[Ida S. Scudder|Dr. Ida S. Scudder]], is another Vellore landmark. The hospital has grown into a medical institution of international repute.{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe central prison in Vellore, established in 1830, had imprisoned notable figures like [[C. Rajagopalachari]] and  [[Ramaswamy Venkataraman]]. Other landmarks include the Aruganthampoodi mausoleums, located close to the section of [[National Highway 48 (India)|National Highway 48]] between Vellore and Arcot, where the family members of [[Tipu Sultan]] were buried; and the Muthu Mandapam, a memorial on the banks of [[Palar River]] built by the Tamil Nadu Government to honor [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] in [[Sri Lanka]], who ruled from 1798 to 1815 and was imprisoned in Vellore Fort for 17 years until his death.\n\n===Vellore Fort===\n{{Main|Vellore Fort}}\n\nThe fort of Vellore was built around 1566 CE by the chieftains of Sadashiv Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire. In the mid-17th century the fort was owned by various parties. The Aravidus, the last dynasty that ruled Vijayanagara lost Vellore to the Bijapur Sultan before being captured by the Marathas after a siege that lasted four and a half months in 1676. The fort came under the charge of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, before passing on to the British in 1760. Vellore Fort withstood Hyder Ali's siege from 1780-82, and would later become the base for Lord Cornwallis\u2019 march on Bangalore to defeat Tipu Sultan.\n\nWhen Tipu Sultan was killed at Sringapatam during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-79 CE), his kingdom was handed back to the Hindu Wodeyar kings of Mysore and the British exiled Tipu's surviving sons, daughters, their families, and their entire entourage to Vellore Fort. They stayed in the palaces in the fort and participated in the Mutiny of 1806.\n\n===Vellore mutiny===\n{{Main|Vellore Mutiny}}\n\nIn 1805, the new Commander-in-Chief of the [[Madras Army]] of the [[British East Indian Company]], [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|General Sir John Cradock]], began an ambitious reform of the army's disciplinary system. New, standardized regulations were approved for the Madras Army, which dictated how [[sepoy]]s should wear their uniforms and appear on duty. Under these regulations, Hindus were prohibited from wearing religious marks on their foreheads while on duty, and Muslims were required to shave their beards and trim their moustaches. One change that was especially problematic was a new headdress associated with Indian converts to Christianity, which included a leather [[cockade]]. This caused an uproar, as leather was a cultural taboo for the upper caste sepoys of the Madras Army. As a result, many sepoys believed that their British officers were conspiring to convert them to Christianity. \n\nIn May 1806, a few soldiers protested against these changes and were sent to [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] in Chennai, where they were publicly lashed and discharged from the army. With the levels of resentment towards the British already high, the sons of the deceased [[Tipu Sultan]] exacerbated the conflict by assisting the mutineers who revolted on 10 July. Under the pretense of attending the wedding of one of Tipu Sultan's daughters, mutineers gathered in Vellore Fort where the wedding was held and revolted. Raising the flag of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], they declared Tipu Sultan\u2019s son Fateh Hyder king. The mutineers caused about 200 British casualties before their revolt was put down by British reinforcements under Sir [[Rollo Gillespie]], and many of the mutineers were either summarily shot, captured, court-martialed, and/or executed.\n\nAs a result of the uprising, the dress codes were retracted, and Cradock was dismissed. Although the mutiny took place before larger revolts in the 1850s, it was indicative of the simmering dissent in the Indian soldiery. The Vellore mutiny is considered to be the first large-scale Indian mutiny against the British, and a prelude to the much larger [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857.\n\n==Economic, Social and Cultural Changes in Vellore in the 20th Century==\nThe economic condition of the district in the earlier stages was not sound with the absence of major industries. Industries like Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. Ranipet, Tamil Nadu Explosives Ltd., and Vellore Katpadi were established as the result of governmental police. There has been notable growth of small scale industries and tanneries in the district, which not only generated employment opportunities, but also contributed economic growth to farmers. Uzhavar Sandhai helped the rural poor improve the economy. Women-driven self help groups played an important role in building rural economy and teaching rural women to be self-reliant.\nVellore also changed socially as time went by. Increased social awareness and upward social growth marked the successful foundation of its districts. Literacy improved in part of the Arivoli Movement.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the town came under [[British rule in India|British rule]].<ref name=\"urbaninfra12\">[[#urban|Urban Infrastructure Report]] 2008, p. 12</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Night View City of Vellore.jpg|thumb|AnnaSalai]]\nVellore is at {{Coord|12.92|N|79.13|E}}, 220m above sea level.

Other landmarks include the Aruganthampoodi mausoleums, located close to the section of [[National Highway 48 (India)|National Highway 48]] between Vellore and Arcot, where the family members of [[Tipu Sultan]] were buried; and the Muthu Mandapam, a memorial on the banks of [[Palar River]] built by the Tamil Nadu Government to honor [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]], the last ruler of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]] in [[Sri Lanka]], who ruled from 1798 to 1815 and was imprisoned in Vellore Fort for 17 years until his death.\n\n===Vellore Fort===\n{{Main|Vellore Fort}}\n\nThe fort of Vellore was built around 1566 CE by the chieftains of Sadashiv Raya of the Vijayanagara Empire. In the mid-17th century the fort was owned by various parties. The Aravidus, the last dynasty that ruled Vijayanagara lost Vellore to the Bijapur Sultan before being captured by the Marathas after a siege that lasted four and a half months in 1676. The fort came under the charge of Dost Ali, the Nawab of Carnatic, before passing on to the British in 1760. Vellore Fort withstood Hyder Ali's siege from 1780-82, and would later become the base for Lord Cornwallis\u2019 march on Bangalore to defeat Tipu Sultan.\n\nWhen Tipu Sultan was killed at Sringapatam during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-79 CE), his kingdom was handed back to the Hindu Wodeyar kings of Mysore and the British exiled Tipu's surviving sons, daughters, their families, and their entire entourage to Vellore Fort. They stayed in the palaces in the fort and participated in the Mutiny of 1806.\n\n===Vellore mutiny===\n{{Main|Vellore Mutiny}}\n\nIn 1805, the new Commander-in-Chief of the [[Madras Army]] of the [[British East Indian Company]], [[John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden|General Sir John Cradock]], began an ambitious reform of the army's disciplinary system. New, standardized regulations were approved for the Madras Army, which dictated how [[sepoy]]s should wear their uniforms and appear on duty. Under these regulations, Hindus were prohibited from wearing religious marks on their foreheads while on duty, and Muslims were required to shave their beards and trim their moustaches. One change that was especially problematic was a new headdress associated with Indian converts to Christianity, which included a leather [[cockade]]. This caused an uproar, as leather was a cultural taboo for the upper caste sepoys of the Madras Army. As a result, many sepoys believed that their British officers were conspiring to convert them to Christianity. \n\nIn May 1806, a few soldiers protested against these changes and were sent to [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] in Chennai, where they were publicly lashed and discharged from the army. With the levels of resentment towards the British already high, the sons of the deceased [[Tipu Sultan]] exacerbated the conflict by assisting the mutineers who revolted on 10 July. Under the pretense of attending the wedding of one of Tipu Sultan's daughters, mutineers gathered in Vellore Fort where the wedding was held and revolted. Raising the flag of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], they declared Tipu Sultan\u2019s son Fateh Hyder king. The mutineers caused about 200 British casualties before their revolt was put down by British reinforcements under Sir [[Rollo Gillespie]], and many of the mutineers were either summarily shot, captured, court-martialed, and/or executed.\n\nAs a result of the uprising, the dress codes were retracted, and Cradock was dismissed. Although the mutiny took place before larger revolts in the 1850s, it was indicative of the simmering dissent in the Indian soldiery. The Vellore mutiny is considered to be the first large-scale Indian mutiny against the British, and a prelude to the much larger [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Sepoy Mutiny]] in 1857.\n\n==Economic, Social and Cultural Changes in Vellore in the 20th Century==\nThe economic condition of the district in the earlier stages was not sound with the absence of major industries. Industries like Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. Ranipet, Tamil Nadu Explosives Ltd., and Vellore Katpadi were established as the result of governmental police. There has been notable growth of small scale industries and tanneries in the district, which not only generated employment opportunities, but also contributed economic growth to farmers. Uzhavar Sandhai helped the rural poor improve the economy. Women-driven self help groups played an important role in building rural economy and teaching rural women to be self-reliant.\nVellore also changed socially as time went by. Increased social awareness and upward social growth marked the successful foundation of its districts. Literacy improved in part of the Arivoli Movement.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, the town came under [[British rule in India|British rule]].<ref name=\"urbaninfra12\">[[#urban|Urban Infrastructure Report]] 2008, p. 12</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Night View City of Vellore.jpg|thumb|AnnaSalai]]\nVellore is at {{Coord|12.92|N|79.13|E}}, 220m above sea level.

Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, and education, among others.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''generate'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''gener\u0101re'', meaning \"to beget\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/generate |title=Generate &#124; Define Generate at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=15 June 1995 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> The word ''generation'' as a ''[[Cohort (statistics)|Group or cohort]]'' in [[social science]] signifies the entire body of individuals born and living at about the same time, most of whom are approximately the same age and have similar ideas, problems, and attitudes (e.g., [[Beat Generation]] and [[Lost Generation]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/generation|title=Definition of generation &#124; Dictionary.com|website=www.dictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n==Familial generation==\n[[File:Lynch Armenia Five generations.png|thumb|right|Five generations of one Armenian family\u2014a child with her mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother.

Prior to that the concept \"generation\" had generally referred to family relationships and not broader social groupings. In 1863, French [[lexicographer]] [[Emile Littr\u00e9]] had defined a generation as, \"all people coexisting in society at any given time\".<ref name=Wohl203>{{Cite book| last=Wohl | first=Robert | title=The generation of 1914 | year=1979 | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts  | isbn=978-0-674-34466-2 | pages=203\u2013209 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YLe3e3FDXQkC&lpg=PA1&dq=wohl%201914&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\nSeveral trends promoted a new idea of generations, as the 19th century wore on, of a society divided into different categories of people based on age. These trends were all related to the processes of [[modernisation]], [[industrialisation]], or [[westernisation]], which had been changing the face of Europe since the mid-18th century. One was a change in mentality about time and social change. The increasing prevalence of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] ideas encouraged the idea that society and life were changeable, and that civilization could [[Social progress|progress]]. This encouraged the equation of youth with social renewal and change. Political rhetoric in the 19th century often focused on the renewing power of youth influenced by movements such as [[Young Italy]], [[Young Germany]], [[Sturm und Drang]], the [[German Youth Movement]], and other [[romantic movement]]s. By the end of the 19th century, European intellectuals were disposed toward thinking of the world in generational terms\u2014in terms of youth rebellion and emancipation.<ref name=Wohl203 />\n\nTwo important contributing factors to the change in mentality were the change in the economic structure of society. Because of the rapid social and economic change, young men particularly were less beholden to their fathers and family authority than they had been. Greater social and economic mobility allowed them to flout their authority to a much greater extent than had traditionally been possible. Additionally, the skills and wisdom of fathers were often less valuable than they had been due to technological and social change.<ref name=Wohl203 /> During this time, the period between [[childhood]] and [[adulthood]], usually spent at university or in military service, was also increased for many people entering [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs. This category of people was very influential in spreading the ideas of youthful renewal.<ref name=Wohl203 />\n\nAnother important factor was the breakdown of traditional social and regional identifications. The spread of [[nationalism]] and many of the factors that created it (a national press, linguistic homogenisation, [[public education]], suppression of local particularities) encouraged a broader sense of belonging beyond local affiliations. People thought of themselves increasingly as part of a society, and this encouraged identification with groups beyond the local.<ref name=Wohl203 /> [[Auguste Comte]] was the first philosopher to make a serious attempt to systematically study generations. In ''Cours de philosophie positive'' Comte suggested that social change is determined by generational change and in particular conflict between successive generations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEO.pdf |title=Hans Jaeger.

Other important theorists of the 19th century were [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].\n\nSociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] was a seminal figure in the study of generations. He elaborated a [[theory of generations]] in his 1923 essay ''The Problem of Generations''.<ref name=\"Pilcher\" /> He suggested that there had been a division into two primary schools of study of generations until that time.  Firstly, positivists such as Comte measured social change in designated life spans.  Mannheim argued that this reduced history to \"a chronological table\". The other school, the \"romantic-historical\" was represented by Dilthey and [[Martin Heidegger]]. This school focused on the individual qualitative experience at the expense of social context. Mannheim emphasised that the rapidity of social change in youth was crucial to the formation of generations, and that not every generation would come to see itself as distinct. In periods of rapid social change a generation would be much more likely to develop a cohesive character. He also believed that a number of distinct sub-generations could exist.<ref name=\"Pilcher\" />\n\nAccording to Gilleard and Higgs, Mannheim identified three commonalities that a generation shares:<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Gilleard| first1=Chris| last2=Higgs| first2=Paul| title=The third age: Class, cohort or generation?|journal=Ageing and Society| year=2002| volume=22| issue=3| pages=369\u2013382| doi=10.1017/s0144686x0200870x}}</ref>\n* Shared temporal location \u2013 generational site or birth cohort\n* Shared historical location \u2013 generation as actuality or exposure to a common era\n* Shared sociocultural location \u2013 generational consciousness or \"[[entelechy]]\"\n\nAuthors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]] developed the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]] outlining what they saw as a pattern of generations repeating throughout American history.

Currently, the most prominent example of pulse-rate generational theory is the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]]; however, [[Jose Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Juli\u00e1n Mar\u00edas]] followed this approach before them.\n\nSocial scientists tend to reject the pulse-rate hypothesis because, as Jaeger explains, \"the concrete results of the theory of the universal pulse rate of history are, of course, very modest. With a few exceptions, the same goes for the partial pulse-rate theories. Since they generally gather data without any knowledge of statistical principles, the authors are often least likely to notice to what extent the jungle of names and numbers which they present lacks any convincing organization according to generations.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jaeger |first1=Hans |title=Generations in History: Reflections on a Controversial Concept |journal=History and Theory |date=1885 |volume=24 |issue=3 |page=283 |url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEOCrOCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nSocial scientists follow the \"imprint hypothesis\" of generations, which can be traced to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s [[theory of generations]]. According to the imprint hypothesis, generations are only produced by specific historical events that cause young people to perceive the world differently than their elders. Thus, not everyone may be part of a generation; only those who share a unique social and biographical experience of an important historical moment will become part of a \"generation as an actuality.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Mannheim |first= Karl | chapter= The Problem of Generations |date=1952 |title= Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge: Collected Works, Volume 5 |editor1-last = Kecskemeti | editor1-first= Paul | location= New York|publisher= Routledge|pages=276\u2013322}}</ref> When following the imprint hypothesis, social scientists face a number of challenges. They cannot accept the labels and chronological boundaries of generations that come from the pulse-rate hypothesis (like Generation X or Millennial); instead, the chronological boundaries of generations must be determined inductively and who is part of the generation must be determined through historical, quantitative, and qualitative analysis.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hart-Brinson |first1=Peter |title=The Gay Marriage Generation: How the LGBTQ Movement Transformed American Culture |date=2018 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nWhile all generations have similarities, there are differences among them as well. A 2007 [[Pew Research Center]] report called \"Millennials: Confident. Connected. Open to Change\" noted the challenge of studying generations: \"Generational analysis has a long and distinguished place in social science, and we cast our lot with those scholars who believe it is not only possible, but often highly illuminating, to search for the unique and distinctive characteristics of any given age group of Americans. But we also know this is not an exact science. We are mindful that there are as many differences in attitudes, values, behaviors, and lifestyles within a generation as there are between generations.

Howe and Strauss also have written on the similarities of people within a generation being attributed to social change. Based on the way these lived experiences shape a generation in regard to values, the result is that the new generation will challenge the older generation's values, resulting in tension. This challenge between generations and the tension that arises is a defining point for understanding generations and what separates them.<ref>Mannheim, Karl.

Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, and education, among others.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''generate'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''gener\u0101re'', meaning \"to beget\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/generate |title=Generate &#124; Define Generate at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=15 June 1995 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> The word ''generation'' as a ''[[Cohort (statistics)|Group or cohort]]'' in [[social science]] signifies the entire body of individuals born and living at about the same time, most of whom are approximately the same age and have similar ideas, problems, and attitudes (e.g., [[Beat Generation]] and [[Lost Generation]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/generation|title=Definition of generation &#124; Dictionary.com|website=www.dictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n==Familial generation==\n[[File:Lynch Armenia Five generations.png|thumb|right|Five generations of one Armenian family\u2014a child with her mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother.

Prior to that the concept \"generation\" had generally referred to family relationships and not broader social groupings. In 1863, French [[lexicographer]] [[Emile Littr\u00e9]] had defined a generation as, \"all people coexisting in society at any given time\".<ref name=Wohl203>{{Cite book| last=Wohl | first=Robert | title=The generation of 1914 | year=1979 | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts  | isbn=978-0-674-34466-2 | pages=203\u2013209 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YLe3e3FDXQkC&lpg=PA1&dq=wohl%201914&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\nSeveral trends promoted a new idea of generations, as the 19th century wore on, of a society divided into different categories of people based on age. These trends were all related to the processes of [[modernisation]], [[industrialisation]], or [[westernisation]], which had been changing the face of Europe since the mid-18th century. One was a change in mentality about time and social change. The increasing prevalence of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] ideas encouraged the idea that society and life were changeable, and that civilization could [[Social progress|progress]]. This encouraged the equation of youth with social renewal and change. Political rhetoric in the 19th century often focused on the renewing power of youth influenced by movements such as [[Young Italy]], [[Young Germany]], [[Sturm und Drang]], the [[German Youth Movement]], and other [[romantic movement]]s. By the end of the 19th century, European intellectuals were disposed toward thinking of the world in generational terms\u2014in terms of youth rebellion and emancipation.<ref name=Wohl203 />\n\nTwo important contributing factors to the change in mentality were the change in the economic structure of society. Because of the rapid social and economic change, young men particularly were less beholden to their fathers and family authority than they had been. Greater social and economic mobility allowed them to flout their authority to a much greater extent than had traditionally been possible. Additionally, the skills and wisdom of fathers were often less valuable than they had been due to technological and social change.<ref name=Wohl203 /> During this time, the period between [[childhood]] and [[adulthood]], usually spent at university or in military service, was also increased for many people entering [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs. This category of people was very influential in spreading the ideas of youthful renewal.<ref name=Wohl203 />\n\nAnother important factor was the breakdown of traditional social and regional identifications. The spread of [[nationalism]] and many of the factors that created it (a national press, linguistic homogenisation, [[public education]], suppression of local particularities) encouraged a broader sense of belonging beyond local affiliations. People thought of themselves increasingly as part of a society, and this encouraged identification with groups beyond the local.<ref name=Wohl203 /> [[Auguste Comte]] was the first philosopher to make a serious attempt to systematically study generations. In ''Cours de philosophie positive'' Comte suggested that social change is determined by generational change and in particular conflict between successive generations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEO.pdf |title=Hans Jaeger.

Other important theorists of the 19th century were [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].\n\nSociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] was a seminal figure in the study of generations. He elaborated a [[theory of generations]] in his 1923 essay ''The Problem of Generations''.<ref name=\"Pilcher\" /> He suggested that there had been a division into two primary schools of study of generations until that time.  Firstly, positivists such as Comte measured social change in designated life spans.  Mannheim argued that this reduced history to \"a chronological table\". The other school, the \"romantic-historical\" was represented by Dilthey and [[Martin Heidegger]]. This school focused on the individual qualitative experience at the expense of social context. Mannheim emphasised that the rapidity of social change in youth was crucial to the formation of generations, and that not every generation would come to see itself as distinct. In periods of rapid social change a generation would be much more likely to develop a cohesive character. He also believed that a number of distinct sub-generations could exist.<ref name=\"Pilcher\" />\n\nAccording to Gilleard and Higgs, Mannheim identified three commonalities that a generation shares:<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Gilleard| first1=Chris| last2=Higgs| first2=Paul| title=The third age: Class, cohort or generation?|journal=Ageing and Society| year=2002| volume=22| issue=3| pages=369\u2013382| doi=10.1017/s0144686x0200870x}}</ref>\n* Shared temporal location \u2013 generational site or birth cohort\n* Shared historical location \u2013 generation as actuality or exposure to a common era\n* Shared sociocultural location \u2013 generational consciousness or \"[[entelechy]]\"\n\nAuthors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]] developed the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]] outlining what they saw as a pattern of generations repeating throughout American history. This theory became quite influential with the public and reignited an interest in the sociology of generations.

Currently, the most prominent example of pulse-rate generational theory is the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]]; however, [[Jose Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Juli\u00e1n Mar\u00edas]] followed this approach before them.\n\nSocial scientists tend to reject the pulse-rate hypothesis because, as Jaeger explains, \"the concrete results of the theory of the universal pulse rate of history are, of course, very modest. With a few exceptions, the same goes for the partial pulse-rate theories. Since they generally gather data without any knowledge of statistical principles, the authors are often least likely to notice to what extent the jungle of names and numbers which they present lacks any convincing organization according to generations.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jaeger |first1=Hans |title=Generations in History: Reflections on a Controversial Concept |journal=History and Theory |date=1885 |volume=24 |issue=3 |page=283 |url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEOCrOCR.pdf}}</ref>\n\nSocial scientists follow the \"imprint hypothesis\" of generations, which can be traced to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s [[theory of generations]]. According to the imprint hypothesis, generations are only produced by specific historical events that cause young people to perceive the world differently than their elders. Thus, not everyone may be part of a generation; only those who share a unique social and biographical experience of an important historical moment will become part of a \"generation as an actuality.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Mannheim |first= Karl | chapter= The Problem of Generations |date=1952 |title= Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge: Collected Works, Volume 5 |editor1-last = Kecskemeti | editor1-first= Paul | location= New York|publisher= Routledge|pages=276\u2013322}}</ref> When following the imprint hypothesis, social scientists face a number of challenges. They cannot accept the labels and chronological boundaries of generations that come from the pulse-rate hypothesis (like Generation X or Millennial); instead, the chronological boundaries of generations must be determined inductively and who is part of the generation must be determined through historical, quantitative, and qualitative analysis.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hart-Brinson |first1=Peter |title=The Gay Marriage Generation: How the LGBTQ Movement Transformed American Culture |date=2018 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nWhile all generations have similarities, there are differences among them as well. A 2007 [[Pew Research Center]] report called \"Millennials: Confident. Connected. Open to Change\" noted the challenge of studying generations: \"Generational analysis has a long and distinguished place in social science, and we cast our lot with those scholars who believe it is not only possible, but often highly illuminating, to search for the unique and distinctive characteristics of any given age group of Americans. But we also know this is not an exact science. We are mindful that there are as many differences in attitudes, values, behaviors, and lifestyles within a generation as there are between generations. But we believe this reality does not diminish the value of generational analysis; it merely adds to its richness and complexity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Millennials. Confident, Connected.

He argued that generations may sometimes be a \"threat to stability\" but at the same time they represent \"the opportunity for social transformation\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ryder|first=Norman|title=The cohort as a concept in the study of social change|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|year=1965|volume=30|issue=6|pages=843\u2013861|doi=10.2307/2090964|jstor=2090964}}</ref> Ryder attempted to understand the dynamics at play between generations.\n\nAmanda Grenier, in a 2007 essay published in ''[[Journal of Social Issues]]'', offered another source of explanation for why generational tensions exist. Grenier asserted that generations develop their own linguistic models that contribute to misunderstanding between age cohorts, \"Different ways of speaking exercised by older and younger people exist, and may be partially explained by social historical reference points, culturally determined experiences, and individual interpretations\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grenier|first=Amanda|title=Crossing age and generational boundaries: Exploring intergenerational research encounters|journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]]|year=2007|volume=63|issue=4|page=718|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00532.x}}</ref>\n\n[[Karl Mannheim]], in his 1952 book ''[[Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge]]'' asserted the belief that people are shaped through lived experiences as a result of social change. Howe and Strauss also have written on the similarities of people within a generation being attributed to social change. Based on the way these lived experiences shape a generation in regard to values, the result is that the new generation will challenge the older generation's values, resulting in tension. This challenge between generations and the tension that arises is a defining point for understanding generations and what separates them.<ref>Mannheim, Karl.

TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\"\n* \"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes. (After the June 2010 spill of more than {{convert|800,000|USgal|L}} of crude oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River, an Enbridge tar sands pipeline \u2013 a {{convert|30|in|mm|adj=on}} pipe compared to the {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} Keystone XL \u2013 was not completely shut down for 12 hours.)\"\n* \"Realistic calculations yield worst-case spill estimates of more than {{convert|180000|oilbbl|USgal L}} in the Nebraska Sandhills above the Ogallala Aquifer, more than {{convert|160000|oilbbl|USgal L}} of crude oil at the Yellowstone River crossings, more than {{convert|140000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Platte River crossing and more than {{convert|120000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Missouri River crossing.\"\n* \"Contaminants from a release at the Missouri or Yellowstone River crossing would enter Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota where they would adversely affect drinking water intakes, aquatic wildlife, and recreation. Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface.

TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\"\n* \"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes. (After the June 2010 spill of more than {{convert|800,000|USgal|L}} of crude oil into a tributary of the Kalamazoo River, an Enbridge tar sands pipeline \u2013 a {{convert|30|in|mm|adj=on}} pipe compared to the {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} Keystone XL \u2013 was not completely shut down for 12 hours.)\"\n* \"Realistic calculations yield worst-case spill estimates of more than {{convert|180000|oilbbl|USgal L}} in the Nebraska Sandhills above the Ogallala Aquifer, more than {{convert|160000|oilbbl|USgal L}} of crude oil at the Yellowstone River crossings, more than {{convert|140000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Platte River crossing and more than {{convert|120000|oilbbl|USgal L}} at the Missouri River crossing.\"\n* \"Contaminants from a release at the Missouri or Yellowstone River crossing would enter Lake Sakakawea in North Dakota where they would adversely affect drinking water intakes, aquatic wildlife, and recreation. Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface.

However, the volume of oil imported into the US from Venezuela dropped in half from 2007 to 2014, as overall Venezuelan exports have dropped, and also as Venezuela seeks to become less dependent on US purchases of its crude oil.
