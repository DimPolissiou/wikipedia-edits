(Although these were the final sketches of ''The Carol Burnett Show'', the characters would end up being reprised one year later in a different four-week series, ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]'').\n\nAs a special surprise for Burnett, Conway introduces a piano player and \u2013 when the curtain goes up \u2013 it is legendary screen actor [[James Stewart]] playing the piano and singing \"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\". Burnett, a lifelong fan of Stewart's, breaks down in tears and expresses how much she admires and loves him, and Stewart reciprocates by saying: \"Carol, I just feel so wonderful to be here, to be a part of all these millions of people to thank you for all the wonderful beautiful times you've given all of us, all of these eleven years.

Harvey Korman, who was appearing as a guest, stops and gives her a kiss; Lawrence comes out of a stage door, signs Burnett's autograph book, kisses and hugs her and leaves; Conway comes down the stairs and does the same.\n\nShe then walks across the empty stage towards a sign reading THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW and flips it over to read CLOSED. Sitting on her Charwoman's bucket, Burnett talks about how hard it is to leave and why she decided to end the show despite a season 12 renewal. She says it felt like the time to move on to do other things while the show was still doing well. She talks about the crew and each member of her cast and how much she loves and respects them. Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre. With the changes in cast (Harvey Korman left the series after the 1976\u201377 season and was replaced by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) along with the mediocre ratings (finishing its last season in 66th place), she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Mr. Tudball is moving his office and has a flashback to when he first interviewed Mrs. Wiggins.) \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" (Harvey Korman)\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" / \"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, [[Bob Hope]] and Bing Crosby)\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Eunice and Mama visit a psychiatrist, played by [[Craig Richard Nelson]]).\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*\"The Charwoman\": \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\n| series       = [[The Carol Burnett Show]]\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| season       = 11\n| episode      = 24 (279th overall)\n| airdate      = {{Start date|1978|03|29}}\n| production   = 0124\n| writer       = Roger Beatty<br>Rick Hawkins<br>Liz Sage<br>[[Robert Illes]]<br>[[James R.

Finally, she thanks the audience and tearfully sings a soulful rendition of the show's closing theme-song \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\". She blows a kiss to the audience, tugs at her ear one last time and says goodnight.<ref>[http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/the-carol-burnett-show/ ''The Carol Burnett Show'' TV series finale], retrieved July 4, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nAlthough [[CBS]] wanted to renew the show for another year, by this time, Burnett had grown tired of the weekly grind and wanted to explore acting roles outside of the comedy genre. With the changes in cast (Harvey Korman left the series after the 1976\u201377 season and was replaced by [[Dick Van Dyke]]) along with the mediocre ratings (finishing its last season in 66th place), she felt that television was undergoing a transition and that the variety series format was on its way out. Therefore, Burnett decided to end the series on her own rather than be canceled later.\n\nThe celebrities in the audience for the final episode included [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Betty White]] and then-husband [[Allen Ludden]], [[Roddy McDowall]], [[Jim Nabors]] and screen legend [[Lillian Gish]].\n\n''The Carol Burnett Show'' was one of the longest-running variety shows in television history; its conclusion marked the closing of another chapter in television as Burnett was the last of the great comedic talents heading a variety show, and hers was the last offering live entertainment before an audience.\n\n==Featured segments==\n*Duets: [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Perry Como]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[Rock Hudson]], [[Steve Lawrence]] and [[Eydie Gorm\u00e9]]\n*\"[[As Time Goes By (song)|As Time Goes By]]\" ([[Burt Reynolds]])\n*\"[[Mrs. Wiggins]]\" \u2013 ''Flashbacks'' (Carol Burnett, Tim Conway and Vicki Lawrence)\n**Mr. Tudball is moving his office and has a flashback to when he first interviewed Mrs. Wiggins. \n*\"[[Ragtime Cowboy Joe]]\" ([[James Stewart]])\n*Water Gimmicks:\n**\"[[They Call the Wind Maria]]\" (Harvey Korman)\n**\"[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Solo Montage:\n**\"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n**\"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (Carol Burnett)\n*Movie Parodies:\n**''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (Carol Burnett and Steve Lawrence)\n**''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'' (Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Steve Lawrence)\n*\"The Doily Sisters\" (Carol Burnett and Vicki Lawrence)\n*Favorite Moments:\n**\"[[The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia]]\" / \"S-P-L-I-T\" (Vicki Lawrence)\n**\"The Brown Derby\" (Carol Burnett, [[Bob Hope]] and Bing Crosby)\n**\"Newscaster\" (Tim Conway)\n**\"Cobumble\" \u2013 a spoof of ''[[Columbo]]'' (Tim Conway)\n**\"Hand Insurance\" (Carol Burnett and [[Dick Van Dyke]])\n*\"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" \u2013 ''The Psychiatrist'' (Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence and [[Craig Richard Nelson]])\n**Eunice and Mama visit a psychiatrist.\n*Scrapbook: \"[[Salsoul Orchestra|Magic Bird of Fire]]\" (The Ernie Flatt Dancers)\n*Bloopers and Outtakes\n*\"The Charwoman\": \"I'm So Glad We Had This Time Together\" (Carol Burnett)\n\n==DVD release==\nOn October 3, 2017, [[Time Life]] released ''The Best of The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Final Show'' as a single disc [[DVD]] in Region 1 to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Carol Burnett Show - The Final Show|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Carol-Burnett-Volume-Release/17604}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb episode|0536584}}\n*[https://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=liza+minnelli+&f=all&c=tv&advanced=1&p=4&item=T80:0730 \"A Special Evening with Carol Burnett\"] at the [[Paley Center for Media]]\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}} \n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special Evening with Carol Burnett, A}}\n[[Category:1978 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:American television series finales]]\n[[Category:Carol Burnett]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFeatured segments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Special_Evening_with_Carol_Burnett"}

In 1935, after four years studying [[military geography]] he graduated with the rank of ''alf\u00e9rez'' ([[Second lieutenant|Second Lieutenant]]) in the [[infantry]]. \n\n==Military career==\nIn September 1937, Pinochet was assigned to the \"Chacabuco\" Regiment, in [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]]. Two years later, in 1939, then with the rank of Sub-lieutenant, he moved to the \"Maipo\" Regiment, garrisoned in Valpara\u00edso. He returned to Infantry School in 1940. On 30 January 1943, Pinochet married [[Luc\u00eda Hiriart|Luc\u00eda Hiriart Rodr\u00edguez]], with whom he had five children: [[Luc\u00eda Pinochet|In\u00e9s Luc\u00eda]], Mar\u00eda Ver\u00f3nica, Jacqueline Marie, Augusto Osvaldo and Marco Antonio.\n\nBy late 1945, Pinochet had been assigned to the \"Carampangue\" Regiment in the northern city of [[Iquique]]. Three years later, he entered the Chilean War Academy but had to postpone his studies because, being the youngest officer, he had to carry out a service mission in the [[coal]] zone of [[Lota, Chile|Lota]]. The following year he returned to his studies in the Academy, and after obtaining the title of Officer Chief of Staff, in 1951, he returned to teach at the Military School. At the same time, he worked as a teachers' aide at the War Academy, giving military geography and geopolitics classes. He was also the editor of the institutional magazine ''Cien \u00c1guilas'' (\"One Hundred Eagles\").

At the end of 1959 he returned to Chile and was sent to General Headquarters of the 1st Army Division, based in [[Antofagasta]]. The following year, he was appointed commander of the \"Esmeralda\" Regiment. Due to his success in this position, he was appointed Sub-director of the War Academy in 1963. In 1968, he was named Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army Division, based in [[Santiago]], and at the end of that year, he was promoted to brigadier general and Commander in Chief of the 6th Division, garrisoned in Iquique.

Economist Andrew Farrant examined the Chilean constitutional clauses that MacLean attributes to Buchanan, and discovered that they pre-dated his visit. He concludes that \"evidence suggests that Buchanan's May 1980 visit did not particularly influence the subsequent drafting of the Chilean Constitution\" and \"there is no evidence to suggest that Buchanan had any kind of audience with Pinochet or corresponded with the Chilean dictator.\"<ref>Farrant, Andrew. \"What Should (Knightian) Economists Do?

Confronted with increasing opposition, notably at the international level, Pinochet legalized political parties in 1987 and called for a vote to determine whether or not he would remain in power until 1997. If the \"YES\" won, Pinochet would have to implement the dispositions of the 1980 Constitution, mainly the call for general elections, while he would himself remain in power as President. If the \"NO\" won, Pinochet would remain President for another year, and a joint Presidential and legislative election would be held.\n\nAnother reason for Pinochet's decision to call for elections was the April 1987 visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to Chile. According to the US Catholic author [[George Weigel]], he held a meeting with Pinochet during which they discussed a return to democracy. John Paul II allegedly pushed Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of his government, and even called for his resignation.<ref>[[George Weigel]], ''Biograf\u00eda de Juan Pablo II \u2013 Testigo de Esperanza'', Editorial Plaza & Jan\u00e9s (2003), {{ISBN|84-01-01304-6}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinochet Aylwin Bush.png|thumb|Former President Pinochet as Commander-in-Chief and President Aylwin met with U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1990.]]\nPolitical advertising was legalized on 5 September 1987, as a necessary element for the campaign for the \"NO\" to the referendum, which countered the official campaign, which presaged a return to a Popular Unity government in case of a defeat of Pinochet. The Opposition, gathered into the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por el NO]]'' (\"Coalition of Parties for NO\"), organized a colorful and cheerful campaign under the slogan ''La alegr\u00eda ya viene'' (\"Joy is coming\"). It was formed by the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democracy]], the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democrat Radical Party|Radical Party]], gathered in the ''Alianza Democr\u00e1tica'' (Democratic Alliance). In 1988, several more parties, including the [[Humanist Party (Chile)|Humanist Party]], the [[Ecologist Party of Chile|Ecologist Party]], the Social Democrats, and several Socialist Party splinter groups added their support.\n\nOn 5 October 1988, the \"NO\" option won with 55.99%<ref name=\"Elections\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117085107/http://www.tribunalcalificador.cl/resultado.php Tribunal Calificador], Chilean governmental website {{in lang|es}}</ref> of the votes, against 44.01% of \"YES\" votes. Pinochet accepted the result and the ensuing Constitutional process led to presidential and legislative elections the following year.\n\nThe Coalition changed its name to ''Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por la Democracia'' (Coalition of Parties for Democracy) and put forward [[Patricio Aylwin]], a Christian Democrat who had opposed Allende, as presidential candidate, and also proposed a list of candidates for the parliamentary elections. The opposition and the Pinochet government made several negotiations to amend the Constitution and agreed to 54 modifications. These amendments changed the way the Constitution would be modified in the future, added restrictions to state of emergency dispositions, the affirmation of [[pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], and enhanced constitutional rights as well as the [[democracy|democratic]] principle and participation to political life. In July 1989, a [[1989 Chilean referendum|referendum]] on the proposed changes took place, supported by all the parties except the right-wing [[Southern Party]] and the Chilean Socialist Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0041490 |title=El plebiscito incomprendido |work=[[Apsi]] |date=17 July 1989}}</ref> The Constitutional changes were approved by 91.25% of the voters.\n\nThereafter, Aylwin won the [[1989 Chilean presidential election|December 1989 presidential election]] with 55% of the votes,<ref name=Elections/> against less than 30% for the right-wing candidate, [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]], who had been Pinochet's [[Minister of Finances]] since 1985 (there was also a third-party candidate, [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera|Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz]], a wealthy aristocrat representing the extreme economic right, who garnered the remaining 15%<ref name=Elections/>). Pinochet thus left the presidency on 11 March 1990 and transferred power to the new democratically elected president.\n\nThe ''Concertaci\u00f3n'' also won the majority of votes for the Parliament. However, due to the \"binomial\" representation system included in the constitution, the elected senators did not achieve a complete majority in Parliament, a situation that would last for over 15 years. This forced them to negotiate all law projects with the [[Alliance for Chile]] (originally called \"Democracy and Progress\" and then \"Union for Chile\"), a center-right coalition involving the ''[[Independent Democratic Union|Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente]]'' (UDI) and ''[[National Renewal (Chile)|Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional]]'' (RN), parties composed mainly of Pinochet's supporters.\n\nDue to the transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. He was then sworn in as a [[senator-for-life]], a privilege granted by the 1980 constitution to former presidents with at least six years in office. His senatorship and consequent [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] protected him from legal action.

Arguing that the bodies of the \"[[Forced disappearance|disappeared]]\" were still missing, he made [[jurisprudence]], which had as effect to lift any [[statute of limitation|prescription]] on the crimes committed by the military. Pinochet's trial continued until his death on 10 December 2006, with an alternation of indictments for specific cases, lifting of immunities by the Supreme Court or to the contrary immunity from prosecution, with his health a main argument for, or against, his prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed, in March 2005, Pinochet's immunity concerning the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires, which had taken place in the frame of Operation Condor. However, he was deemed fit to stand trial for [[Operation Colombo]], during which 119 political opponents were \"disappeared\" in Argentina. The Chilean justice also lifted his immunity on the [[Villa Grimaldi]] case, a detention and torture center in the outskirts of Santiago. Pinochet, who still benefited from a reputation of righteousness from his supporters, lost legitimacy when he was put under house arrest on tax fraud and passport forgery, following the publication by the US Senate [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] of a report concerning the [[Riggs Bank]] in July 2004. The report was a consequence of investigations on financial funding of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the US. The bank controlled between US$4 million and $8 million of Pinochet's assets, who lived in Santiago in a modest house, dissimulating his wealth. According to the report, Riggs participated in [[money laundering]] for Pinochet, setting up offshore [[shell company|shell corporations]] (referring to Pinochet as only \"a former public official\"), and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. Related to Pinochet's and his family secret bank accounts in United States and in Caribbean islands, this tax fraud filing for an amount of 27 million dollars shocked the conservative sectors who still supported him. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was chief of the Chilean armies, and would essentially have come from [[weapons traffic]] (when purchasing French '[[Dassault Mirage|Mirage]]' fighter aircraft in 1994, Dutch '[[Leopard 2]]' tanks, Swiss '[[MOWAG]]' armored vehicles or by illegal sales of weapons to [[Croatia]], during the [[Yugoslav Wars|Balkans war]].)

Pinochet's funeral took place the following day at the same venue before a gathering of 60,000 supporters.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pinochet's funeral draws 60,000|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2006/12/12/pinochet-funeral.html|accessdate=5 March 2013|newspaper=CBC News|date=12 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn a government decision, he was not granted a [[state funeral]] (an honor normally bestowed upon past presidents of Chile) but a [[military funeral]] as former [[commander-in-chief]] of the Army appointed by Allende.

In 1935, after four years studying [[military geography]] he graduated with the rank of ''alf\u00e9rez'' ([[Second lieutenant|Second Lieutenant]]) in the [[infantry]]. \n\n==Military career==\nIn September 1937, Pinochet was assigned to the \"Chacabuco\" Regiment, in [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]]. Two years later, in 1939, then with the rank of Sub-lieutenant, he moved to the \"Maipo\" Regiment, garrisoned in Valpara\u00edso. He returned to Infantry School in 1940.

At the end of 1959 he returned to Chile and was sent to General Headquarters of the 1st Army Division, based in [[Antofagasta]]. The following year, he was appointed commander of the \"Esmeralda\" Regiment. Due to his success in this position, he was appointed Sub-director of the War Academy in 1963. In 1968, he was named Chief of Staff of the 2nd Army Division, based in [[Santiago]], and at the end of that year, he was promoted to brigadier general and Commander in Chief of the 6th Division, garrisoned in Iquique.

He was replaced by General [[Fernando Matthei]].\n\nPinochet organized a [[1980 Chilean constitutional referendum|plebiscite on 11 September 1980]] to ratify a new [[Constitution of Chile|constitution]], replacing the 1925 Constitution drafted during [[Arturo Alessandri]]'s presidency. The new Constitution, partly drafted by [[Jaime Guzm\u00e1n]], a close adviser to Pinochet who later founded the right-wing party [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI), gave a lot of power to the President of the Republic\u2014Pinochet.

Economist Andrew Farrant examined the Chilean constitutional clauses that MacLean attributes to Buchanan, and discovered that they pre-dated his visit. He concludes that \"evidence suggests that Buchanan's May 1980 visit did not particularly influence the subsequent drafting of the Chilean Constitution\" and \"there is no evidence to suggest that Buchanan had any kind of audience with Pinochet or corresponded with the Chilean dictator.\"<ref>Farrant, Andrew. \"What Should (Knightian) Economists Do?

Confronted with increasing opposition, notably at the international level, Pinochet legalized political parties in 1987 and called for a vote to determine whether or not he would remain in power until 1997. If the \"YES\" won, Pinochet would have to implement the dispositions of the 1980 Constitution, mainly the call for general elections, while he would himself remain in power as President. If the \"NO\" won, Pinochet would remain President for another year, and a joint Presidential and legislative election would be held.\n\nAnother reason for Pinochet's decision to call for elections was the April 1987 visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to Chile. According to the US Catholic author [[George Weigel]], he held a meeting with Pinochet during which they discussed a return to democracy. John Paul II allegedly pushed Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of his government, and even called for his resignation.<ref>[[George Weigel]], ''Biograf\u00eda de Juan Pablo II \u2013 Testigo de Esperanza'', Editorial Plaza & Jan\u00e9s (2003), {{ISBN|84-01-01304-6}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pinochet Aylwin Bush.png|thumb|Former President Pinochet as Commander-in-Chief and President Aylwin met with U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1990.]]\nPolitical advertising was legalized on 5 September 1987, as a necessary element for the campaign for the \"NO\" to the referendum, which countered the official campaign, which presaged a return to a Popular Unity government in case of a defeat of Pinochet. The Opposition, gathered into the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por el NO]]'' (\"Coalition of Parties for NO\"), organized a colorful and cheerful campaign under the slogan ''La alegr\u00eda ya viene'' (\"Joy is coming\"). It was formed by the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democracy]], the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democrat Radical Party|Radical Party]], gathered in the ''Alianza Democr\u00e1tica'' (Democratic Alliance). In 1988, several more parties, including the [[Humanist Party (Chile)|Humanist Party]], the [[Ecologist Party of Chile|Ecologist Party]], the Social Democrats, and several Socialist Party splinter groups added their support.\n\nOn 5 October 1988, the \"NO\" option won with 55.99%<ref name=\"Elections\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060117085107/http://www.tribunalcalificador.cl/resultado.php Tribunal Calificador], Chilean governmental website {{in lang|es}}</ref> of the votes, against 44.01% of \"YES\" votes. Pinochet accepted the result and the ensuing Constitutional process led to presidential and legislative elections the following year.\n\nThe Coalition changed its name to ''Concertaci\u00f3n de Partidos por la Democracia'' (Coalition of Parties for Democracy) and put forward [[Patricio Aylwin]], a Christian Democrat who had opposed Allende, as presidential candidate, and also proposed a list of candidates for the parliamentary elections. The opposition and the Pinochet government made several negotiations to amend the Constitution and agreed to 54 modifications. These amendments changed the way the Constitution would be modified in the future, added restrictions to state of emergency dispositions, the affirmation of [[pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], and enhanced constitutional rights as well as the [[democracy|democratic]] principle and participation to political life. In July 1989, a [[1989 Chilean referendum|referendum]] on the proposed changes took place, supported by all the parties except the right-wing [[Southern Party]] and the Chilean Socialist Party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/documento_detalle.asp?id=MC0041490 |title=El plebiscito incomprendido |work=[[Apsi]] |date=17 July 1989}}</ref> The Constitutional changes were approved by 91.25% of the voters.\n\nThereafter, Aylwin won the [[1989 Chilean presidential election|December 1989 presidential election]] with 55% of the votes,<ref name=Elections/> against less than 30% for the right-wing candidate, [[Hern\u00e1n B\u00fcchi]], who had been Pinochet's [[Minister of Finances]] since 1985 (there was also a third-party candidate, [[Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz Talavera|Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz]], a wealthy aristocrat representing the extreme economic right, who garnered the remaining 15%<ref name=Elections/>). Pinochet thus left the presidency on 11 March 1990 and transferred power to the new democratically elected president.\n\nThe ''Concertaci\u00f3n'' also won the majority of votes for the Parliament. However, due to the \"binomial\" representation system included in the constitution, the elected senators did not achieve a complete majority in Parliament, a situation that would last for over 15 years. This forced them to negotiate all law projects with the [[Alliance for Chile]] (originally called \"Democracy and Progress\" and then \"Union for Chile\"), a center-right coalition involving the ''[[Independent Democratic Union|Uni\u00f3n Dem\u00f3crata Independiente]]'' (UDI) and ''[[National Renewal (Chile)|Renovaci\u00f3n Nacional]]'' (RN), parties composed mainly of Pinochet's supporters.\n\nDue to the transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army until March 1998. He was then sworn in as a [[senator-for-life]], a privilege granted by the 1980 constitution to former presidents with at least six years in office. His senatorship and consequent [[Immunity from prosecution (international law)|immunity from prosecution]] protected him from legal action. These were possible in Chile only after Pinochet was arrested in 1998 in the [[United Kingdom]], on an [[extradition]] request issued by Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garz\u00f3n]]. Allegations of abuses had been made numerous times before his arrest, but never acted upon.<ref>See [[Juan Guzm\u00e1n Tapia]]'s autobiography</ref> The extradition attempt was dramatised in the 2006 BBC television docudrama ''[[Pinochet in Suburbia]]'', with Pinochet played by [[Derek Jacobi]].

Guzm\u00e1n had ordered in 1999 the arrest of five militarists, including General [[Pedro Espinoza Bravo]] of the [[Direcci\u00f3n de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], for their role in the [[Caravan of Death]] following the coup on 11 September. Arguing that the bodies of the \"[[Forced disappearance|disappeared]]\" were still missing, he made [[jurisprudence]], which had as effect to lift any [[statute of limitation|prescription]] on the crimes committed by the military. Pinochet's trial continued until his death on 10 December 2006, with an alternation of indictments for specific cases, lifting of immunities by the Supreme Court or to the contrary immunity from prosecution, with his health a main argument for, or against, his prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed, in March 2005, Pinochet's immunity concerning the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires, which had taken place in the frame of Operation Condor. However, he was deemed fit to stand trial for [[Operation Colombo]], during which 119 political opponents were \"disappeared\" in Argentina. The Chilean justice also lifted his immunity on the [[Villa Grimaldi]] case, a detention and torture center in the outskirts of Santiago. Pinochet, who still benefited from a reputation of righteousness from his supporters, lost legitimacy when he was put under house arrest on tax fraud and passport forgery, following the publication by the US Senate [[Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] of a report concerning the [[Riggs Bank]] in July 2004. The report was a consequence of investigations on financial funding of the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the US. The bank controlled between US$4 million and $8 million of Pinochet's assets, who lived in Santiago in a modest house, dissimulating his wealth. According to the report, Riggs participated in [[money laundering]] for Pinochet, setting up offshore [[shell company|shell corporations]] (referring to Pinochet as only \"a former public official\"), and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. Related to Pinochet's and his family secret bank accounts in United States and in Caribbean islands, this tax fraud filing for an amount of 27 million dollars shocked the conservative sectors who still supported him. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was chief of the Chilean armies, and would essentially have come from [[weapons traffic]] (when purchasing French '[[Dassault Mirage|Mirage]]' fighter aircraft in 1994, Dutch '[[Leopard 2]]' tanks, Swiss '[[MOWAG]]' armored vehicles or by illegal sales of weapons to [[Croatia]], during the [[Yugoslav Wars|Balkans war]].) His wife, [[Luc\u00eda Hiriart]], and his son, Marco Antonio Pinochet, were also sued for complicity. For the fourth time in seven years, Pinochet was indicted by the Chilean justice.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/28/chile.pinochet/?section=cnn_topstories U.S. sends back Pinochet daughter], ''[[CNN]]'', 28 January 2006</ref>\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Pinochet muerto.jpg|thumb|upright|Pinochet on the bier on 11 December 2006]]\n[[File:Feretro Pinochet.jpg|thumb|Pinochet's funeral]]\nPinochet suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on the morning of 3 December 2006 and was given the [[last rites]] the same day.
