The most commercially successful and longest-lasting line-up consisted of keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], bassist/guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] and drummer/singer [[Phil Collins]]. Significant former members were original lead singer [[Peter Gabriel]], and guitarists [[Anthony Phillips]] and [[Steve Hackett]]. The band moved from [[folk music]] to [[progressive rock]] in the 1970s, before moving towards pop at the end of the decade. They have sold 21.5 million copies of their albums in the United States, with worldwide sales of between 100 million and 150 million.\n\nFormed by five Charterhouse pupils including Banks, Rutherford, Gabriel, and Phillips, Genesis were named by former pupil [[Jonathan King]], who arranged for them to record several unsuccessful singles and their debut album ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'' in 1968. After splitting with King, the group began to tour professionally, signed with [[Charisma Records]] and recorded ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' (1970) in the progressive rock style. Following the departure of Phillips, Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' (1971). Their live shows also began to be centred on Gabriel's theatrical costumes and performances. They were first successful in mainland Europe, before entering the UK charts with ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' (1972). In 1973, they released ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' (1973), which featured their first UK top 30 single \"[[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)]]\". The [[concept album]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'' followed in 1974, and was promoted with a transatlantic tour featuring an elaborate stage show. Following the ''Lamb'' tour, Gabriel left Genesis in August 1975 to begin a solo career.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful search for a replacement, Collins took over as lead singer, while Genesis gained popularity in the UK and the US. Following ''[[A Trick of the Tail]]'' and ''[[Wind & Wuthering]]'' (both 1976), Hackett left, reducing the band to Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Genesis' next album ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'' produced their first UK top ten and US top 30 single in 1978 with \"[[Follow You Follow Me]]\", and they continued to gain commercial success with ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' (1980), ''[[Abacab]]'' (1981), and ''[[Genesis (Genesis album)|Genesis]]'' (1983). They reached a peak of popularity with ''[[Invisible Touch]]'' (1986), which featured five US top five singles, and its [[Invisible Touch (song)|title track]] reached number one there. After the tour for ''[[We Can't Dance]]'' (1991), Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career. Banks and Rutherford recruited [[Ray Wilson (musician)|Ray Wilson]] for ''[[Calling All Stations]]'' (1997), but a lack of success in the US led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the [[Turn It On Again: The Tour|Turn It On Again Tour]] in 2007. Although various members of Genesis participated in interviews for the 2014 BBC documentary ''[[Genesis: Together and Apart]]'', there was no further band activity for thirteen years, apart from various back catalogue reissues. In 2020, Collins, Banks and Rutherford announced they would reform for a final tour.\n\nTheir [[Genesis discography|discography]] includes fifteen studio and six live albums, six of which topped the UK chart. They have won numerous [[List of awards and nominations received by Genesis|awards and nominations]], including a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video|Best Concept Music Video]] with \"[[Land of Confusion]]\", and inspired a number of [[tribute band]]s recreating Genesis shows from various stages of the band's career. In 2010, Genesis were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].\n\n== History ==\n=== 1967\u20131969: Formation, early demos, and ''From Genesis to Revelation'' ===\n[[File:Chouse22.jpg|thumb|250px|The group formed at [[Charterhouse School]] in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]].]]\nThe founding members of Genesis, singer [[Peter Gabriel]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], guitarist [[Anthony Phillips]], bassist and guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]], and drummer [[Chris Stewart (author)|Chris Stewart]], met at [[Charterhouse School]], a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]]. Banks and Gabriel arrived at the school in September 1963, Rutherford in September 1964, and Phillips in April 1965.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} The five were members in one of the school's two bands; Phillips and Rutherford were in [[Anon (band)|Anon]] with singer [[Richard Macphail]], bassist [[Rivers Jobe]], and drummer Rob Tyrrell, while Gabriel, Banks, and Stewart made up [[Garden Wall (band)|Garden Wall]].{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}}\n\nIn January 1967, after both groups had split, Phillips and Rutherford continued to write together and proceeded to make a demo tape at a friend's home-made studio, inviting Banks, Gabriel, and Stewart to record with them in the process. The five recorded six songs: \"Don't Want You Back\", \"Try a Little Sadness\", \"She's Beautiful\", \"That's Me\", \"Listen on Five\", and \"Patricia\", an instrumental.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}}{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=13}} When they wished to have them professionally recorded they sought Charterhouse alumnus [[Jonathan King]], who seemed a natural choice as their publisher and producer following the success of his 1965 UK top five single, \"[[Everyone's Gone to the Moon]]\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=14}} A group friend gave the tape to King who was immediately enthusiastic.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=15}} Under King's direction, the group, aged between 15 and 17, signed a one-year recording contract with [[Decca Records]].{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=11}}\n\nFrom August to December 1967,{{sfn|Platts|2001|pp=11\u201312}} the five recorded a selection of potential singles at Regent Sound Studios on [[Denmark Street]], London, where they attempted longer and more complex compositions, but King advised them to stick to more straightforward pop.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=16}} In response Banks and Gabriel wrote \"[[The Silent Sun]]\", a pastiche of the [[Bee Gees]], one of King's favourite bands, which was recorded with orchestral arrangements added by [[Arthur Greenslade]].{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} The group exchanged various names for the band, including King's suggestion of Gabriel's Angels and Champagne Meadow from Phillips, before taking King's suggestion of Genesis, indicating the start of his production career. King chose \"The Silent Sun\" as their first single, with \"That's Me\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], released in February 1968.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=17}}{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}} It achieved some airplay on [[BBC Radio One]] and [[Radio Caroline]] but it failed to sell. A second single, \"A Winter's Tale\"&nbsp;/ \"One-Eyed Hound\", followed in May 1968 which also sold little.{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=25}} Three months later, Stewart left the group to continue with his studies.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}} He was replaced by fellow Charterhouse pupil [[John Silver (musician)|John Silver]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=19}}\n\nKing felt the group would achieve greater success with an album.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=19}} The result, ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'', was produced at Regent Sound in ten days during their school's summer break in August 1968.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=21\u201322}} King assembled the tracks as a [[concept album]] which he produced, while Greenslade added further orchestral arrangements to the songs, something the band were not informed of until the album was released. Phillips was particularly upset about Greenslade's additions.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=20}} When Decca found an American band already named Genesis, King refused to change his group's name. He reached a compromise by removing their name from the album cover, resulting in a minimalist design with the album title printed on a plain black background.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=21}} When the album was released in March 1969 it became a commercial failure, because record shops put the album in the \"Religious\" section upon seeing the cover.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}} Banks recalled the album \"after a year or so, had sold 649 copies\".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=52}} A third single, \"Where the Sour Turns to Sweet\"&nbsp;/ \"In Hiding\", was released in June 1969.{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=25}} None of the releases were commercially successful and led to the band's split with King and Decca.<ref name=\"fromgenesisto\">King, Jonathan.

Phillips and Rutherford decided to make music a full-time career as they were starting to write more complex music than their earlier songs with King.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=23\u201324}} After Banks and Gabriel decided to follow suit, the four returned to Regent Sound in August 1969 and recorded four more demos with Silver: \"Family\" (later known as \"Dusk\"), \"[[White Mountain (song)|White Mountain]]\", \"Going Out to Get You\", and \"Pacidy\". The tape was rejected by each record label that heard it.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=19}} Silver then left the group to study leisure management in the United States.

Initial discussions with [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records|Island]] and [[Chris Wright (music industry executive)|Chris Wright]] of [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] were unsuccessful. In March 1970, during the band's six-week Tuesday night residency at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]] in [[Soho]], members of [[Rare Bird]], who Genesis had supported earlier, recommended the band to producer and A&R man [[John Anthony (record producer)|John Anthony]] of [[Charisma Records]].{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} Anthony attended one of their shows and enjoyed them enough to convince his boss, label owner [[Tony Stratton-Smith]], to watch their next appearance.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=71}} Stratton-Smith recalled, \"Their potential was immediately apparent ... the material was good and their performance was good ... It was a long shot, because they needed time to find their strength ... but I was prepared to make that commitment\".{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} Stratton-Smith agreed to a record and management deal within two weeks, paying Genesis an initial sum of \u00a310 a week (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|10|1970|r=-2}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=72}}\n\nGenesis stayed at Wotton until April 1970,{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} by which time they had enough new material for a second album.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=27}} Recording for ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' began in June at [[Trident Studios]], London with Anthony as producer and [[David Hentschel]] hired as assistant engineer.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=31}} The album included longer and more complex songs than their first with [[folk music|folk]] and [[progressive rock]] elements with various [[time signature]] changes, as in the nine-minute song \"[[The Knife (song)|The Knife]]\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=32\u201333}} ''Trespass'' is the first in a series of three Genesis album covers designed by [[Paul Whitehead]]. He had completed the cover before the band decided to include \"The Knife\" on the album. Feeling the cover no longer reflected the album's overall mood, the band persuaded Whitehead to slash a knife across the canvas and have the result photographed.{{sfn|Romano|2010|p=72}} Released in October 1970, ''Trespass'' reached No. 1 in [[Belgium]] in 1971{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=50}} and No. 98 in the UK in 1984.<ref name=UKchart>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/14995/genesis/|title=GENESIS|publisher=Official Charts|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref> \"The Knife\" was released as a single in May 1971.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=349}} ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' briefly mentioned the album with a negative view following its 1974 reissue: \"It's spotty, poorly defined, at times innately boring\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/genesis/albums/album/127085/review/5946324/trespass |title=Genesis: Trespass : Music Reviews|first=Gordon|last=Fletcher|work=Rolling Stone|date=1 August 1974|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502020946/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/genesis/albums/album/127085/review/5946324/trespass|archivedate=2 May 2008}}</ref> \"Genesis seemed to be dying a death around our second album,\" Gabriel told [[Mark Blake (writer)|Mark Blake]]. \"We couldn't get arrested.

His last show with the band took place in [[Haywards Heath]] on 18 July 1970.{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=27}} He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=29,31}} He had contracted [[bronchial pneumonia]] and became isolated from the rest of the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=34}} Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band, which affected his confidence.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=35}}\n\n=== 1970\u20131972: Collins and Hackett join and ''Nursery Cryme'' ===\nThe search for a new guitarist and drummer began with advertisements placed in copies of ''[[Melody Maker]]''. The invitation was spotted by drummer [[Phil Collins]], formerly of [[Flaming Youth (band)|Flaming Youth]] who already knew Stratton-Smith.

As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. \"They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills and Nash]]\".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=94}} Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, \"It was a combination of things. He could make it swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals\".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=95}} In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=94}}\n\nAfter a short holiday, Genesis began to write and rehearse as a four-piece band in [[Farnham]], Surrey. The now empty guitar sections in their songs allowed Banks and Rutherford to expand their sound and play what Gabriel described as \"interesting chords\".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=95}} As they had not found a new guitarist, Genesis resumed as a live act with Rutherford adding [[bass pedals]] and Banks playing lead guitar lines on a [[Pianet]] through a distorted [[Distortion (music)|fuzz box]] amplifier in addition to his keyboard parts, something that he credits in helping him develop his technique.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=96}} In November 1970, after a second audition with Caryl fell through, Dave Stopps, owner of [[Friars Aylesbury|Friars club]] in [[Aylesbury]], suggested they use [[Mick Barnard]] of The Farm, who joined the band for their gigs which included Genesis's television debut on BBC's ''[[Disco 2 (TV series)|Disco 2]]''.{{sfn|Rutherford|2015|p=94}} After two months of performances, the band found Barnard lacked in expertise and wished to try someone else.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=41}} In December, Gabriel spotted a ''Melody Maker'' advert from [[Steve Hackett]], formerly of [[Quiet World]], who wanted to join a band of \"receptive musicians, determined to drive beyond existing stagnant music forms\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=43}} Gabriel advised Hackett to become familiar with ''Trespass'' and attend their upcoming gig at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in London.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=43}} Hackett auditioned with the group in a flat in [[Earls Court]] and formed an instant rapport with Rutherford through a common interest in [[inverted chord]]s.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=101}} After Hackett joined in January 1971,{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=44}} Stratton-Smith organised a UK tour with Genesis opening for fellow Charisma acts [[Lindisfarne (band)|Lindisfarne]] and [[Van der Graaf Generator]].{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=103}} Their first overseas dates took place in March with gigs in Belgium{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=32}} followed by their first of three consecutive appearances at the annual [[Reading Festival]] on 26 June.{{sfn|Platts|2001|p=42}}\n\nRehearsals for the band's third album, ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'', took place at [[Luxford House]] near [[Crowborough]], [[East Sussex]] that Stratton-Smith had owned.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|pp=105\u2013106}} Recording began at Trident Studios in August 1971 with Anthony and Hentschel reprising their respective roles as producer and assistant engineer.

The most commercially successful and longest-lasting line-up consisted of keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], bassist/guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]] and drummer/singer [[Phil Collins]]. Significant former members were original lead singer [[Peter Gabriel]], and guitarists [[Anthony Phillips]] and [[Steve Hackett]]. The band moved from [[folk music]] to [[progressive rock]] in the 1970s, before moving towards pop at the end of the decade. They have sold 21.5 million copies of their albums in the United States, with worldwide sales of between 100 million and 150 million.\n\nFormed by five Charterhouse pupils including Banks, Rutherford, Gabriel, and Phillips, Genesis were named by former pupil [[Jonathan King]], who arranged for them to record several unsuccessful singles and their debut album ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'' in 1968. After splitting with King, the group began to tour professionally, signed with [[Charisma Records]] and recorded ''[[Trespass (album)|Trespass]]'' (1970) in the progressive rock style. Following the departure of Phillips, Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded ''[[Nursery Cryme]]'' (1971). Their live shows also began to be centred on Gabriel's theatrical costumes and performances. They were first successful in mainland Europe, before entering the UK charts with ''[[Foxtrot (album)|Foxtrot]]'' (1972). In 1973, they released ''[[Selling England by the Pound]]'' (1973), which featured their first UK top 30 single \"[[I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)]]\". The [[concept album]] ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]'' followed in 1974, and was promoted with a transatlantic tour featuring an elaborate stage show. Following the ''Lamb'' tour, Gabriel left Genesis in August 1975 to begin a solo career.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful search for a replacement, Collins took over as lead singer, while Genesis gained popularity in the UK and the US. Following ''[[A Trick of the Tail]]'' and ''[[Wind & Wuthering]]'' (both 1976), Hackett left, reducing the band to Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Genesis' next album ''[[...And Then There Were Three...]]'' produced their first UK top ten and US top 30 single in 1978 with \"[[Follow You Follow Me]]\", and they continued to gain commercial success with ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' (1980), ''[[Abacab]]'' (1981), and ''[[Genesis (Genesis album)|Genesis]]'' (1983). They reached a peak of popularity with ''[[Invisible Touch]]'' (1986), which featured five US top five singles, and its [[Invisible Touch (song)|title track]] reached number one there. After the tour for ''[[We Can't Dance]]'' (1991), Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career. Banks and Rutherford recruited [[Ray Wilson (musician)|Ray Wilson]] for ''[[Calling All Stations]]'' (1997), but a lack of success in the US led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the [[Turn It On Again: The Tour|Turn It On Again Tour]] in 2007. Although various members of Genesis participated in interviews for the 2014 BBC documentary ''[[Genesis: Together and Apart]]'', there was no further band activity for thirteen years, apart from various back catalogue reissues. In 2020, Collins, Banks and Rutherford announced they would reform for a final tour.\n\nTheir [[Genesis discography|discography]] includes fifteen studio and six live albums, six of which topped the UK chart. They have won numerous [[List of awards and nominations received by Genesis|awards and nominations]], including a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video|Best Concept Music Video]] with \"[[Land of Confusion]]\", and inspired a number of [[tribute band]]s recreating Genesis shows from various stages of the band's career. In 2010, Genesis were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].\n\n== History ==\n=== 1967\u20131969: Formation, early demos, and ''From Genesis to Revelation'' ===\n[[File:Chouse22.jpg|thumb|250px|The group formed at [[Charterhouse School]] in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]].]]\nThe founding members of Genesis, singer [[Peter Gabriel]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], guitarist [[Anthony Phillips]], bassist and guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]], and drummer [[Chris Stewart (author)|Chris Stewart]], met at [[Charterhouse School]], a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in [[Godalming]], [[Surrey]]. Banks and Gabriel arrived at the school in September 1963, Rutherford in September 1964, and Phillips in April 1965.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} The five were members in one of the school's two bands; Phillips and Rutherford were in [[Anon (band)|Anon]] with singer [[Richard Macphail]], bassist [[Rivers Jobe]], and drummer Rob Tyrrell, while Gabriel, Banks, and Stewart made up [[Garden Wall (band)|Garden Wall]].{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}}\n\nIn January 1967, after both groups had split, Phillips and Rutherford continued to write together and proceeded to make a demo tape at a friend's home-made studio, inviting Banks, Gabriel, and Stewart to record with them in the process. The five recorded six songs: \"Don't Want You Back\", \"Try a Little Sadness\", \"She's Beautiful\", \"That's Me\", \"Listen on Five\", and \"Patricia\", an instrumental.{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}}{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=13}} When they wished to have them professionally recorded they sought Charterhouse alumnus [[Jonathan King]], who seemed a natural choice as their publisher and producer following the success of his 1965 UK top five single, \"[[Everyone's Gone to the Moon]]\".{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=14}} A group friend gave the tape to King who was immediately enthusiastic.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=15}} Under King's direction, the group, aged between 15 and 17, signed a one-year recording contract with [[Decca Records]].{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=11}}\n\nFrom August to December 1967,{{sfn|Platts|2001|pp=11\u201312}} the five recorded a selection of potential singles at Regent Sound Studios on [[Denmark Street]], London, where they attempted longer and more complex compositions, but King advised them to stick to more straightforward pop.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=16}} In response Banks and Gabriel wrote \"[[The Silent Sun]]\", a pastiche of the [[Bee Gees]], one of King's favourite bands, which was recorded with orchestral arrangements added by [[Arthur Greenslade]].{{sfn|Frame|1983|p=23}} The group exchanged various names for the band, including King's suggestion of Gabriel's Angels and Champagne Meadow from Phillips, before taking King's suggestion of Genesis, indicating the start of his production career. King chose \"The Silent Sun\" as their first single, with \"That's Me\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], released in February 1968.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=17}}{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}} It achieved some airplay on [[BBC Radio One]] and [[Radio Caroline]] but it failed to sell. A second single, \"A Winter's Tale\"&nbsp;/ \"One-Eyed Hound\", followed in May 1968 which also sold little.{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=25}} Three months later, Stewart left the group to continue with his studies.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}} He was replaced by fellow Charterhouse pupil [[John Silver (musician)|John Silver]].{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=19}}\n\nKing felt the group would achieve greater success with an album.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=19}} The result, ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'', was produced at Regent Sound in ten days during their school's summer break in August 1968.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|pp=21\u201322}} King assembled the tracks as a [[concept album]] which he produced, while Greenslade added further orchestral arrangements to the songs, something the band were not informed of until the album was released. Phillips was particularly upset about Greenslade's additions.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=20}} When Decca found an American band already named Genesis, King refused to change his group's name. He reached a compromise by removing their name from the album cover, resulting in a minimalist design with the album title printed on a plain black background.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=21}} When the album was released in March 1969 it became a commercial failure, because record shops put the album in the \"Religious\" section upon seeing the cover.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=348}} Banks recalled the album \"after a year or so, had sold 649 copies\".{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=52}} A third single, \"Where the Sour Turns to Sweet\"&nbsp;/ \"In Hiding\", was released in June 1969.{{sfn|Hewitt|2001|p=25}} None of the releases were commercially successful and led to the band's split with King and Decca.<ref name=\"fromgenesisto\">King, Jonathan. ''In the Beginning'', ''[[From Genesis to Revelation]]'' (sleeve notes). 1993 release.</ref> King continues to hold the rights to the album which has seen numerous reissues.

After his graduation in 1927, Morandi gained experience in [[Calabria]] working with reinforced concrete in earthquake-damaged areas. On his return to Rome to open his own office, he continued with his technical exploration of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures and embarked on the design of a series of novel cinema structures and bridges. His numerous later works include his work on the [[Leonardo da Vinci Airport|Fiumicino Airport (Rome)]] in 1970, and [[Pumarejo bridge|Pumarejo bridge (Colombia)]] in 1974.\n\nMorandi was appointed professor of bridge design both at the [[University of Florence]] and the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], became a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society of Arts|\"Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce\"]] (FRSA) in 1963,<ref>Riccardo Morandi was elected a Fellow of the Society on March 11th 1963.

She gained her power from being on the bus that was hit by dark matter when the Flash escapes the Speed Force due to the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]]'s plans and begins targeting collectors of Native American artifacts. She was defeated by Team Flash and remanded to Iron Heights Penitentiary.

He makes his first appearance in ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (vol. 2) #1 (July 2011). In the alternate timeline created by the events of Flashpoint, Blackout is recruited by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] into a team of superheroes whose mission was to end the Amazon-Atlantean war, which had devastated Europe and caused millions of human casualties. To that end, the team was assigned to take down both [[Aquaman|Emperor Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].\n\nAnother new recruit, the [[Outsider (comics)|Outsider]], revealed during a meeting with [[Batman]] that he had been hunting Blackout so he could use his abilities to power India. This manhunt resulted in the loss of Blackout's girlfriend and his departure from school. Blackout has since voiced his reluctance to be part of the same team with his worst enemy.\n\n====Blackout in other media====\n'''Farooq Gibran'''/Blackout appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by actor [[Michael Reventar]]. One time Farooq Gibran was out with friends when the [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] particle accelerator exploded and electrocuted him. He survives and later finds out he has the ability to siphon electrical energy. In the episode \"Power Outage\", he decides to take out revenge on [[Eobard Thawne|Harrison Wells]] for the particle accelerator's activation. He is confronted by the Flash and drains the speedster's speed. He later attacks S.T.A.R. Labs, kills Girder and attacks Wells. However, the Flash was able to get the speed back and kill him. Blackout was mentioned by Barry Allen in the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode \"[[Worlds Finest]]\".\n\n===Blackrock===\n'''Blackrock''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. Blackrock is a recurring enemy of [[Superman]] first appearing in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #458 (April 1976).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=32-33}}</ref>\n\nBlackrock was the creation of '''Dr. Peter Silverstone''' in an attempt to increase ratings for the United Broadcasting [[television network]]. Silverstone hypnotized UB President Sam Tanner and later Tanner's nephew, Les Vegas, to fill the role. A third Blackrock (an energy construct) was created by Tanner's command not much later.\n\nHowever, it is known that eventually Silverstone assumed the mantle of Blackrock himself, using a powerful stone that could metabolize electromagnetic energy into energy to achieve flight, energy blasts and superhuman strength, and fought Superman several times. This rock, while a technological artifact, has the appearance of a polished [[Gemstone|gem]] that is as black as [[coal]]. It was appropriately dubbed the Blackrock.\n\nThe Post-''Crisis'' version was stated (in ''Batman/Superman'' adventures) to be a symbiotic alien life form, rather than a creation of Dr. Silverstone. Its appearance and abilities are approximately the same.\n\nSilverstone is the only Pre-''Crisis'' user of the stone that has been mentioned in Post-''Crisis'' continuity. Overuse of the Blackrock's powers blinded Silverstone and left him insane. He was found sitting muttering to himself and watching constant television shows in an apartment owned by an ex-convict named '''Samuel Benjamin''', who beat Silverstone to death with the Blackrock and took it for himself. Despite its power, his inexperience with the Blackrock led to his defeat and Superman took the stone and threw it towards the Sun.<ref>''Superman'' #218 (August 2005)</ref>\n\nA short time later, [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]], disguised as [[Lex Luthor]], dispatched [[Bizarro]] to retrieve the Blackrock from the Sun<ref>''Superman'' #222 (December 2005)</ref> before passing it on to a South American woman named '''Lucia''',<ref>''Superman'' #223 (January 2006)</ref> a drug smuggler and revolutionary who had been jailed by Superman before. Her intense feelings of hatred towards the Man of Steel matched those of the Blackrock and she proved particularly adept in using it. However, her skills were not enough to defeat Superman and the Blackrock withdrew into itself.<ref>''Superman'' #224 (February 2006)</ref>\n\nIt was eventually shown that the Blackrock had been kept by Superman, who eventually locked it away in his Fortress of Solitude. The Blackrock eventually escaped and bonded with [[Plastic Man]]. Shortly after, the Blackrock was removed from Plastic Man and found its way into the hands of [[Batman]], who shortly afterwards decided he needed its powers to help him stop a currently-rampaging Superman (Superman had fallen under the influence of [[Despero]] as he attempted to turn Earth's alien heroes against humans). Although it remained on Batman after Superman threw off Despero's influence, Superman was able to force it to leave Batman by threatening to kill him, informing the Blackrock that he knew Batman would rather die than live like this.\n\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Blackrock is '''Bradley Glenn''', an ex-con who was hired to star in a [[reality television]] show called ''Badass Nation'' about the life of a supervillain.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #5 (April 2016)</ref> The TV company provided him with powered armor and a fictional backstory about finding it in a crashed spacecraft. They intended to film him tearing up a bridge that was scheduled for demolition, but the crew neglected to ensure that the bridge had been closed to traffic and the Pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' Superman had to intervene.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #6 (May 2016)</ref>\n\nThe Post-''Crisis'' wielders of the Blackrock seem to have developed differing powers based on their personalities. All seem to have possessed superhuman strength and endurance, flight and energy projection abilities. The Blackrock also has the ability to absorb ambient energy to empower its wielder. Dr. Silverstone seemed most adept at using its ability to process information from TV and radio signals. Samuel Benjamin was particularly skilled at using it to boost his own physical strength and toughness. Lucia's abilities seemed to be an amalgamation of her predecessors', but she seemed to prefer using its energy projection abilities and discovered a way to use it to drain Superman's power.\n\nWhile the stone had bonded to [[Plastic Man]], he was not shown using its abilities much.\n\n[[Batman]] used it in much the same way that Lucia did; however, Batman showed more of a preference for physical combat than Lucia did.\n\n[[Jimmy Olsen]] and several other humans were bonded to the Blackrocks when a shower of them rained down on Earth. These people showed some level of superhuman abilities similar to those demonstrated by Lucia, etc. but it was not shown if they were as strong as he was.\n\nBradley Glenn's armor enabled him to leap great distances and an energy field around one gauntlet gave him a powerful punch.\n\n===Blackwing===\n'''Blackwing''' ('''Charles \"Charlie\" Bullock''') is a fictional [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]]. He was created by Paul Levitz, Joe Staton and Joey Cavalieri.\n\nThe character was chronologically introduced in ''Adventure Comics'' #464 (April 1979), but was unnamed in that comic. He was, however, named in his next appearance in ''Wonder Woman'' #281 (April 1981) and later, became Blackwing in ''Wonder Woman'' #297 (August 1982). Also, worth to note, the original story in ''Adventure Comics'' was intended for ''All Star Comics'' #75. Charlie was drawn as a teen in that story, but his next appearance (only three years later) depicts him as a young adult who graduated from law school.\n\nIn his mid-teens, Charles Bullock was searching for a direction in life. The teenager found it after he helped fight off street punks alongside Wildcat (Ted Grant) and was invited to join him at his gym. Charlie attended law school and later became a junior partner and top-notch researcher to the law firm called Cranston, Grayson and Wayne. When a criminal named Karnage broke into the office looking for his boss, Arthur Cranston, this, and another event, led him to become the costumed hero Blackwing. Although his first outing as a crime fighter proved unsuccessful when he was captured by the costumed villain Boa's gang, Blackwing managed to contribute in freeing the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)]] from Boa's giant snake and recorded some evidence that was used to put the mastermind and his men away.\n\nSince then, Blackwing has never appeared again in any other published story.\n\n===Vera Black===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Vera Black\n|CBDBid = 2534\n}}\n'''Vera Black''' is a British psionic cyborg in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Doug Mahnke]], first appeared in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #100 (August 2004).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/208041/\n|title=JLA #100\n|publisher=The Grand Comics Database\n|accessdate=2012-05-29\n}}</ref> The storyline set up the limited series ''[[Justice League Elite]]'' which consisted of 12 issues published between 2004\u20132005.\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Vera Black is the sister of [[Manchester Black]]. As children their parents would often fight and Manchester would take her out to play to avoid them. As his idea of \"play\" became killing sprees, Vera's perspective became twisted.{{issue|date=May 2012}} When her brother dies after attempting to destroy [[Superman]], she has her ruined arms, lost in an untold childhood incident, replaced with cybernetic prostheses which can configure into any weapon she desires, initially contemplating revenge on Superman before she decides to be better than her brother.\n\nHer new abilities result in her leading the remnants of the [[The Elite (DC Comics)|Elite]] and tacitly working with the [[Justice League]]. This leads to the League, encouraged by the [[Wally West|Flash]], asking her to lead a new team with the intention that she will handle [[black ops]] missions that the League cannot due to what they represent to the public, primarily involving hunting down and eliminating metahuman threats before they go public. Starting with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Coldcast|Coldcast]] and [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Menagerie|Menagerie]], she adds Flash, [[Manitou Raven]], [[Major Disaster]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Cassandra Cain|Kasumi]] to the team. She also enlists [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Naif al-Sheikh|Naif al-Sheikh]] to keep the team in check and serve as a liaison to the governments of the world.\n\n====Equipment of Vera Black====\nVera's cybernetic arms have the capacity to transform into an almost unlimited variety of melee, projectile and beam weapons. They also incorporate camouflage technology relying on optics, as well as altering sense perception in others.\n\n====Vera Black in other media====\nVera Black appears in the direct-to-DVD animated feature ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]'', voiced by [[Marcella Lentz-Pope]] as an adult and by [[Tara Strong]] as a girl in a flashback sequence.\n\n===Block===\n'''Block''' is a young Maori woman living in Melbourne, Australia, the woman dubbed the '''Human Block''' was once inexplicably struck by lightning and survived the incident. Unknown to her, this similar event had happened to many other individuals throughout time and was in fact the Speed Force imbuing her with speed-related abilities. In her then-present time\u20141957\u2014Block acted as a side show attraction in a carnival, the prize of $1,000 going to whoever could move her, which was failed by many, as she had manipulated her body density. One drunken man staggered onto the stage to accept her challenge, making her move by insulting her Maori heritage rather than physically moving her. Angered, she immediately struck out at him and instigated a small brawl, tearing through the crowd before someone hastily drew their firearm on her and shot, only to find that not even bullets affected her. Before the now-turned mob could attack her, Zoom, accompanied by his newly recruited acolytes the Folded Man and Magali, appeared and teleported her outside of the carnival grounds. Being offered the chance to embrace her abilities and live as a godlike being after mastering them, she did not hesitate to join Zoom and his quest to kill the \"evil\" Flash. Along with the other Acolytes, she would train for what would be an unknown amount of time to kill the Flash, facing off with Zoom in his place. It is unknown how long this training took place, as they stated that, over the course of centuries, this team trained to take on the Flash and when they reached older age, Magali would revert them back to their original ages when joining. Unknown to Block, Zoom is actually the one to have orchestrated her joining him to begin with, appearing to the drunk man who challenged her, while convincing him that the way to make her move was to attack her heritage, as he had been keeping close watch on her for some time.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Block====\nBeing imbued with the Speed Force, Block has the unique ability to slow down her atoms. In doing this, they become denser than steel and grant her invulnerability, super-strength and immobility. She can possibly slow down other speedsters, if not other people as well, through physical touch, as she stopped the Top's ability to spin and was able to hold Zoom in place in a headlock. After training centuries with Zoom, she is a deadly fighter. Recently, she was able to stop the molecules around herself to make the air unbreakable.\n\n====Block in other media====\nBlock appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' season 5 episode \"Blocked\" portrayed by [[Erin Cummings]]. '''Vanessa Jansen''', nicknamed \"Block\" by [[Cisco Ramon]], was a [[metahuman]] weapons dealer working for the East Street Skulls gang. Vanessa Jansen worked as a weapons dealer for the East Street Skulls gang, but was betrayed. She was subsequently arrested and sent to [[Iron Heights]] for four years. Through unknown means, Jansen acquired metahuman powers, which allowed her to create boxes of dense air. When Jansen got out of Iron Heights, either by escape or release, she took revenge on Bobby Moretti and killed him with her metahuman powers. She then robbed Bobby's warehouse of guns, planning to sell them. However, the buyer turned out to be Bobby's older brother, Bruno Moretti. He attempted to kill her out of revenge for Bobby's death, only for Jansen to save herself with her powers. She then tried to save Bruno, but was stopped by [[XS (comics)|XS]], who saved him instead. XS then tried to capture her, but Jansen trapped her in a block of dense air, causing the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] to come out and confront her. Jansen threw XS into the air, forcing the Flash to save her, allowing Jansen to escape. Later, Jansen attempted to sell the weapons again, but was once again confronted by Bruni. Bruni arrived with backup, threatening to kill Jansen if she did not return the guns. They opened fire on her, but she shielded herself from the bullets using her powers. The Flash and XS took out the weapon dealers and confronted her again. The Flash repeatedly sped around as Jansen tried to hit him, eventually tiring her out. Jansen was able to trap him in a block while he was distracted and caused it to start shrinking. However, XS battled Jansen, tiring her out once again. XS then used the opportunity to put Jansen in power-dampening handcuffs. Suddenly, when Elongated Man and Vibe arrived to help arrest her, Cicada's dagger pierced through Jansen's chest. XS sped her to the hospital, but Jansen died of her injuries on the way there.\n\n===Billy Numerous===\n'''Billy Numerous''' (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]) was specifically created for the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series and did not have a previous appearance in the mainstream comics. However, he has since made the jump to these with his first appearance in the DC Universe in ''[[Catwoman]]'' #78 (April 2008), now known as '''Repro'''.\n\nBilly Numerous (real name '''William \"Billy\" Strayer''') is a former student of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy and an enemy of the [[Teen Titans]]. Numerous first appeared as a student of the H.I.V.E Academy, where his power of self-duplication was subtly hinted at. After the H.I.V.E. was destroyed during [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'s confrontation with [[Brother Blood]], Numerous and most of the other students went freelance. Later, Numerous engaged in a robbing spree all across Jump City and he stole anything he and his innumerable clones could get his (their) collective hands on. His power thoroughly confounded the Titans, especially Cyborg, who became all the more obsessed in catching him. Finally, however, Cyborg realized that there was another way of catching Numerous. He and the other Titans confronted Numerous in the old stadium where he had stashed his loot, seemingly with numerous copies of themselves. In order to bring them down, Numerous created even more clones of himself, but finally pushed his powers too far. The resulting reabsorption of each of his clones caused a massive physical and mental shock, stunning him and enabling his capture. To add insult to injury, the Titans' copies were not actual clones, but merely holographic projections created and controlled by Cyborg.\n\nAt some point, Numerous entered [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]]'s H.I.V.E. Five and was also recruited into the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. As one of the Five, he participated in the attempted capture of [[Kid Flash]], but even his numerous clones were unable to stop the super-speedster. Later, when the Brotherhood executed its worldwide strike against young superheroes, he and [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] were sent to capture Kole and Gnarrk in their subterranean retreat, but both heroes escaped them. When the remnants of the Titans under [[Beast Boy]] later attacked the Brotherhood's headquarters, Numerous and most of his H.I.V.E. Five teammates tried to run, but were intercepted by Kid Flash\u2014and aghast to see that Jinx had switched sides and joined up with him. Moments later, they were all swept away by one of Jinx's hexes and carted off by Kid Flash for flash-freeze treatment.\n \nIn ''[[Catwoman]]'' #78 (April 2008), a character based on Billy Numerous named '''Repro''' appears. The small-time crook known as Repro was operating in [[Gotham City]] during the time when many of the city's criminals disappeared for a short time. He was one of the only two criminals left in the city, with the other being the Thief. Repro was a young and inexperienced criminal who only did small-time criminal activities, just enough to stay off the radar of big-time crime fighters. After a confrontation with Catwoman where he thought he had shot her in the chest, he hastily departed and ran to the Thief to tell him about it. He was, in turn, shot in the chest and killed by the Thief, who then dumped his body in an alley to cover up the murder.\n\n====Billy Numerous in other media====\n* Billy Numerous appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' tie-in comics. He appears as a background villain and member of the H.I.V.E. Five in this comic adaptation of the animated television series. He engages in various petty crimes and attempts at one point to join a new iteration of the team being organised by Psimon and Dr. Light. He fails the test, along with dozens of other villains.\n* Billy Numerous appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' as a minor supporting villain in several episodes throughout the series, typically in association with other H.I.V.E. Five members.

He is generally used as comic relief.

The character was a throwback to the [[Adam West]] ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' TV series in that he was whimsical and made many condiment-based puns. Condiment King first appeared where he attacked a rooftop restaurant to rob it, only to end up fighting Batman. Chased by Batman to the balcony of the restaurant he robbed, he slipped on some ketchup and fell off the balcony, where he was rendered unconscious upon landing on the police car that [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] and [[Renee Montoya]] were in. They removed his mask, revealing him to be a stand-up comedian named '''Buddy Standler'''. Batman and Alfred Pennyworth watched the news, where it was mentioned that a hospitalized Buddy Standler had no memory of the restaurant attack and that the restaurant is suing the TV studio where Buddy Standler's TV show is broadcast for the damages that Condiment King did to the restaurant. Batman discovered that Buddy Standler was brainwashed by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (using the [[Mad Hatter (DC Comics)|Mad Hatter]]'s devices), whom he and fellow comedians Harry Loomis (who Joker brainwashed into being Pack Rat) and Lisa Lorraine (who Joker brainwashed into being Mighty Mom) had unwittingly spurned the previous year at a comedian contest. After Joker was apprehended, it can be assumed that Buddy Standler and the other brainwashed comedians were cleared of all charges.\n\n'''Mitchell Mayo''' is a criminal who operates as the Condiment King.

Damien uses a magical artifact to employ telekinesis and can also drain the life energy of his foes if he makes physical contact with them. The only exception to this is [[Thea Queen]], who causes his life-force absorption ability to backfire due to being revived by the [[Lazarus Pit]]. Although a ruthless killer, when the Green Arrow saves his family from [[Anarky]], Damien allows [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] to leave, despite having a chance to kill him, out of appreciation for the actions. Damien's artifact is eventually destroyed by Vixen and he is prosecuted and sent to Iron Heights Penitentiary. But, after recruiting the [[Malcolm Merlyn|Dark Archer]], [[Brick (comics)|Brick]] and [[Murmur (DC Comics)|Murmur]], he eventually breaks out and murders the [[Black Canary|Black Canary (Laurel Lance)]]. After [[Anarky]] kills his wife and destroys the secret underground city in which Damien planned to survive the [[nuclear holocaust]] he wanted to cause, he becomes nihilistic and decides to destroy the world anyway. But, with help from [[Michael Holt (comics)|Mr. Terrific]] and the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], Oliver's allies succeed in disabling all but one of the nuclear bombs (a city is destroyed by the successful nuke). Meanwhile, the Green Arrow leads the people of Star City in a rally against Damien and his army, with the outpour of hope nullifying Damien's powers. The two engage in a physical fight with Oliver overpowering him. Defeated, Damien taunts the Green Arrow, stating Oliver spared [[Slade Wilson]] after killing Oliver's mother. Oliver reminds him that he killed tens of thousands of innocent people, including Laurel, and states not having a choice before stabbing him with an arrow, killing him.

Damien returns in season two as a recurring character, one of the two secondary antagonists alongside Malcolm Merlyn and a member of the [[Legion of Doom]]. He also serves as an archenemy to [[Sara Lance]], Laurel Lance's sister and the Legends' leader. Although initially hesitant to work with [[Eobard Thawne]], he quickly joins forces upon learning of his future death and the failure of his plans from Sara. Together with Eobard, his future/former accomplice the Dark Archer and the rest of the Legion of Doom, he works to find the fabled [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] in order to change his fate. After they succeed, Damien makes himself mayor of Star City and regains his magical artifact. However, the Legends manage to travel back in time to stop the Legion's success. Eobard also travels back to warn the past Legion, so Damien sets out with the Legion to stop the Legends in a final battle. Using swords and a futuristic gun courtesy of Eobard, Damien eventually kills the future counterpart of [[Citizen Steel]] before engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Sara. Sara manages to overpower him and knock him out. After the Legion is defeated, the Legends return each member of the Legion to their respective place in the timeline and wipe their memories of time travel, so Damien ends up dying in 2016 as before. In season three, Damien is the secondary antagonist and is resurrected from his death by his time-displaced daughter Nora Darhk with his memories restored and resumes his feud with Sara, the Legends and their allies. He later encounters [[Gorilla Grodd]] upon saving him from the napalm bombing during the [[Vietnam War]] and claims to have time traveling technology that will let Grodd time travel at will. It is revealed that his alliance with Mallus is intended to ensure Mallus' release from his prison dimension by causing temporal aberrations that will weaken it, but this effort is complicated when tension arises between Damien and his daughter over their differing approaches to their relationship. Damien, after being convinced by Steel and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] that his daughter will cease to exist if Mallus is set free, decides to help the Legends stop Mallus from taking Nora's body, but ends up taking Nora's place and is killed by Mallus in the season three finale. In season five, Astra Logue grants Damien a second chance at life. He was supposed cause misery, but instead went to go see Nora. She had to hide the fact of her current status by stating that Constantine is her husband and that Sara and Ava are now her henchmen. Everything unraveled when the ring that Ray placed in a chocolate mousse.

During a break-in, Dex-Starr scratched the burglar before his owner was killed and he was evicted by the police. Homeless, he was grabbed by two street thugs and thrown off the Brooklyn Bridge, but the rage that he felt caught the attention of a [[Power ring (DC Comics)#Red|red power ring]] and it came to him before he hit the water. As a member of the [[Red Lantern Corps]], wearing his red power ring around his tail, he killed the two thugs and slept on their skulls, proclaiming himself to be a \"good kitty\" using thoughts expressed in simple sentences. He was described by [[Geoff Johns]] in an interview with ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' as \"the most sadistic and malicious\" of the Red Lanterns. Originally intended as a joke by Shane Davis, he began being featured more prominently due to positive reception. Dex-Starr frequently travels with Atrocitus, with his vengeful quest centering on finding the burglar that murdered his owner. Dex-Starr gained the ability to create constructs after drinking the blood of Rankorr and, unbeknownst to his fellow Red Lanterns, he used his newfound ability to save [[Atrocitus]] from certain death after the former leader of the Red Lanterns saw his red power ring being taken by [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=89}}</ref>\n\n====Dex-Starr in other media====\n* Dex-Starr appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''.

Operating from London, England, Dodger will steal and/or sell anything from information to advanced technology.\n\nAt one point he came into possession of what appeared to be an alien spacecraft. Recognizing that the vehicle's stealth capabilities made it a lucrative commodity, he began leasing the vessel to various underworld figures, including the [[League of Assassins]]. When the vessel in question was linked to an assassination attempt against [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], the [[Green Arrow]] and the [[Black Canary]] began investigating its activity. The trail led them to London where they (along with [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Mia \"Speedy\" Dearden]]) engaged in combat with Dodger at a local pub. Although Dodger proved to be an able-bodied physical combatant, \"Team Arrow\" subdued him and he told them about the League of Assassins.\n\nWhen pressed for more information, Dodger was unwilling to cooperate, so the Green Arrow and the Black Canary dropped him from the belly of a cargo plane suspended by a bungee cord until he agreed to give them better intelligence. He took them to his secret lair and triangulated the last location of the stealth ship he had leased.\n\nThe Green Arrow and the Black Canary then persuaded him to accompany them on the search, which brought them to a castle in Leichestershire, England. They evaded several traps and finally discovered a cryogenics tube containing the compressed form of former Justice Leaguer [[Plastic Man]].\n\nDodger continued to work alongside \"Team Arrow\" and fought a team of metahumans who claimed to represent the League of Assassins. Dodger contributed very little to the battle; however, he did manage to distract one of them long enough for [[Batman]] to subdue him. Dodger continued adventuring with the group, battled foes and completed the adventure along with the team.\n\nAfter settling their business with the League of Assassins, Dodger accompanied \"Team Arrow\" back to the United States, where he struck up a romantic relationship with Mia Dearden. Mia has now left the States and traveled to London to continue this relationship.\n\n====Dodger in other media====\nDodger appears in the TV series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' portrayed by [[James Callis]]. Appearing in the 15th episode \"Dodger,\" he is a British jewel thief who robs valuable jewels from wealthy occupants and sells them at a high price. Unlike the comics, this iteration of the character uses hostages with bomb collars to steal for him, rather than alien technology. He also uses a high voltage stun-stick as a weapon, which renders victims unconscious. His real name is '''Winnick Norton''', a reference to the original creators of the character, [[Judd Winick]] and [[Mike Norton]]. He is defeated by Oliver and John Diggle when he is taken out with his own \"shocker\" after Oliver causes his car to crash, using an arrow as a dagger, and is arrested by a SCPD unit afterwards. In the ''Arrow: Season 2.5'' tie-in comic, Norton escapes from prison and begins operating out of Bludhaven as part of a mercenary group called the Renegades. He and other members kidnap [[Felicity Smoak]] on the orders of [[Brother Blood|Clinton Hogue]], reminiscent how he kidnapped her earlier in \"Dodger\". Norton and other members are defeated by Oliver Queen, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] and [[Huntress (comics)|Helena Bertinelli]], leaving them bound and tipping off the police so they could arrest them.\n\n===Dominus===\n{{For|the [[Marvel Comics]] villain|Dominus (Marvel Comics)}}\n'''Dominus''' is a [[fictional character]] and a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] who first appeared in ''Action Comics'' #747.

During this time, he fell in love with his peer, Ahti. However, he was driven mad by jealousy when Ahti ascended past him and assumed the mantle of Kismet, Illuminator of All Realities.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nStudying infernal forbidden magic in an attempt to gain the power to challenge his former lover and rob her of the power of Kismet, Tuoni's assault was reflected by Kismet's divine energies and his body was incinerated. Despite Tuoni's deceit, the [[omnibenevolent]] Kismet showed him mercy and shunted his shattered, still-living body into the [[Phantom Zone]].<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nWithin the [[Phantom Zone]], Tuoni encountered a holographic projection of [[Superman]]'s long-dead [[Kryptonian]] ancestor, Kem-L, who was able to use his own ancient variety of [[arcane]] [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] science to rebuild the former holy man as a [[psionic]], cosmic phantasm known as \"Dominus\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=75-76}}</ref>\n\nIn this new all-powerful form, Dominus escaped the Zone via Superman's [[Fortress of Solitude]] and attacked [[Earth]]. Attempting to find Kismet to steal her cosmic powers, he was opposed by Superman. Swearing vengeance, Dominus [[telepathy|telepathically]] entered Superman's mind and preyed on one of the Man of Steel's greatest weaknesses; his fear of failing the people of [[Earth]].\n\nUsing [[mind control]], Dominus convinced Superman to take control of Earth and build the [[Superman robots]] to police the planet 24 hours a day, seven days a week forever. In another battle, Dominus used his reality-warping powers to become Superman, using the Superman robots to search for Kismet while Superman was disguised as one of his own robots and later as Dominus.\n\nDuring his captivity in these other forms Superman improved on his use of ''Torquasm Vo'', an ancient Kryptonian warrior discipline technique where the warrior can control what they think. Superman and Dominus then engaged in a mental-physical battle with Dominus using any stray thought of Superman to reshape reality. The battle ends with Superman banishing Dominus to the [[Phantom Zone]].\n\nDominus uses his \"Continuum Control\" to alter reality and his \"Control\" to make people unaware that the change occurred. He can actually create more than one simultaneous reality, each one attacking a specific character's mental attributes. Dominus' realities were also inspired by other times in Superman's publishing history (the 1940s, 1960s and 1970s) and \"The Superman of 2965\u20132966\" story involving Muto.<ref>''Superman'' #181 (Nov. 1965)</ref><ref>''Action Comics'' #338\u2013339 (June\u2013July 1966)</ref>\n\n====Dominus behind the scenes====\nIn a 1981 DC Treasury Special called ''Superman and his Fortress of Solitude'', the Pre-''Crisis'' [[Lex Luthor]] posed as a red-armored alien named Dominus as part of an elaborate ruse aimed at destroying the Man of Steel.\n\n===Dreadnought===\nThe '''Dreadnought''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]] appearing in ''[[The New 52]]'' continuity. He serves as an agent of the [[H.I.V.E.]], along with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Psiphon|Psiphon]]. He appears in ''Superboy'' (vol. 4) #20, where he is sent by the H.I.V.E. to [[New York City]] to apprehend [[Doctor Psycho]], who had escaped from a H.I.V.E. facility, and [[Superboy]], whose psionic powers were of interest to the H.I.V.E. The two characters teamed up and managed to defeat the H.I.V.E. soldiers. The Dreadnought was sent flying by Superboy and landed in the [[Hudson River]].\n\nThe Dreadnought has undergone genetic modifications by the H.I.V.E. that mutated him into a giant purple humanoid beast with metallic armor and large black horns protruding from his head. He has superhuman strength and durability, which enables him to hold his own against even Superboy.\n\n===Carl Draper===\n'''Carl Draper''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]], an enemy of [[Superman]]. He has gone by the names the '''Master Jailer''', '''Kator''', '''Deathtrap''', the '''Locksmith''' and '''Castellan'''. Draper made his first appearance in ''Superman'' #331 (Jan. 1979), written by [[Martin Pasko]] and drawn by [[Curt Swan]] and [[Frank Chiaramonte]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.supermanartists.comics.org/superwhoswho/Superframe.htm |title=supermanwho |publisher=Supermanartists.comics.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232751/http://www.supermanartists.comics.org/superwhoswho/Superframe.htm |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the Pre-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]]'' comics, '''Carl \"Moosie\" Draper''' grew up in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] (see ''Kator'' below). Draper was an overweight clumsy teenager whom most of the other kids never noticed or made fun of and was in love with [[Lana Lang]], who had eyes only for [[Superboy]], much to Draper's resentment. As an adult, Draper underwent a self-imposed self-improvement regimen, including exercise and cosmetic surgery, to overcome his physical shortcomings. He became an expert locksmith and architect, designing an inescapable prison for supervillains called \"Mount Olympus\". Impressed by the achievement, Superman augmented the prison's security by placing it on an antigravity platform. Initially dubbed \"Draper's Island\" by Superman, it was informally renamed \"Superman Island\" by the adult Lana\u2014with whom Draper remained smitten, just as she remained lovestruck by Superman. It was the latter name, plus the novelty of the floating platform, that caught public attention, diverting recognition from Draper himself. This proved the final straw for Draper, who snapped and became the costumed supervillain the '''Master Jailer'''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=238-239}}</ref> He attacked Superman and kidnapped Lana under that name.

Kator, however, developed an [[artificial intelligence]] and almost killed the Boy of Steel before being destroyed (in ''New Adventures of Superboy'' #18). However, the robot apparently gave Draper its identity and powers before being destroyed. Draper (as the new Kator) then engages Superboy in combat. However, Jonathan Kent presses the safety switch on the \"cutoff\" device, which removes \"Kator's\" superpowers from Draper, and Superboy removes the memory of Draper ever being Kator.<ref>{{cite web|author=DarkMark |url=http://darkmark6.tripod.com/superboyind3.htm |title=Superboy index, part 3 |publisher=Darkmark6.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://obscure.dcuguide.com/m.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520042837/http://obscure.dcuguide.com/m.htm |archivedate=2006-05-20 }}</ref>\n\nIn the Post-''Crisis'' comics, Carl Draper first appeared in ''Adventures of Superman'' #517 (Nov. 1994). This was during the \"Dead Again\" storyline, when Superman was suspected of being an impostor after his body was found still in his tomb (from ''[[The Death of Superman]]'' storyline). Draper was hired by [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to design a holding cell for [[Conduit (comics)|Conduit]], when his daughter, Carla, asked him if he could build a prison that could hold even Superman. Draper initially designed a trap that only the real Superman could escape from, explaining this to Superman by way of a hologram of a costumed figure named '''Deathtrap'''. However, when Superman escaped the trap, Draper became obsessed with proving that he ''could'' capture the real thing. Of note, this version of Draper was dressed in casual wear, only getting an updated costume with chain-based attacks later.\n\nDraper made several other attempts to capture Superman, often programming the Deathtrap hologram in advance so he could publicly be elsewhere. On one occasion, in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #43 (April 1995), he programmed Deathtrap to appear during a Draper Security press conference and display how Draper's devices were being \"subverted\", thus both removing suspicion from him and acting as an advertisement for the company.\n\nIn ''Action Comics'' #739, Superman (in his blue energy form) was captured in an \"energy hobble\" by Deathtrap, now calling himself the '''Locksmith'''. At the end of the story, it was revealed to the reader that his daughter, Carla Draper, was running the hologram this time and that her father was unaware of this. The now costumed-Master Jailer was one of the villains along with [[Neutron (comics)|Neutron]] controlled by [[Manchester Black]] in the 2002 storyline \"Ending Battle\"; however, it was not clear that it was, in fact, Draper.\n\nCarl Draper appears in ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' #17 (Oct. 2007). At some point, Checkmate discovered his multiple identities and used this to force him into becoming a security consultant, protecting Checkmate itself from attack. In the issue, he prevents numerous assaults on Checkmate headquarters and is promoted to head of security with the title '''Castellan'''. Although he has not told his superiors, he strongly suspects that Carla is involved in the attacks.

[[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]]. An enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], Adeline makes her first appearance in ''New Teen Titans'' #34 (August 1983). She was brought up as a wealthy jet-setting playgirl, despite being trained by a father who had worked with Chinese guerrilla forces. But, after a traumatic first marriage at 19, she joined the U.S. military, where she met, trained, and married Slade Wilson. After Slade left the military, Slade and Adeline took up the socialite lifestyle Adeline had been raised into.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, Slade was using his hunting trips to gain clients for his mercenary side job, which resulted in the kidnapping and near-death of their younger son, [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph]]. Enraged and betrayed by Slade's prioritization of Deathstroke's honor code over their son's well-being, Adeline shot her husband and, when he survived, served him with divorce papers.\n\nGrant, who had idolized his father, rebelled against his mother and ran away to New York, where he ran into the Titans and ended up dying due to his alliance with the H.I.V.E. Slade vowed to pick up his dead son's contract against the Teen Titans; Adeline promptly interfered; she blamed Slade for Grant's death. Due to Adeline's intervention, Joseph, who had been working with her, joined the Titans as Jericho.\n\nJoseph eventually became possessed by the spirits of Azarath. Begging his father to kill him in order to prevent the corrupted spirits from achieving their purpose, Adeline's only remaining son died at her husband's hand. Adeline found this out from one of her Searchers Inc. agents, rather than from Slade himself, which merely cemented her long-held grudge against her ex-husband.\n\nSlade, however, held no grudge against her, keeping an eye out for her safety and attempting to aid her when he thought he could get away with it; e.g., when Adeline had been abducted by her first husband Morel, a.k.a. Count Tavolera, who had poisoned her in an attempt to force her to work with him to discover her ancestor Josiah Kane's treasure.\n\nTo save Adeline's life, Slade gave her some of his own serum-altered blood. This ended up driving her crazy; Slade's genotype had a unique mutation which enabled him to effectively metabolize his serum. Other less fortunate people either died or went insane.\n\nFor a time, Adeline went underground, slowly losing more and more of her normal cognitive abilities, though none of her tactical skills. She eventually turned herself into the H.I.V.E. Mistress, in her madness focusing on superheroes as the reason for her sons' death and creating a plan to kill all the superheroes that she could.\n\nHer plot ultimately resulted in her death. [[Vandal Savage]] put a team together to take advantage of Adeline's plan, intending to take her immortal blood to create a sort of Fountain of Youth potion. With her throat cut, unable to die and yet unable to fully heal, Adeline regained her sanity briefly and pleaded with Slade (who had learned of her involvement and arrived to try and save her) to kill her and reunite her with their children. However, because he still had feelings for her no matter what she had done, he was unable to comply with her request, so [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] killed her instead.\n\n====Adeline Kane in other media====\nAdeline makes her live-action debut in the second season of ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'' portrayed by [[Mayko Nguyen]].\n\n===Kilg%re===\n*Creators: [[Mike Baron]] and Jackson Guice\n*First appearance: ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #3 (August 1987)\n\n'''Kilg%re''' was an electro-mechano-organic intelligence that needed electro-life to survive. It consumed its entire home planet in the Pleides sector and then moved on into space. It was attacked by something known as Meta#sker and placed into a vibrational limbo. Somehow, it found its way to the flats near Salt Lake City on Earth. It could only be seen by people traveling at high speeds, such as an F-15 pilot or the Flash. The Flash unknowingly released it from the limbo it was imprisoned in and it followed him to S.T.A.R. Labs and took over its electrical systems. Kilg%re found the number of machines on Earth ideal for its survival, but humans it deemed distractions and planned to destroy them. It delivered an ultimatum: abandon North America by 12:00 noon on May 10 or be destroyed. During a battle with the Flash in Salt Lake City, it turned out all the power in the country. The Flash sought the help of Cyborg, who used the Titans' satellite to relay the message to the governments of the world to shut down all power in order to kill Kilg%re. This scared it out of the power grid and it weaved a giant mechanical snake across the Utah flats, trying to complete a circuit by catching up with the cloned body of S.T.A.R. Labs' Dr. Schmitz in order to survive. However, the Flash outraced it, supposedly killing it. After Kilg%re's defeat at the hands of the Flash he appeared to be destroyed, but resurfaced in the form of a sentient computer mind hidden in a self-created computer operating system in a deep cave. When [[Maxwell Lord]] was spelunking one day, his then-president had fallen deep into the cave where Kilg%re lay dormant. Sensing a human life, Kilg%re decided to help coax Max into further succeeding his own plans, as well as Max's subconscious plans of self-actualization. To do this, Kilg%re decided to help Max start the new Justice League and grow the group into becoming more international. Kilg%re served in a behind-the-scenes role, constantly coaxing and manipulating Max into furthering his plans, such as gaining money, power and cutting-edge technology to give Kilg%re a stronger machine to inhabit. Through such advantages, Kilg%re and Max were able to create a better duplicate of the Justice League signal device, begin a recruitment drive and find willing villains, gaining additional muscle such as Booster Gold and a new Ace android. Kilg%re grew impatient and decided to start using bigger ideas, such as inciting an international incident to distract Justice League International. To do this, he found hidden technologies designed as a monitoring device by Metron. He launched the satellite, which was only defeated by Mister Miracle because he was used to New God technology. A serious mishap occurred during the Millenium event, in which the Manhunters took over the bodies of those they deemed were close enough to major figures to do damage. One of these Manhunters took over the body of the secretary of Max and, when she delivered coffee to him, she shot him four times. Rushing to Max's safety, Kilg%re promptly eliminated the threat by combining some of his technology with Max in order to save his life and kill the Manhunter. Max eventually learned of Kilg%re's tampering when half of Kilg%re was destroyed by the construct falling through the building that housed Kilg%re. In Kilg%re's fleeting moments, he threw another series of visions designed to tamper with Max's thoughts and implant Kilg%re into another larger system. Max refused and destroyed what was left of Kilg%re's last computing body. Doing so removed the cyborg self-repairing systems in Max's body, which landed him in the hospital. Kilg%re, however, was not completely destroyed.\n\nKilg%re appeared in ''[[DC Rebirth]]''{{'}}s ''[[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'' #01, 02 and 18 and ''The Flash/[[Speed Buggy]] Special'' #1.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Kilg%re====\nKilg%re has a robot body, electrokinesis, electronic interaction, electronic disruption, electronic constructs, and superhuman speed.\n\n====Kilg%re in other media====\n* A different depiction of Kilg%re appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[Dominic Burgess]].

Ramsey was one of the 12 passengers on the bus which was hit by dark matter when the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash/Barry Allen]] escaped the Speed Force, becoming a metahuman who can control and manipulate technology. In the episode \"Mixed Signals\", Ramsey, taking the name \"Kilg%re\", used his powers to take revenge on his former teammates, killing one and nearly doing the same to the others, until he was stopped by Team Flash and remanded to Iron Heights. In the episode \"True Colors\", Kilg%re is among the metahuman inmates at Iron Heights Penitentiary that Warden Wolfe planned to sell to Blacksmith. When Warden Wolfe outs Barry's true identity to Blacksmith, [[Dwarfstar]], [[Hazard (DC Comics)|Hazard]], Kilg%re, and [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Black Bison|Black Bison]], they prepare to attack, only for the Thinker to arrive and absorb the powers of the four metahumans while killing them.\n* Kilg%re appears in the tie-in comic ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' #28.\n* Kilg%re appears in the tie-in comic ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'' #14.\n\n===King Cobra===\nThere have been at least two different characters named the '''King Cobra''' in [[DC Comics]].\n\n====Batman villain====\nThe King Cobra is a mob boss in Gotham City who wears a green snake costume.

He is featured in the \"Initiation\" DLC challenge map. Before he becomes Batman, Bruce Wayne approaches his dojo in the mountains of North Korea and asks Kirigi to train him. Kirigi lets him train with him and his students for a while out of pity and later tests him to see if he is worthy. Depending on how the player operates Bruce Wayne during this performance, there are three different endings after Bruce Wayne defeats [[Lady Shiva]]. If the player completes the challenge map with less than nine medals, Kirigi states that Bruce is the best foreigner that he has trained, yet he does not say much. Kirigi then sends Bruce to find a bucket and broom in order to clean the latrines. If the player completes the challenge map with nine or more medals, Kirigi is impressed with Bruce's progress, yet states that he still has a lot to learn. For the time being, Kirigi then sends Bruce to find a rag in order to clean the floors. If the player completes the challenge map with all 15 medals, Kirigi states to Bruce that he is impressed and, at the same time, also states that he is rarely impressed. Upon telling Bruce that he has gained his dojo's respect and proven himself worthy, Kirigi states that he will be given the information that he seeks. Bruce is sent to the kitchen by Kirigi to prepare tea for him and all of Kirigi's students, where there is much to discuss.\n\n===Komodo===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Komodo\n|CBDBid =\n|GCDid = Simon+Lacroix\n}}\n'''Komodo''' ('''Simon Lacroix''') first appears in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' (vol. 5) #17 (April 2013).<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #17 (April 2013)</ref> He was created by writer [[Jeff Lemire]] and artist [[Andrea Sorrentino]].

Lionel hired a nurse named Rachel Dunleavy to assist her. Rachel and Lionel subsequently had an affair, resulting in the birth of Lionel's illegitimate son, Lucas. It is unclear whether Lillian knew of the affair or the child.\n\nLillian was helped by a nanny, Pamela Jenkins, who Alexander regarded as a second mother. Lionel was often absent from home and Lillian insisted that he take Alexander on one of his business trips to Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. Lionel's resulting shame and constant critique of Alexander bothered Lillian greatly.\n\nSometime in the early 1990s, Lionel insisted that they have another child, an idea that Lillian was highly opposed to, presumably because of her poor health. However, when Alexander was 11, Lillian became pregnant again. She insisted that Alexander be allowed to come home for school from Excelsior Academy and Lionel complied. Her pregnancy was strenuous and Lillian was bedridden for much of it. On Alexander's disastrous 12th birthday (which no one attended), Lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of St. George, which he kept into adulthood and later gave to Clark Kent.\n\nAfter baby Julian's birth, Lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression, refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually. One evening, Lionel sent the baby's nanny home and insisted that Lillian bond with the child. Lillian expressed her concern that Lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce, a threat that she had apparently made many times and that Lionel had called \"tiresome\".\n\nOn returning home from work one night, Lionel discovered Alexander in the baby's nursery. Alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing Julian while trying to stop him from crying. Lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck Alexander. Their relationship never recovered, even after he became an adult. It was not until years later, after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories, that he remembered that Lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions, hoping to spare him from Lionel's maltreatment. Alexander took the blame, correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir, although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife.\n\nSometime before her death Lillian, along with Lex and Lionel, went to a ranch in Montana to spend time together. During that time, a snake spooked Lillian's horse, prompting Lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better.\n\nAfter Julian's death, Lillian's health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when Alexander was 13. He later confessed to Clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her. Lex also told Lana Lang that he was away at boarding school when Lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school.\n\nLillian left her shares of LuthorCorp to her son and Pamela.\n\nLillian's death was extremely influential in the adult Lex's life. He had visions of his mother on many occasions. When Lex was shot and ended up in a coma, he had a near-death experience. In it, Lillian visited him and showed Lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from Lionel and LuthorCorp. However, at the end of the vision, Lana (his dream wife) suffered complications during childbirth. Because of Lex's lack of resources and estrangement from his father, he was unable to transfer Lana to a better facility and she died: this led Lex to believe that Lana died because he lacked enough money and power: with these, everything else in life could be secured. As a result, Lex ignored his mother's warning and continued his lifestyle of deceit and corruption. After realizing this, Lillian was seen in the reflection of a hospital window crying over her son's choice.\n\nWhen Lex was injected with the Limbo drug, which placed its users in a state of \"clinical death\", he met Lillian again, who told him that she was angry with him for ignoring her advice.\n\nWhen Lex was shot and went into a coma, Clark Kent and Lionel used a machine that allowed Clark to enter Lex's mind in order to find Lois Lane and Kara Kent. In Lex's mind, Clark met a young version of Lex and the two hid from a psychotic and murderous adult Lex. In the memory featuring Lillian snooping in Lionel's briefcase, Clark witnessed Lionel's verbal and physical abuse of both Lex and Lillian, as well as watched Lex try to help his mother up, but Lillian uncharacteristically told him that he had done enough and walked away from him.\n\n====Lillian Luthor in comics====\nIn DC Comics, Lex Luthor's mother is named '''Arlene Luthor'''. In later incarnations, her name was changed to '''\"Leticia\"''' even though she remained unnamed in most of her appearances.\n\n====Lillian Luthor in other media====\nLillian Luthor (known as '''the Doctor''') appears in ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Brenda Strong]]. Dr. Lillian Luthor is a scientist, the leader of [[Project Cadmus]], the wife of the late Lionel Luthor, the mother of [[Lex Luthor]] and the adoptive mother of [[Lena Luthor]].\n\n===Lunkhead===\nLunkhead is an enemy of [[Batman]] who became an inmate at [[Arkham Asylum]]. Lunkhead was clearly stupid, but exhibited massive strength; he made an enemy of [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Arnold Wesker]] when he smashed Wesker's companion \"Scarface\". He was sacrificed to the devil by a pack of demons, along with many others, when the Ventriloquist threw his voice to make it seem as though Lunkhead was volunteering to be thrown into the fiery pit with the rest of the damned.\n\n====Lunkhead in other media====\n* Lunkhead appears in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', voiced by [[JB Blanc]]. He is a reformed criminal who was beaten into a coma for two months by Batman. He was part of a therapy program in [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] alongside Margaret Sorrow. Lunkhead was released and has been a reformed criminal. Lieutenant [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] asks him about Margaret, bribing him with chocolate.\n* Lunkhead appears in the ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' episode \"A Dark Knight: One of My Three Soups\", portrayed by Hank Strong. This version is an African-American [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] and had known Jerome Valeska's uncle Zachary Trumble. When he showed up to assist Zachary, Jerome spilled some soup on him. Upon Bruce Wayne arriving, he fought against Lunkhead and defeated him.\n\n==M==\n===Matches Malone===\n{{Comics character list header\n| debut = ''Batman'' #242\n| debutmo = June\n| debutyr = 1972\n| creators = [[Dennis O'Neil]], [[Irv Novick]], [[Dick Giordano]]\n| name = Matches Malone\n| CBDBid = 9795\n| GCDid = Matches+Malone\n}}\n'''Matches Malone''' was originally a Gotham gang boss who [[Batman]] attempted to recruit to help him take down [[Ra's al Ghul]]. When he was accidentally killed by a ricocheting bullet that was meant for Batman, Batman began to impersonate him to use his underworld contacts and to fool Ra's.\n\nPost-''Crisis'', he was a relatively small-time arsonist with his brother Carver and who came to [[Gotham City]] early on in [[Batman]]'s career, attracting Batman's attention when Carver was apparently murdered. Although Matches was the prime suspect, there was no concrete evidence to make the charges stick and Matches was released, only for Batman to subsequently find what appeared to be Matches' dead body in another fire, apparently a suicide. However, Batman never reported the death; at the time, he had been attempting to establish a criminal alias for himself to help him gather information, but the exclusive nature of the criminal sects meant that no one would recruit someone that they had not heard of, prompting him to adopt Matches' identity and use it for his own.\n\nHowever, years later, Batman learned the truth about what had happened. Carver's death had actually been a suicide prompted by his guilt over a fire that he and Matches had started that resulted in the death of a homeless man resting in the building they had torched, with Matches making the body look like a murder victim because he was ashamed of his brother's suicide. Subsequently, deciding to escape Batman stalking him for the crime, Matches used the body of their earlier victim to fake his own death, with Batman being so eager to establish his criminal alias that he never took the time to definitively confirm the body's identity. After operating underground for years by committing low-end robberies, Matches returned to Gotham after hearing reports of 'his' activities, only to be shot by [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Scarface]] for 'his' recent betrayal, surviving long enough to simply confess his role in events to Batman and [[Nightwing]] before dying, with his last request being that Batman bury him next to his brother Carver.\n\nHaving destroyed Scarface in 'revenge' for Matches' death, Batman commented to Nightwing later on that he continued using the Matches identity because, in the years he had spent playing Matches, he had come to recognize that Matches was not an evil man, but had done some bad things that he never had the chance to make up for, regarding his use of Matches' name as a chance to give Matches some absolution.\n\nThe \"Matches Malone\" identity indirectly caused the events of ''[[Batman: War Games]]''; after she was fired as Robin, [[Stephanie Brown (character)|Stephanie Brown]] attempted to implement an old plan of Batman's that would allow him to take control of the city's criminal organisations, hoping that this would impress Batman enough to convince him to take her back. Unfortunately, she was unaware that Batman's agent who was meant to take control of the meeting, Matches Malone, was actually Batman himself, resulting in tensions between the crime families flaring up and most of them being killed in the subsequent stand-off, leading into the subsequent gang wars and Stephanie's own apparent death.\n\nIn ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' comic book series, Batman uses the Matches Malone guise against the False Face Society and a backstory reveals Malone was a low-level enforcer for [[Rupert Thorne]] who agreed to become a snitch for Batman and [[Commissioner Gordon]] against Thorne. But, when Malone began skimming cash from Thorne, he was shot to death by \"two Chicago triggers\" who go by the monikers Dapper (for always dressing well) and Cricket (for his short wiry build). Upon finding the dying Malone and being told that his killers went to a well-known Chinese restaurant, Batman removed his glasses\u2014and was shocked by what Malone looked like. Batman took Malone's guise, defeated the two hitmen and sent them to prison, and has used the guise ever since.\n\n====Matches Malone in other media====\n* The character, renamed '''Matthew \"Matches\" Malone''', is used in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' as an alias by [[Batman]] (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]). In the episode \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\", Batman uses the name variation during a trip to the past with the [[Phantom Stranger]] to see [[Thomas Wayne]] and [[Martha Wayne]] years before their deaths and unaware that Malone is their grown son. In the episode \"The Mask of Matches Malone!\", Batman gets amnesia while in his Matches Malone persona and believes himself to actually be a gangster.\n* The character appears, renamed '''Patrick \"Matches\" Malone''', in the live-action ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' TV series, portrayed by Danny Schoch in his first masked appearance and by [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] in the second appearance. This version is a philosophical hitman-for-hire who is one of Gotham City's deadliest murderers and was an old partner of [[Mutants (DC Comics)|Mutants]] leader Terence \"Cupcake\" Shaw. He is the masked man in shiny shoes who killed Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne in front of Bruce Wayne and [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] (who was watching from the highest part of the fire escape), taking [[Joe Chill]]'s place in the comics and most adaptations. This has led Detective [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] into finding him in order to bring to justice. [[Silver St. Cloud]] revealed the killer's identity to be Patrick. When Bruce finally confronts Patrick, Patrick stated that he was tired of doing bad things, while barely recalling if he killed Bruce's parents and Bruce decides not to kill Patrick. Using the gun that Bruce left behind, Patrick committed suicide by the time Gordon caught up with Bruce. Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] were left wondering who could have hired Malone to kill Thomas and Martha (which was eventually revealed to be [[Hugo Strange]]).\n\n===Menagerie===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image=\n| caption=Sonja shapeshifting, art by [[Doug Mahnke]]\n| character_name=Menagerie\n| real_name=Pamela<br>Sonja\n| publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n| debut='''Pamela:''' ''Action Comics'' #[[What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?|775]] (March 2001)<br>'''Sonja:''' ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #100 (August 2004)\n| creators= [[Joe Kelly (writer)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Doug Mahnke]]\n| alliances=[[Justice League]]<br/>[[The Elite (DC Comics)|The Elite]]\n| aliases=\n| powers=Controls symbiotic alien parasites\n}}\n'''Menagerie''' is a name shared by two [[anti-hero]]ines in the [[DC Universe]], both members of [[The Elite (DC Comics)|the Elite]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=241}}</ref> The two are [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] sisters who are linked with a [[symbiotic]] alien weapon cr\u00e8che called symbeasts.

While the origins of her powers are unclear in ''Action Comics'' #775, [[Manchester Black]] states that the rogue [[Men in Black]] (from the [[Department of Extranormal Operations]]) once picked up the dregs of society, turning them into weapons and selling them off to the highest alien bidder. Black recruits Pam to be a member of the Elite. This group takes it upon themselves to \"free the Earth of scum\". They come into conflict with [[Superman]] during their first mission and Superman disables them following a showdown on Jupiter's moon, Io. The Elite are delivered into custody, but soon released by President [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #593\u2013594</ref> During an assassination attempt on Luthor, Menagerie reveals to Superman that the Elite are acting against their wills.

As Sister Superior she convinces Pamela's sister, Sonja, to assume control of the alien cache as the second Menagerie. Vera then approaches the [[Justice League|JLA]] with a proposition to form a sort of [[black op]]s JLA team: [[Justice League Elite]].<ref>''JLA'' #100</ref> Sonja's hatred of Manchester Black becomes a hatred of the Elite. Sonja sees this as her opportunity to kill Vera's dream, so she plays along and joins the team. In their first mission, Menagerie secretly coaxes [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Coldcast|Coldcast]] into killing the foreign terrorist dictator, Hi-Shan Bhat.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #1\u20133</ref> Menagerie lays low during the fallout and puts effort into her personal relationship with Coldcast. The two become lovers and are drawn together by their shared affection for Pamela. Then, while most of the Elite goes underground, Vera is finally fully overtaken by the disembodied Manchester Black.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #4\u20137</ref>\n\nWhile Black threatens Earth with a [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]] god, Menagerie goes missing and Coldcast is arrested by the JLA for Bhat's murder. Coldcast confesses to the murder and is taken to the Slab prison. There he is visited by the spirit of the recently departed [[Manitou Raven]], who frees him from Menagerie's control.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #10\u201311</ref> Coldcast is exonerated and the team tracks Sonja to Costa Rica. She is taken into JLA custody, deprived of the aliens, and begins a gradual separation that they hope will sever her connection to the symbeasts.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #12</ref>\n\n====Powers and abilities of Menagerie====\nThe symbeasts can be assembled to shift over the host to form various shapes and weapons such as claws, spikes or whips. Most commonly, they form around the body and take the form of wings, enabling Menagerie to fly. She can also instruct them to take other forms, or detach from her body and operate independently. One creature has a bite that can force its victims to tell the truth. According to Vera Black, there is also a creature among the creche that can create bio-electric bursts. Menagerie has acidic blood as well and Sonja often allows herself to get hurt by her opponents as a combat tactic.\n\n====Menagerie in other media====\nMenagerie appears in ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]'', voiced by [[Melissa Disney]].\n\nA variation of the Pamela version of Menagerie appears in her self-titled ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode portrayed by Jessica Meraz. In this show, '''Pamela Ferrer''' is a jewel thief who got bonded to a snake-like alien, transforming her into Menagerie. After she killed her partner Chuck and some other people, Menagerie was confronted by Supergirl, the Martian Manhunter, Brainiac 5, and [[Alex Danvers]]. Their fight attracted the attention of the Children of Liberty. When Menagerie planned to rob the masquerade ball, she encountered [[Nia Nal]] and Supergirl and George Lockwood show up. While she did manage to subdue Supergirl, the snake-like alien on Menagerie was beheaded by George. President Baker made an example out of Menagerie and had her incarcerated. While in her cell, Menagerie received a pleasing letter from Manchester Black.

After Mera helps Aquaman escape, Orm tells Nereus that Mera perished in the escape. Nereus accompanied Orm in his trip to the Kingdom of the Fishermen. When the Fisherman King Ricou turned down Orm's offer, he was killed while Nereus killed the two guards that tried to avenge him. Nereus then watched as Orm persuaded King Ricou's wife Queen Rina and daughter Princess Scales to take the offer. During the attack on the Kingdom of the Brine where Orm became the Ocean Master, Nereus fought the Brine soldiers and told the Ocean Master that they need the Brine King alive. When Aquaman arrives on the back of the leviathan Karathan and summons an army of sea creatures, Nereus is told by Princess Scales that Aquaman is also commanding the Trench, which Nereus considered impossible. Mera finds her father and informs him that Aquaman has King Atlan's trident, causing Nereus to switch sides. He then watches Aquaman's duel with the Ocean Master, where Aquaman is victorious, and even sees [[#Atlanna|Atlanna]] appear.

As '''Mister Polka-Dot''', he wore a costume covered in spots; once removed from the costume, the spots could be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating deadly weapons and a bizarre escape vehicle. He succeeded in capturing Robin, but Batman defeated him.<ref>''Detective Comics'' #300 (Feb. 1962)</ref>\n\nYears later, Mister Polka-Dot (now calling himself the Polka-Dot Man) returned without his gimmicks, with the spots on his costume merely decorative. Using a [[baseball bat]], he assaulted Officer Foley of the [[Gotham City Police Department]], causing minor injuries.

When attached to his costume, they were inert, but once removed, they would enlarge in size and become various different devices which could aid in his crime sprees, most notably a flying saucer which he used as a getaway vehicle. The dots were controlled through the costume's belt. He used this belt to dominate Batman and Digger.\n\n====Alternate versions of Polka-Dot Man====\n* The Polka-Dot Man appears in the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice 2]]''.

Unfortunately, that same fire destroyed most of his body, and he was forced to wear a containment suit in order to prevent himself from destroying everything he touched. The Russian government then maneuvered him into position to be one of its premier heroes, placing him into a battle against the original [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], who was then calling for complete nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe battle raged for a time between the two heroes, until a nuclear weapon was dropped on the duo while they fought in the Nevada desert. From that debacle arose a new Firestorm, in which Mikhail played a crucial role, along with the original two members of the Firestorm Matrix, Martin Stein and [[Ronnie Raymond]]. He continued as a member of Firestorm in another incarnation, as an Elemental, but was eventually removed from the Firestorm Matrix so that Martin alone could bear the powers. Ronnie and Mikhail returned to their homes, de-powered.\n\nDuring the \"In My Father's House\" storyline in the most recent ''Firestorm'' series, it was revealed that Mikhail is, in fact, once again in control of his former abilities. He was re-powered by a nuclear test gone wrong in Russia. After going by the name of Firestorm for a time (not knowing that a new Firestorm made up of Jason Rusch and Martin Stein had been in operation for some time), he has now changed his identity back to Pozhar.<ref>''Firestorm the Nuclear Men'' (vol. 3) #27 (September 2006)</ref><ref>''Firestorm the Nuclear Men'' (vol. 3) #29 (November 2006)</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The New 52]]'', a reboot of the DC Universe, Professor Mikhail Arkadin helped Professor Martin Stein invent the Firestorm Protocols.<ref name=N52>''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men'' #4 (February 2012)</ref><ref>''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men'' #8-12 (June\u2013August 2012)</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Pozhar appears as a member of the People's Heroes.

His [[xenophobia]] led him to a group of [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] in the American desert, who he forced into worshiping him and his views. However, in time, the people of \"God's Peake\" (as the camp was called) came to worship Preus as their cult leader. His increasing prominence eventually led both the [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]] to investigate, only to have both of them captured by Preus and his men.<ref>''Action Comics'' #821 (January 2005)</ref>\n\nThis forced a confrontation with Superman, who, at the time, was dealing with the effects of [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]]'s synthetic yellow [[kryptonite]], which had significantly aged and weakened Superman in a short period of time. So weakened, Superman was barely able to deal with Preus' legions alone and quickly found himself outclassed by the (at the time) much more vital Preus.<ref>''Action Comics'' #822 (February 2005)</ref>\n\nA last-ditch gambit using kryptonite to try and weaken Preus failed, as Preus revealed a previously unknown resistance to kryptonite. However, he was finally defeated when Superman attacked and destroyed a key portion of Preus' armor, rendering him unconscious. Afterwards, Preus was injured from that attack and had to be hospitalized. His current whereabouts are unknown. He was last seen as a weakened Superman tried to fly him to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] for treatment. Preus disappeared after Superman was engaged by an army of Gogs.<ref>''Action Comics'' #825 (May 2005)</ref>\n\n====Powers and abilities of Preus====\nPreus possesses powers similar to those of Superman, such as superhuman strength and speed, flight, invulnerability, X-ray vision and enhanced senses. Unlike Superman, Preus can fire beams of black energy from his eyes that strike a target with intense heat and force. Preus also does not share Superman's vulnerability to [[kryptonite]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Psiphon===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity.

He appears in ''Superboy'' (vol. 4) #20, where the team are dispatched to [[New York City]] to capture [[Doctor Psycho]], who had escaped from a H.I.V.E. facility, and [[Superboy]], whose psionic powers were of interest to the H.I.V.E. Despite proving to be formidable opponents, both Psiphon and the Dreadnought were defeated when Doctor Psycho and Superboy teamed up to take them down. Psiphon was knocked out by Superboy with just a flick of his finger.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Psiphon====\nHaving undergone genetic modifications by the H.I.V.E., Psiphon, as his name implies, has the ability to drain the energy of a psi-powered individual and feed it to the Dreadnought to increase his strength.\n\n===Puppeteer===\n{{Redirect|Puppeteer (comics)|the Marvel Comics character|Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|other uses|Puppet Master (disambiguation){{!}}Puppet Master}}\n{{Comics character list header\n| debut = ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 2) #1 (July\u2013Aug. 1960)\n| creators = [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], [[Gil Kane]]\n| alias = Jordan Weir\n| abilities = \"Hypno-ray\" device that allows mind control\n}}\n\nThe '''Puppeteer''', originally known as the '''Puppet Master''', is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]].

This left her with a deep distrust of humans, who she called \"breathers\" or \"normals\".\n\nAfter making it to America, she was captured by R-Complex, a government agency that subjected her to numerous experiments. She was eventually rescued by the efforts of Arnold Burnsteel and Fate. The pair also freed Fang, Slither, and Gross-Out.

Williams II]].\n\n'''Mr. Auerbach''' (first appearance in ''Flash'' (vol. 2) #238 (May 2008)), was the son of a media mogul whose holdings included the cable news network KN News. He pursued a career in journalism, hoping to work his way up in his father's company. While working on a story, he met Edwar Martinez, who was capable of sensing the fears in others and making them a reality.\nAuerbach eventually was put in charge of KN News, where he had a hand in determining much of the content that the network covered.\n\nHe also led a double life as the villain '''Spin'''. He kept Edwar captive in the basement of the news building, hooking him up to machines and forcing him to watch news coverage. In this setting, Spin was able to channel and direct Edwar's amazing ability.\n\nHis first caper was robbing a Faberg\u00e9 egg from a local auction. He created a distraction by summoning earthquakes, which had been in the public's mind due to a recent quake in [[Hub City (comics)|Hub City]].\n\nHe took advantage of a comment made on television by the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] expressing his financial woes. After the citizens of [[Keystone City]] started to feel some doubt about their local hero, Spin lured him to the Keystone City Salamanders stadium and forced him to steal many valuables from the fans there. This causes a massive public outcry against the Flash, which Spin enhances with his powers, even turning the original Flash against his successor.\n\nWhen Spin and Edwar realized that the Flash had identified the source of the disturbances as emanating from KN News, he used his abilities to summon [[Gorilla Grodd]] to Keystone, the Rogue which Edwar sensed would make the speedster most anxious. Grodd, however, was not pleased with his sudden teleportation and a massive battle ensued. In the chaos, Edwar was released from his machinery and his powers went completely out of control, causing citizens to act out nearly every situation being mentioned in the media.\n\n====Equipment of Spin====\nSpin has a vast array of equipment set up in the basement of the KN News building, where he keeps Edwar Martinez. By forcing Edwar to watch news coverage, he is able to direct and control Edwar's ability to sense specific anxieties in the public consciousness and turn them into reality.\n\nSpin wears a costume with a television screen for a face. Usually static appears on the screen, but when channeling Edwar's powers, the face of his victim or a phrase describing his actions may appear. He can summon this costume by uttering the words \"Load theme\".\n\n====Spin in other media====\nIn ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' [[The Flash (season 5)|season five]], a female version of Spin named '''[[Spencer Young]]''' (portrayed by Kiana Madeira) appears as a young millennial with a blog app dedicated to metahumans. She used to work with [[Iris West]] and now has a rivalry with her competing blog. During the Enlightenment, Young's cellphone was hit with debris from [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]]'s satellite, turning it into meta-tech capable of controlling people's minds.

Knowing her idol had just died, she briefly took up the identity in her crusade against her parents' killer, more precisely his wife, before giving it up to save her hero's reputation as [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] under the guise, as Green Arrow advised her to do. In season five, Evelyn is recruited by Oliver to train and join Green Arrow's team of vigilantes, taking the codename '''Artemis''' (unlike the comic book version, who calls herself the Starling). Later, she betrays the team to [[Adrian Chase|Prometheus]] as a brief double agent upon learning of Oliver's past as the Hood. Apparently, she regrets to Oliver for betrayal during his captivity by Adrian who seemingly kills her, but this was revealed to be a deception in order to break Oliver psychologically. She later releases Black Siren (Laurel's Earth Two counterpart) and both of them, along with [[Talia al Ghul]], kidnap all members of Team Arrow, including police captain Quentin Lance and Oliver's son William, and take them to Lian Yu island in order to force Oliver into releasing Adrian from jail. Evelyn is seen keeping captured prisoners Thea, Felicity, Curtis and William's mother Samantha in cages with Talia. Oliver and his army of former enemies release the prisoners from the cages, but [[Digger Harkness]] betrays them. Evelyn is defeated and put in a cage, but Oliver promises to come back for her after the reckoning. Her fate is unknown, since Chase detonated the island with explosives and there is no sign or trace that she escaped from the island.\n** In the ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' episode \"Doomworld\", Evelyn Sharp's Artemis mask can be seen in a glass display case alongside other vigilantes' masks inside Damien Darhk's office, who has become Star City's mayor after he and the Legion of Doom changed reality.\n\n===Sy Borgman===\n'''Sy Borgman''' is a retired wheelchair-bound U.S. agent with some cybernetic enhancements and an ally of [[Harley Quinn]] that first appeared in ''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #2 (March 2014)\n\n====Sy Borgman in other media====\nSy Borgman appears in the ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'' TV series voiced by [[Jason Alexander]].

He makes his first appearance in ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' (vol. 2) #1 (July 2011). In the alternate timeline created by the events of Flashpoint, Blackout is recruited by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] into a team of superheroes whose mission was to end the Amazon-Atlantean war, which had devastated Europe and caused millions of human casualties. To that end, the team was assigned to take down both [[Aquaman|Emperor Aquaman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].\n\nAnother new recruit, the [[Outsider (comics)|Outsider]], revealed during a meeting with [[Batman]] that he had been hunting Blackout so he could use his abilities to power India. This manhunt resulted in the loss of Blackout's girlfriend and his departure from school.

Blackout was mentioned by Barry Allen in the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode \"[[Worlds Finest]]\".\n\n===Blackrock===\n'''Blackrock''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]]. Blackrock is a recurring enemy of [[Superman]] first appearing in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #458 (April 1976).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=32-33}}</ref>\n\nBlackrock was the creation of '''Dr. Peter Silverstone''' in an attempt to increase ratings for the United Broadcasting [[television network]]. Silverstone hypnotized UB President Sam Tanner and later Tanner's nephew, Les Vegas, to fill the role. A third Blackrock (an energy construct) was created by Tanner's command not much later.\n\nHowever, it is known that eventually Silverstone assumed the mantle of Blackrock himself, using a powerful stone that could metabolize electromagnetic energy into energy to achieve flight, energy blasts and superhuman strength, and fought Superman several times. This rock, while a technological artifact, has the appearance of a polished [[Gemstone|gem]] that is as black as [[coal]]. It was appropriately dubbed the Blackrock.\n\nThe Post-''Crisis'' version was stated (in ''Batman/Superman'' adventures) to be a symbiotic alien life form, rather than a creation of Dr. Silverstone. Its appearance and abilities are approximately the same.\n\nSilverstone is the only Pre-''Crisis'' user of the stone that has been mentioned in Post-''Crisis'' continuity. Overuse of the Blackrock's powers blinded Silverstone and left him insane. He was found sitting muttering to himself and watching constant television shows in an apartment owned by an ex-convict named '''Samuel Benjamin''', who beat Silverstone to death with the Blackrock and took it for himself. Despite its power, his inexperience with the Blackrock led to his defeat and Superman took the stone and threw it towards the Sun.<ref>''Superman'' #218 (August 2005)</ref>\n\nA short time later, [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]], disguised as [[Lex Luthor]], dispatched [[Bizarro]] to retrieve the Blackrock from the Sun<ref>''Superman'' #222 (December 2005)</ref> before passing it on to a South American woman named '''Lucia''',<ref>''Superman'' #223 (January 2006)</ref> a drug smuggler and revolutionary who had been jailed by Superman before. Her intense feelings of hatred towards the Man of Steel matched those of the Blackrock and she proved particularly adept in using it. However, her skills were not enough to defeat Superman and the Blackrock withdrew into itself.<ref>''Superman'' #224 (February 2006)</ref>\n\nIt was eventually shown that the Blackrock had been kept by Superman, who eventually locked it away in his Fortress of Solitude. The Blackrock eventually escaped and bonded with [[Plastic Man]]. Shortly after, the Blackrock was removed from Plastic Man and found its way into the hands of [[Batman]], who shortly afterwards decided he needed its powers to help him stop a currently-rampaging Superman (Superman had fallen under the influence of [[Despero]] as he attempted to turn Earth's alien heroes against humans). Although it remained on Batman after Superman threw off Despero's influence, Superman was able to force it to leave Batman by threatening to kill him, informing the Blackrock that he knew Batman would rather die than live like this.\n\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Blackrock is '''Bradley Glenn''', an ex-con who was hired to star in a [[reality television]] show called ''Badass Nation'' about the life of a supervillain.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #5 (April 2016)</ref> The TV company provided him with powered armor and a fictional backstory about finding it in a crashed spacecraft. They intended to film him tearing up a bridge that was scheduled for demolition, but the crew neglected to ensure that the bridge had been closed to traffic and the Pre-''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' Superman had to intervene.<ref>''Superman: Lois and Clark'' #6 (May 2016)</ref>\n\nThe Post-''Crisis'' wielders of the Blackrock seem to have developed differing powers based on their personalities. All seem to have possessed superhuman strength and endurance, flight and energy projection abilities. The Blackrock also has the ability to absorb ambient energy to empower its wielder. Dr. Silverstone seemed most adept at using its ability to process information from TV and radio signals. Samuel Benjamin was particularly skilled at using it to boost his own physical strength and toughness. Lucia's abilities seemed to be an amalgamation of her predecessors', but she seemed to prefer using its energy projection abilities and discovered a way to use it to drain Superman's power.\n\nWhile the stone had bonded to [[Plastic Man]], he was not shown using its abilities much.\n\n[[Batman]] used it in much the same way that Lucia did; however, Batman showed more of a preference for physical combat than Lucia did.\n\n[[Jimmy Olsen]] and several other humans were bonded to the Blackrocks when a shower of them rained down on Earth. These people showed some level of superhuman abilities similar to those demonstrated by Lucia, etc. but it was not shown if they were as strong as he was.\n\nBradley Glenn's armor enabled him to leap great distances and an energy field around one gauntlet gave him a powerful punch.\n\n===Blackwing===\n'''Blackwing''' ('''Charles \"Charlie\" Bullock''') is a fictional [[superhero]] from [[DC Comics]]. He was created by Paul Levitz, Joe Staton and Joey Cavalieri.\n\nThe character was chronologically introduced in ''Adventure Comics'' #464 (April 1979), but was unnamed in that comic. He was, however, named in his next appearance in ''Wonder Woman'' #281 (April 1981) and later, became Blackwing in ''Wonder Woman'' #297 (August 1982). Also, worth to note, the original story in ''Adventure Comics'' was intended for ''All Star Comics'' #75. Charlie was drawn as a teen in that story, but his next appearance (only three years later) depicts him as a young adult who graduated from law school.\n\nIn his mid-teens, Charles Bullock was searching for a direction in life. The teenager found it after he helped fight off street punks alongside Wildcat (Ted Grant) and was invited to join him at his gym. Charlie attended law school and later became a junior partner and top-notch researcher to the law firm called Cranston, Grayson and Wayne. When a criminal named Karnage broke into the office looking for his boss, Arthur Cranston, this, and another event, led him to become the costumed hero Blackwing. Although his first outing as a crime fighter proved unsuccessful when he was captured by the costumed villain Boa's gang, Blackwing managed to contribute in freeing the [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)]] from Boa's giant snake and recorded some evidence that was used to put the mastermind and his men away.\n\nSince then, Blackwing has never appeared again in any other published story.\n\n===Vera Black===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Vera Black\n|CBDBid = 2534\n}}\n'''Vera Black''' is a British psionic cyborg in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Doug Mahnke]], first appeared in ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #100 (August 2004).<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/208041/\n|title=JLA #100\n|publisher=The Grand Comics Database\n|accessdate=2012-05-29\n}}</ref> The storyline set up the limited series ''[[Justice League Elite]]'' which consisted of 12 issues published between 2004\u20132005.\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Vera Black is the sister of [[Manchester Black]]. As children their parents would often fight and Manchester would take her out to play to avoid them. As his idea of \"play\" became killing sprees, Vera's perspective became twisted.{{issue|date=May 2012}} When her brother dies after attempting to destroy [[Superman]], she has her ruined arms, lost in an untold childhood incident, replaced with cybernetic prostheses which can configure into any weapon she desires, initially contemplating revenge on Superman before she decides to be better than her brother.\n\nHer new abilities result in her leading the remnants of the [[The Elite (DC Comics)|Elite]] and tacitly working with the [[Justice League]]. This leads to the League, encouraged by the [[Wally West|Flash]], asking her to lead a new team with the intention that she will handle [[black ops]] missions that the League cannot due to what they represent to the public, primarily involving hunting down and eliminating metahuman threats before they go public. Starting with [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Coldcast|Coldcast]] and [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Menagerie|Menagerie]], she adds Flash, [[Manitou Raven]], [[Major Disaster]], [[Green Arrow]] and [[Cassandra Cain|Kasumi]] to the team. She also enlists [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Naif al-Sheikh|Naif al-Sheikh]] to keep the team in check and serve as a liaison to the governments of the world.\n\n====Equipment of Vera Black====\nVera's cybernetic arms have the capacity to transform into an almost unlimited variety of melee, projectile and beam weapons. They also incorporate camouflage technology relying on optics, as well as altering sense perception in others.\n\n====Vera Black in other media====\nVera Black appears in the direct-to-DVD animated feature ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]'', voiced by [[Marcella Lentz-Pope]] as an adult and by [[Tara Strong]] as a girl in a flashback sequence.\n\n===Block===\n'''Block''' is a young Maori woman living in Melbourne, Australia, the woman dubbed the '''Human Block''' was once inexplicably struck by lightning and survived the incident. Unknown to her, this similar event had happened to many other individuals throughout time and was in fact the Speed Force imbuing her with speed-related abilities. In her then-present time\u20141957\u2014Block acted as a side show attraction in a carnival, the prize of $1,000 going to whoever could move her, which was failed by many, as she had manipulated her body density. One drunken man staggered onto the stage to accept her challenge, making her move by insulting her Maori heritage rather than physically moving her. Angered, she immediately struck out at him and instigated a small brawl, tearing through the crowd before someone hastily drew their firearm on her and shot, only to find that not even bullets affected her. Before the now-turned mob could attack her, Zoom, accompanied by his newly recruited acolytes the Folded Man and Magali, appeared and teleported her outside of the carnival grounds. Being offered the chance to embrace her abilities and live as a godlike being after mastering them, she did not hesitate to join Zoom and his quest to kill the \"evil\" Flash. Along with the other Acolytes, she would train for what would be an unknown amount of time to kill the Flash, facing off with Zoom in his place. It is unknown how long this training took place, as they stated that, over the course of centuries, this team trained to take on the Flash and when they reached older age, Magali would revert them back to their original ages when joining. Unknown to Block, Zoom is actually the one to have orchestrated her joining him to begin with, appearing to the drunk man who challenged her, while convincing him that the way to make her move was to attack her heritage, as he had been keeping close watch on her for some time.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Block====\nBeing imbued with the Speed Force, Block has the unique ability to slow down her atoms. In doing this, they become denser than steel and grant her invulnerability, super-strength and immobility. She can possibly slow down other speedsters, if not other people as well, through physical touch, as she stopped the Top's ability to spin and was able to hold Zoom in place in a headlock. After training centuries with Zoom, she is a deadly fighter. Recently, she was able to stop the molecules around herself to make the air unbreakable.\n\n====Block in other media====\nBlock appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' season 5 episode \"Blocked\" portrayed by [[Erin Cummings]]. '''Vanessa Jansen''', nicknamed \"Block\" by [[Cisco Ramon]], was a [[metahuman]] weapons dealer working for the East Street Skulls gang. Vanessa Jansen worked as a weapons dealer for the East Street Skulls gang, but was betrayed. She was subsequently arrested and sent to [[Iron Heights]] for four years. Through unknown means, Jansen acquired metahuman powers, which allowed her to create boxes of dense air. When Jansen got out of Iron Heights, either by escape or release, she took revenge on Bobby Moretti and killed him with her metahuman powers. She then robbed Bobby's warehouse of guns, planning to sell them. However, the buyer turned out to be Bobby's older brother, Bruno Moretti. He attempted to kill her out of revenge for Bobby's death, only for Jansen to save herself with her powers. She then tried to save Bruno, but was stopped by [[XS (comics)|XS]], who saved him instead. XS then tried to capture her, but Jansen trapped her in a block of dense air, causing the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] to come out and confront her. Jansen threw XS into the air, forcing the Flash to save her, allowing Jansen to escape. Later, Jansen attempted to sell the weapons again, but was once again confronted by Bruni. Bruni arrived with backup, threatening to kill Jansen if she did not return the guns. They opened fire on her, but she shielded herself from the bullets using her powers. The Flash and XS took out the weapon dealers and confronted her again. The Flash repeatedly sped around as Jansen tried to hit him, eventually tiring her out. Jansen was able to trap him in a block while he was distracted and caused it to start shrinking. However, XS battled Jansen, tiring her out once again. XS then used the opportunity to put Jansen in power-dampening handcuffs. Suddenly, when Elongated Man and Vibe arrived to help arrest her, Cicada's dagger pierced through Jansen's chest. XS sped her to the hospital, but Jansen died of her injuries on the way there.\n\n===Billy Numerous===\n'''Billy Numerous''' (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]) was specifically created for the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series and did not have a previous appearance in the mainstream comics. However, he has since made the jump to these with his first appearance in the DC Universe in ''[[Catwoman]]'' #78 (April 2008), now known as '''Repro'''.\n\nBilly Numerous (real name '''William \"Billy\" Strayer''') is a former student of the [[H.I.V.E.]] Academy and an enemy of the [[Teen Titans]]. Numerous first appeared as a student of the H.I.V.E Academy, where his power of self-duplication was subtly hinted at. After the H.I.V.E. was destroyed during [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'s confrontation with [[Brother Blood]], Numerous and most of the other students went freelance. Later, Numerous engaged in a robbing spree all across Jump City and he stole anything he and his innumerable clones could get his (their) collective hands on. His power thoroughly confounded the Titans, especially Cyborg, who became all the more obsessed in catching him. Finally, however, Cyborg realized that there was another way of catching Numerous. He and the other Titans confronted Numerous in the old stadium where he had stashed his loot, seemingly with numerous copies of themselves. In order to bring them down, Numerous created even more clones of himself, but finally pushed his powers too far. The resulting reabsorption of each of his clones caused a massive physical and mental shock, stunning him and enabling his capture. To add insult to injury, the Titans' copies were not actual clones, but merely holographic projections created and controlled by Cyborg.\n\nAt some point, Numerous entered [[Jinx (comics)|Jinx]]'s H.I.V.E. Five and was also recruited into the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. As one of the Five, he participated in the attempted capture of [[Kid Flash]], but even his numerous clones were unable to stop the super-speedster. Later, when the Brotherhood executed its worldwide strike against young superheroes, he and [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] were sent to capture Kole and Gnarrk in their subterranean retreat, but both heroes escaped them. When the remnants of the Titans under [[Beast Boy]] later attacked the Brotherhood's headquarters, Numerous and most of his H.I.V.E. Five teammates tried to run, but were intercepted by Kid Flash\u2014and aghast to see that Jinx had switched sides and joined up with him. Moments later, they were all swept away by one of Jinx's hexes and carted off by Kid Flash for flash-freeze treatment.\n \nIn ''[[Catwoman]]'' #78 (April 2008), a character based on Billy Numerous named '''Repro''' appears. The small-time crook known as Repro was operating in [[Gotham City]] during the time when many of the city's criminals disappeared for a short time. He was one of the only two criminals left in the city, with the other being the Thief. Repro was a young and inexperienced criminal who only did small-time criminal activities, just enough to stay off the radar of big-time crime fighters. After a confrontation with Catwoman where he thought he had shot her in the chest, he hastily departed and ran to the Thief to tell him about it. He was, in turn, shot in the chest and killed by the Thief, who then dumped his body in an alley to cover up the murder.\n\n====Billy Numerous in other media====\n* Billy Numerous appears in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' tie-in comics. He appears as a background villain and member of the H.I.V.E. Five in this comic adaptation of the animated television series.

He fails the test, along with dozens of other villains.\n* Billy Numerous appears in ''[[Teen Titans Go!

In addition, he also called himself the Cyclotronic Man. When the Cyclotronic Man attacked the [[A.S.A.

When Carson fought the Cyclotronic Man, he fought him to a standstill as Carson started to copy his abilities. The fight ends when Carson wraps his legs around the Cyclotronic Man's neck and snaps it. Carson then introduced himself to those taking the tour, while reporting to Percy Odell that the Cyclotronic Man and the Markovian soldiers with him have been eliminated. In the episode \"The Book of Occupation Chapter Three: Agent Odell's Pipe-Dream,\" it was suspected by Lynn that the Cyclotronic Man was the carrier for a man-made virus that the Markovians used to infect the metahumans in the A.S.A.'s custody.\n\n===Cyborgirl===\n{{Comics character list header\n|debut = ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 2) #179\n|debutmo = May\n|debutyr = 2002\n|creators = [[Phil Jimenez]]<br>Roy Allan Martinez\n|abilities =\n|alias =\n|name = Cyborgirl\n|CBDBid =\n|GCDid = Cyborgirl\n}}\n'''LeTonya Charles''' was a young woman who had destroyed her body with the drug Tar, but was granted a second chance when her aunt, Sarah Charles, one of the scientists who helped repair Cyborg, saved her with powerful cybernetic implants. Rather than use her newfound gifts for good, LeTonya chose to focus on personal gain as '''Cyborgirl'''. She became a member of Villainy, Inc., teaming up with several seasoned Wonder Woman villains. She and her teammates tried to overthrow Skartaris, but were stopped by Wonder Woman.\n\nWhen the government rounded up villains and sent them to the planet Salvation, she handed herself over to the Justice League to avoid being exiled. Soon after, Cyborgirl joined the Cyborg Revenge Squad and was one of several such beings to wage an attack against Victor Stone at S.T.A.R. Labs. Stone avoided Cyborgirl's electromagnetic attack, but succeeded in defeating her through sheer force.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Cyborgirl====\nCybernetic enhancement: Because of the implants that her aunt gave her, Cyborgirl has the same powers as Cyborg. Much of her body has been replaced with advanced cybernetics. This grants her a variety of powers, including superhuman durability, superhuman speed, superhuman agility, superhuman reflexes,\nsuperhuman stamina, [[superhuman strength]], enhanced senses and energy projection.\n\n====Cyborgirl in other media====\n* When ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' was pitched to the [[Kids' WB]] network, the lineup originally included three young members as prot\u00e9g\u00e9s for the Justice League.

Dr. Laura Washington, nicknamed Cyber-Woman by [[Rory Regan]], is a doctor that artificially augmented herself using technology stolen from Van Horn Industries. Augmenting herself cybernetically, Laura Washington stole a regulator from Van Horn Industries and implanted it in herself. Sometime after, Team Arrow tracked Washington down to a warehouse, hoping to take the regulator for their own means. [[Wild Dog (comics)|Wild Dog]] took her on, but she shot blasts of energy at him, forcing him to dodge them. Before she could accurately hit him, Wild Dog was saved by the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]].

Damien uses a magical artifact to employ telekinesis and can also drain the life energy of his foes if he makes physical contact with them. The only exception to this is [[Thea Queen]], who causes his life-force absorption ability to backfire due to being revived by the [[Lazarus Pit]]. Although a ruthless killer, when the Green Arrow saves his family from [[Anarky]], Damien allows [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] to leave, despite having a chance to kill him, out of appreciation for the actions. Damien's artifact is eventually destroyed by Vixen and he is prosecuted and sent to Iron Heights Penitentiary. But, after recruiting the [[Malcolm Merlyn|Dark Archer]], [[Brick (comics)|Brick]] and [[Murmur (DC Comics)|Murmur]], he eventually breaks out and murders the [[Black Canary|Black Canary (Laurel Lance)]]. After [[Anarky]] kills his wife and destroys the secret underground city in which Damien planned to survive the [[nuclear holocaust]] he wanted to cause, he becomes nihilistic and decides to destroy the world anyway. But, with help from [[Michael Holt (comics)|Mr. Terrific]] and the [[Calculator (comics)|Calculator]], Oliver's allies succeed in disabling all but one of the nuclear bombs (a city is destroyed by the successful nuke). Meanwhile, the Green Arrow leads the people of Star City in a rally against Damien and his army, with the outpour of hope nullifying Damien's powers. The two engage in a physical fight with Oliver overpowering him. Defeated, Damien taunts the Green Arrow, stating Oliver spared [[Slade Wilson]] after killing Oliver's mother. Oliver reminds him that he killed tens of thousands of innocent people, including Laurel, and states not having a choice before stabbing him with an arrow, killing him. He returned in season five as a manifestation from a [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominator]]'s mental simulation in the 100th episode ''[[Invasion!

Damien returns in season two as a recurring character, one of the two secondary antagonists alongside Malcolm Merlyn and a member of the [[Legion of Doom]]. He also serves as an archenemy to [[Sara Lance]], Laurel Lance's sister and the Legends' leader. Although initially hesitant to work with [[Eobard Thawne]], he quickly joins forces upon learning of his future death and the failure of his plans from Sara. Together with Eobard, his future/former accomplice the Dark Archer and the rest of the Legion of Doom, he works to find the fabled [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] in order to change his fate. After they succeed, Damien makes himself mayor of Star City and regains his magical artifact. However, the Legends manage to travel back in time to stop the Legion's success. Eobard also travels back to warn the past Legion, so Damien sets out with the Legion to stop the Legends in a final battle. Using swords and a futuristic gun courtesy of Eobard, Damien eventually kills the future counterpart of [[Citizen Steel]] before engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Sara. Sara manages to overpower him and knock him out. After the Legion is defeated, the Legends return each member of the Legion to their respective place in the timeline and wipe their memories of time travel, so Damien ends up dying in 2016 as before. In season three, Damien is the secondary antagonist and is resurrected from his death by his time-displaced daughter Nora Darhk with his memories restored and resumes his feud with Sara, the Legends and their allies. He later encounters [[Gorilla Grodd]] upon saving him from the napalm bombing during the [[Vietnam War]] and claims to have time traveling technology that will let Grodd time travel at will. It is revealed that his alliance with Mallus is intended to ensure Mallus' release from his prison dimension by causing temporal aberrations that will weaken it, but this effort is complicated when tension arises between Damien and his daughter over their differing approaches to their relationship. Damien, after being convinced by Steel and the [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]] that his daughter will cease to exist if Mallus is set free, decides to help the Legends stop Mallus from taking Nora's body, but ends up taking Nora's place and is killed by Mallus in the season three finale. In season five, Astra Logue grants Damien a second chance at life. He was supposed cause misery, but instead went to go see Nora. She had to hide the fact of her current status by stating that Constantine is her husband and that Sara and Ava are now her henchmen. Everything unraveled when the ring that Ray placed in a chocolate mousse. Nora's latest charge wishes them all into an episode of ''Mr. Parker's Cul-De-Sac'' (a parody of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'') where they all worked out their issues in the most unlikeliest of ways. Afterwards, Damien allows Nora to marry Ray. After talking to Sara what Astra wanted him to do, Damien briefly borrowed the Hellsword previously used by [[Genghis Khan]] and stabbed himself.\n\n===Dex-Starr===\n'''Dex-Starr''' is an abandoned stray blue [[Cat|domestic cat]] from Earth, adopted by a woman in Brooklyn who names him Dexter. During a break-in, Dex-Starr scratched the burglar before his owner was killed and he was evicted by the police.

As a member of the [[Red Lantern Corps]], wearing his red power ring around his tail, he killed the two thugs and slept on their skulls, proclaiming himself to be a \"good kitty\" using thoughts expressed in simple sentences. He was described by [[Geoff Johns]] in an interview with ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' as \"the most sadistic and malicious\" of the Red Lanterns. Originally intended as a joke by Shane Davis, he began being featured more prominently due to positive reception. Dex-Starr frequently travels with Atrocitus, with his vengeful quest centering on finding the burglar that murdered his owner. Dex-Starr gained the ability to create constructs after drinking the blood of Rankorr and, unbeknownst to his fellow Red Lanterns, he used his newfound ability to save [[Atrocitus]] from certain death after the former leader of the Red Lanterns saw his red power ring being taken by [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]].<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=89}}</ref>\n\n====Dex-Starr in other media====\n* Dex-Starr appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''.

Operating from London, England, Dodger will steal and/or sell anything from information to advanced technology.\n\nAt one point he came into possession of what appeared to be an alien spacecraft. Recognizing that the vehicle's stealth capabilities made it a lucrative commodity, he began leasing the vessel to various underworld figures, including the [[League of Assassins]]. When the vessel in question was linked to an assassination attempt against [[Green Arrow (Connor Hawke)|Connor Hawke]], the [[Green Arrow]] and the [[Black Canary]] began investigating its activity. The trail led them to London where they (along with [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Mia \"Speedy\" Dearden]]) engaged in combat with Dodger at a local pub. Although Dodger proved to be an able-bodied physical combatant, \"Team Arrow\" subdued him and he told them about the League of Assassins.\n\nWhen pressed for more information, Dodger was unwilling to cooperate, so the Green Arrow and the Black Canary dropped him from the belly of a cargo plane suspended by a bungee cord until he agreed to give them better intelligence. He took them to his secret lair and triangulated the last location of the stealth ship he had leased.\n\nThe Green Arrow and the Black Canary then persuaded him to accompany them on the search, which brought them to a castle in Leichestershire, England. They evaded several traps and finally discovered a cryogenics tube containing the compressed form of former Justice Leaguer [[Plastic Man]].\n\nDodger continued to work alongside \"Team Arrow\" and fought a team of metahumans who claimed to represent the League of Assassins. Dodger contributed very little to the battle; however, he did manage to distract one of them long enough for [[Batman]] to subdue him. Dodger continued adventuring with the group, battled foes and completed the adventure along with the team.\n\nAfter settling their business with the League of Assassins, Dodger accompanied \"Team Arrow\" back to the United States, where he struck up a romantic relationship with Mia Dearden. Mia has now left the States and traveled to London to continue this relationship.\n\n====Dodger in other media====\nDodger appears in the TV series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' portrayed by [[James Callis]]. Appearing in the 15th episode \"Dodger,\" he is a British jewel thief who robs valuable jewels from wealthy occupants and sells them at a high price. Unlike the comics, this iteration of the character uses hostages with bomb collars to steal for him, rather than alien technology. He also uses a high voltage stun-stick as a weapon, which renders victims unconscious. His real name is '''Winnick Norton''', a reference to the original creators of the character, [[Judd Winick]] and [[Mike Norton]]. He is defeated by Oliver and John Diggle when he is taken out with his own \"shocker\" after Oliver causes his car to crash, using an arrow as a dagger, and is arrested by a SCPD unit afterwards. In the ''Arrow: Season 2.5'' tie-in comic, Norton escapes from prison and begins operating out of Bludhaven as part of a mercenary group called the Renegades. He and other members kidnap [[Felicity Smoak]] on the orders of [[Brother Blood|Clinton Hogue]], reminiscent how he kidnapped her earlier in \"Dodger\". Norton and other members are defeated by Oliver Queen, [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] and [[Huntress (comics)|Helena Bertinelli]], leaving them bound and tipping off the police so they could arrest them.\n\n===Dominus===\n{{For|the [[Marvel Comics]] villain|Dominus (Marvel Comics)}}\n'''Dominus''' is a [[fictional character]] and a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] who first appeared in ''Action Comics'' #747.

Attempting to find Kismet to steal her cosmic powers, he was opposed by Superman. Swearing vengeance, Dominus [[telepathy|telepathically]] entered Superman's mind and preyed on one of the Man of Steel's greatest weaknesses; his fear of failing the people of [[Earth]].\n\nUsing [[mind control]], Dominus convinced Superman to take control of Earth and build the [[Superman robots]] to police the planet 24 hours a day, seven days a week forever. In another battle, Dominus used his reality-warping powers to become Superman, using the Superman robots to search for Kismet while Superman was disguised as one of his own robots and later as Dominus.\n\nDuring his captivity in these other forms Superman improved on his use of ''Torquasm Vo'', an ancient Kryptonian warrior discipline technique where the warrior can control what they think. Superman and Dominus then engaged in a mental-physical battle with Dominus using any stray thought of Superman to reshape reality. The battle ends with Superman banishing Dominus to the [[Phantom Zone]].\n\nDominus uses his \"Continuum Control\" to alter reality and his \"Control\" to make people unaware that the change occurred. He can actually create more than one simultaneous reality, each one attacking a specific character's mental attributes. Dominus' realities were also inspired by other times in Superman's publishing history (the 1940s, 1960s and 1970s) and \"The Superman of 2965\u20132966\" story involving Muto.<ref>''Superman'' #181 (Nov. 1965)</ref><ref>''Action Comics'' #338\u2013339 (June\u2013July 1966)</ref>\n\n====Dominus behind the scenes====\nIn a 1981 DC Treasury Special called ''Superman and his Fortress of Solitude'', the Pre-''Crisis'' [[Lex Luthor]] posed as a red-armored alien named Dominus as part of an elaborate ruse aimed at destroying the Man of Steel.\n\n===Dreadnought===\nThe '''Dreadnought''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]] appearing in ''[[The New 52]]'' continuity.

The two characters teamed up and managed to defeat the H.I.V.E. soldiers. The Dreadnought was sent flying by Superboy and landed in the [[Hudson River]].\n\nThe Dreadnought has undergone genetic modifications by the H.I.V.E. that mutated him into a giant purple humanoid beast with metallic armor and large black horns protruding from his head. He has superhuman strength and durability, which enables him to hold his own against even Superboy.\n\n===Carl Draper===\n'''Carl Draper''' is a fictional character in [[DC Comics]], an enemy of [[Superman]].

Draper was an overweight clumsy teenager whom most of the other kids never noticed or made fun of and was in love with [[Lana Lang]], who had eyes only for [[Superboy]], much to Draper's resentment. As an adult, Draper underwent a self-imposed self-improvement regimen, including exercise and cosmetic surgery, to overcome his physical shortcomings. He became an expert locksmith and architect, designing an inescapable prison for supervillains called \"Mount Olympus\". Impressed by the achievement, Superman augmented the prison's security by placing it on an antigravity platform. Initially dubbed \"Draper's Island\" by Superman, it was informally renamed \"Superman Island\" by the adult Lana\u2014with whom Draper remained smitten, just as she remained lovestruck by Superman.

This was during the \"Dead Again\" storyline, when Superman was suspected of being an impostor after his body was found still in his tomb (from ''[[The Death of Superman]]'' storyline). Draper was hired by [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to design a holding cell for [[Conduit (comics)|Conduit]], when his daughter, Carla, asked him if he could build a prison that could hold even Superman. Draper initially designed a trap that only the real Superman could escape from, explaining this to Superman by way of a hologram of a costumed figure named '''Deathtrap'''. However, when Superman escaped the trap, Draper became obsessed with proving that he ''could'' capture the real thing. Of note, this version of Draper was dressed in casual wear, only getting an updated costume with chain-based attacks later.\n\nDraper made several other attempts to capture Superman, often programming the Deathtrap hologram in advance so he could publicly be elsewhere. On one occasion, in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #43 (April 1995), he programmed Deathtrap to appear during a Draper Security press conference and display how Draper's devices were being \"subverted\", thus both removing suspicion from him and acting as an advertisement for the company.\n\nIn ''Action Comics'' #739, Superman (in his blue energy form) was captured in an \"energy hobble\" by Deathtrap, now calling himself the '''Locksmith'''. At the end of the story, it was revealed to the reader that his daughter, Carla Draper, was running the hologram this time and that her father was unaware of this. The now costumed-Master Jailer was one of the villains along with [[Neutron (comics)|Neutron]] controlled by [[Manchester Black]] in the 2002 storyline \"Ending Battle\"; however, it was not clear that it was, in fact, Draper.\n\nCarl Draper appears in ''[[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]'' #17 (Oct. 2007). At some point, Checkmate discovered his multiple identities and used this to force him into becoming a security consultant, protecting Checkmate itself from attack. In the issue, he prevents numerous assaults on Checkmate headquarters and is promoted to head of security with the title '''Castellan'''. Although he has not told his superiors, he strongly suspects that Carla is involved in the attacks.

While conducting an experiment to sending radio signals into deep space, his experiment somehow accidentally teleported the Martian J'onn J'onzz into his observatory. Erdel was surprised of J'onn's appearance and suffered a fatal heart attack. Before succumbing to his death, Erdel somberly apologized J'onn for stranding him on Earth and warns that human society will not take too kindly to him as people will fear him because of his appearance, and strongly recommended to him not to reveal himself and take the time to study humanity, using his image for a while before becoming a [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]] Detective.<ref>''DC: The New Frontier'' #2</ref>\n\nErdel makes a non-speaking cameo in ''[[Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths]]''.

After falling back to the Iceberg Lounge due to Professor Pyg having gotten away, the Headhunter stated to Cobblepot that Gordon is right.

The first Hyena debuted in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]'' #4 (September 1978) and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Al Milgrom]]. The second Hyena debuted in ''[[Firestorm (comics)|The Fury of Firestorm]]'' #10 (March 1983) and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Pat Broderick]].\n\nBoth werehyenas had problems with authority and resented Firestorm for interfering in their [[Feud|vendettas]]. The unique feature of the Hyenas was that they turned into werehyena forms whenever they were under great emotional stress, not only when there was a [[full moon]]. This meant that they could attack foes in broad daylight and that they would revert into their human forms when their emotional tension was relieved.\n\nThe first Hyena, '''Summer Day''', joined the [[Peace Corps]] as a result of relational issues with her father and was turned into a werehyena as a result of an accident in [[Africa]]. Taking the name the Hyena, Summer returned to America and began attacking both criminals and police officers. A result of her condition is a steadily progressing madness.<ref>As seen in ''Flash'' #304</ref>\n\nThe second Hyena, '''Doctor Jivan Shi''', was a [[psychiatrist]] whom Summer Day had fallen in love with while he was attempting to treat her werehyena condition. One night, as Summer and Jivan were embracing, Summer transformed into the Hyena and infected Jivan with the werehyena curse. Professor Stein noted that being the Hyena seemed to have warped Jivan Shi's mind.<ref>As seen in ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #11</ref> According to ''The Fury of Firestorm'' #10\u201313, the madness suffered by the werehyenas is one's bestial side taking over, coupled with an exaggeration of negative emotions.\n\nIn ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', [[Deadshot]] killed one of the Hyenas after a prison breakout<ref>''[[Villains United]]'' #3</ref> and the other appeared as a member of the [[Injustice League]] in ''[[One Year Later]]'' before being shot and killed by [[Parademon]]s that were attacking the villains' camp.<ref name=\"As seen in Salvation Run #6\">As seen in ''Salvation Run'' #6</ref>\n\nA pack of at least five new werehyenas, presumably suffering from the same curse as Summer and Jivan, were seen in San Francisco some time after the death of their remaining predecessor. They were promptly defeated and permanently returned to human form, thanks to [[Zatanna]], [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]] and [[Black Canary]].<ref>''Zatanna'' #2</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the werehyenas are reintroduced as mercenaries who received special drugs that gave superstrength and velocity, with the side effect of a constant laugh.<ref>''The Fury of Firestorm'' #2</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline as part of ''[[The New 52]]'', the Summer Day version of the Hyena appears as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].

He assists the group in escaping from [[S.H.A.D.E.]], an evil governmental organization with control of the [[White House]]. In issue #6, it is revealed that he is '''Ken Thurston''', the great-grandson of the original [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Invisible Hood and that he is using the same hood that the original Invisible Hood had used. Uncle Sam had used telepathy to direct Ken to the hood.

[[Deathstroke|Deathstroke the Terminator]]. An enemy of the [[Teen Titans]], Adeline makes her first appearance in ''New Teen Titans'' #34 (August 1983). She was brought up as a wealthy jet-setting playgirl, despite being trained by a father who had worked with Chinese guerrilla forces. But, after a traumatic first marriage at 19, she joined the U.S. military, where she met, trained, and married Slade Wilson. After Slade left the military, Slade and Adeline took up the socialite lifestyle Adeline had been raised into.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, Slade was using his hunting trips to gain clients for his mercenary side job, which resulted in the kidnapping and near-death of their younger son, [[Jericho (comics)|Joseph]]. Enraged and betrayed by Slade's prioritization of Deathstroke's honor code over their son's well-being, Adeline shot her husband and, when he survived, served him with divorce papers.\n\nGrant, who had idolized his father, rebelled against his mother and ran away to New York, where he ran into the Titans and ended up dying due to his alliance with the H.I.V.E. Slade vowed to pick up his dead son's contract against the Teen Titans; Adeline promptly interfered; she blamed Slade for Grant's death. Due to Adeline's intervention, Joseph, who had been working with her, joined the Titans as Jericho.\n\nJoseph eventually became possessed by the spirits of Azarath. Begging his father to kill him in order to prevent the corrupted spirits from achieving their purpose, Adeline's only remaining son died at her husband's hand. Adeline found this out from one of her Searchers Inc. agents, rather than from Slade himself, which merely cemented her long-held grudge against her ex-husband.\n\nSlade, however, held no grudge against her, keeping an eye out for her safety and attempting to aid her when he thought he could get away with it; e.g., when Adeline had been abducted by her first husband Morel, a.k.a. Count Tavolera, who had poisoned her in an attempt to force her to work with him to discover her ancestor Josiah Kane's treasure.\n\nTo save Adeline's life, Slade gave her some of his own serum-altered blood. This ended up driving her crazy; Slade's genotype had a unique mutation which enabled him to effectively metabolize his serum. Other less fortunate people either died or went insane.\n\nFor a time, Adeline went underground, slowly losing more and more of her normal cognitive abilities, though none of her tactical skills. She eventually turned herself into the H.I.V.E. Mistress, in her madness focusing on superheroes as the reason for her sons' death and creating a plan to kill all the superheroes that she could.\n\nHer plot ultimately resulted in her death. [[Vandal Savage]] put a team together to take advantage of Adeline's plan, intending to take her immortal blood to create a sort of Fountain of Youth potion. With her throat cut, unable to die and yet unable to fully heal, Adeline regained her sanity briefly and pleaded with Slade (who had learned of her involvement and arrived to try and save her) to kill her and reunite her with their children. However, because he still had feelings for her no matter what she had done, he was unable to comply with her request, so [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] killed her instead.\n\n====Adeline Kane in other media====\nAdeline makes her live-action debut in the second season of ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'' portrayed by [[Mayko Nguyen]].\n\n===Kilg%re===\n*Creators: [[Mike Baron]] and Jackson Guice\n*First appearance: ''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'' (vol. 2) #3 (August 1987)\n\n'''Kilg%re''' was an electro-mechano-organic intelligence that needed electro-life to survive. It consumed its entire home planet in the Pleides sector and then moved on into space. It was attacked by something known as Meta#sker and placed into a vibrational limbo. Somehow, it found its way to the flats near Salt Lake City on Earth. It could only be seen by people traveling at high speeds, such as an F-15 pilot or the Flash. The Flash unknowingly released it from the limbo it was imprisoned in and it followed him to S.T.A.R. Labs and took over its electrical systems. Kilg%re found the number of machines on Earth ideal for its survival, but humans it deemed distractions and planned to destroy them. It delivered an ultimatum: abandon North America by 12:00 noon on May 10 or be destroyed. During a battle with the Flash in Salt Lake City, it turned out all the power in the country. The Flash sought the help of Cyborg, who used the Titans' satellite to relay the message to the governments of the world to shut down all power in order to kill Kilg%re. This scared it out of the power grid and it weaved a giant mechanical snake across the Utah flats, trying to complete a circuit by catching up with the cloned body of S.T.A.R. Labs' Dr. Schmitz in order to survive. However, the Flash outraced it, supposedly killing it. After Kilg%re's defeat at the hands of the Flash he appeared to be destroyed, but resurfaced in the form of a sentient computer mind hidden in a self-created computer operating system in a deep cave. When [[Maxwell Lord]] was spelunking one day, his then-president had fallen deep into the cave where Kilg%re lay dormant. Sensing a human life, Kilg%re decided to help coax Max into further succeeding his own plans, as well as Max's subconscious plans of self-actualization. To do this, Kilg%re decided to help Max start the new Justice League and grow the group into becoming more international. Kilg%re served in a behind-the-scenes role, constantly coaxing and manipulating Max into furthering his plans, such as gaining money, power and cutting-edge technology to give Kilg%re a stronger machine to inhabit. Through such advantages, Kilg%re and Max were able to create a better duplicate of the Justice League signal device, begin a recruitment drive and find willing villains, gaining additional muscle such as Booster Gold and a new Ace android. Kilg%re grew impatient and decided to start using bigger ideas, such as inciting an international incident to distract Justice League International. To do this, he found hidden technologies designed as a monitoring device by Metron. He launched the satellite, which was only defeated by Mister Miracle because he was used to New God technology. A serious mishap occurred during the Millenium event, in which the Manhunters took over the bodies of those they deemed were close enough to major figures to do damage. One of these Manhunters took over the body of the secretary of Max and, when she delivered coffee to him, she shot him four times. Rushing to Max's safety, Kilg%re promptly eliminated the threat by combining some of his technology with Max in order to save his life and kill the Manhunter. Max eventually learned of Kilg%re's tampering when half of Kilg%re was destroyed by the construct falling through the building that housed Kilg%re. In Kilg%re's fleeting moments, he threw another series of visions designed to tamper with Max's thoughts and implant Kilg%re into another larger system. Max refused and destroyed what was left of Kilg%re's last computing body. Doing so removed the cyborg self-repairing systems in Max's body, which landed him in the hospital. Kilg%re, however, was not completely destroyed.\n\nKilg%re appeared in ''[[DC Rebirth]]''{{'}}s ''[[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'' #01, 02 and 18 and ''The Flash/[[Speed Buggy]] Special'' #1.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Kilg%re====\nKilg%re has a robot body, electrokinesis, electronic interaction, electronic disruption, electronic constructs, and superhuman speed.\n\n====Kilg%re in other media====\n* A different depiction of Kilg%re appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by [[Dominic Burgess]]. This version is a computer programmer named '''Ramsey Deacon''', who developed an application that was stolen by his teammates for self-profit, leaving him with nothing. Ramsey was one of the 12 passengers on the bus which was hit by dark matter when the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash/Barry Allen]] escaped the Speed Force, becoming a metahuman who can control and manipulate technology.

In the episode \"True Colors\", Kilg%re is among the metahuman inmates at Iron Heights Penitentiary that Warden Wolfe planned to sell to Blacksmith. When Warden Wolfe outs Barry's true identity to Blacksmith, [[Dwarfstar]], [[Hazard (DC Comics)|Hazard]], Kilg%re, and [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Black Bison|Black Bison]], they prepare to attack, only for the Thinker to arrive and absorb the powers of the four metahumans while killing them.\n* Kilg%re appears in the tie-in comic ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' #28.\n* Kilg%re appears in the tie-in comic ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]'' #14.\n\n===King Cobra===\nThere have been at least two different characters named the '''King Cobra''' in [[DC Comics]].\n\n====Batman villain====\nThe King Cobra is a mob boss in Gotham City who wears a green snake costume.

The character, created by [[James Owsley]] and [[Jim Aparo]], first appeared in ''Batman'' #431 (March 1989). Within the context of the stories, Kirigi taught [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]] the art of [[ninjitsu]] when Bruce approached him for martial arts training. He was later hired by [[Ra's al Ghul]] to train members of the [[League of Assassins]] in ninjitsu. Batman visited Kirigi when he recognized some of the moves done by the League of Assassins members that Kirigi taught him.\n\n====Kirigi in other media====\nKirigi appears in the video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', voiced by [[Kaiji Tang]]. He is featured in the \"Initiation\" DLC challenge map. Before he becomes Batman, Bruce Wayne approaches his dojo in the mountains of North Korea and asks Kirigi to train him. Kirigi lets him train with him and his students for a while out of pity and later tests him to see if he is worthy. Depending on how the player operates Bruce Wayne during this performance, there are three different endings after Bruce Wayne defeats [[Lady Shiva]]. If the player completes the challenge map with less than nine medals, Kirigi states that Bruce is the best foreigner that he has trained, yet he does not say much. Kirigi then sends Bruce to find a bucket and broom in order to clean the latrines. If the player completes the challenge map with nine or more medals, Kirigi is impressed with Bruce's progress, yet states that he still has a lot to learn. For the time being, Kirigi then sends Bruce to find a rag in order to clean the floors. If the player completes the challenge map with all 15 medals, Kirigi states to Bruce that he is impressed and, at the same time, also states that he is rarely impressed. Upon telling Bruce that he has gained his dojo's respect and proven himself worthy, Kirigi states that he will be given the information that he seeks. Bruce is sent to the kitchen by Kirigi to prepare tea for him and all of Kirigi's students, where there is much to discuss.\n\n===Komodo===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Komodo\n|CBDBid =\n|GCDid = Simon+Lacroix\n}}\n'''Komodo''' ('''Simon Lacroix''') first appears in ''[[Green Arrow]]'' (vol. 5) #17 (April 2013).<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #17 (April 2013)</ref> He was created by writer [[Jeff Lemire]] and artist [[Andrea Sorrentino]]. Komodo was once Robert Queen's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and was part of Robert's expedition to find the \"Arrow Totem\", which was said to bring enlightenment. Seeking this enlightenment for himself, Lacroix betrayed and murdered Robert, but could not find the Totem. Consumed by his desire for the Totem's enlightenment, Lacroix strove to destroy Oliver Queen and the Green Arrow and became the masked archer \"Komodo\". Through his company Stellmoor International, he works on behalf of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]], a shadowy secret society of warriors from different weapon disciplines, which he wants to rule.<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #24</ref> Komodo travels with his equally deadly \"daughter\" [[Emiko Queen|Emiko]], who, in fact, is the daughter of Robert Queen and the archer [[Shado (DC Comics)|Shado]]. Emiko later learns this and is shocked, and learning that both her parents were alive, turned against Komodo. He attempted to kill her but, ultimately, she killed him with an arrow shot through his heart.<ref>''Green Arrow'' (vol. 5) #31</ref>\n\n====Komodo in other media====\nKomodo also appears in the ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' season three episode \"Sara\", portrayed by Matt Ward. This version is described as a mercenary from [[Sainte-Sophie, Quebec]]. He begins targeting several businessmen in Star City (including [[Atom (DC Comics)|Ray Palmer]]), but is prevented by Team Arrow for the latter target. Arrow and the others think that he killed [[Sara Lance]], but he denies it, which is proven to be correct. Komodo then escapes from them and is never seen again.\n\n===Kulak===\n{{Comics character list header\n|name = Kulak\n|CBDBid = 2385\n|GCDid = Kulak\n}}\n'''Kulak''' is a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] and [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Bernard Baily]], first appeared in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #2 (Fall 1940).\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Kulak is the high priest of the dead planet Brztal who had been imprisoned on Earth in antiquity. When released by archeologists in 1940, he seeks to destroy Earth, but is defeated by the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]].<ref>{{cite comic\n|writer = [[Jerry Siegel]]\n|penciller = [[Bernard Baily]]\n|title = [[All-Star Comics]]\n|issue = #2\n|date = fall 1940\n|publisher = DC Comics\n}}</ref>\n\nThe character was not used again until 1983, when he appears in a three-part story published in ''All-Star Squadron'', and has rarely been used since.\n\n==L==\n===Lady Eve===\n'''Lady Eve''' is a fictional [[supervillain]]ess created by [[Mike W. Barr]] and [[Alan Davis]], making her first appearance in ''Batman and the Outsiders'' #24 (Aug. 1985).\n\nLittle is known about Lady Eve's past, but she first met the terrorist cult leader [[Kobra (DC Comics)|Kobra (Jeffrey Burr)]] in [[Egypt]] where she nursed him back to health. In gratitude, Kobra offered Eve to join him in exchange for a better life. She accepted and eventually became Kobra's lover, as well as a high-ranking member of the Kobra Cult. She and Kobra once hatched a plot to brainwash top officials of the [[U.S. Army]] and steal a satellite defense program to blackmail the [[United States government]], but [[Batman]] and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] eventually stopped them both.<ref>''Batman and the Outsiders'' #25\u201327 (Sept.-Nov. 1985)</ref>\n\nLady Eve would later assemble a second incarnation of [[Strike Force Kobra]]. When this version of Strike Force Kobra was defeated by the [[Eradicator (comics)|Eradicator]]'s incarnation of the Outsiders, even after the death of the third [[Syonide]], Lady Eve called Kobra for help, only for him to tell them to surrender. This action caused a strain between Kobra and Lady Eve.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 2) #5.

She also has ties to [[Peter Gambi]]. Lady Eve is later murdered by Tobias' men as part of a plan to frame Black Lightning and also avenging [[#Joey Toledo|Joey Toledo]] when Peter Gambi left the blame of his death on Lady Eve's group. It was later revealed that she was an old friend of Lazarus Prime who taught him some of her tricks. [[Technocrat (comics)|Baron]] later found her picture on Gambi's computer when trying to find out who tried to have Gambi killed. Lady Eve was shown to be revived offscreen and is the head of the Ultimate O business where she starts to develop some competition with Lala and the remnants of the 100.\n\n===Lillian Luthor===\n'''Lillian Luthor''' (portrayed by [[Alisen Down]]) was the mother of Alexander Luthor and Julian Luthor, as well as the wife of [[Lionel Luthor]].\n\n====''Smallville''====\nLillian had a long and prolific role in the TV series ''[[Smallville]]''.\n\nLillian came from a wealthy family. How she met Lionel is unclear, but they were married sometime before the 1980s. By all accounts, Lillian was a caring, beautiful and sophisticated person, as well as comments made by Lex and Lionel have indicated that she had a spirited personality, had ambitions of her own and often stood up to Lionel.\n\nEventually, Lillian began to wonder about the special projects that Lionel had. She searched for answers and found something called \"Veritas\". However, Alexander saw her going through his father's briefcase, so Lillian asked him not to tell anyone. When Lionel found out, he immediately blamed Alexander and forced him to tell the truth. When Alexander did, Lillian insisted Lionel explain what Veritas was, but Lionel knocked her to the floor instead and warned her not to look into his projects again. Lillian felt angered and disgusted by Alexander's betrayal.\n\nSometime later, Lillian became ill with a heart condition that worsened over the rest of her life. Lionel hired a nurse named Rachel Dunleavy to assist her. Rachel and Lionel subsequently had an affair, resulting in the birth of Lionel's illegitimate son, Lucas. It is unclear whether Lillian knew of the affair or the child.\n\nLillian was helped by a nanny, Pamela Jenkins, who Alexander regarded as a second mother. Lionel was often absent from home and Lillian insisted that he take Alexander on one of his business trips to Smallville during the meteor shower of 1989. Lionel's resulting shame and constant critique of Alexander bothered Lillian greatly.\n\nSometime in the early 1990s, Lionel insisted that they have another child, an idea that Lillian was highly opposed to, presumably because of her poor health. However, when Alexander was 11, Lillian became pregnant again. She insisted that Alexander be allowed to come home for school from Excelsior Academy and Lionel complied. Her pregnancy was strenuous and Lillian was bedridden for much of it. On Alexander's disastrous 12th birthday (which no one attended), Lillian gave him a lead box allegedly made from the armor of St. George, which he kept into adulthood and later gave to Clark Kent.\n\nAfter baby Julian's birth, Lillian descended into a deep case of postpartum depression, refusing to hold the child and crying perpetually. One evening, Lionel sent the baby's nanny home and insisted that Lillian bond with the child. Lillian expressed her concern that Lionel would pit the two boys against each other and announced that she wanted a divorce, a threat that she had apparently made many times and that Lionel had called \"tiresome\".\n\nOn returning home from work one night, Lionel discovered Alexander in the baby's nursery. Alexander immediately apologized and confessed to accidentally killing Julian while trying to stop him from crying. Lionel erupted into a fierce rage and struck Alexander. Their relationship never recovered, even after he became an adult. It was not until years later, after receiving experimental therapy to recall repressed memories, that he remembered that Lillian had in fact smothered the baby during one of her delusions, hoping to spare him from Lionel's maltreatment. Alexander took the blame, correctly assuming that his father would cover it up in order to protect his sole heir, although he would probably be less inclined to do so for his wife.\n\nSometime before her death Lillian, along with Lex and Lionel, went to a ranch in Montana to spend time together. During that time, a snake spooked Lillian's horse, prompting Lionel to save her and wait on her until she was better.\n\nAfter Julian's death, Lillian's health rapidly deteriorated and she died several months later in the spring of 1993 when Alexander was 13. He later confessed to Clark that he was in denial about her impending death and spent the time researching treatments and doctors instead of being with her. Lex also told Lana Lang that he was away at boarding school when Lillian died and found out about her passing from reporters who had sneaked into his school.\n\nLillian left her shares of LuthorCorp to her son and Pamela.\n\nLillian's death was extremely influential in the adult Lex's life. He had visions of his mother on many occasions. When Lex was shot and ended up in a coma, he had a near-death experience. In it, Lillian visited him and showed Lex an alternate life of happiness that he could have if he would simply walk away from Lionel and LuthorCorp. However, at the end of the vision, Lana (his dream wife) suffered complications during childbirth. Because of Lex's lack of resources and estrangement from his father, he was unable to transfer Lana to a better facility and she died: this led Lex to believe that Lana died because he lacked enough money and power: with these, everything else in life could be secured. As a result, Lex ignored his mother's warning and continued his lifestyle of deceit and corruption. After realizing this, Lillian was seen in the reflection of a hospital window crying over her son's choice.\n\nWhen Lex was injected with the Limbo drug, which placed its users in a state of \"clinical death\", he met Lillian again, who told him that she was angry with him for ignoring her advice.\n\nWhen Lex was shot and went into a coma, Clark Kent and Lionel used a machine that allowed Clark to enter Lex's mind in order to find Lois Lane and Kara Kent. In Lex's mind, Clark met a young version of Lex and the two hid from a psychotic and murderous adult Lex. In the memory featuring Lillian snooping in Lionel's briefcase, Clark witnessed Lionel's verbal and physical abuse of both Lex and Lillian, as well as watched Lex try to help his mother up, but Lillian uncharacteristically told him that he had done enough and walked away from him.\n\n====Lillian Luthor in comics====\nIn DC Comics, Lex Luthor's mother is named '''Arlene Luthor'''. In later incarnations, her name was changed to '''\"Leticia\"''' even though she remained unnamed in most of her appearances.\n\n====Lillian Luthor in other media====\nLillian Luthor (known as '''the Doctor''') appears in ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Brenda Strong]]. Dr. Lillian Luthor is a scientist, the leader of [[Project Cadmus]], the wife of the late Lionel Luthor, the mother of [[Lex Luthor]] and the adoptive mother of [[Lena Luthor]].\n\n===Lunkhead===\nLunkhead is an enemy of [[Batman]] who became an inmate at [[Arkham Asylum]]. Lunkhead was clearly stupid, but exhibited massive strength; he made an enemy of [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Arnold Wesker]] when he smashed Wesker's companion \"Scarface\". He was sacrificed to the devil by a pack of demons, along with many others, when the Ventriloquist threw his voice to make it seem as though Lunkhead was volunteering to be thrown into the fiery pit with the rest of the damned.\n\n====Lunkhead in other media====\n* Lunkhead appears in ''[[Beware the Batman]]'', voiced by [[JB Blanc]]. He is a reformed criminal who was beaten into a coma for two months by Batman. He was part of a therapy program in [[Blackgate Penitentiary]] alongside Margaret Sorrow. Lunkhead was released and has been a reformed criminal. Lieutenant [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] asks him about Margaret, bribing him with chocolate.\n* Lunkhead appears in the ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' episode \"A Dark Knight: One of My Three Soups\", portrayed by Hank Strong. This version is an African-American [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] and had known Jerome Valeska's uncle Zachary Trumble. When he showed up to assist Zachary, Jerome spilled some soup on him. Upon Bruce Wayne arriving, he fought against Lunkhead and defeated him.\n\n==M==\n===Matches Malone===\n{{Comics character list header\n| debut = ''Batman'' #242\n| debutmo = June\n| debutyr = 1972\n| creators = [[Dennis O'Neil]], [[Irv Novick]], [[Dick Giordano]]\n| name = Matches Malone\n| CBDBid = 9795\n| GCDid = Matches+Malone\n}}\n'''Matches Malone''' was originally a Gotham gang boss who [[Batman]] attempted to recruit to help him take down [[Ra's al Ghul]]. When he was accidentally killed by a ricocheting bullet that was meant for Batman, Batman began to impersonate him to use his underworld contacts and to fool Ra's.\n\nPost-''Crisis'', he was a relatively small-time arsonist with his brother Carver and who came to [[Gotham City]] early on in [[Batman]]'s career, attracting Batman's attention when Carver was apparently murdered. Although Matches was the prime suspect, there was no concrete evidence to make the charges stick and Matches was released, only for Batman to subsequently find what appeared to be Matches' dead body in another fire, apparently a suicide. However, Batman never reported the death; at the time, he had been attempting to establish a criminal alias for himself to help him gather information, but the exclusive nature of the criminal sects meant that no one would recruit someone that they had not heard of, prompting him to adopt Matches' identity and use it for his own.\n\nHowever, years later, Batman learned the truth about what had happened. Carver's death had actually been a suicide prompted by his guilt over a fire that he and Matches had started that resulted in the death of a homeless man resting in the building they had torched, with Matches making the body look like a murder victim because he was ashamed of his brother's suicide. Subsequently, deciding to escape Batman stalking him for the crime, Matches used the body of their earlier victim to fake his own death, with Batman being so eager to establish his criminal alias that he never took the time to definitively confirm the body's identity. After operating underground for years by committing low-end robberies, Matches returned to Gotham after hearing reports of 'his' activities, only to be shot by [[Ventriloquist (comics)#Arnold Wesker|Scarface]] for 'his' recent betrayal, surviving long enough to simply confess his role in events to Batman and [[Nightwing]] before dying, with his last request being that Batman bury him next to his brother Carver.\n\nHaving destroyed Scarface in 'revenge' for Matches' death, Batman commented to Nightwing later on that he continued using the Matches identity because, in the years he had spent playing Matches, he had come to recognize that Matches was not an evil man, but had done some bad things that he never had the chance to make up for, regarding his use of Matches' name as a chance to give Matches some absolution.\n\nThe \"Matches Malone\" identity indirectly caused the events of ''[[Batman: War Games]]''; after she was fired as Robin, [[Stephanie Brown (character)|Stephanie Brown]] attempted to implement an old plan of Batman's that would allow him to take control of the city's criminal organisations, hoping that this would impress Batman enough to convince him to take her back. Unfortunately, she was unaware that Batman's agent who was meant to take control of the meeting, Matches Malone, was actually Batman himself, resulting in tensions between the crime families flaring up and most of them being killed in the subsequent stand-off, leading into the subsequent gang wars and Stephanie's own apparent death.\n\nIn ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' comic book series, Batman uses the Matches Malone guise against the False Face Society and a backstory reveals Malone was a low-level enforcer for [[Rupert Thorne]] who agreed to become a snitch for Batman and [[Commissioner Gordon]] against Thorne. But, when Malone began skimming cash from Thorne, he was shot to death by \"two Chicago triggers\" who go by the monikers Dapper (for always dressing well) and Cricket (for his short wiry build). Upon finding the dying Malone and being told that his killers went to a well-known Chinese restaurant, Batman removed his glasses\u2014and was shocked by what Malone looked like. Batman took Malone's guise, defeated the two hitmen and sent them to prison, and has used the guise ever since.\n\n====Matches Malone in other media====\n* The character, renamed '''Matthew \"Matches\" Malone''', is used in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' as an alias by [[Batman]] (voiced by [[Diedrich Bader]]). In the episode \"[[Chill of the Night!]]\", Batman uses the name variation during a trip to the past with the [[Phantom Stranger]] to see [[Thomas Wayne]] and [[Martha Wayne]] years before their deaths and unaware that Malone is their grown son. In the episode \"The Mask of Matches Malone!\", Batman gets amnesia while in his Matches Malone persona and believes himself to actually be a gangster.\n* The character appears, renamed '''Patrick \"Matches\" Malone''', in the live-action ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'' TV series, portrayed by Danny Schoch in his first masked appearance and by [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]] in the second appearance. This version is a philosophical hitman-for-hire who is one of Gotham City's deadliest murderers and was an old partner of [[Mutants (DC Comics)|Mutants]] leader Terence \"Cupcake\" Shaw. He is the masked man in shiny shoes who killed Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne in front of Bruce Wayne and [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] (who was watching from the highest part of the fire escape), taking [[Joe Chill]]'s place in the comics and most adaptations. This has led Detective [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] into finding him in order to bring to justice. [[Silver St. Cloud]] revealed the killer's identity to be Patrick. When Bruce finally confronts Patrick, Patrick stated that he was tired of doing bad things, while barely recalling if he killed Bruce's parents and Bruce decides not to kill Patrick. Using the gun that Bruce left behind, Patrick committed suicide by the time Gordon caught up with Bruce. Gordon and [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]] were left wondering who could have hired Malone to kill Thomas and Martha (which was eventually revealed to be [[Hugo Strange]]).\n\n===Menagerie===\n{{Infobox comics character| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image=\n| caption=Sonja shapeshifting, art by [[Doug Mahnke]]\n| character_name=Menagerie\n| real_name=Pamela<br>Sonja\n| publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n| debut='''Pamela:''' ''Action Comics'' #[[What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?|775]] (March 2001)<br>'''Sonja:''' ''[[JLA (comic book)|JLA]]'' #100 (August 2004)\n| creators= [[Joe Kelly (writer)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Doug Mahnke]]\n| alliances=[[Justice League]]<br/>[[The Elite (DC Comics)|The Elite]]\n| aliases=\n| powers=Controls symbiotic alien parasites\n}}\n'''Menagerie''' is a name shared by two [[anti-hero]]ines in the [[DC Universe]], both members of [[The Elite (DC Comics)|the Elite]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=241}}</ref> The two are [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] sisters who are linked with a [[symbiotic]] alien weapon cr\u00e8che called symbeasts.

While the origins of her powers are unclear in ''Action Comics'' #775, [[Manchester Black]] states that the rogue [[Men in Black]] (from the [[Department of Extranormal Operations]]) once picked up the dregs of society, turning them into weapons and selling them off to the highest alien bidder. Black recruits Pam to be a member of the Elite. This group takes it upon themselves to \"free the Earth of scum\". They come into conflict with [[Superman]] during their first mission and Superman disables them following a showdown on Jupiter's moon, Io. The Elite are delivered into custody, but soon released by President [[Lex Luthor]].<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #593\u2013594</ref> During an assassination attempt on Luthor, Menagerie reveals to Superman that the Elite are acting against their wills.

As Sister Superior she convinces Pamela's sister, Sonja, to assume control of the alien cache as the second Menagerie. Vera then approaches the [[Justice League|JLA]] with a proposition to form a sort of [[black op]]s JLA team: [[Justice League Elite]].<ref>''JLA'' #100</ref> Sonja's hatred of Manchester Black becomes a hatred of the Elite. Sonja sees this as her opportunity to kill Vera's dream, so she plays along and joins the team. In their first mission, Menagerie secretly coaxes [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Coldcast|Coldcast]] into killing the foreign terrorist dictator, Hi-Shan Bhat.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #1\u20133</ref> Menagerie lays low during the fallout and puts effort into her personal relationship with Coldcast. The two become lovers and are drawn together by their shared affection for Pamela. Then, while most of the Elite goes underground, Vera is finally fully overtaken by the disembodied Manchester Black.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #4\u20137</ref>\n\nWhile Black threatens Earth with a [[Jack Kirby's Fourth World|Fourth World]] god, Menagerie goes missing and Coldcast is arrested by the JLA for Bhat's murder. Coldcast confesses to the murder and is taken to the Slab prison. There he is visited by the spirit of the recently departed [[Manitou Raven]], who frees him from Menagerie's control.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #10\u201311</ref> Coldcast is exonerated and the team tracks Sonja to Costa Rica. She is taken into JLA custody, deprived of the aliens, and begins a gradual separation that they hope will sever her connection to the symbeasts.<ref>''Justice League Elite'' #12</ref>\n\n====Powers and abilities of Menagerie====\nThe symbeasts can be assembled to shift over the host to form various shapes and weapons such as claws, spikes or whips. Most commonly, they form around the body and take the form of wings, enabling Menagerie to fly. She can also instruct them to take other forms, or detach from her body and operate independently. One creature has a bite that can force its victims to tell the truth. According to Vera Black, there is also a creature among the creche that can create bio-electric bursts. Menagerie has acidic blood as well and Sonja often allows herself to get hurt by her opponents as a combat tactic.\n\n====Menagerie in other media====\nMenagerie appears in ''[[Superman vs. The Elite]]'', voiced by [[Melissa Disney]].\n\nA variation of the Pamela version of Menagerie appears in her self-titled ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' episode portrayed by Jessica Meraz. In this show, '''Pamela Ferrer''' is a jewel thief who got bonded to a snake-like alien, transforming her into Menagerie. After she killed her partner Chuck and some other people, Menagerie was confronted by Supergirl, the Martian Manhunter, Brainiac 5, and [[Alex Danvers]]. Their fight attracted the attention of the Children of Liberty. When Menagerie planned to rob the masquerade ball, she encountered [[Nia Nal]] and Supergirl and George Lockwood show up.

Unfortunately, that same fire destroyed most of his body, and he was forced to wear a containment suit in order to prevent himself from destroying everything he touched. The Russian government then maneuvered him into position to be one of its premier heroes, placing him into a battle against the original [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], who was then calling for complete nuclear disarmament.\n\nThe battle raged for a time between the two heroes, until a nuclear weapon was dropped on the duo while they fought in the Nevada desert. From that debacle arose a new Firestorm, in which Mikhail played a crucial role, along with the original two members of the Firestorm Matrix, Martin Stein and [[Ronnie Raymond]]. He continued as a member of Firestorm in another incarnation, as an Elemental, but was eventually removed from the Firestorm Matrix so that Martin alone could bear the powers. Ronnie and Mikhail returned to their homes, de-powered.\n\nDuring the \"In My Father's House\" storyline in the most recent ''Firestorm'' series, it was revealed that Mikhail is, in fact, once again in control of his former abilities. He was re-powered by a nuclear test gone wrong in Russia. After going by the name of Firestorm for a time (not knowing that a new Firestorm made up of Jason Rusch and Martin Stein had been in operation for some time), he has now changed his identity back to Pozhar.<ref>''Firestorm the Nuclear Men'' (vol. 3) #27 (September 2006)</ref><ref>''Firestorm the Nuclear Men'' (vol. 3) #29 (November 2006)</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The New 52]]'', a reboot of the DC Universe, Professor Mikhail Arkadin helped Professor Martin Stein invent the Firestorm Protocols.<ref name=N52>''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men'' #4 (February 2012)</ref><ref>''The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men'' #8-12 (June\u2013August 2012)</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Pozhar appears as a member of the People's Heroes. He appears on TV, announcing that Russia is closing their borders to all foreigners, be they metahuman or not. During his interview on \"the Superman Theory\", Firestorm used a profanity to describe it and even used another profanity to insult Pozhar, much to the dismay of Martin Stein.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics</ref> Pozhar joined the People's Heroes in trying to catch Firestorm when he was accused of turning some Russians into glass. This causes Superman to come to Firestorm's defense, much to the dismay of Batman.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #8 (December 2018). DC Comics</ref>\n\n====Pozhar in other media====\nMikhail Arkadin appears in ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'', portrayed by Voytek Skrzeta. When the Legends infiltrate Luskavic Labs looking into [[Vandal Savage (Arrowverse)|Vandal Savage]]'s Operation Svarog, Arkadin leads Soviet soldiers in capturing [[Martin Stein (Arrowverse)|Martin Stein]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]] and [[Mick Rory (Arrowverse)|Mick Rory]] and takes them to the Koshmar prison camp. At Koshmar, Arkadin tortures Palmer and Rory in order to get Stein to divulge his knowledge of Firestorm. When [[Jefferson Jackson (Arrowverse)|Jefferson Jackson]] cuts the circuit breaker to Koshmar, a prison riot breaks out. Arkadin attempts to contain the prisoners, but [[Leonard Snart (Arrowverse)|Leonard Snart]] pushes him into a cell with a prisoner named Boris, who proceeds to beat him up. He is killed when [[Valentina Vostok]] (as Firestorm) becomes unstable, causing a nuclear explosion at Koshmar.\n\n===Preus===\n'''Preus''' is a [[fictional]] [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] who first appeared in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #625 (April 2004) and was created by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Talent Caldwell]].<ref name=aos625>''Adventures of Superman'' #625 (April 2004)</ref>\n\nFor years, '''Sergeant Preus''' had proudly served the Citizen's Patrol Corps, a police force that kept the peace in [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] under the [[Kryptonian]] banner of El, their \"creator\".<ref name=aos625/> Due to the compression of time, more than a century had passed inside the bottle city (compared to only a handful of years outside it) during which Preus and his fellow Kandorians had come to worship \"The [[Superman]]\" as their \"god in heaven\" above. The Corpsman was also a devout [[xenophobia|xenophobe]], who dispensed justice against \"non-K\" (Kryptonian) dissidents that threatened their way of life, especially a citizen named [[Kal-El]], who forever tainted Paradise when he seemingly murdered several Kandorians.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |page=319}}</ref>\n\nPreus swore a solemn oath to make the murderer pay, not realizing that Kal-El was actually the Superman that he and the others had worshiped for so long.<ref>''Action Comics'' #813 (May 2004)</ref> He was also unaware that the \"victims\" were constructs created by an alien telepath, [[Lyla (comics)|Lyla]], who had brainwashed Kal-El into believing that Kandor was a never-exploded [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].<ref>''Adventures of Superman'' #626 (May 2004)</ref> Eventually shattering the illusion, Superman escaped Kandor and confronted Lyla back in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. Preus followed them, but exposure to [[Earth]]'s air and yellow sun drastically affected him, giving him strange, new powers equal to Superman's while amplifying his already-unbalanced [[Racism|racist]] views.<ref>''Superman'' (vol. 2) #202\u2013203 (April\u2013May 2004)</ref>\n\nConvinced that Kal-El had defiled the legacy of \"The Superman\", Preus swore to assume that responsibility himself and that all of the impure would die by his hand. His [[xenophobia]] led him to a group of [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] in the American desert, who he forced into worshiping him and his views. However, in time, the people of \"God's Peake\" (as the camp was called) came to worship Preus as their cult leader. His increasing prominence eventually led both the [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Jimmy Olsen]] to investigate, only to have both of them captured by Preus and his men.<ref>''Action Comics'' #821 (January 2005)</ref>\n\nThis forced a confrontation with Superman, who, at the time, was dealing with the effects of [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]]'s synthetic yellow [[kryptonite]], which had significantly aged and weakened Superman in a short period of time. So weakened, Superman was barely able to deal with Preus' legions alone and quickly found himself outclassed by the (at the time) much more vital Preus.<ref>''Action Comics'' #822 (February 2005)</ref>\n\nA last-ditch gambit using kryptonite to try and weaken Preus failed, as Preus revealed a previously unknown resistance to kryptonite. However, he was finally defeated when Superman attacked and destroyed a key portion of Preus' armor, rendering him unconscious. Afterwards, Preus was injured from that attack and had to be hospitalized. His current whereabouts are unknown. He was last seen as a weakened Superman tried to fly him to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] for treatment. Preus disappeared after Superman was engaged by an army of Gogs.<ref>''Action Comics'' #825 (May 2005)</ref>\n\n====Powers and abilities of Preus====\nPreus possesses powers similar to those of Superman, such as superhuman strength and speed, flight, invulnerability, X-ray vision and enhanced senses. Unlike Superman, Preus can fire beams of black energy from his eyes that strike a target with intense heat and force. Preus also does not share Superman's vulnerability to [[kryptonite]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Psiphon===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, '''Psiphon''' is introduced to DC as a [[H.I.V.E.]] warrior who is paired up with the [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Dreadnought|Dreadnought]]. He appears in ''Superboy'' (vol. 4) #20, where the team are dispatched to [[New York City]] to capture [[Doctor Psycho]], who had escaped from a H.I.V.E. facility, and [[Superboy]], whose psionic powers were of interest to the H.I.V.E. Despite proving to be formidable opponents, both Psiphon and the Dreadnought were defeated when Doctor Psycho and Superboy teamed up to take them down. Psiphon was knocked out by Superboy with just a flick of his finger.\n\n====Powers and abilities of Psiphon====\nHaving undergone genetic modifications by the H.I.V.E., Psiphon, as his name implies, has the ability to drain the energy of a psi-powered individual and feed it to the Dreadnought to increase his strength.\n\n===Puppeteer===\n{{Redirect|Puppeteer (comics)|the Marvel Comics character|Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|other uses|Puppet Master (disambiguation){{!}}Puppet Master}}\n{{Comics character list header\n| debut = ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (vol. 2) #1 (July\u2013Aug. 1960)\n| creators = [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]], [[Gil Kane]]\n| alias = Jordan Weir\n| abilities = \"Hypno-ray\" device that allows mind control\n}}\n\nThe '''Puppeteer''', originally known as the '''Puppet Master''', is a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]]. '''Jordan Weir''' was a scientist who created a \"hypno-ray\" which he could use to force his victims to obey his commands. As the Puppet Master, he embarked on a crime spree, manipulating minor criminals into doing his dirty work.\n\nAfter being defeated by Green Lantern, he started a new life as a scientist for Dayton Industries. However, when the company developed the self-generating power source known as Promethium, the temptation was too much for him.<ref>''New Titans'' #8</ref> Through his robot puppets, the Puppeteer took control of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]], [[Wally West|Kid Flash]], [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], and [[Donna Troy|Wonder Girl]] and turned them against their teammates. [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'s soul-self was finally able to break their trance and the Titans united to battle the Puppeteer and his toy robotic army. When the villain was defeated, the H.I.V.E. attempted to destroy him for his failure, but the Puppeteer escaped.<ref>''New Titans'' #9</ref>\n\n====Puppeteer in other media====\n* A supervillain called '''Dollman''' made a one-shot appearance in the 1968 Filmation cartoon series featuring [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. He was, however, more reminiscent of the Puppet Master (a Golden Age Batman foe from ''Detective Comics'' #212).\n* In the ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series, a character named the '''Puppet King''' is probably based on both the Puppet Master and the Puppeteer.\n* The Puppeteer made several background appearances as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd|Grodd's]] [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]] in the final season of ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.\n\n===Purgatory===\n'''Purgatory''' is a supervillain in DC Comics.\n\nPaul Christian is a man who lost his legs in a subway accident. Years later, he was almost injured during a battle involving [[Green Lantern]] V ([[Kyle Rayner]]). To make amends, Kyle used his [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] to give Paul new legs.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #66</ref> Following another accident, it affected Paul's willpower, causing him to lose his legs.<ref>''Green Lantern'' (vol. 3) #67</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event, Paul was desperate to get his legs back. He accepted [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]]'s offer to regain his legs and was given superpowers. As the green flame-emitting Purgatory, he was sent to kill Green Lantern V.

Since Gorshin was in a contract dispute with the series' producers at the time and no longer wanted to play the Riddler as a result of this, the script was rewritten and re-titled \"The Puzzles Are Coming\"/\"The Duo Is Slumming\" and the Riddler was changed to the Puzzler.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Eisner\n| first = Joel \n| title = The Official Batman Batbook\n| format =\n| accessdate =\n| type =\n| year = 1986\n| publisher = Contemporary Books\n| location =\n| language =\n| isbn = 0-8092-5035-7\n| oclc =\n| doi =\n| bibcode =\n| id =\n| page =\n| pages =\n| nopp =\n| chapter =\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Puzzler is referenced in the film ''[[Batman Forever]]'' when [[Riddler#In other media|Edward Nygma]] ([[Jim Carrey]]) suggests villainous nicknames for himself, including \"the Puzzler\", \"the Gamester\", \"Captain Kill\" or \"the Question Mark Man\".\n\nA male Puzzler, with a costume similar to van Haaften's, appears as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Legion of Doom]] in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''.\n\n==Q==\n===Moira Queen===\n'''Moira Queen''' is the mother of [[Green Arrow|Oliver Queen/the Green Arrow]].

She was eventually rescued by the efforts of Arnold Burnsteel and Fate. The pair also freed Fang, Slither, and Gross-Out.

Williams II]].\n\n'''Mr. Auerbach''' (first appearance in ''Flash'' (vol. 2) #238 (May 2008)), was the son of a media mogul whose holdings included the cable news network KN News. He pursued a career in journalism, hoping to work his way up in his father's company. While working on a story, he met Edwar Martinez, who was capable of sensing the fears in others and making them a reality.\nAuerbach eventually was put in charge of KN News, where he had a hand in determining much of the content that the network covered.\n\nHe also led a double life as the villain '''Spin'''. He kept Edwar captive in the basement of the news building, hooking him up to machines and forcing him to watch news coverage. In this setting, Spin was able to channel and direct Edwar's amazing ability.\n\nHis first caper was robbing a Faberg\u00e9 egg from a local auction. He created a distraction by summoning earthquakes, which had been in the public's mind due to a recent quake in [[Hub City (comics)|Hub City]].\n\nHe took advantage of a comment made on television by the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] expressing his financial woes. After the citizens of [[Keystone City]] started to feel some doubt about their local hero, Spin lured him to the Keystone City Salamanders stadium and forced him to steal many valuables from the fans there. This causes a massive public outcry against the Flash, which Spin enhances with his powers, even turning the original Flash against his successor.\n\nWhen Spin and Edwar realized that the Flash had identified the source of the disturbances as emanating from KN News, he used his abilities to summon [[Gorilla Grodd]] to Keystone, the Rogue which Edwar sensed would make the speedster most anxious. Grodd, however, was not pleased with his sudden teleportation and a massive battle ensued. In the chaos, Edwar was released from his machinery and his powers went completely out of control, causing citizens to act out nearly every situation being mentioned in the media.\n\n====Equipment of Spin====\nSpin has a vast array of equipment set up in the basement of the KN News building, where he keeps Edwar Martinez. By forcing Edwar to watch news coverage, he is able to direct and control Edwar's ability to sense specific anxieties in the public consciousness and turn them into reality.\n\nSpin wears a costume with a television screen for a face. Usually static appears on the screen, but when channeling Edwar's powers, the face of his victim or a phrase describing his actions may appear. He can summon this costume by uttering the words \"Load theme\".\n\n====Spin in other media====\nIn ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' [[The Flash (season 5)|season five]], a female version of Spin named '''[[Spencer Young]]''' (portrayed by Kiana Madeira) appears as a young millennial with a blog app dedicated to metahumans. She used to work with [[Iris West]] and now has a rivalry with her competing blog. During the Enlightenment, Young's cellphone was hit with debris from [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]]'s satellite, turning it into meta-tech capable of controlling people's minds. After [[Nora West-Allen|XS]] appears in Central City, Young decides to make her blog more popular by creating headlines starring her and reporting them seconds before they happen. Her plan is eventually thwarted by the Flash and she is remanded to Iron Heights. In that same episode, it is shown that Spin and XS are attracted to each other. In the episode \"Gone Rogue\", Spin's cellphone is stolen by XS and given to [[Bug-Eyed Bandit|Brie Larvan]] as a new way for her to control her robotic bees.\n\n===Stalnoivolk===\n{{Comics character list header\n|debut = ''[[Firestorm the Nuclear Man]]'' #67\n|debutmo = January\n|debutyr = 1988\n|creators = [[John Ostrander]] and [[Joe Brozowski]]\n|abilities = Superhuman strength, durability and longevity\n|alias = Ivan Illyich Gort\n|name = Stalnoivolk\n|CBDBid = 7837\n|GCDid = Stalnoivolk\n}}\n'''Stalnoivolk''' ({{lang|ru|\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043a}} or \"Steel Wolf\") is a [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Universe]].\n\nThe character, created by [[John Ostrander]] and [[Joe Brozowski]], first appeared in ''[[Firestorm the Nuclear Man]]'' #67 (January 1988).\n\nWithin the context of the stories, Ivan Illyich Gort is a Russian born in the 1900s who underwent government experiments during [[World War II]]. He loyally serves the [[Soviet Union]] under the codename \"Stalnoivolk\" as a symbol of Russia's resistance to [[Nazi Germany]]. After the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], he is exiled to [[Siberia]] for his participation in the [[Great Purge|purging]] of the [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{Cite comic\n|writer = John Ostrander\n|penciller = Joe Brozowski\n|story = Dialogues\n|title = Firestorm the Nuclear Man\n|issue = #67\n|date = January 1988\n}}</ref>\n\nHe is reactivated just before the Soviet Union dissolves by Major Zastrow, leader of the [[Red Shadows (comics)|Red Shadows]].

He also encounters the [[Suicide Squad]] more than once.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Starling (Evelyn Crawford)===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the '''Starling''' is introduced as part of the relaunch of ''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' as a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant and markswoman who has been friends with the [[Black Canary]] since they worked undercover together at the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]]'s Iceberg Lounge. She is later chosen by the Black Canary to help reform the Birds of Prey, but later betrays the group.\n\n====Starling in other media====\n* The character later appears in the TV series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' as '''Evelyn Crawford Sharp''', played by Madison McLaughlin. Introduced in season four, she emerges as an impostor Black Canary following Laurel Lance's death. She was a star gymnast before her family became a [[H.I.V.E.]] test subject, leaving Evelyn as the only survivor. Knowing her idol had just died, she briefly took up the identity in her crusade against her parents' killer, more precisely his wife, before giving it up to save her hero's reputation as [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] under the guise, as Green Arrow advised her to do. In season five, Evelyn is recruited by Oliver to train and join Green Arrow's team of vigilantes, taking the codename '''Artemis''' (unlike the comic book version, who calls herself the Starling). Later, she betrays the team to [[Adrian Chase|Prometheus]] as a brief double agent upon learning of Oliver's past as the Hood. Apparently, she regrets to Oliver for betrayal during his captivity by Adrian who seemingly kills her, but this was revealed to be a deception in order to break Oliver psychologically. She later releases Black Siren (Laurel's Earth Two counterpart) and both of them, along with [[Talia al Ghul]], kidnap all members of Team Arrow, including police captain Quentin Lance and Oliver's son William, and take them to Lian Yu island in order to force Oliver into releasing Adrian from jail. Evelyn is seen keeping captured prisoners Thea, Felicity, Curtis and William's mother Samantha in cages with Talia. Oliver and his army of former enemies release the prisoners from the cages, but [[Digger Harkness]] betrays them. Evelyn is defeated and put in a cage, but Oliver promises to come back for her after the reckoning. Her fate is unknown, since Chase detonated the island with explosives and there is no sign or trace that she escaped from the island.\n** In the ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' episode \"Doomworld\", Evelyn Sharp's Artemis mask can be seen in a glass display case alongside other vigilantes' masks inside Damien Darhk's office, who has become Star City's mayor after he and the Legion of Doom changed reality.\n\n===Sy Borgman===\n'''Sy Borgman''' is a retired wheelchair-bound U.S. agent with some cybernetic enhancements and an ally of [[Harley Quinn]] that first appeared in ''Harley Quinn'' (vol. 2) #2 (March 2014)\n\n====Sy Borgman in other media====\nSy Borgman appears in the ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'' TV series voiced by [[Jason Alexander]]. He appears as the owner of an apartment building. As of \"Being Harley Quinn\", Sy Borgman appears as a member of Harley's crew.\n\n===Clarissa Stein===\n'''Clarissa Stein''' is the estranged wife of Professor Martin Stein (a.k.a. one-half of [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]]). She was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Pat Broderick]] and first appeared in ''Firestorm'' (vol. 2) #10.\n\n====Clarissa Stein in other media====\nClarissa Stein is portrayed by [[Isabella Hofmann]] (in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'') and both by Chanelle Stevenson and by [[Emily Tennant]] (in ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'').

In the episode \"The Fury of Firestorm\", the Earth-1 version is a scientist affected by the particle accelerator and is selected as a possible candidate to fuse with Martin Stein as Firestorm's new half after Ronnie Raymond's death (in the destruction of the Singularity), based on him having been affected by the dark matter explosion in a similar manner and possessing the same blood type as Ronnie and Stein. [[Killer Frost|Caitlin Snow]] invites him to fuse with Dr. Stein, considering him the 'better' candidate due to his scientific background, even though [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Jefferson Jackson|Jax Jackson]] seems like a closer genetic match. Henry is upset when the fusion fails; however, the fusion does awaken an uncontrollable nuclear power within him which comes out when he is angry (which has caused him to have a criminal history). He fights the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and the new Firestorm and he loses.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/demore-barnes-cast-as-flashs-tokamak | title= Demore Barnes Cast as 'Flash's' Tokamak | date= August 25, 2015 |first= Brett |last= White| website= ComicBookResources.com| accessdate= March 23, 2016}}</ref> The episodes \"[[Welcome to Earth-2]]\" and \"[[Escape from Earth-2]]\" shows a parallel Earth-2 counterpart, a kind scientist in [[Harrison Wells|Harry Wells]]'s [[S.T.A.R.

She blamed this predicament on Luthor and left the team.\n\nWeeks later, she had stopped using the Sharp and her friend and former teammate, [[Natasha Irons]], convinced Luthor to let her back on the team. She hoped to one day move on to become a member of the [[Teen Titans]] and become the new [[Kid Flash]]. However, her dream was cut short, as Luthor stripped her of her powers at a crucial moment in a battle with the [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)#Blockbuster III|Blockbuster]] III and she was killed.\n\n====Trajectory in other media====\n* The character appears in ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', portrayed by Allison Paige.

Some elements are directly involved in plant [[metabolism]]. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.\n\nA nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]] is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air, and [[hydrogen]], which is obtained from water.\n\nPlants uptake essential elements from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their [[Leaf|leaves]].

Some elements are directly involved in plant [[metabolism]]. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.\n\nA nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]] is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air, and [[hydrogen]], which is obtained from water.\n\nPlants uptake essential elements from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump [[hydrogen ion]]s (H<sup>+</sup>) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s.

The {{convert|6|ha|adj=on|spell=in}} site includes the prison cellblocks, gatehouse, perimeter walls, cottages, and tunnels. It was initially used for [[Convict era of Western Australia|convicts transported from Britain]], but was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. [[Royal Commission]]s were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in [[Fremantle Prison riot|a 1988 riot]] with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security [[Casuarina Prison]].\n\nThe prison was administered by a [[Comptroller General of Convicts (Western Australia)|comptroller general]], sheriff, or director, responsible for the entire convict or prison system in Western Australia, and a superintendent in charge of the prison itself. Prison officers, known as warders in the 19th century, worked under stringent conditions until they achieved representation through the [[Western Australian Prison Officers' Union]]. Convicts were initially of good character as potential future colonists, but less desirable convicts were eventually sent. As a locally-run prison, Fremantle's population was generally short-sentenced white prisoners in the 1890s, with very few Aboriginal prisoners. By the late 20th century, most prisoners were serving longer sentences, a higher proportion of them were violent, and Aboriginal people were over-represented.\n\nPrison life at Fremantle was extremely regulated. Meals were an important part of the day, eaten in the cells throughout the operational life of the prison. Convict or prisoner labour was used on public infrastructure works until around 1911; subsequently, only work inside the prison was allowed, though there was never enough to fully occupy the inmates. Punishments varied over the years, with [[flogging]] and time in [[leg irons|irons]] eventually replaced by lengthening of sentences and deprivation of visitors or entertainment. More than 40 hangings were carried out at Fremantle Prison, which was Western Australia's only lawful place of execution between 1888 and 1984. Prominent escapees included [[Moondyne Joe]], as well as [[John Boyle O'Reilly]] and six other [[Fenian]]s in the 19th century, and [[Brenden Abbott]] in 1989. There have been various riots and other disturbances, with major riots causing damage in 1968 and 1988.\n\nSince 1991, Fremantle Prison has been conserved as a recognised heritage site, and various restoration works have been undertaken. New uses have been found for some buildings within the prison, which has also become a significant tourist attraction. The process of obtaining World Heritage listing as part of the [[Australian Convict Sites]] submission focused historical interpretation and conservation efforts on the prison's convict era (1850{{Spaced en dash}}1886), at the expense of its more recent history, including Aboriginal prisoners held there.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Architecture ==\n{{Main|Architecture of Fremantle Prison}}\n\n=== Layout ===\n{{Wide image|Fremantle Prison map.svg|515px|Fremantle Prison buildings, wall, and tunnels.

In contrast, the cramped cells measured just {{convert|7|by|4|ft|spell = in}}. Although each cell initially had a basin connected to running water, the installation was before the advent of [[S-bend]]s; the smells coming up the pipes led to their removal by the 1860s. Following a [[Royal Commission]], the cells were enlarged by removing a dividing wall from between two cells. Electric lighting was installed in the 1920s, but there were never any toilets \u2013 buckets were used for the duration of the prison's operation.

It also allowed prison administrators to implement the \"[[separate system]]\", whereby prisoners were completely isolated for the first three months of their sentence. A [[panopticon]] in the exercise yard was initially used to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading to its removal within five years. New Division was the first building to have electricity, with underground wiring. During World War II, the Australian Army appropriated the division, to keep their prisoners separate from the main population. In 1994 the building was retrofitted to cater for offices, small business premises, and meeting rooms.<ref name=\"FP New Division\">{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance \u2013 Building Management and Works |title=New Division |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/newdivision/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171842/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/newdivision/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |url-status=dead}} {{webarchive |format=addlarchives |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171842/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/newdivision/Pages/default.aspx |date=13 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Women's Prison ====\nThe north-western complex was originally a service area with a cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry, built in the 1850s. A place for women prisoners was needed following the closure of [[Perth Gaol]] and the transfer of prisoners to Fremantle. The buildings were converted to a prison, and a wall built around them, creating Western Australia's first separate prison for women. Population and crime growth led to them being extended in the 1890s and 1910s. The construction of [[Bandyup Women's Prison]] saw Fremantle's Women's Prison close in 1970, with the space used for education and assessment until the main prison's closure in 1991.<ref name=\"FP womens\" />\n\n==== Hospital ====\nBuilt between 1857 and 1859, the hospital was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance \u2013 Building Management and Works |title=Hospital |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/hospital/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171822/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/hospital/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |url-status=dead}} {{webarchive |format=addlarchives |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501180412/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/hospital/Pages/default.aspx |date=1 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Workshops ====\nThe original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, one of the first buildings to be constructed on the prison site.

Upon arrival to Western Australia, convicts were kept within the prison for a period of observation. If found to have a reasonable disposition, the convict would be sent to work, in a gang under the control of a warder.

A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted at the end of a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison.

Other factors that contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing to go back to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.<ref name=\"Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis\" />\n\nAfter approximately three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, with the last of them locked in their cells just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, [[Karnet Prison Farm|Karnet]], and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the [[Brand\u2013Nalder Ministry|state government]], which did not consider prison reform a priority.<ref name=\"Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis\">{{cite thesis |degree = M.A.|first = Nancy P.|last = Stokes|title = Human Geography Thesis on Fremantle Prison|publisher = [[Graylands Teachers College]]|date = November 1968|url = http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21750802?q=+&versionId=26151783}}</ref>\n\n==== 1988 ====\n{{Main|Fremantle Prison riot}}\nOn 4 January 1988, despite the {{convert|42|C}} heat,<ref name=\"Garton-Smith 2000 CVM\">{{cite journal |last1=Garton-Smith |first1=Jennifer |editor1-last=Witcomb |editor1-first=Andrea |title=Commemoration, Voices and Museums |journal=Open Museum Journal |date=January 2000 |volume=1 |url=http://hosting.collectionsaustralia.net/omj/vol1/pdfs/gsmith.pdf <!--metadata from: http://hosting.collectionsaustralia.net/omj/vol1/gartonsmith.html --> |format=PDF |accessdate=25 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021081309/http://hosting.collectionsaustralia.net/omj/vol1/pdfs/gsmith.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2014 |url-status=dead |publisher=Australian Museums and Galleries Online |via=Collections Australia Network |issn=1443-5144}} {{webarchive |format=addlarchives |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925100934/http://hosting.collectionsaustralia.net/omj/vol1/pdfs/gsmith.pdf |date=25 September 2014}}</ref> officers decided prisoners should remain outside in the exercise yards in the afternoon.

The {{convert|6|ha|adj=on|spell=in}} site includes the prison cellblocks, gatehouse, perimeter walls, cottages, and tunnels. It was initially used for [[Convict era of Western Australia|convicts transported from Britain]], but was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. [[Royal Commission]]s were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in [[Fremantle Prison riot|a 1988 riot]] with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security [[Casuarina Prison]].\n\nThe prison was administered by a [[Comptroller General of Convicts (Western Australia)|comptroller general]], sheriff, or director, responsible for the entire convict or prison system in Western Australia, and a superintendent in charge of the prison itself. Prison officers, known as warders in the 19th century, worked under stringent conditions until they achieved representation through the [[Western Australian Prison Officers' Union]]. Convicts were initially of good character as potential future colonists, but less desirable convicts were eventually sent. As a locally-run prison, Fremantle's population was generally short-sentenced white prisoners in the 1890s, with very few Aboriginal prisoners. By the late 20th century, most prisoners were serving longer sentences, a higher proportion of them were violent, and Aboriginal people were over-represented.\n\nPrison life at Fremantle was extremely regulated. Meals were an important part of the day, eaten in the cells throughout the operational life of the prison. Convict or prisoner labour was used on public infrastructure works until around 1911; subsequently, only work inside the prison was allowed, though there was never enough to fully occupy the inmates. Punishments varied over the years, with [[flogging]] and time in [[leg irons|irons]] eventually replaced by lengthening of sentences and deprivation of visitors or entertainment. More than 40 hangings were carried out at Fremantle Prison, which was Western Australia's only lawful place of execution between 1888 and 1984. Prominent escapees included [[Moondyne Joe]], as well as [[John Boyle O'Reilly]] and six other [[Fenian]]s in the 19th century, and [[Brenden Abbott]] in 1989. There have been various riots and other disturbances, with major riots causing damage in 1968 and 1988.\n\nSince 1991, Fremantle Prison has been conserved as a recognised heritage site, and various restoration works have been undertaken.

The central, four-storey high cell block is flanked on either end by large dormitory wards, called the Association Rooms. Here, as many as 80 men slept in hammocks, either as a reward for good behaviour or because they would soon receive their [[ticket of leave]]. In contrast, the cramped cells measured just {{convert|7|by|4|ft|spell = in}}. Although each cell initially had a basin connected to running water, the installation was before the advent of [[S-bend]]s; the smells coming up the pipes led to their removal by the 1860s. Following a [[Royal Commission]], the cells were enlarged by removing a dividing wall from between two cells. Electric lighting was installed in the 1920s, but there were never any toilets \u2013 buckets were used for the duration of the prison's operation.

It also allowed prison administrators to implement the \"[[separate system]]\", whereby prisoners were completely isolated for the first three months of their sentence. A [[panopticon]] in the exercise yard was initially used to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading to its removal within five years. New Division was the first building to have electricity, with underground wiring. During World War II, the Australian Army appropriated the division, to keep their prisoners separate from the main population. In 1994 the building was retrofitted to cater for offices, small business premises, and meeting rooms.<ref name=\"FP New Division\">{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance \u2013 Building Management and Works |title=New Division |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/newdivision/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171842/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/newdivision/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} {{webarchive |format=addlarchives |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171842/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/newdivision/Pages/default.aspx |date=13 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Women's Prison ====\nThe north-western complex was originally a service area with a cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry, built in the 1850s. A place for women prisoners was needed following the closure of [[Perth Gaol]] and the transfer of prisoners to Fremantle. The buildings were converted to a prison, and a wall built around them, creating Western Australia's first separate prison for women. Population and crime growth led to them being extended in the 1890s and 1910s. The construction of [[Bandyup Women's Prison]] saw Fremantle's Women's Prison close in 1970, with the space used for education and assessment until the main prison's closure in 1991.<ref name=\"FP womens\" />\n\n==== Hospital ====\nBuilt between 1857 and 1859, the hospital was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |author1=The Department of Finance \u2013 Building Management and Works |title=Hospital |url=http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/hospital/Pages/default.aspx |website=Fremantle Prison |publisher=Government of Western Australia |accessdate=10 August 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213171822/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/hospital/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=13 February 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }} {{webarchive |format=addlarchives |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140501180412/http://www.fremantleprison.com.au/Cultural_Heritage/prisonbuildings/hospital/Pages/default.aspx |date=1 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==== Workshops ====\nThe original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, one of the first buildings to be constructed on the prison site.

Other factors that contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing to go back to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.<ref name=\"Stokes 1968 Human geography thesis\" />\n\nAfter approximately three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, with the last of them locked in their cells just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, [[Karnet Prison Farm|Karnet]], and Barton's Mill.

Samaritans base it solely on a passage called the ''[[Haazinu#In Samaritan interpretation|Haazinu]]'' in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], since they accept only the [[Torah]] and reject the rest of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nThe resurrection of the dead is a core belief in the [[Mishnah]] which was assembled in the early centuries of the Christian era.<ref>[[Jacob Neusner]], ''World Religions in America: An Introduction'' (2009), p. 133: \"He who says, the resurrection of the dead is a teaching which does not derive from the Torah. ...Excluded are those who deny the resurrection of the dead, or deny that the Torah teaches that the dead will live.\"</ref> The belief in resurrection is expressed on all occasions in the [[Jewish liturgy]]; e.g., in the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Morning|morning prayer ''Elohai Neshamah'']], in the ''[[Shemoneh Esrei|Shemoneh 'Esreh]]'' and in the [[Bereavement in Judaism|funeral services]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=233&letter=R&search=Resurrection#656 |title=Resurrection: Jewish Creed or Not? |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> [[Maimonides]] made it the last of his [[Thirteen Articles of Faith]]: \"I firmly believe that there will take place a revival of the dead at a time which will please the Creator, blessed be His name.\"<ref>David Birnbaum, Jews, Church & Civilization, Volume III (Millennium Education Foundation 2005), p. 157</ref>\n\nThere are three explicit examples in the Hebrew Bible of people being resurrected from the dead:\n* The prophet [[Elijah]] prays and God raises a young boy from death (1 Kings 17:17\u201324)\n* [[Elisha]] raises the son of the Shunammite woman (2 Kings 4:32\u201337); this was the very same child whose birth he previously foretold (2 Kings 4:8\u201316)\n* A dead man's body that was thrown into the dead Elisha's tomb is resurrected when the body touches Elisha's bones (2 Kings 13:21)\n\nDuring the [[Second Temple period]], Judaism developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.<ref>2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.</ref> Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],<ref>1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.</ref> in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]],<ref>2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5</ref> and [[2 Esdras]]. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is \"little or no clear reference \u2026 either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead\" in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.<ref>Philip R. Davies. \"Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls\" in Alan J. Avery-Peck & Jacob Neusner (eds.)

Leiden 2000:209.</ref> Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],<ref>Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acts 23.8.</ref> but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.<ref>Acts 23.8.</ref> According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and \"pass into other bodies,\" while \"the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.\"<ref>Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14\u201315.</ref> [[Paul the Apostle]], who also was a Pharisee,<ref>Acts 23.6, 26.5.</ref> said that at the resurrection what is \"sown as a natural body is raised a spiritual body.\"<ref>1 Corinthians 15.35\u201353</ref> [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] refers only to the resurrection of the soul, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.<ref>Jubilees 23.31</ref>\n\nHarry Sysling, in his 1996 study of ''Te\u1e25iyyat Ha-Metim'' in the Palestinian [[Targum]]im, identifies a consistent usage of the term \"[[second death]]\" in texts from the Second Temple period and [[Rabbinical literature|early rabbinical writings]], but ''not in the Hebrew Bible''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblestudytools.com/job/|title=Bool of Job|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"Second death\" is identified with judgment, followed by resurrection from ''Gehinnom'' (\"[[Gehenna]]\") at the [[End time#Judaism|Last Day]].<ref>Harry Sysling, ''Te\u1e25iyyat ha-metim: the resurrection of the dead in the Palestinian Targums'' (1996), p. 222: \"Here the second death is identical with the judgment in Gehinnom.

Andr\u00e9 Dartigues has observed that especially \"from the 17th to the 19th century, the language of popular piety no longer evoked the resurrection of the soul but [[Eternal life (Christianity)|everlasting life]].
