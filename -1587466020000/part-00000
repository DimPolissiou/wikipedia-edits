It is also known for the [[Locarno Treaties]], a series of European territorial agreements negotiated here in October 1925.\n\nIn January 2004, the [[Italy|Italian]] [[historian]] Marino Vigano speculated that [[Castello Visconteo (Locarno)|Locarno's castle]] may have been designed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistoric Locarno===\nIn 1934 in the vicinity of today's Via S. Jorio, a [[necropolis]] with 14 [[Urn#Cremation urns|urn graves]] from the Early [[Bronze Age]] (about 14th century BC) were found. Some of the urns were directly buried, while others were placed in boxes of uncut stone. The urns contained, in addition to burned bones, [[bronze]] ornaments, which had some fire damage, including, bangles, hair pins with conical head and slightly thickened neck, rings and knives. Similar urns were also discovered in the district of S. Antonio, which was probably also a small cemetery. The ceramic and bronze objects date from the [[Canegrate culture]] (named after a large necropolis in the province of Milan). However, no traces of the settlement have been discovered.<ref name=HDS_Pre>{{HDS|2108<!--Section 1-1-->|Locarno \u2013 Prehistory}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, a large necropolis was discovered at [[Solduno]]. The over 200 graves cover nearly a thousand years, from the [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] to the 3rd century AD. Many of the La T\u00e8ne era grave goods (particularly from the 3rd\u20131st centuries BC) are [[Celts|Celtic]] style [[Fibula (brooch)|Fibulae]] or brooches. These objects demonstrate a cultural influence from regions north of the Alps. However, the ceramic objects are indigenous to [[Golasecca culture]] which spread into Ticino and [[Lombardy]].<ref name=HDS_Pre/>\n\n===Roman era===\nBetween 1946 and 1949, a number of [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]] tombs were discovered on the terrace between the churches of Santa Maria in Selva and San Giovanni Battista in Solduno. The Roman city that became Locarno was therefore between the [[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]] of Muralto and this cemetery. Unfortunately, intensive construction and agricultural activity have destroyed most traces of the ancient city. In 1995 and 1997, 57 graves were found in Via Valle Maggia. Nineteen were from the Roman period, which confirms that even in the [[3rd century]] AD cremation and body burials were practiced side by side. Among other significant finds, a number of glass items were discovered. The Roman necropolis was used from the end of the prehistoric [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne era]] until the middle of the 3rd century AD. The extensive [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] of Locarno wiped out much of the local culture and replaced it with ancient Roman elements. However, it appears that there was no Roman ruling class which could have dominated the local population.<ref name=HDS_early>{{HDS|2108<!--Section 1-2-->|Locarno \u2013 Roman Era to Early Modern Era}}</ref>\n\n===Capitanei di Locarno===\nThe '''capitanei''' were a group of prominent noble families who emerged in the early Middle Ages and led Locarno. The term is first mentioned in a document granting [[market right]]s to the town by the [[Holy Roman Empire|Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] in 1164. This title was originally reserved only the direct [[vassals]] of the king's [[fief]]. The lower vassals were known as ''valvassores'', but could have been awarded the title of ''capitanei'' as a special concession. The original ''capitanei'' were probably descendants of the old [[Lombards|Lombard]] noble family of Da Besozzo from the [[county]] of Seprio, a historic region of [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard Italy]] which comprised areas in southern Ticino and modern day Italian provinces of [[Province of Varese|Varese]] and [[Province of Como|Como]] on the western side of Lake Maggiore, and was centered in [[Castelseprio (archaeological park)|Castelseprio]], some 20 kilometres south of Locarno.\n\nAround 1000, the family was granted a fief in Locarno by the schismatic [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Como|Bishop of Como]] Landolfo da Carcano. The ''capitanei'' were given the right to manage the property of the Church entrusted to the local [[pieve]], they had the rights of immunity and coercion, but were not owners of the village cooperatives' (''vicini'') land, with the exception of the churches and royal estates. They did not have the right of [[High, middle and low justice|high justice]] so their political power was limited. However, they played an important role in the later conflicts in the 13th and 14th century between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]] and in the wars between Como and the [[Duchy of Milan]].\n\nIn Locarno, during the [[Reformation]] period in the 16th century, two of the three great feudal families of capitanei, the Muralto and the Orelli families, left the town and moved to [[Z\u00fcrich]]. A branch of the Muraltos was established in [[Bern]]. The third great Locarno family, the Magoria, remained in Locarno. The ''capitanei'' retained a central role in Locarno's politics until 1798. In 1803, the lands and rights of the ''capitanei'' were integrated into the political municipality of Locarno.<ref>{{HDS|41282|Capitanei di Locarno}}</ref>\n\n===Early Locarno===\n[[File:Tessin2006 picture 049.jpg|thumb|Harbor of Locarno. Trade along the lake allowed Locarno to flourish]]\nStarting in the Lombard period (after 569), the area around Locarno (and presumably the town) was part of the county Stazzona and later the [[March (territory)|Mark]] of Lombardy.  Locarno is first mentioned in 807 as ''Leocarni''. In German, it came to be known as ''Luggarus, Lucarius, Lucaris''.<ref name=HDS/> It is likely that a market existed at or near the lake since the Roman era.  The long history of the town and its location led to the creation of a royal court, which is first mentioned in 866.  During the [[Middle Ages]] Locarno and Ascona formed a community, with several, separate neighborhoods.  The community managed its [[the commons|common goods]] (alpine pastures, pastures, forests, churches) and tax officials and police.\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Bishop of Milan]] began to consolidate more and more power to himself at the expense of the [[Kingdom of Germany|Kings of the Germans]].  This expansion by Milan was countered by [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], who incorporated Locarno in 1002/04 with the surrounding areas into the Diocese of Como. [[Friedrich Barbarossa]] granted extensive [[market town|market rights]] to Locarno in 1164 and granted [[imperial immediacy]] in 1186. Due to these privileges, Locarno developed substantial local autonomy, which assisted the development of municipal institutions. The nobles (''Nobili'') lost more and more rights to the citizens (''borghesi''). By 1224, the ''borghesi'' had their own administration and various privileges, including: market rights, the right to their own weights, maintenance of mills and grazing rights in Saleggi, in Colmanicchio (''Alp Vignasca'') and in the Magadino and Quartino valleys.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nLocarno was the administrative center of the [[parish]] of Locarno.  The ''[[Podest\u00e0]]'' or high government official, resided in the Casa della Gallinazza, which was burned in 1260 during the clashes between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Several Locarno families, including members of the ''Capitanei di Locarno'' and Simone da Orello, played an important role in the battles between the two factions. In 1342, Luchino and Giovanni [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] conquered the area, which brought Locarno back under the power of [[Milan]]. In 1439, Count Franchino Rusca was awarded Locarno as a fief.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nIn 1291, a [[Humiliati]] monastery was first mentioned in Locarno.  St. Catherine's church, attached to the monastery, probably dates to the mid-14th century.<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\n===Under the Swiss Confederation===\n[[File:Struktur Eidgen 1530.png|thumb|Swiss Confederation in 1530, showing Locarno and other territories of the Ticino region]]\nThe rule of the Rusca ended 1503, when the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Confederates]] occupied Locarno, but failed to conquer the Visconti castle. After the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|battle of Novara]] in 1513, the French King [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] gave the Confederates the castle.  In the Treaty of Freiburg in 1516, they received all of Locarno.  The Twelve Cantons took turns appointing a governor ({{lang-it|commissario}}), to rule over Locarno.  The governor had both civil and criminal jurisdiction, except in certain cases after 1578, where seven judges were elected by the locals to try the cases.  On taking office, the Governor swore under oath to obey the statutes of Locarno.  The Governor was supported by a local mayor, and criminal fines were usually given to local community.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nThe rule of the Twelve Cantons also had an effect on the social and political relations of the town. In addition to the nobility (representing the three old noble families Orelli, Muralto and Magoria) and citizens, there was a third group.  This third group, the ''terrieri'', was a group of residents who had lived a long time in Locarno, but were not citizens.  Each of the three groups were a [[statutory corporation]], with shared property and a governing body.  Under the Confederation, each of these groups or corporations had representation in the ''Consiglio Magnifico'' which ruled Locarno.  However, the town's dominance over the villages in the region, until 1798, is clearly shown in their representation in the Council.  The three groups in Locarno had twelve aldermen (six nobles, four citizens and two ''terrieri''), while all the rural communities together had only eight members.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Locarno was centered around the intersection of Via Cittadella and Via S. Antonio.  The town stretched up the slope of the mountain and behind the castle. Some houses lined the shore, and above the Contrada Borghese a small, almost rural settlement grew up.  The center of town was dominated by town houses with their large courtyards and gardens.  The members of the upper class also owned small country houses with [[vineyards]], which went up the hill behind Locarno as well as in Solduno and [[Cugnasco]].  Locarno also had several noble [[Estate (land)|estates]] during the [[Late Middle Ages]], including the so-called Cittadella.  The buildings of the 17th and 18th Centuries, including the Casa Simona (16th to 18th century), the Casa Rusca from the first half of the 18th century (now the seat of the municipal art gallery) and the Casa del Negromante, were built on older structures and didn't change the layout of the town.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\n===Locarno's castles===\n[[File:Castello Visconteo3.jpg|thumb|Castello Visconteo]]\n{{Main|Castello Visconteo (Locarno)}}\nThere were several castles from the [[Early Middle Ages]] in Locarno.  One was destroyed by the Milanese in 1156.  Another, first mentioned in 1210 as Orelli castle, was occupied in 1342 occupied by the Visconti and enlarged.  This castle came to be known as Visconti Castle.  In 1531, the Confederates demolished much of the castle, leaving only the central core.  The castle was used as the residence of the governor, but in the following centuries, it began to fall apart.  From 1804 to 1909, the castle was the seat of the administrative governor and the District Court.  After 1909, it came into the possession of the city and was renovated in 1921\u201328.  Since 1920, it houses the city and Archaeological Museum.  In 1507, a defensive bastion or [[ravelin]] was added to protect the castle entrance.  It is likely that Leonardo da Vinci designed this structure.<ref name=\"Swissinfo 11 Aug\">{{cite news |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Locarno_gets_its_own_da_Vinci_mystery.html?cid=5371158 |title= Locarno gets its own da Vinci mystery |author=Gehring, Fran\u00e7oise |location=Locarno, Switzerland |date=11 August 2006 |publisher=SSR SRG |work=Swissinfo.com |accessdate=3 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=HDS_early/> North-east of the castle is Palazzo Casorella (Casa degli Orelli) from the 16th century.\n\n===Early modern Locarno===\n[[File:View from Monte Ceneri road toward Locarno.jpg|thumb|Vineyards above Locarno]]\nDuring the Middle Ages, the economy of Locarno and the whole region was closely linked with the nobles who owned the market, fishing, alpine and grazing rights and [[tithe]]s. Starting in the 13th century, some of these privileges went to the citizens corporation.  The hill areas were dominated by [[viticulture]], while grain was raised in the plains. Within the town, vegetables and fruits were grown. Artisans and stores were concentrated in the interior of the town. The repeatedly flooded shorelines and the alpine pastures were used for grazing. In the early modern period, Locarno developed into a thriving commercial center on an important road that linked the major cities of [[Lombardy]], with German-speaking Switzerland and Germany. Cereals and salt came from the Lombardy and [[Piedmont]] to Locarno, while Locarno and its hinterland (especially the [[Valle Maggia|Maggia Valley]]) provided large quantities of wood and cattle to Italy.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nThe [[parish church]] of Locarno, S. Antonio Abate, was first built in 1353\u201354. It was replaced by the current building in 1664. The decoration of the church was financed, primarily, by the grain traders at the end of the 17th century, and the chapel [[fresco]]es are by Giuseppe Antonio Felice Orelli from 1742. The citizens of Locarno had the right to appoint priests at S. Antonio Abate, S. Maria in Selva (consecrated in 1424, since 1884 only the [[choir]] and bell tower remain) and SS Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti (consecrated 1621). The church of San Francesco, together with the adjoining convent, were built in the early 13th century. The church's first consecration was probably in 1230, but the first documented consecration of the church was in 1316. It was rebuilt and enlarged between 1538\u20131675 using construction material from Visconti Castle. San Francesco hosted the meetings of the nobility and the citizens. Starting in the 16th century, the appointed Governor swore his oath in the church.<ref name=HDS_Religion>{{HDS|2108<!--Section 1-3-->|Locarno \u2013 Religious Life}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Humiliati]] order was suppressed and St. Catherine's church and monastery closed. All three ruling groups of Locarno agreed to convert the church and monastery into the Hospital S. Carlo. The Hospital remained until 1854 when it closed, due to financial reasons.<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\nIn the 16th century, Locarno's population declined as a result of exodus of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in 1576\u201377. After a recovery in the 17th century, the population declined considerably in the 18th century again.\n\n===Protestant Reformation===\nBy 1535, there was a [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] community known as the ''ecclesia christiana locarnensis'' in Locarno. They owed their existence to the work of Giovanni Beccaria, several notables of the town (including Taddeo Duni) and religious refugees from [[Milan]] and Piedmont. To counteract the tensions, the Protestant community and the Catholic clergy met for a debate on 8 May 1549. At the end of the debate, Beccaria was imprisoned. However, because of protests against his arrest, he was immediately released. In 1550, Locarno declared itself to be a Catholic town, but a large group continued to practice the Protestant faith. However, in 1554, the Diet of Baden issued an ultimatum to the Protestants, either renounce new faith or go into exile. On 3 March 1555, over 100 people left Locarno to emigrate to [[Z\u00fcrich]].<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\nIn the course of [[Counter-Reformation]] in the 17th century, many religious buildings in Locarno were renewed or rebuilt. These include the 1604 church dedicated to SS Sebastiano e Rocco with the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery and the church of S. Maria Assunta (Chiesa Nuova).<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\n===The Canton of Ticino===\nUnder the [[Helvetic Republic]] (1798\u20131803) Locarno was part of the [[Canton of Lugano]].  Following the collapse of the Helvetic Republic, the [[Act of Mediation]], in 1803, created the Canton of Ticino with Locarno as an independent municipality.  The Helvetic Republic was very liberal and attempted to reform much of Swiss society.  However, the changes were too great and the Republic collapsed.  The compromise Act of Mediation changed some aspects of society but left others unchanged.  The new municipality of Lucarno was no longer ruled by three different ''[[B\u00fcrgergemeinde|patriziati]]'', which had emerged from the three groups (nobles, ''borghesi'' and ''terrieri''), but until the mid-19th century there were institutions that reached back to the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Ancien R\u00e9gime]].  For example, the community of Locarno and Ascona was dissolved in 1805.  Nevertheless, a \"committee of the representatives of the former communities of Locarno\" managed, for several decades, the S. Carlo Hospital and schools, which had been shared by the ''patriziati'' of the old, combined community.  However, the power of the old ''patriziati'' gradually weakened.  In 1859, the ''terrieri'' decided to set aside their corporation.  The nobles corporation distributed its assets in 1866\u201367 to its members and dissolved the archive, but retained until about 1920, the fishing rights. Only the citizens corporation has preserved its status as a civil community.<ref name=HDS_Modern>{{HDS|2108<!--Section 1-4-->|Locarno \u2013 19th and 20th Centuries}}</ref>\n[[File:Locarno 1.jpg|thumb|left|Piazza Grande]]\nThe Constitution of 1814, established Locarno, Bellinzona and [[Lugano]] as the capitals of the canton, in a six-year rotation. Locarno was the capital of the canton in 1821\u201327, 1839\u201345, 1857\u201363 and 1875\u201381. In 1838\u201339, on the initiative of a group of notables, a government building was built. It was sold in 1893 to private company. It then became the headquarters of Credito Ticinese and since 1917 it has been the headquarters of the [[Electricity Company of Sopraceneri]].  Locarno was repeatedly the scene of political clashes.  In 1839 and 1841, uprisings against the government broke out. In 1855, a murder in a coffee house was used as a pretext for a coup of radicals (''pronunciamento'').  Another coup, the Ticino coup of 1890, did nothing to change the balance of power between the parties in the city. After a liberal [[Mayor of Locarno|mayor]] ruled for 35 consecutive years (1865\u201380), a conservative mayor ruled for another 36 years (1880\u20131916).<ref name=HDS_Modern/>\n\nTo break the conservative hegemony of the late 19th century, the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democrats]], allied with the [[Liberal Party of Switzerland|Liberals]] in 1916 elections.  They succeeded to a majority in the city government (which then consisted of nine members, but in 1987 was limited to seven), which they kept in the following decades.<ref name=HDS_Modern/>\n\nIn the 19th century, the population in Locarno grew noticeably compared to neighboring communities. As early as 1836, the immigrant population was over 16% of the population. Between 1860\u201380, the population fell slightly  mainly because of emigration to [[California]]. In the following decades, the growth rates were below those of other population centers of the canton, which, unlike Locarno, benefited directly from the [[Gotthard railway]].\n\nIn 1816, the special rights and title of the old mother church of San Vittore in [[Muralto]] went over to S. Antonio Abate.  In 1863, snow collecting on the roof of the church caused the [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] to collapse, killing 40 people.  The citizens collective or ''borghesi'' lacked the resources to repair the church.  Therefore, in 1866, the ownership and maintenance of the churches of S. Antonio and S. Maria in Selva were given to the town as a whole.  For financial reasons, the collapsed church was not completely repaired.  Only the fa\u00e7ade and central vault were rebuilt and the choir was expanded.<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\nBetween 1863 and '74, church of San Francesco had to be used for services, and after 1798, the Assemblies of the neighborhoods, the city and the county were held in the church. In 1814, the church of San Francesco was [[secularized]] and the [[Franciscans]] had to leave. The church and convent served from 1821 until 1827 as the State Government offices. From 1848\u201363, the church was closed for worship, and in 1874 it was converted into a barracks and a salt storage. In 1924, it was converted back into a church and used by Benedictines for [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] services delivered in the [[German language]]. The [[Jesuits]] took over this task from 1947 until 1992. The monastery was secularized in 1848, and after the 1893\u201394 renovation, it housed the first high school. Then in 1930 it was used for teacher training.\n\n===Modern Locarno===\nBetween 1935 and '92, the newspaper, ''L'Eco di Locarno'' was printed in Locarno.  In 1992, it merged with the official newspaper of the Liberal party ''Il dovere'' to create the daily newspaper ''La Regione''. Since 1987, the only German language newspaper in Ticino, the ''Tessiner Zeitung'', is published three times each week in Locarno.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Locarno1.jpg|thumb|Locarno]]\nLocarno has an area, {{as of|1997|lc=on}}, of {{convert|19.27|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

[[Pluto]], the final planet in the model, can be found {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} away from this starting point in the village of Tegna.\n\n===Madonna del Sasso, Cardada and Cimetta===\nThe sanctuary of [[Madonna del Sasso, Switzerland|Madonna del Sasso]] in [[Orselina]] above the city is the principal sight and goal of pilgrimage in the city.\n\nThe founding of the sanctuary goes back to a vision of the Virgin Mary that the [[Franciscan]] brother Bartolomeo d'Ivrea experienced in the night of 14/15 August 1480. The interior is highly decorated, and a platform has views of the city.\n\nThe [[Locarno\u2013Madonna del Sasso funicular]] links Locarno city centre with the Madonna del Sasso sanctuary and Orselina. From Orselina, a [[aerial lift|cable car]] operates to the top of [[Cardada]] (el. {{convert|1340|m|ft|abbr=on}}), and a [[chair lift]] goes further to the top of [[Cimetta]] (el. {{convert|1671|m|ft|abbr=on}}).\n\n===Castello Visconteo===\n[[Visconteo Castle (Locarno)|Castello Visconteo]], on the edge of the old town, was built in the 12th century, probably as the residence of a Captain Orelli, who remained true to the Emperor. In 1260, it fell into the hands of the [[Ghibelline]]s. In 1342 the Visconti of Milan, for whom it is now named, attacked the castle from both the land and the lake side and took it. It first came into the hands of the ''[[Old Swiss Confederation|Eidgenossen]]'' in 1503. Today, only a fifth of the original structure remains. Most of that dates from the 15th and 16th centuries. Only the foundation remains from the original structure.\n\n==Politics==\nIn the [[2007 Swiss federal election|2007 federal election]] the most popular party was the [[FDP.The Liberals|FDP]] which received 34.88% of the vote.  The next three most popular parties were the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|SP]] (19.72%), the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|CVP]] (18.75%) and the [[Ticino League]] (9.54%).  In the federal election, a total of 3,303 votes were cast, and the [[voter turnout]] was 40.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/kataloge-datenbanken/tabellen.assetdetail.216301.html|publisher= Swiss Federal Statistical Office |title=Nationalratswahlen 2007: St\u00e4rke der Parteien nach Gemeinden|language= German|trans-title=National council elections 2007: strength of the parties and voter turnout by municipality| accessdate= 1 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the {{as of|2007|alt=2007}} ''[[Ticino#Government|Gran Consiglio]]'' election, there were a total of 8,555 registered voters in Locarno, of which 4,291 or 50.2% voted.  90 blank ballots and 15 null ballots were cast, leaving 4,186 valid ballots in the election.

It is also known for the [[Locarno Treaties]], a series of European territorial agreements negotiated here in October 1925.\n\nIn January 2004, the [[Italy|Italian]] [[historian]] Marino Vigano speculated that [[Castello Visconteo (Locarno)|Locarno's castle]] may have been designed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistoric Locarno===\nIn 1934 in the vicinity of today's Via S. Jorio, a [[necropolis]] with 14 [[Urn#Cremation urns|urn graves]] from the Early [[Bronze Age]] (about 14th century BC) were found. Some of the urns were directly buried, while others were placed in boxes of uncut stone. The urns contained, in addition to burned bones, [[bronze]] ornaments, which had some fire damage, including, bangles, hair pins with conical head and slightly thickened neck, rings and knives. Similar urns were also discovered in the district of S. Antonio, which was probably also a small cemetery. The ceramic and bronze objects date from the [[Canegrate culture]] (named after a large necropolis in the province of Milan). However, no traces of the settlement have been discovered.<ref name=HDS_Pre>{{HDS|2108<!--Section 1-1-->|Locarno \u2013 Prehistory}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, a large necropolis was discovered at [[Solduno]]. The over 200 graves cover nearly a thousand years, from the [[La T\u00e8ne culture]] to the 3rd century AD. Many of the La T\u00e8ne era grave goods (particularly from the 3rd\u20131st centuries BC) are [[Celts|Celtic]] style [[Fibula (brooch)|Fibulae]] or brooches. These objects demonstrate a cultural influence from regions north of the Alps. However, the ceramic objects are indigenous to [[Golasecca culture]] which spread into Ticino and [[Lombardy]].<ref name=HDS_Pre/>\n\n===Roman era===\nBetween 1946 and 1949, a number of [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]] tombs were discovered on the terrace between the churches of Santa Maria in Selva and San Giovanni Battista in Solduno. The Roman city that became Locarno was therefore between the [[Vicus (Rome)|vicus]] of Muralto and this cemetery. Unfortunately, intensive construction and agricultural activity have destroyed most traces of the ancient city. In 1995 and 1997, 57 graves were found in Via Valle Maggia. Nineteen were from the Roman period, which confirms that even in the [[3rd century]] AD cremation and body burials were practiced side by side. Among other significant finds, a number of glass items were discovered. The Roman necropolis was used from the end of the prehistoric [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne era]] until the middle of the 3rd century AD. The extensive [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] of Locarno wiped out much of the local culture and replaced it with ancient Roman elements. However, it appears that there was no Roman ruling class which could have dominated the local population.<ref name=HDS_early>{{HDS|2108<!--Section 1-2-->|Locarno \u2013 Roman Era to Early Modern Era}}</ref>\n\n===Capitanei di Locarno===\nThe '''capitanei''' were a group of prominent noble families who emerged in the early Middle Ages and led Locarno. The term is first mentioned in a document granting [[market right]]s to the town by the [[Holy Roman Empire|Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]] in 1164. This title was originally reserved only the direct [[vassals]] of the king's [[fief]]. The lower vassals were known as ''valvassores'', but could have been awarded the title of ''capitanei'' as a special concession. The original ''capitanei'' were probably descendants of the old [[Lombards|Lombard]] noble family of Da Besozzo from the [[county]] of Seprio, a historic region of [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombard Italy]] which comprised areas in southern Ticino and modern day Italian provinces of [[Province of Varese|Varese]] and [[Province of Como|Como]] on the western side of Lake Maggiore, and was centered in [[Castelseprio (archaeological park)|Castelseprio]], some 20 kilometres south of Locarno.\n\nAround 1000, the family was granted a fief in Locarno by the schismatic [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Como|Bishop of Como]] Landolfo da Carcano. The ''capitanei'' were given the right to manage the property of the Church entrusted to the local [[pieve]], they had the rights of immunity and coercion, but were not owners of the village cooperatives' (''vicini'') land, with the exception of the churches and royal estates. They did not have the right of [[High, middle and low justice|high justice]] so their political power was limited. However, they played an important role in the later conflicts in the 13th and 14th century between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]] and in the wars between Como and the [[Duchy of Milan]].\n\nIn Locarno, during the [[Reformation]] period in the 16th century, two of the three great feudal families of capitanei, the Muralto and the Orelli families, left the town and moved to [[Z\u00fcrich]]. A branch of the Muraltos was established in [[Bern]]. The third great Locarno family, the Magoria, remained in Locarno. The ''capitanei'' retained a central role in Locarno's politics until 1798. In 1803, the lands and rights of the ''capitanei'' were integrated into the political municipality of Locarno.<ref>{{HDS|41282|Capitanei di Locarno}}</ref>\n\n===Early Locarno===\n[[File:Tessin2006 picture 049.jpg|thumb|Harbor of Locarno. Trade along the lake allowed Locarno to flourish]]\nStarting in the Lombard period (after 569), the area around Locarno (and presumably the town) was part of the county Stazzona and later the [[March (territory)|Mark]] of Lombardy.  Locarno is first mentioned in 807 as ''Leocarni''. In German, it came to be known as ''Luggarus, Lucarius, Lucaris''.<ref name=HDS/> It is likely that a market existed at or near the lake since the Roman era.  The long history of the town and its location led to the creation of a royal court, which is first mentioned in 866.  During the [[Middle Ages]] Locarno and Ascona formed a community, with several, separate neighborhoods.  The community managed its [[the commons|common goods]] (alpine pastures, pastures, forests, churches) and tax officials and police.\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Bishop of Milan]] began to consolidate more and more power to himself at the expense of the [[Kingdom of Germany|Kings of the Germans]].  This expansion by Milan was countered by [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]], who incorporated Locarno in 1002/04 with the surrounding areas into the Diocese of Como. [[Friedrich Barbarossa]] granted extensive [[market town|market rights]] to Locarno in 1164 and granted [[imperial immediacy]] in 1186. Due to these privileges, Locarno developed substantial local autonomy, which assisted the development of municipal institutions. The nobles (''Nobili'') lost more and more rights to the citizens (''borghesi''). By 1224, the ''borghesi'' had their own administration and various privileges, including: market rights, the right to their own weights, maintenance of mills and grazing rights in Saleggi, in Colmanicchio (''Alp Vignasca'') and in the Magadino and Quartino valleys.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nLocarno was the administrative center of the [[parish]] of Locarno.  The ''[[Podest\u00e0]]'' or high government official, resided in the Casa della Gallinazza, which was burned in 1260 during the clashes between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Several Locarno families, including members of the ''Capitanei di Locarno'' and Simone da Orello, played an important role in the battles between the two factions. In 1342, Luchino and Giovanni [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] conquered the area, which brought Locarno back under the power of [[Milan]]. In 1439, Count Franchino Rusca was awarded Locarno as a fief.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nIn 1291, a [[Humiliati]] monastery was first mentioned in Locarno.  St. Catherine's church, attached to the monastery, probably dates to the mid-14th century.<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\n===Under the Swiss Confederation===\n[[File:Struktur Eidgen 1530.png|thumb|Swiss Confederation in 1530, showing Locarno and other territories of the Ticino region]]\nThe rule of the Rusca ended 1503, when the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Confederates]] occupied Locarno, but failed to conquer the Visconti castle. After the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|battle of Novara]] in 1513, the French King [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] gave the Confederates the castle.  In the Treaty of Freiburg in 1516, they received all of Locarno.  The Twelve Cantons took turns appointing a governor ({{lang-it|commissario}}), to rule over Locarno.  The governor had both civil and criminal jurisdiction, except in certain cases after 1578, where seven judges were elected by the locals to try the cases.  On taking office, the Governor swore under oath to obey the statutes of Locarno.  The Governor was supported by a local mayor, and criminal fines were usually given to local community.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nThe rule of the Twelve Cantons also had an effect on the social and political relations of the town. In addition to the nobility (representing the three old noble families Orelli, Muralto and Magoria) and citizens, there was a third group.  This third group, the ''terrieri'', was a group of residents who had lived a long time in Locarno, but were not citizens.  Each of the three groups were a [[statutory corporation]], with shared property and a governing body.  Under the Confederation, each of these groups or corporations had representation in the ''Consiglio Magnifico'' which ruled Locarno.  However, the town's dominance over the villages in the region, until 1798, is clearly shown in their representation in the Council.  The three groups in Locarno had twelve aldermen (six nobles, four citizens and two ''terrieri''), while all the rural communities together had only eight members.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Locarno was centered around the intersection of Via Cittadella and Via S. Antonio.  The town stretched up the slope of the mountain and behind the castle. Some houses lined the shore, and above the Contrada Borghese a small, almost rural settlement grew up.  The center of town was dominated by town houses with their large courtyards and gardens.  The members of the upper class also owned small country houses with [[vineyards]], which went up the hill behind Locarno as well as in Solduno and [[Cugnasco]].  Locarno also had several noble [[Estate (land)|estates]] during the [[Late Middle Ages]], including the so-called Cittadella.  The buildings of the 17th and 18th Centuries, including the Casa Simona (16th to 18th century), the Casa Rusca from the first half of the 18th century (now the seat of the municipal art gallery) and the Casa del Negromante, were built on older structures and didn't change the layout of the town.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\n===Locarno's castles===\n[[File:Castello Visconteo3.jpg|thumb|Castello Visconteo]]\n{{Main|Castello Visconteo (Locarno)}}\nThere were several castles from the [[Early Middle Ages]] in Locarno.  One was destroyed by the Milanese in 1156.  Another, first mentioned in 1210 as Orelli castle, was occupied in 1342 occupied by the Visconti and enlarged.  This castle came to be known as Visconti Castle.  In 1531, the Confederates demolished much of the castle, leaving only the central core.  The castle was used as the residence of the governor, but in the following centuries, it began to fall apart.  From 1804 to 1909, the castle was the seat of the administrative governor and the District Court.  After 1909, it came into the possession of the city and was renovated in 1921\u201328.  Since 1920, it houses the city and Archaeological Museum.  In 1507, a defensive bastion or [[ravelin]] was added to protect the castle entrance.  It is likely that Leonardo da Vinci designed this structure.<ref name=\"Swissinfo 11 Aug\">{{cite news |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Locarno_gets_its_own_da_Vinci_mystery.html?cid=5371158 |title= Locarno gets its own da Vinci mystery |author=Gehring, Fran\u00e7oise |location=Locarno, Switzerland |date=11 August 2006 |publisher=SSR SRG |work=Swissinfo.com |accessdate=3 December 2010}}</ref><ref name=HDS_early/> North-east of the castle is Palazzo Casorella (Casa degli Orelli) from the 16th century.\n\n===Early modern Locarno===\n[[File:View from Monte Ceneri road toward Locarno.jpg|thumb|Vineyards above Locarno]]\nDuring the Middle Ages, the economy of Locarno and the whole region was closely linked with the nobles who owned the market, fishing, alpine and grazing rights and [[tithe]]s. Starting in the 13th century, some of these privileges went to the citizens corporation.  The hill areas were dominated by [[viticulture]], while grain was raised in the plains. Within the town, vegetables and fruits were grown. Artisans and stores were concentrated in the interior of the town. The repeatedly flooded shorelines and the alpine pastures were used for grazing. In the early modern period, Locarno developed into a thriving commercial center on an important road that linked the major cities of [[Lombardy]], with German-speaking Switzerland and Germany. Cereals and salt came from the Lombardy and [[Piedmont]] to Locarno, while Locarno and its hinterland (especially the [[Valle Maggia|Maggia Valley]]) provided large quantities of wood and cattle to Italy.<ref name=HDS_early/>\n\nThe [[parish church]] of Locarno, S. Antonio Abate, was first built in 1353\u201354. It was replaced by the current building in 1664. The decoration of the church was financed, primarily, by the grain traders at the end of the 17th century, and the chapel [[fresco]]es are by Giuseppe Antonio Felice Orelli from 1742. The citizens of Locarno had the right to appoint priests at S. Antonio Abate, S. Maria in Selva (consecrated in 1424, since 1884 only the [[choir]] and bell tower remain) and SS Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti (consecrated 1621). The church of San Francesco, together with the adjoining convent, were built in the early 13th century. The church's first consecration was probably in 1230, but the first documented consecration of the church was in 1316. It was rebuilt and enlarged between 1538\u20131675 using construction material from Visconti Castle. San Francesco hosted the meetings of the nobility and the citizens. Starting in the 16th century, the appointed Governor swore his oath in the church.<ref name=HDS_Religion>{{HDS|2108<!--Section 1-3-->|Locarno \u2013 Religious Life}}</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Humiliati]] order was suppressed and St. Catherine's church and monastery closed. All three ruling groups of Locarno agreed to convert the church and monastery into the Hospital S. Carlo. The Hospital remained until 1854 when it closed, due to financial reasons.<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\nIn the 16th century, Locarno's population declined as a result of exodus of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] and the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] in 1576\u201377. After a recovery in the 17th century, the population declined considerably in the 18th century again.\n\n===Protestant Reformation===\nBy 1535, there was a [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] community known as the ''ecclesia christiana locarnensis'' in Locarno. They owed their existence to the work of Giovanni Beccaria, several notables of the town (including Taddeo Duni) and religious refugees from [[Milan]] and Piedmont. To counteract the tensions, the Protestant community and the Catholic clergy met for a debate on 8 May 1549. At the end of the debate, Beccaria was imprisoned. However, because of protests against his arrest, he was immediately released. In 1550, Locarno declared itself to be a Catholic town, but a large group continued to practice the Protestant faith. However, in 1554, the Diet of Baden issued an ultimatum to the Protestants, either renounce new faith or go into exile. On 3 March 1555, over 100 people left Locarno to emigrate to [[Z\u00fcrich]].<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\nIn the course of [[Counter-Reformation]] in the 17th century, many religious buildings in Locarno were renewed or rebuilt. These include the 1604 church dedicated to SS Sebastiano e Rocco with the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery and the church of S. Maria Assunta (Chiesa Nuova).<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\n===The Canton of Ticino===\nUnder the [[Helvetic Republic]] (1798\u20131803) Locarno was part of the [[Canton of Lugano]].  Following the collapse of the Helvetic Republic, the [[Act of Mediation]], in 1803, created the Canton of Ticino with Locarno as an independent municipality.  The Helvetic Republic was very liberal and attempted to reform much of Swiss society.  However, the changes were too great and the Republic collapsed.  The compromise Act of Mediation changed some aspects of society but left others unchanged.  The new municipality of Lucarno was no longer ruled by three different ''[[B\u00fcrgergemeinde|patriziati]]'', which had emerged from the three groups (nobles, ''borghesi'' and ''terrieri''), but until the mid-19th century there were institutions that reached back to the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Ancien R\u00e9gime]].  For example, the community of Locarno and Ascona was dissolved in 1805.  Nevertheless, a \"committee of the representatives of the former communities of Locarno\" managed, for several decades, the S. Carlo Hospital and schools, which had been shared by the ''patriziati'' of the old, combined community.  However, the power of the old ''patriziati'' gradually weakened.  In 1859, the ''terrieri'' decided to set aside their corporation.  The nobles corporation distributed its assets in 1866\u201367 to its members and dissolved the archive, but retained until about 1920, the fishing rights. Only the citizens corporation has preserved its status as a civil community.<ref name=HDS_Modern>{{HDS|2108<!--Section 1-4-->|Locarno \u2013 19th and 20th Centuries}}</ref>\n[[File:Locarno 1.jpg|thumb|left|Piazza Grande]]\nThe Constitution of 1814, established Locarno, Bellinzona and [[Lugano]] as the capitals of the canton, in a six-year rotation. Locarno was the capital of the canton in 1821\u201327, 1839\u201345, 1857\u201363 and 1875\u201381. In 1838\u201339, on the initiative of a group of notables, a government building was built. It was sold in 1893 to private company. It then became the headquarters of Credito Ticinese and since 1917 it has been the headquarters of the [[Electricity Company of Sopraceneri]].  Locarno was repeatedly the scene of political clashes.  In 1839 and 1841, uprisings against the government broke out. In 1855, a murder in a coffee house was used as a pretext for a coup of radicals (''pronunciamento'').  Another coup, the Ticino coup of 1890, did nothing to change the balance of power between the parties in the city. After a liberal [[Mayor of Locarno|mayor]] ruled for 35 consecutive years (1865\u201380), a conservative mayor ruled for another 36 years (1880\u20131916).<ref name=HDS_Modern/>\n\nTo break the conservative hegemony of the late 19th century, the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democrats]], allied with the [[Liberal Party of Switzerland|Liberals]] in 1916 elections.  They succeeded to a majority in the city government (which then consisted of nine members, but in 1987 was limited to seven), which they kept in the following decades.<ref name=HDS_Modern/>\n\nIn the 19th century, the population in Locarno grew noticeably compared to neighboring communities. As early as 1836, the immigrant population was over 16% of the population. Between 1860\u201380, the population fell slightly  mainly because of emigration to [[California]]. In the following decades, the growth rates were below those of other population centers of the canton, which, unlike Locarno, benefited directly from the [[Gotthard railway]].\n\nIn 1816, the special rights and title of the old mother church of San Vittore in [[Muralto]] went over to S. Antonio Abate.  In 1863, snow collecting on the roof of the church caused the [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] to collapse, killing 40 people.  The citizens collective or ''borghesi'' lacked the resources to repair the church.  Therefore, in 1866, the ownership and maintenance of the churches of S. Antonio and S. Maria in Selva were given to the town as a whole.  For financial reasons, the collapsed church was not completely repaired.  Only the fa\u00e7ade and central vault were rebuilt and the choir was expanded.<ref name=HDS_Religion/>\n\nBetween 1863 and '74, church of San Francesco had to be used for services, and after 1798, the Assemblies of the neighborhoods, the city and the county were held in the church. In 1814, the church of San Francesco was [[secularized]] and the [[Franciscans]] had to leave. The church and convent served from 1821 until 1827 as the State Government offices. From 1848\u201363, the church was closed for worship, and in 1874 it was converted into a barracks and a salt storage. In 1924, it was converted back into a church and used by Benedictines for [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] services delivered in the [[German language]]. The [[Jesuits]] took over this task from 1947 until 1992. The monastery was secularized in 1848, and after the 1893\u201394 renovation, it housed the first high school. Then in 1930 it was used for teacher training.\n\n===Modern Locarno===\nBetween 1935 and '92, the newspaper, ''L'Eco di Locarno'' was printed in Locarno.  In 1992, it merged with the official newspaper of the Liberal party ''Il dovere'' to create the daily newspaper ''La Regione''. Since 1987, the only German language newspaper in Ticino, the ''Tessiner Zeitung'', is published three times each week in Locarno.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Locarno1.jpg|thumb|Locarno]]\nLocarno has an area, {{as of|1997|lc=on}}, of {{convert|19.27|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

The Sun can be found at the end of Via Gioacchino Respini where the cycle path, which runs alongside the river Maggia, starts. [[Pluto]], the final planet in the model, can be found {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} away from this starting point in the village of Tegna.\n\n===Madonna del Sasso, Cardada and Cimetta===\nThe sanctuary of [[Madonna del Sasso, Switzerland|Madonna del Sasso]] in [[Orselina]] above the city is the principal sight and goal of pilgrimage in the city.\n\nThe founding of the sanctuary goes back to a vision of the Virgin Mary that the [[Franciscan]] brother Bartolomeo d'Ivrea experienced in the night of 14/15 August 1480. The interior is highly decorated, and a platform has views of the city.\n\nThe [[Locarno\u2013Madonna del Sasso funicular]] links Locarno city centre with the Madonna del Sasso sanctuary and Orselina. From Orselina, a [[aerial lift|cable car]] operates to the top of [[Cardada]] (el. {{convert|1340|m|ft|abbr=on}}), and a [[chair lift]] goes further to the top of [[Cimetta]] (el. {{convert|1671|m|ft|abbr=on}}).\n\n===Castello Visconteo===\n[[Visconteo Castle (Locarno)|Castello Visconteo]], on the edge of the old town, was built in the 12th century, probably as the residence of a Captain Orelli, who remained true to the Emperor. In 1260, it fell into the hands of the [[Ghibelline]]s. In 1342 the Visconti of Milan, for whom it is now named, attacked the castle from both the land and the lake side and took it. It first came into the hands of the ''[[Old Swiss Confederation|Eidgenossen]]'' in 1503. Today, only a fifth of the original structure remains. Most of that dates from the 15th and 16th centuries. Only the foundation remains from the original structure.\n\n==Politics==\nIn the [[2007 Swiss federal election|2007 federal election]] the most popular party was the [[FDP.The Liberals|FDP]] which received 34.88% of the vote.

In Ticino, vocational students may either attend school while working on their internship or apprenticeship (which takes three or four years) or may attend school followed by an internship or apprenticeship (which takes one year as a full-time student or one and a half to two years as a part-time student).<ref>{{Cite report |title=KANTONALE SCHULSTRUKTUREN IN DER SCHWEIZ UND IM F\u00dcRSTENTUM LIECHTENSTEIN / STRUCTURES SCOLAIRES CANTONALES EN SUISSE ET DANS LA PRINCIPAUT\u00c9 DU LIECHTENSTEIN |url= http://edudoc.ch/record/35128/files/Schulsystem_alle.pdf |author= EDK/CDIP/IDES |year= 2010 |accessdate= 24 June 2010 }}</ref>  There were 146 vocational students who were attending school full-time and 293 who attend part-time.\n\nThe professional program lasts three years and prepares a student for a job in engineering, nursing, computer science, business, tourism and similar fields.

[[Crepuscular]] species, such as [[rabbit]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[hyena]]s, are often erroneously referred to as nocturnal. [[Cathemeral]] species, such as [[Eupleridae|fossa]]s and [[lion]]s, are active both in the day and at night.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Kiwi bird in Christchurch, New Zealand, 2002-01-01.jpg|thumb|The Kiwi is a family of nocturnal birds endemic to New Zealand.]]\nWhile it is difficult to say which came first, nocturnality or diurnality, there is a leading hypothesis out in the evolutionary biology community. Known as the \"bottleneck theory\", it postulates that millions of years ago in the Mesozoic era, many ancestors of modern-day mammals evolved nocturnal characteristics in order to avoid contact with the numerous diurnal predators. A recent study attempts to answer the question as to why so many modern day mammals retain these nocturnal characteristics even though they are not active at night. The leading answer is that the high visual acuity that comes with diurnal characteristics isn't needed anymore due to the evolution of compensatory sensory systems, such as a heightened sense of smell and more astute auditory systems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Torres|first=Christopher R.|last2=Clarke|first2=Julia A.|date=2018-11-07|title=Nocturnal giants: evolution of the sensory ecology in elephant birds and other palaeognaths inferred from digital brain reconstructions|journal=Proc.

They indicated that olfactory bulbs were much larger in comparison to their optic lobes, indicating they both have a common ancestor who evolved to function as a nocturnal species, decreasing their eyesight in favor of a better sense of smell.<ref name=\":0\" /> The anomaly to this theory were [[Simian|anthropoids]], who appeared to have the most divergence from nocturnality than all organisms examined. While most mammals didn't exhibit the morphological characteristics expected of a nocturnal creature, reptiles and birds fit in perfectly. A larger cornea and pupil correlated well with whether these two classes of organisms were nocturnal or not.<ref name=\"HallEtAl\" />\n\n==Advantages==\n\n===Resource competition===\nBeing active at night is a form of [[niche differentiation]], where a species' niche is partitioned not by the amount of resources but by the amount of time (i.e. temporal division of the [[ecological niche]]). [[Hawk]]s and [[owl]]s can hunt the same field or meadow for the same rodents without conflict because hawks are diurnal and owls are nocturnal. This means they are not in competition for each other's prey.\n\n===Predation===\n[[File:Bat flying at night.png|thumb|Echolocating bats adjust their vocalizations to catch insects against a changing environmental background.]]\nNocturnality is a form of [[crypsis]], an adaptation to avoid or enhance [[predation]]. One of the reasons that (cathemeral) [[lion]]s prefer to hunt at night is that many of their prey species ([[zebra]], [[antelope]], impala, [[wildebeest]], etc.) have poor night vision. Many species of small rodents, such as the [[Large Japanese field mouse|Large Japanese Field Mouse]], are active at night because most of the dozen or so [[birds of prey]] that hunt them are diurnal. There are many diurnal species that exhibit some nocturnal behaviors. For example, many [[seabird]]s and [[sea turtle]]s only gather at breeding sites or colonies at night to reduce the risk of predation to themselves and/or their offspring. Nocturnal species take advantage of the night time to prey on species that are used to avoiding diurnal predators. Some nocturnal fish species will use the moonlight to prey on zooplankton species that come to the surface at night.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Longcore|first=Travis|last2=Rich|first2=Catherine|date=May 2004|title=Ecological light pollution|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=191\u2013198|doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0191:elp]2.0.co;2|issn=1540-9295|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/623a338f2b6fe3d574cc344c10e4c1ae4d8ad346}}</ref> Some species have developed unique adaptations that allow them to hunt in the dark. Bats are famous for using [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to hunt down their prey, using sonar sounds to capture them in the dark.\n\n===Water conservation===\n\nAnother reason for nocturnality is avoiding the heat of the day. This is especially true in [[arid]] [[biome]]s like [[desert]]s, where nocturnal behavior prevents creatures from losing precious water during the hot, dry daytime. This is an [[adaptation]] that enhances [[osmoregulation]].<ref>N.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Campbell (1996) ''Biology'' (4th edition) Benjamin Cummings New York. {{ISBN|0-8053-1957-3}}</ref> One of the reasons that ([[cathemeral]]) lions prefer to hunt at night is to conserve water.\n\nMany plant species native to arid biomes have adapted so that their flowers only open at night when the sun's intense heat cannot wither and destroy their moist, delicate blossoms. These flowers are [[pollinate]]d by bats, another creature of the night.\n\nClimate-change and the change in global temperatures has led to an increasing amount of diurnal species to push their activity patterns closer towards crepuscular or fully nocturnal behavior. This adaptive measure allows species to avoid the heat of the day, without having to leave that particular habitat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Ofir|last2=Dayan|first2=Tamar|last3=Porter|first3=Warren P.|last4=Kronfeld-Schor|first4=Noga|date=2018-11-12|title=Time and ecological resilience: can diurnal animals compensate for climate change by shifting to nocturnal activity?|journal=Ecological Monographs|volume=89|pages=e01334|language=en|doi=10.1002/ecm.1334|issn=0012-9615|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Human disturbances ==\nThe exponential increase in human expansion and technological advances in the last few centuries has had a major effect on nocturnal animals, as well as diurnal species.

Many nocturnal creatures including [[tarsiers]] and some [[owls]] have large eyes in comparison with their body size to compensate for the lower light levels at night.

[[Crepuscular]] species, such as [[rabbit]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[hyena]]s, are often erroneously referred to as nocturnal. [[Cathemeral]] species, such as [[Eupleridae|fossa]]s and [[lion]]s, are active both in the day and at night.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Kiwi bird in Christchurch, New Zealand, 2002-01-01.jpg|thumb|The Kiwi is a family of nocturnal birds endemic to New Zealand.]]\nWhile it is difficult to say which came first, nocturnality or diurnality, there is a leading hypothesis out in the evolutionary biology community. Known as the \"bottleneck theory\", it postulates that millions of years ago in the Mesozoic era, many ancestors of modern-day mammals evolved nocturnal characteristics in order to avoid contact with the numerous diurnal predators. A recent study attempts to answer the question as to why so many modern day mammals retain these nocturnal characteristics even though they are not active at night. The leading answer is that the high visual acuity that comes with diurnal characteristics isn't needed anymore due to the evolution of compensatory sensory systems, such as a heightened sense of smell and more astute auditory systems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Torres|first=Christopher R.|last2=Clarke|first2=Julia A.|date=2018-11-07|title=Nocturnal giants: evolution of the sensory ecology in elephant birds and other palaeognaths inferred from digital brain reconstructions|journal=Proc.

They indicated that olfactory bulbs were much larger in comparison to their optic lobes, indicating they both have a common ancestor who evolved to function as a nocturnal species, decreasing their eyesight in favor of a better sense of smell.<ref name=\":0\" /> The anomaly to this theory were [[Simian|anthropoids]], who appeared to have the most divergence from nocturnality than all organisms examined. While most mammals didn't exhibit the morphological characteristics expected of a nocturnal creature, reptiles and birds fit in perfectly. A larger cornea and pupil correlated well with whether these two classes of organisms were nocturnal or not.<ref name=\"HallEtAl\" />\n\n==Advantages==\n\n===Resource competition===\nBeing active at night is a form of [[niche differentiation]], where a species' niche is partitioned not by the amount of resources but by the amount of time (i.e. temporal division of the [[ecological niche]]). [[Hawk]]s and [[owl]]s can hunt the same field or meadow for the same rodents without conflict because hawks are diurnal and owls are nocturnal. This means they are not in competition for each other's prey.\n\n===Predation===\n[[File:Bat flying at night.png|thumb|Echolocating bats adjust their vocalizations to catch insects against a changing environmental background.]]\nNocturnality is a form of [[crypsis]], an adaptation to avoid or enhance [[predation]]. One of the reasons that (cathemeral) [[lion]]s prefer to hunt at night is that many of their prey species ([[zebra]], [[antelope]], impala, [[wildebeest]], etc.) have poor night vision. Many species of small rodents, such as the [[Large Japanese field mouse|Large Japanese Field Mouse]], are active at night because most of the dozen or so [[birds of prey]] that hunt them are diurnal. There are many diurnal species that exhibit some nocturnal behaviors. For example, many [[seabird]]s and [[sea turtle]]s only gather at breeding sites or colonies at night to reduce the risk of predation to themselves and/or their offspring. Nocturnal species take advantage of the night time to prey on species that are used to avoiding diurnal predators. Some nocturnal fish species will use the moonlight to prey on zooplankton species that come to the surface at night.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Longcore|first=Travis|last2=Rich|first2=Catherine|date=May 2004|title=Ecological light pollution|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=191\u2013198|doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2004)002[0191:elp]2.0.co;2|issn=1540-9295|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/623a338f2b6fe3d574cc344c10e4c1ae4d8ad346}}</ref> Some species have developed unique adaptations that allow them to hunt in the dark. Bats are famous for using [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to hunt down their prey, using sonar sounds to capture them in the dark.\n\n===Water conservation===\n\nAnother reason for nocturnality is avoiding the heat of the day. This is especially true in [[arid]] [[biome]]s like [[desert]]s, where nocturnal behavior prevents creatures from losing precious water during the hot, dry daytime. This is an [[adaptation]] that enhances [[osmoregulation]].<ref>N.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Campbell (1996) ''Biology'' (4th edition) Benjamin Cummings New York. {{ISBN|0-8053-1957-3}}</ref> One of the reasons that ([[cathemeral]]) lions prefer to hunt at night is to conserve water.\n\nMany plant species native to arid biomes have adapted so that their flowers only open at night when the sun's intense heat cannot wither and destroy their moist, delicate blossoms. These flowers are [[pollinate]]d by bats, another creature of the night.\n\nClimate-change and the change in global temperatures has led to an increasing amount of diurnal species to push their activity patterns closer towards crepuscular or fully nocturnal behavior. This adaptive measure allows species to avoid the heat of the day, without having to leave that particular habitat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Ofir|last2=Dayan|first2=Tamar|last3=Porter|first3=Warren P.|last4=Kronfeld-Schor|first4=Noga|date=2018-11-12|title=Time and ecological resilience: can diurnal animals compensate for climate change by shifting to nocturnal activity?|journal=Ecological Monographs|volume=89|pages=e01334|language=en|doi=10.1002/ecm.1334|issn=0012-9615|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Human disturbances ==\nThe exponential increase in human expansion and technological advances in the last few centuries has had a major effect on nocturnal animals, as well as diurnal species.

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only. The term was instead used about anyone who to the Norse peoples appeared as a pirate. Therefore the term had been used about Israelites on the Red Sea; Muslims encountering Scandinavians in the Mediterranean; Caucasian pirates encountering the famous Swedish Ingvar-Expedition, and Estonian pirates on the Baltic Sea. Thus the term \"Viking\" was supposedly never limited to a single ethnicity as such, but rather an activity.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8906219/_Vikings_and_the_Viking_Age?email_work_card=title]</ref>\n\n===Other names===\n[[File:Europe 814.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Europe in 814.

England suffered from internal divisions and was relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted. The decline in the profitability of old [[trade route]]s could also have played a role. Trade between western Europe and the rest of Eurasia suffered a severe blow when the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell in the 5th century.<ref>{{cite web |last=Macauley Richardson |first=Lloyd |url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/72831997.html |title=Books: Eurasian Exploration |work=Policy Review |publisher=Hoover Institution |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216043007/http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/72831997.html |archivedate=2009-12-16}}</ref> The expansion of Islam in the 7th century had also affected trade with western Europe.<ref>Crone, Patricia.

The [[Jutes]] invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, pouring out from [[Jutland]] during the [[Age of Migrations]], before the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] settled there. The [[Saxons]] and the [[Angles]] did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

Its inhabitants were known as [[Jomsvikings]]. Jomsborg's exact location, or its existence, has not yet been established, though it is often maintained that Jomsborg was somewhere on the islands of the [[Oder]] estuary.<ref>[[T. D. Kendrick]], ''A History of the Vikings'', Courier Dover Publications, 2004, pp. 179ff, {{ISBN|978-0-486-43396-7}}</ref>\n\n===End of the Viking Age===\nDuring the Viking Age, Scandinavian men and women travelled to many parts of Europe and beyond, in a cultural diaspora that left its traces from [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] to [[Byzantium]]. This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus' Vikings more peaceful businesses in these areas and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the [[Dnieper Rapids|rapids]] on the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], but this can hardly be seen from the modern names.<ref>See information on the \"Slavonic and Norse names of the Dnieper rapids\" on [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]].</ref><ref>Else Roesdahl (prof. in Arch. & Hist.): ''The Vikings'', Penguin Books (1999), {{ISBN|0-14-025282-7}}</ref>\n\nA consequence of the available written sources, which may have coloured how the Viking age is perceived as a historical period, is that much more is known of the Vikings' activities in western Europe than in the East. One reason is that the cultures of north-eastern Europe at the time were non-literate, and did not produce a legacy of literature. Another is that the vast majority of written sources on Scandinavia in the Viking Age come from Iceland, a nation originally settled by Norwegian colonists. As a result, there is much more material from the Viking Age about Norway than Sweden, which apart from many runic inscriptions, has almost no written sources from the early Middle Ages.\n\n====Runestones====\n{{Main|Runestone}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = U 240, Lingsberg.JPG\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Lingberg Runestone\n| caption1  = The [[Lingsberg Runestone]] in Sweden\n| image2    = Jellingsten stor 2.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Jelling Stones\n| caption2  = Runic inscriptions of the larger of the [[Jelling Stones]] in Denmark\n| footer    = Two types of Norse runestones from the Viking Age\n}}\nThe Norse of the Viking Age could read and write and used a non-standardised alphabet, called ''runor'', built upon sound values. While there are few remains of runic writing on paper from the Viking era, thousands of stones with runic inscriptions have been found where Vikings lived. They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of ''runor'' survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. \n\nThe runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none.<ref name=\"forskning.no\">\n{{cite web\n |last=Olstad\n |first=Lisa\n |title=Ein minnestein for \u00e5 hedre seg sj\u00f8lv\n |publisher=forskning.no\n |date=2002-12-16\n |url=http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2002/desember/1039779970.6\n |accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref> Sweden has as many as between 1,700<ref name=\"forskning.no\"/> and 2,500<ref name=\"Zilmer38\">Zilmer 2005:38</ref> depending on definition.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = Two typical viking ships.\n}}\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the [[Eddic poem]] of [[R\u00edgs\u00feula]], which also explains that it was the [[R\u00edg (Norse god)|God R\u00edg]]\u2014father of mankind also known as [[Heimdallr]]\u2014who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\">Roesdahl, pp. 38\u201348, 61\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[Thrall]]s were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vikings may have first taken to seas to find women, slaves |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=15 April 2016 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190115/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |archive-date=1 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes [[Human sacrifice in Germanic paganism|sacrificially killed]] and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|title=Double graves with headless slaves|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Mari Kildah|publisher=University of Oslo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011090033/http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|archive-date=11 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like ''hauldr'', ''thegn'', ''landmand'', show mobility between the Karls and the Jarls.\n\nOther social structures included the communities of ''f\u00e9lag'' in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called ''f\u00e9lagi'') were obliged. A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as ''drenge'', one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the [[Thing (assembly)|Things]].\n\n====Women====\nWomen had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Borgstr\u00f6m Eva {{in lang|sv}}: Makal\u00f6sa kvinnor: k\u00f6ns\u00f6verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

Finger rings were seldom used and earrings were not used at all, as they were seen as a [[Slavic people|Slavic]] phenomenon. Most Karls expressed similar tastes and hygiene, but in a more relaxed and inexpensive way.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/appearance/|title=Appearance \u2013 What did the Vikings look like?|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502052336/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/appearance/|archive-date=2 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nArchaeological findings throughout Scandinavia and Viking settlements in the British Isles support the idea of the well groomed and hygienic Viking.

This included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through [[wrestling]] (see [[glima]]), [[fist fighting]], and stone lifting. In areas with mountains, [[mountain climbing]] was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed. [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was a popular sport and [[Snorri Sturluson]] describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of [[knife juggling]] as well.\n\n[[Skiing]] and [[ice skating]] were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.\n\nHorse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear.

Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions.\n\nIcelandic sources refer to the sport of ''[[knattleikr|knattleik]]''. A ball game akin to [[hockey]], knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[fox]]es were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows.

Wool was also very important as a domestic product for the Vikings, to produce warm clothing for the cold Scandinavian and Nordic climate, and for sails. Sails for Viking ships required large amounts of wool, as evidenced by experimental archaeology. There are archaeological signs of organised textile productions in Scandinavia, reaching as far back as the early [[Nordic Iron Age|Iron Ages]].

The devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]].<ref>English Historical Documents, c. 500\u20131042 by Dorothy Whitelock; p. 776</ref> Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".<ref>Derry (2012).

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by [[Richard Wagner]]. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased. The largest such groups include [[The Vikings (reenactment)|The Vikings]] and [[Regia Anglorum]], though many smaller groups exist in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Many reenactor groups participate in live-steel combat, and a few have Viking-style ships or boats.\n\nThe [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the [[National Football League]] are so-named owing to the large Scandinavian population in the US state of [[Minnesota]].\n\nDuring the banking boom of the first decade of the twenty-first century, Icelandic financiers came to be styled as ''[[\u00fatr\u00e1sarv\u00edkingar]]'' (roughly 'raiding Vikings').<ref>Ann-Sofie Nielsen Gremaud, \u2018[https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/8692 The Vikings are coming!

The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side.\n\nHistorians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of ''[[Geatish Society|G\u00f6tiska F\u00f6rbundet]]'', founded in 1811 in [[Stockholm]].<ref name=\"Frank\">{{cite book |last=Frank |first=Roberta |title=International Scandinavian and Medieval Studies in Memory of Gerd Wolfgang Weber |year=2000 |publisher=Ed.

This was done to legitimise the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealised in European culture.\n\nThe latter-day ''mythos'' created by [[National Romanticism|national romantic ideas]] blended the Viking Age with aspects of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] some 2,000 years earlier. Horned helmets from the Bronze Age were shown in [[petroglyph]]s and appeared in archaeological finds (see [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] and [[Vikso]] helmets).

People from the Viken area were not called \"Viking\" in Old Norse manuscripts, but are referred to as ''v\u00edkverir'', ('V\u00edk dwellers'). In addition, that explanation could explain only the masculine (''v\u00edkingr'') and not the feminine (''v\u00edking''), which is a serious problem because the masculine is easily derived from the feminine but hardly the other way around.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/viking%20rowshift.pdf|title=''V\u00edking'' \u2013 'rower shifting'?

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only. The term was instead used about anyone who to the Norse peoples appeared as a pirate. Therefore the term had been used about Israelites on the Red Sea; Muslims encountering Scandinavians in the Mediterranean; Caucasian pirates encountering the famous Swedish Ingvar-Expedition, and Estonian pirates on the Baltic Sea. Thus the term \"Viking\" was supposedly never limited to a single ethnicity as such, but rather an activity.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8906219/_Vikings_and_the_Viking_Age?email_work_card=title]</ref>\n\n===Other names===\n[[File:Europe 814.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Europe in 814.

Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted.

The [[Saxons]] and the [[Angles]] did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus' Vikings more peaceful businesses in these areas and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the [[Dnieper Rapids|rapids]] on the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], but this can hardly be seen from the modern names.<ref>See information on the \"Slavonic and Norse names of the Dnieper rapids\" on [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]].</ref><ref>Else Roesdahl (prof. in Arch. & Hist.): ''The Vikings'', Penguin Books (1999), {{ISBN|0-14-025282-7}}</ref>\n\nA consequence of the available written sources, which may have coloured how the Viking age is perceived as a historical period, is that much more is known of the Vikings' activities in western Europe than in the East. One reason is that the cultures of north-eastern Europe at the time were non-literate, and did not produce a legacy of literature. Another is that the vast majority of written sources on Scandinavia in the Viking Age come from Iceland, a nation originally settled by Norwegian colonists.

They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of ''runor'' survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. \n\nThe runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none.<ref name=\"forskning.no\">\n{{cite web\n |last=Olstad\n |first=Lisa\n |title=Ein minnestein for \u00e5 hedre seg sj\u00f8lv\n |publisher=forskning.no\n |date=2002-12-16\n |url=http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2002/desember/1039779970.6\n |accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref> Sweden has as many as between 1,700<ref name=\"forskning.no\"/> and 2,500<ref name=\"Zilmer38\">Zilmer 2005:38</ref> depending on definition.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = Two typical viking ships.\n}}\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|200px|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the [[Eddic poem]] of [[R\u00edgs\u00feula]], which also explains that it was the [[R\u00edg (Norse god)|God R\u00edg]]\u2014father of mankind also known as [[Heimdallr]]\u2014who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\">Roesdahl, pp. 38\u201348, 61\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[Thrall]]s were the lowest ranking class and were slaves.

Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions.

A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader.

Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see [[Viking art]]).

A ball game akin to [[hockey]], knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[fox]]es were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows.

The Vikings played several types of ''tafl'' games; ''[[hnefatafl]]'', ''nitavl'' ([[nine men's morris]]) and the less common ''[[Tafl games|kvatrutafl]]''. [[Chess]] also appeared at the end of the Viking Age. Hnefatafl is a war game, in which the object is to capture the king piece\u2014a large hostile army threatens and the king's men have to protect the king. It was played on a board with squares using black and white pieces, with moves made according to dice rolls.

The devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]].<ref>English Historical Documents, c. 500\u20131042 by Dorothy Whitelock; p. 776</ref> Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".<ref>Derry (2012).

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by [[Richard Wagner]]. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as [[Frans Gunnar Bengtsson]]'s ''[[The Long Ships]]'' (which was also released as a [[The Long Ships (1963 film)|1963 film]]), and historical fantasies such as the film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'', [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' (movie version called ''[[The 13th Warrior]]''), and the comedy film ''[[Erik the Viking]]''. The vampire [[Eric Northman]], in the HBO TV series ''[[True Blood]]'', was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the [[Danish American]] writer [[Poul Anderson]], while British explorer, historian, and writer [[Tim Severin]] authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world.\n\nIn 1962, American comic book writer [[Stan Lee]] and his brother [[Larry Lieber]], together with [[Jack Kirby]], created the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 [[Marvel Studios]] film [[Thor (film)|''Thor'']] and its sequels ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''. The character also appears in the 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and its associated [[Marvel's Avengers Assemble (TV series)|animated series]].\n\nThe appearance of Vikings within popular media and television has seen a resurgence in recent decades, especially with the History Channel's series [[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings (2013)]], directed by Michael Hirst. The show has a loose grounding in historical facts and sources, but bases itself more so on literary sources, such as [[Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok|fornaldarsaga Ragnars saga lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]], itself more legend than fact, and Old Norse Eddic and Skaldic poetry.<ref>Gareth Lloyd Evans, \"Michael Hirst\u2019s Vikings and Old Norse Poetry\", ''Translating Early Medieval Poetry: Transformation, Reception, Interpretation''.

The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side.\n\nHistorians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven.

[[Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Trinidadian-born]] singer Nestor Alexander Haddaway was then chosen to sing it.

Outside Europe, the song was moderately successful, reaching number 11 in the United States, number 12 in Australia, number 17 in Canada, and number 48 in New Zealand.\n\n==Background==\n\"What Is Love\" was written and produced by German music producer and composer Dee Dee Halligan (Dieter L\u00fcnstedt a.k.a.

[[Trinidadians and Tobagonians|Trinidadian-born]] singer Nestor Alexander Haddaway was then chosen to sing it.

[[Brahmi]] legend \"NITI\" in front, [[Shrivatasa]] symbol on the reverse. 8th century CE.]]\n\nThe history of the region of [[Arakan]] (now renamed Rakhine) State can be roughly divided into seven parts. The first four divisions and the periods are based on the location of the centre of power of the main independent Rakhine-dominated polities in the northern Rakhine region, especially along the Kaladan River. Thus, the history is divided into the [[Dhanyawadi]], [[Waithali]], [[Laymro]] and [[Mrauk U]]. Mrauk U was conquered by the [[Konbaung dynasty]] of Burma in 1784\u201385, after which Rakhine became part of the Konbaung kingdom of Burma. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war erupted and in 1826, Rakhine (alongside [[Tanintharyi Region|Tanintharyi]]) was ceded to the British as reparation by the Burmese to the British. Rakhine thus became part of the province of Burma of British India. In 1948, Burma was given independence and Rakhine became part of the new federal republic.\n\n===Independent kingdom===\nBased on Rakhine oral histories and inscriptions in certain temples, the history of the Rakhine region dates back nearly five thousand years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The Rakhine people trace their societal history back to as far as 3325 BCE and have given a lineal succession of 227 native monarchs and princes<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Arakan |volume=2 |page=315}}</ref> down to the last ruler in 1784. They also describe their territory as including, in varying points of time, the regions of [[Inwa|Ava]], the [[Irrawaddy Delta]], the port town of [[Thanlyin]] (Syriam) and parts of eastern Bengal. However, the expanse of the successive Rakhine kingdoms does not exactly corroborate with certain known historical documentation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAccording to Rakhine legend, the first recorded kingdom, centred around the northern town of [[Dhanyawadi]], arose in the 34th century BCE and lasted until 327 CE. Rakhine documents and inscriptions state that the famed [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple|Mahamuni Buddha image]] was cast in Dhanyawady in around 554 BCE when the Buddha visited the kingdom. After the fall of Dhanyawadi in the 4th century CE, the centre of power shifted to a new dynasty based in the town of Waithali. The Waithali kingdom ruled the regions of Rakhine from the middle of the 4th century to 818 CE. The period is seen as the classical period of Rakhine culture, architecture and Buddhism, as the Waithali period left behind more archaeological remains than its predecessor. A new dynasty emerged in four towns along the Laymro river as Waithali waned in influence, and ushered in the Lemro period, where four principal towns served as successive capitals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAfter its partial dominance by the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]], the final [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] was founded in 1429 by [[Min Saw Mon]]. It is seen by the Rakhine people as the golden age of their history, as Mrauk U served as a commercially important port and base of power in the Bay of Bengal region and involved in extensive maritime trade with Arabia and Europe.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}Part of it, along [[Bengal Subah]]'s [[Chittagong]], was later conquered by the Islamic Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. \nThe country steadily declined from the 18th century onwards after its loss to the [[Mughal Empire]]. Internal instability, rebellion and dethroning of kings were very common. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakans.<ref name=EB1911/><ref name=\"Phayre1841\">{{cite book|author=Arthur P.

The Mahamuni image was taken away by the Burmese as war loot. Thus, an expansionist Burma came into direct territorial contact with territories of the British East India Company, which set the stage for future flaring of hostility. Various geopolitical issues gave rise to the First [[Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824\u201326). As the image of Mahamuni had been taken as war loot by the Burmese, this time the huge bell of the temple was taken by the [[British Army]] and awarded to a soldier, Bhim Singh, a Risaldar in [[British East India Company]]'s 2nd Division of the British, for his bravery. This inscribed huge bell is still installed in a temple at village Nadrai near [[Kasganj]] town in present-day Kanshiram Nagar District of [[Uttar Pradesh]] India. In the [[Treaty of Yandabo]] (1826), which ended hostilities, Burma was forced to cede Arakan alongside [[Tanintharyi]] (Tenasserim) to [[British India]]. The British made Akyab (now Sittwe) the capital of Arakan. Later, Arakan became part of the province of Burma of the British Indian Empire, and then part of British Burma when Burma was made into a separate crown colony. Arakan was administratively divided into three districts along traditional divisions during the Mrauk U period.\n\n===1940 onwards and inclusion in Myanmar===\n\nRakhine (Arakan) was the site of many battles during the Second World War, most notably the [[Arakan Campaign 1942\u201343]] and the [[Battle of Ramree Island]]. In 1948, Arakan became part of the newly independent [[Union of Burma]] (later renamed as [[Myanmar]]) and the three districts became Arakan Division. From the 1950s, there was a growing movement for [[secession]] and restoration of Arakan independence. In part to appease this sentiment, in 1974, the socialist government under General [[Ne Win]] constituted \"Rakhine State\" from Arakan Division giving at least nominal acknowledgment of the regional majority of the [[Rakhine people]].\n\n===2010 onwards (after 2008 constitution)===\nSince 2010, Rakhine state has had two chief ministers: Hla Maung Tin and Major General Maung Maung Ohn.\nHla Maung Tin ( January 2011 \u2013 20 June 2014) was an elected Rakhine [[State and Region Hluttaws|State Hluttaw]] member representing USDP from [[Ann Township]] in 2010 general election.  He resigned from the post after recurrent intense inter-communal conflicts between Muslims and Rakhine ethnic groups in 2012\u201314.<ref>[http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621065601/http://www.mizzima.com/mizzima-news/myanmar/item/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns/11519-rakhine-state-chief-minister-resigns |date=21 June 2014 }}</ref>\nIn 2014, he was replaced by Major General Maung Maung Ohn (30 June 2014 \u2013 present).

[[Brahmi]] legend \"NITI\" in front, [[Shrivatasa]] symbol on the reverse. 8th century CE.]]\n\nThe history of the region of [[Arakan]] (now renamed Rakhine) State can be roughly divided into seven parts. The first four divisions and the periods are based on the location of the centre of power of the main independent Rakhine-dominated polities in the northern Rakhine region, especially along the Kaladan River. Thus, the history is divided into the [[Dhanyawadi]], [[Waithali]], [[Laymro]] and [[Mrauk U]]. Mrauk U was conquered by the [[Konbaung dynasty]] of Burma in 1784\u201385, after which Rakhine became part of the Konbaung kingdom of Burma. In 1824, the first Anglo-Burmese war erupted and in 1826, Rakhine (alongside [[Tanintharyi Region|Tanintharyi]]) was ceded to the British as reparation by the Burmese to the British. Rakhine thus became part of the province of Burma of British India. In 1948, Burma was given independence and Rakhine became part of the new federal republic.\n\n===Independent kingdom===\nBased on Rakhine oral histories and inscriptions in certain temples, the history of the Rakhine region dates back nearly five thousand years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The Rakhine people trace their societal history back to as far as 3325 BCE and have given a lineal succession of 227 native monarchs and princes<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Arakan |volume=2 |page=315}}</ref> down to the last ruler in 1784. They also describe their territory as including, in varying points of time, the regions of [[Inwa|Ava]], the [[Irrawaddy Delta]], the port town of [[Thanlyin]] (Syriam) and parts of eastern Bengal. However, the expanse of the successive Rakhine kingdoms does not exactly corroborate with certain known historical documentation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAccording to Rakhine legend, the first recorded kingdom, centred around the northern town of [[Dhanyawadi]], arose in the 34th century BCE and lasted until 327 CE. Rakhine documents and inscriptions state that the famed [[Mahamuni Buddha Temple|Mahamuni Buddha image]] was cast in Dhanyawady in around 554 BCE when the Buddha visited the kingdom. After the fall of Dhanyawadi in the 4th century CE, the centre of power shifted to a new dynasty based in the town of Waithali. The Waithali kingdom ruled the regions of Rakhine from the middle of the 4th century to 818 CE. The period is seen as the classical period of Rakhine culture, architecture and Buddhism, as the Waithali period left behind more archaeological remains than its predecessor. A new dynasty emerged in four towns along the Laymro river as Waithali waned in influence, and ushered in the Lemro period, where four principal towns served as successive capitals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nAfter its partial dominance by the Islamic [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]], the final [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] was founded in 1429 by [[Min Saw Mon]]. It is seen by the Rakhine people as the golden age of their history, as Mrauk U served as a commercially important port and base of power in the Bay of Bengal region and involved in extensive maritime trade with Arabia and Europe.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}Part of it, along [[Bengal Subah]]'s [[Chittagong]], was later conquered by the Islamic Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. \nThe country steadily declined from the 18th century onwards after its loss to the [[Mughal Empire]]. Internal instability, rebellion and dethroning of kings were very common. The Portuguese, during the era of their greatness in Asia, gained a temporary establishment in Arakans.<ref name=EB1911/><ref name=\"Phayre1841\">{{cite book|author=Arthur P.

The Mahamuni image was taken away by the Burmese as war loot. Thus, an expansionist Burma came into direct territorial contact with territories of the British East India Company, which set the stage for future flaring of hostility. Various geopolitical issues gave rise to the First [[Anglo-Burmese War]] (1824\u201326). As the image of Mahamuni had been taken as war loot by the Burmese, this time the huge bell of the temple was taken by the [[British Army]] and awarded to a soldier, Bhim Singh, a Risaldar in [[British East India Company]]'s 2nd Division of the British, for his bravery. This inscribed huge bell is still installed in a temple at village Nadrai near [[Kasganj]] town in present-day Kanshiram Nagar District of [[Uttar Pradesh]] India. In the [[Treaty of Yandabo]] (1826), which ended hostilities, Burma was forced to cede Arakan alongside [[Tanintharyi]] (Tenasserim) to [[British India]]. The British made Akyab (now Sittwe) the capital of Arakan. Later, Arakan became part of the province of Burma of the British Indian Empire, and then part of British Burma when Burma was made into a separate crown colony. Arakan was administratively divided into three districts along traditional divisions during the Mrauk U period.\n\n===1940 onwards and inclusion in Myanmar===\n\nRakhine (Arakan) was the site of many battles during the Second World War, most notably the [[Arakan Campaign 1942\u201343]] and the [[Battle of Ramree Island]]. In 1948, Arakan became part of the newly independent [[Union of Burma]] (later renamed as [[Myanmar]]) and the three districts became Arakan Division. From the 1950s, there was a growing movement for [[secession]] and restoration of Arakan independence. In part to appease this sentiment, in 1974, the socialist government under General [[Ne Win]] constituted \"Rakhine State\" from Arakan Division giving at least nominal acknowledgment of the regional majority of the [[Rakhine people]].\n\n===2010 onwards (after 2008 constitution)===\nSince 2010, Rakhine state has had two chief ministers: Hla Maung Tin and Major General Maung Maung Ohn.\nHla Maung Tin ( January 2011 \u2013 20 June 2014) was an elected Rakhine [[State and Region Hluttaws|State Hluttaw]] member representing USDP from [[Ann Township]] in 2010 general election.
