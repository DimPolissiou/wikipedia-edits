In 1991, in a partnership with his father, Katz paid $300,000 for the Canadian rights to the U.S.-based Medicine Shoppe drugstore franchise which had over 1,000 stores in the USA. In 1992, they opened the first Medicine Shoppe store and Katz founded the Katz Group of Companies which was to become the holding company for the group. In 1996, Katz purchased the storied but fading [[Rexall]] drugstore chain in Canada which at the time, only consisted of several dozen stores. The business grew and by 1998, the Katz Group consisted of 80 Rexall stores, 30 Medicine Shoppe outlets, and a few smaller independent retailers. In 1997, he purchased the Ontario-based, 143-store Pharma Plus drug store chain from the supermarket operator [[Oshawa Group]] for $100 million.<ref name=EdmontonJournalReclusive/> Katz reportedly retains a small circle of highly paid executives who run Katz Group.

His foray into the U.S. was not without failure: the Snyder's chain filed for bankruptcy in 2003 and its 25 stores were sold to Walgreens. In 2004, Katz purchased the naming rights for ten years to the new $45-million [[Rexall Centre]], a 12,500-seat tennis and entertainment complex on the campus of York University. In January 2012, he sold Drug Trading Co. and Medicine Shoppe Canada to the U.S.-based drug distributor [[McKesson Corporation]] for $1.2 billion.

Hingalganj, a block headquarters some 100 km from Calcutta. A ribbon-like road threads through the tree-clad villages on this island in the Sunderbans delta, empty of traffic except for an occasional motorcycle-driven cart laden with passengers, the lone local transport. At midday, the only sound you hear is the chirping of invisible crickets. Hingalganj, clearly, looks idyllic.\n\nSuddenly, an armed Border Security Force squad emerges from a roadside bamboo grove. Further on, near what looks like a village square, another group of border guards marches by, fingers on the triggers of the guns hanging from their shoulders. In front of the local police station, a constable stands guard with an automatic rifle, an unusual sight in a rural police station in West Bengal.\n\nBut then, Hingalganj is not just another rural town in Bengal. Perched on India\u2019s border with Bangladesh, Hingalganj, in North 24 Parganas district, is now a gateway to terror, a place the security forces and intelligence agents are keeping a sharp eye on.\n\n- [[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]], 3 September 2006<ref>{{cite web | url =  https://www.telegraphindia.com/1060903/asp/opinion/story_6691043.asp| title = Bengal, the new terror hub, Police recognise the threat to Calcutta   | publisher =  The Telegraph, 3 September 2006 |accessdate =  12 May 2018}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==CD Block HQ==\nThe headquarters of Hingalganj CD Block are located at Hingalganj.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/DCHB_A/19/1911_PART_A_DCHB_NORTH%20TWENTY%20FOUR%20PARGANAS.pdf |title = District Census Handbook North Twenty Four Parganas, Census of India 2011, Series 20, Part XII A |work = Map of North Twenty Four Parganas with CD Block HQs and Police Stations (on the fifth page) | publisher= Directorate of Census Operations, West Bengal| accessdate = 6 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nAs per the [[2011 Census of India]], Hingalganj town had a total population of 8,179, of which 4,129 (50%) were males and 4,050 (50%) were females.

He served as a general in the [[United States Army]] from 1814 to 1861, taking part in the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the early stages of the [[American Civil War]], and various [[American Indian Wars|conflicts]] with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Scott was the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]'s presidential nominee in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Franklin Pierce]]. He was known as '''Old Fuss and Feathers''' for his insistence on proper military etiquette, and as the '''Grand Old Man of the Army''' for his many years of service.\n\nScott was born near [[Petersburg, Virginia]], in 1786. After training as a lawyer and brief militia service, he joined the army in 1808 as a captain of the light artillery. In the War of 1812, Scott served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front, taking part in the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] and the [[Battle of Fort George]], and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in early 1814. He served with distinction in the [[Battle of Chippawa]], but was badly wounded in the subsequent [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]]. After the conclusion of the war, Scott was assigned to command army forces in a district containing much of the Northeastern United States, and he and his family made their home near New York City. During the 1830s, Scott negotiated an end to the [[Black Hawk War]], took part in the [[Second Seminole War]] and the [[Creek War of 1836]], and presided over the [[Indian removal|removal]] of the [[Cherokee]]. Scott also helped to avert war with Britain, defusing tensions arising from the [[Patriot War]] and the [[Aroostook War]]. \n\nIn 1841, Scott became the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]], beating out his rival, [[Edmund P. Gaines]], for the position. After the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, Scott initially served as an administrator, but in 1847 he led a campaign against the [[Mexico|Mexican]] capital of [[Mexico City]]. After [[Siege of Veracruz|capturing]] the port city of [[Veracruz]], he defeated Mexican General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s armies at the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], the [[Battle of Contreras]], and the [[Battle of Churubusco]] and [[Battle for Mexico City|captured Mexico City]]. He maintained order in the Mexican capital and indirectly helped envoy [[Nicholas Trist]] negotiate the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which brought an end to the war.\n\nScott was a candidate for the Whig presidential nomination in 1840, 1844, and 1848, and he finally won the Whig presidential nomination at the [[1852 Whig National Convention]]. The Whigs were badly divided over the [[Compromise of 1850]], and Pierce won a decisive victory over his former commander. Nonetheless, Scott remained popular among the public, and in 1855 he received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to the rank of [[lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], becoming the first U.S. Army officer to hold that rank since [[George Washington]]. Despite being a Virginia native, Scott stayed loyal to the Union and served as an important adviser to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the opening stages of the Civil War. He developed a strategy known as the [[Anaconda Plan]], but retired in late 1861 after Lincoln increasingly relied on General [[George B. McClellan]] for military advice and leadership. Scott's military talent was highly regarded by contemporaries, and historians generally consider him to be one of the most accomplished generals in U.S. history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Winfield Scott.svg|upright=1|thumb|Scott used this [[coat of arms]] for his [[bookplate]].{{sfn|''Hobbies magazine'' |page=139}} It has been incorporated into the heraldry of various units of the U.S. Army, including the [[1st Engineer Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[7th Engineer Battalion (United States)|7th]] Engineer Battalions.{{sfn|''U.S. Army Heraldic Crests''|pages=108\u2013109}}]]\n\nWinfield Scott was born on June 13, 1786, to Ann Mason and her husband, William Scott, a farmer, veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and officer in the [[Dinwiddie County, Virginia|Dinwiddie County]] militia.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=1\u20132}} At the time, the Scott family resided at Laurel Hill, a plantation near [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=219}} Ann Mason Scott was the daughter of Daniel Mason and Elizabeth Winfield, and it was Ann's mother's maiden name that William and Ann Scott selected for their son.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=1}} Scott's paternal grandfather, James Scott, had migrated from [[Scotland]] after the defeat of [[Charles Edward Stuart]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Culloden]].

Clay, [[Daniel Webster]], and General Zachary Taylor were also candidates for the nomination. As in 1840, Whigs were looking for a non-ideological war hero to be their candidate. Scott's main appeal was to anti-slavery \"conscience Whigs\", who were dismayed by the fact that two of the leading contenders, Clay and Taylor, were slaveholders. Ultimately, however, the delegates passed on Scott for a second time, nominating Taylor on the fourth ballot.

Scott was the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]'s presidential nominee in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Franklin Pierce]]. He was known as '''Old Fuss and Feathers''' for his insistence on proper military etiquette, and as the '''Grand Old Man of the Army''' for his many years of service.\n\nScott was born near [[Petersburg, Virginia]], in 1786. After training as a lawyer and brief militia service, he joined the army in 1808 as a captain of the light artillery. In the War of 1812, Scott served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front, taking part in the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] and the [[Battle of Fort George]], and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in early 1814. He served with distinction in the [[Battle of Chippawa]], but was badly wounded in the subsequent [[Battle of Lundy's Lane]]. After the conclusion of the war, Scott was assigned to command army forces in a district containing much of the Northeastern United States, and he and his family made their home near New York City. During the 1830s, Scott negotiated an end to the [[Black Hawk War]], took part in the [[Second Seminole War]] and the [[Creek War of 1836]], and presided over the [[Indian removal|removal]] of the [[Cherokee]]. Scott also helped to avert war with Britain, defusing tensions arising from the [[Patriot War]] and the [[Aroostook War]]. \n\nIn 1841, Scott became the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]], beating out his rival, [[Edmund P. Gaines]], for the position. After the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846, Scott initially served as an administrator, but in 1847 he led a campaign against the [[Mexico|Mexican]] capital of [[Mexico City]]. After [[Siege of Veracruz|capturing]] the port city of [[Veracruz]], he defeated Mexican General [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]]'s armies at the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]], the [[Battle of Contreras]], and the [[Battle of Churubusco]] and [[Battle for Mexico City|captured Mexico City]]. He maintained order in the Mexican capital and indirectly helped envoy [[Nicholas Trist]] negotiate the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which brought an end to the war.\n\nScott was a candidate for the Whig presidential nomination in 1840, 1844, and 1848, and he finally won the Whig presidential nomination at the [[1852 Whig National Convention]]. The Whigs were badly divided over the [[Compromise of 1850]], and Pierce won a decisive victory over his former commander. Nonetheless, Scott remained popular among the public, and in 1855 he received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to the rank of [[lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]], becoming the first U.S. Army officer to hold that rank since [[George Washington]]. Despite being a Virginia native, Scott stayed loyal to the Union and served as an important adviser to President [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the opening stages of the Civil War. He developed a strategy known as the [[Anaconda Plan]], but retired in late 1861 after Lincoln increasingly relied on General [[George B. McClellan]] for military advice and leadership. Scott's military talent was highly regarded by contemporaries, and historians generally consider him to be one of the most accomplished generals in U.S. history.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Winfield Scott.svg|upright=1|thumb|Scott used this [[coat of arms]] for his [[bookplate]].{{sfn|''Hobbies magazine'' |page=139}} It has been incorporated into the heraldry of various units of the U.S. Army, including the [[1st Engineer Battalion (United States)|1st]] and [[7th Engineer Battalion (United States)|7th]] Engineer Battalions.{{sfn|''U.S. Army Heraldic Crests''|pages=108\u2013109}}]]\n\nWinfield Scott was born on June 13, 1786, to Ann Mason and her husband, William Scott, a farmer, veteran of the [[American Revolutionary War]], and officer in the [[Dinwiddie County, Virginia|Dinwiddie County]] militia.{{sfn|Wright|1894|pages=1\u20132}} At the time, the Scott family resided at Laurel Hill, a plantation near [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], [[Virginia]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=219}} Ann Mason Scott was the daughter of Daniel Mason and Elizabeth Winfield, and it was Ann's mother's maiden name that William and Ann Scott selected for their son.{{sfn|Wright|1894|page=1}} Scott's paternal grandfather, James Scott, had migrated from [[Scotland]] after the defeat of [[Charles Edward Stuart]]'s forces in the [[Battle of Culloden]].

Scott's plan was leaked to the public, and was derided by most Northern newspapers, which tended to favor an immediate assault on the Confederacy.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=385\u2013387}} As Scott was too old for battlefield command, Lincoln selected General [[Irvin McDowell]], an officer whom Scott saw as unimaginative and inexperienced, to lead the main Union army in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|eastern theater]] of the war.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=387\u2013388}} Though Scott counseled that the army needed more time to train, Lincoln ordered an offensive against the Confederate capital of Richmond. Irvin McDowell led a force of 30,000 men south, where he met Confederate Army at [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. The Confederate army dealt the Union a major defeat, ending any hope of a quick end to the war.{{sfn|White|2009|pp=429\u2013435}}\n\nMcDowell took the brunt of public vituperation for the defeat at Bull Run, but Scott, who had helped plan the battle, also received criticism.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=388\u2013392}} Lincoln replaced McDowell with McClellan, and the president began meeting with McClellan without Scott in attendance.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=393\u2013394}} Frustrated with his diminished standing, Scott submitted his resignation in October 1861. Though Scott favored General [[Henry Halleck]] as his successor, Lincoln instead made McClellan the army's senior officer.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=393\u2013398}}\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Winfield Scott Seated 1861.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Scott in 1861]]\n\nAfter retiring, Scott traveled to Europe with his daughter, Cornelia, and her husband, H. L. Scott. In [[Paris]], he helped American consul [[John Bigelow]] defuse the [[Trent Affair]], a diplomatic incident with Britain.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=400\u2013401}} On his return from Europe in December 1861, he lived alone in New York City and at [[West Point, New York]], where he wrote his memoirs and closely followed the ongoing civil war. After McClellan's defeat in the [[Seven Days Battles]], Lincoln accepted Scott's advice and appointed General Halleck as the army's senior general. In 1864, Scott sent a copy of his newly-published memoirs to Ulysses S. Grant, who had succeeded Halleck as the lead Union general. The copy that Scott sent was inscribed, \"from the oldest to the greatest general.\"{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=402\u2013404}} Following a strategy similar to Scott's Anaconda Plan, Grant led the Union to victory, and the Confederate army [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|surrendered]] in April 1865.<ref name=\"malanga\" />\n\nScott died at the West Point on May 29, 1866.{{sfn|Southwick|1998|p=220}} President [[Andrew Johnson]] ordered the flags flown at half-staff to honor Scott, and Scott's funeral was attended by many of the leading Union generals, including Grant, George G. Meade, [[George H. Thomas]], and [[John Schofield]]. He is buried at the [[West Point Cemetery]].{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n[[File:General Winfield Scott statue (45726769).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Brevet Lt.

Steven Malanga of ''[[City Journal]]'' writes that \"Scott was one of America\u2019s greatest generals ... but he had the misfortune to serve in two conflicts\u2014the War of 1812 and the controversial Mexican-American War\u2014bracketed by the far more significant American Revolution and Civil War.\"<ref name=\"4PNmt\" /> Biographer John Eisenhower writes that Scott \"was an astonishing man\" who was the country's \"most prominent general\" between the retirement of Andrew Jackson in 1821 and the onset of the Civil War in 1861.{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|p=xiii}} The [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] proclaimed Scott \"the greatest living general\" after his capture of Mexico City.{{sfn|Johnson|1998|p=1}} Robert E. Lee wrote, \"the great cause of our success [in Mexico] was in our leader [Scott]\".{{sfn|Eisenhower|1999|p=315}} Historians Scott Kaufman and John A. Soares Jr. write that Scott was \"an able diplomat who proved crucial in helping avert war between Britain and the United States in period after the War of 1812.\"{{sfn|Kaufman|Soares|2006|p=58}} [[Fanny Crosby]], the hymn writer, recalled that Scott's \"gentle manner did not indicate a hero of so many battles; yet there was strength beneath the exterior appearance and a heart of iron within his breast. But from him I learned that the warrior only it is, who can fully appreciate the blessing of peace.\"<ref name=\"7TErp\" />\n\nIn addition to his reputation as a tactician and strategist, Scott's career was also noteworthy for his concern about the welfare of his subordinates, as demonstrated by his willingness to risk his career in the dispute with Wilkinson over the Louisiana bivouac site.{{sfn|Johnson|1998|pages=13-14}}  In another example, when cholera broke out among his soldiers while they were aboard ship during the Black Hawk campaign and the ship's surgeon was incapacitated by the disease, Scott received a treatment tutorial from the surgeon and risked his own health by tending to the sick men himself.<ref name=\"XTEwe\" />\n\n===Memorials===\n[[File:Winfield Scott44 1870 issue-24c.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|First Winfield Scott stamp, issue of 1870]]\n\nScott has been memorialized in numerous ways.
