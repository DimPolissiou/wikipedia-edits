The memoir describes his days as a race car driver, the challenges, the victories, and the crashes \u2014 the worst of which he describes as an \u201cexplosion.\u201d The memoir also discusses the genesis for the revolutionary car he created, the [[Shelby Cobra]].\n\n==Shelby the constructor==\n{{main|Shelby American vehicles}}\n[[File:Blue Cobra by Blue Pacific.JPG|thumb|right|1965 [[AC Cobra]] 427 (North America)]]\nShelby states in his book, The Carroll Shelby Story, \"...the longer I went on racing and was around the limited-production factories in Europe, the more I realized that America was missing a big bet, a winning bet...that winning bet I'm talking about was the design and production of an all-purpose, all-American sports or grand touring car that you could drive to market and also race during the weekend...\"  In particular, Shelby wanted to put a 300 [[horsepower|brake horsepower]] [[V8]] on an Austin Healey type [[chassis]], so that it weighed less than 2600 pounds.<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|90\u201393}}\n\nAfter retiring from driving in October 1959 for health reasons,<ref>\"Automobiles\", episode about Ford Motor Company, History Channel</ref> Shelby opened a high-performance driving school and the [[Carroll Shelby International|Shelby-American]] performance equipment and customization company in the Los Angeles area. Shelby became interested in the potential of the [[AC Ace]] chassis, especially after [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] stopped building automobile engines, and the sales with the [[Ford Zephyr engine]] were declining in September 1961.  Shelby contacted Charles Hurlock of AC, who agreed to provide the chassis on credit.  Dave Evans of [[Ford Motor Company]], agreed to provide on credit, the 221-cubic-inch and 260-cubic-inch V8 engines with transmissions.  The new car, called the Carroll Shelby Experimental or CSX0001, would be marketed as the Shelby AC Cobra, then [[AC Cobra]], and eventually, the [[Ford Cobra]].  Production began in March 1962, and 75 cars were sold by the end of the year.  A 100 cars had been built by April 1963, the first 75 with the 260-cubic-inch engine, followed by a 289-cubic-inch engine.  The 427 Cobra prototype was built in Oct. 1964.<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|172\u2013183,190,195}}\n\nShelby started racing his creation in October 1962 at Riverside, with Billy Krause driving the CSX0002.  Racing experience from 1963 indicated that further modifications were necessary to make the Cobra competitive with the Ferrari GT cars; in particular, the AC roadster body needed to be replaced with a lower-drag enclosed coupe body for high-speed circuits.  The result was the [[Shelby Daytona]] Coupe, which took three GT class wins on the 1964 [[World Sportscar Championship]] GT circuit, including Le Mans and the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, plus the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[United States Road Racing Championship|U.S. GT Championship]].  Then in 1965, Shelby American Cobra won the [[World Sportscar Championship|International Championship for GT Manufacturers]].<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|180,202,208\u2013210,213\u2013214,217,221}}\n\nAfter success with the Daytona Coupe in 1964, Shelby-American became more heavily involved in Ford's [[Ford GT40|GT40]] Sports Prototype racing program, which had experienced disappointing results.  Shelby made changes to running gear, particularly transmissions, to improve reliability, and designed their GT40 Mark II variant around Ford's 7.0-liter engine.  The results paid off spectacularly in 1966, with the Mark II bringing Ford the overall Constructors' title in the World Sportscar Championship, clinched with their 1-2-3 finish at Le Mans.  But Ford could not rest on its laurels in light of Ferrari's determined efforts, and was developing a radical new prototype with a lightweight chassis based on aluminum honeycomb panels.  Shelby was brought in to finalize development of the car after the project experienced setbacks in 1966.  The Mark IV was introduced for the 1967 [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and won handily, then was prepared for Le Mans.  Various misfortunes took Ford out of realistic contention for a repeat title, but the Shelby-American team delivered another record-breaking statement win at Le Mans.  An exclamation point was added to that statement when [[Dan Gurney]] shook and sprayed champagne on the podium, starting a tradition.  The Mark IV was Shelby's last prototype racer, as new limits on engine displacement for that class took all of Ford's high-performance engines out of eligibility.\n\nShelby's early racing successes led to a joint effort of Ford and Shelby-American to produce the Mustang-based [[Shelby GT350]], starting in 1965, then the [[Shelby GT500]], starting in 1967. Shelby produced those cars through 1968, then subsequent cars with the Shelby GT brand were produced in-house by Ford.\n\nAfter parting with Ford, Shelby moved on to help develop performance cars with divisions of the two other [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big 3]] American companies: [[Dodge]], and [[Oldsmobile]].\n\nIn the intervening years, Shelby had a series of ventures start and stop relating to production of \"completion\" Cobras&nbsp;\u2014 cars that were allegedly built using \"leftover\" parts and frames. In the 1960s, the [[FIA]] required entrants (Shelby, Ford, Ferrari, etc.) to produce at least 100 cars for [[homologated]] classes of racing. Shelby simply ordered an insufficient number of cars and skipped a large block of [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s, to create the illusion the company had imported large numbers of cars. Decades later in the 1990s, Carroll alleged that he had found the \"left over\" frames, and began selling cars which were supposedly finally \"completed\". After it was discovered the cars were built from scratch in collaboration with McCluskey, Ltd., they were re-termed \"continuation\" Cobras. The cars are still built to this day, known as the current CSX4000 series of Cobras.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1991, the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/carroll-shelby.html Carroll Shelby] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 1992, the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1992,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319205857/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/carroll-shelby/126/ Automotive Hall of Fame]</ref> and the [[Diecast Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

In 2004, a new '''[[Ford Shelby Cobra Concept]]''' was shown off at U.S. car shows. Built with a retro body mimicking the 1960s [[AC Cobra|Cobras]] mixed with modern touches, it was based on the [[Ford GT]] chassis (reworked for [[front engine]]/[[rear wheel drive]]) powered with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] that produced 605&nbsp;hp (451&nbsp;kW). It received overwhelmingly positive press reviews and has won the \"Best In Show\" award at Detroit International Auto Show.\n\nA coupe version of the Shelby Cobra roadster was introduced the following year. The '''[[Ford Shelby GR-1]]''' concept car of 2005. While sporting a completely modern design, it showed a nod to the 1960s [[Shelby Daytona]]. The GR-1, like the Cobra, is based on the GT's chassis. Press reviews for the GR-1 have been positive. The car was featured on the cover of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''[[Car Magazine]]''. The Ford Shelby GR-1 could possibly be built, taking over the [[Ford GT]]'s production line after its production comes to an end.\n\nIn 2005, Carroll Shelby built his first modern Masterpiece, the CSM #00001 V6 Shelby Mustang CS6, to prove to Ford that he could still build high-performance cars, and that he did, with the V6 putting out 380HP it made the V6 Shelby faster than Ford's V8 300HP. Because Ford thought the CS6 would hurt Ford Mustang V8 sales, Ford told Shelby to go with the V8 instead. Few CS6 Shelbys were made by Shelby; consequently these are among the rarest Shelbys in the world.\n\nThe [[Shelby Mustang|Shelby GT500]] was revealed at the [[New York International Auto Show]], and became available in the summer of 2006 as part of the model year 2007 lineup. It was powered by a 5.4 Liter Modular V8, with four-valves-per-cylinder heads borrowed from the $150K Ford GT supercar, an Eaton M122 [[Roots-type supercharger]] and is rated by Ford at {{convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|480|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. It boasts a [[Tremec]] T-6060 [[manual transmission]], reworked [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] geometry, 18-inch wheels, functional aerodynamic body kit, and still retains the [[Live axle|solid rear axle]]. The GT500 starts at an MSRP of $40,930 for the coupe, and $45,755 for the convertible version. Although Carroll Shelby had no hands-on involvement in the design of the car, he did provide Ford and SVT (Special Vehicle Team) input on what would make the car better and convinced Ford to enlist wider rear tires (from 255&nbsp;mm wide to 285&nbsp;mm wide).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nShelby, in cooperation with the [[Hertz Corporation]], produced 500 cars named \"Shelby GT-H\" in 2006. This was a special-edition Ford Mustang GT, available for rental from Hertz. A Ford Racing Performance Group FR1 Power Pack increased the GT's 4.6 L V8 engine to {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The cars included a custom Shelby hood and black and gold body styling, incorporating a gold-plated \"Hertz\" nameplate on both sides.\n\nA consumer version of the Shelby GT-H was available from Shelby through Ford dealers, called the Shelby GT. There were 5,682 vehicles for 2007 and 2,300 for 2008 were built. They had the same engine as the GT-H, but more suspension, appearance and drivetrain upgrades and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also. An available upgrade from the Shelby factory in Las Vegas were a few different superchargers. It then was called a Shelby GT/SC. All Shelby GTs are shipped with the Shelby serial number (CSM) on the dashboard badge and in the engine compartment, such as 07SGT0001 or 08SGT0001.\n\n==Non-Ford projects==\nIn his later years, Shelby brought several lawsuits against companies making copies of the Cobra body for use on kit cars&nbsp;\u2013 ostensibly for copyright, trademark and patent violations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Despite the litigation, the Cobra kit car industry continues to thrive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nOne of the lawsuits involved the Superformance Brock Coupe, a copy of the original Shelby Daytona Coupe. The Superformance Brock Coupe was designed by [[Pete Brock]], who had also designed the original Daytona Coupe for Shelby. Shelby American sued Superformance after the company had developed and begun production of the Superformance Brock Coupe. Eventually, the litigation was settled, though the terms of the settlement have never been released to the public. As a result of the agreement between the two companies, the product is now known as the Shelby Daytona Coupe, despite being neither designed nor built by Shelby American. Nearly 150 of these new Shelby Daytona Coupes have been built as of February 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 2002, Unique Performance, a company of Farmers Branch, Texas, purchased a license from Carroll Shelby Enterprises to place his name on a series of continuation vintage vehicles.

Like most Ferrari repairs, this was not going to be a cheap, simple fix. At the time, Laughlin was an active participant in the American sports car racing scene and was a close acquaintance of many of the key figures, including fellow Texan Shelby. The two had witnessed a number of V8-powered home-built specials challenge, and often defeat, the best that Europe had to offer. The idea developed that they should build a dual-purpose car based on the solid mechanicals of the Chevrolet Corvette. European-style alloy coachwork could help the chassis finally realize its potential. By chance, Laughlin owned a few Chevrolet dealerships and had a particularly valuable friend in Peter Coltrin, an automotive journalist who had gained an \u201cin\u201d with the influential Italians. Laughlin met with Jim Hall and Carroll Shelby to begin discussing what form their new Italian-American hybrid would take. The general consensus was that they should create a car that offered the best of both worlds \u2013 a Corvette with the distinction, performance and style of a Ferrari, but with the power and reliability of a Chevrolet. The aim was to create a genuine high-performance GT with enough leg and headroom to meet American expectations. Once this was decided, Coltrin put Laughlin in touch with Sergio Scaglietti. With the help of Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole, three 1959 Corvette chassis were discreetly acquired from the St. Louis Corvette plant before bodies could be fitted \u2013 one was specified with a \u201cfuelie\u201d and a four-speed, the others came with twin four barrels and automatics. During one of his frequent trips through Europe, Laughlin met with Sergio Scaglietti who agreed to produce a small run of bodies for the Corvette chassis. At the time, Scaglietti was busy turning out Ferrari's Tour de France and purpose-built racing cars. The Scaglietti Corvette would follow the lines of the Tour de France, albeit lines adapted to fit the Corvette's larger footprint. In an effort to impress, or perhaps, appease GM management, Laughlin specified a proper Corvette grille. The interior would be similarly hybridized with an intriguing combination of Americana \u2013 Stewart Warner gauges, T-handle parking brake, Corvette shift knob; and classic Italian GT \u2013 a purposeful crackle-finish dashboard, deeply bolstered leather seats and exquisite door hardware. \n[[File:ScagliettiCorvette.JPG|thumb|240px|right|1959 [[Scaglietti]] Corvette]]\nThe completed car arrived in Texas in the fall of 1960, almost 18 months after the chassis had been obtained. It proved to be the only one of the three to be finished in Italy and shipped back to the United States as a complete car. When Laughlin received the car, the fit and finish were not quite what he was expecting, especially as the project had taken nearly three years from conception to completion. Enzo Ferrari would have been quite unhappy to hear that his exclusive coach builder was working on side projects for a group of Texans, so, to Scaglietti's credit, the car was largely a prototype and the work was executed in a shroud of secrecy. Towards the end of the project, Carroll Shelby, who by then was living in Italy, received a late-night phone call from Ed Cole. Cole had been chastised by GM management and was told to drop the project. It was poor timing. American car companies were under pressure to cut down on their high-performance and racing programs. They simply could not deal with the repercussions of a GM-backed Italian bodied Corvette. The remaining cars were shipped to Houston in a partially completed state. Jim Hall took delivery of one. Shelby, who had helped conceive the project, ended up declining the remaining car and it was promptly sold.\n\n==Other projects==\nCarroll Shelby's name is associated with a chili fixings kit.

Shelby became interested in the potential of the [[AC Ace]] chassis, especially after [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] stopped building automobile engines, and the sales with the [[Ford Zephyr engine]] were declining in September 1961.  Shelby contacted Charles Hurlock of AC, who agreed to provide the chassis on credit.  Dave Evans of [[Ford Motor Company]], agreed to provide on credit, the 221-cubic-inch and 260-cubic-inch V8 engines with transmissions.  The new car, called the Carroll Shelby Experimental or CSX0001, would be marketed as the Shelby AC Cobra, then [[AC Cobra]], and eventually, the [[Ford Cobra]].  Production began in March 1962, and 75 cars were sold by the end of the year.  A 100 cars had been built by April 1963, the first 75 with the 260-cubic-inch engine, followed by a 289-cubic-inch engine.  The 427 Cobra prototype was built in Oct. 1964.<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|172\u2013183,190,195}}\n\nShelby started racing his creation in October 1962 at Riverside, with Billy Krause driving the CSX0002.  Racing experience from 1963 indicated that further modifications were necessary to make the Cobra competitive with the Ferrari GT cars; in particular, the AC roadster body needed to be replaced with a lower-drag enclosed coupe body for high-speed circuits.  The result was the [[Shelby Daytona]] Coupe, which took three GT class wins on the 1964 [[World Sportscar Championship]] GT circuit, including Le Mans and the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood, plus the [[Sports Car Club of America]]'s [[United States Road Racing Championship|U.S. GT Championship]].  Then in 1965, Shelby American Cobra won the [[World Sportscar Championship|International Championship for GT Manufacturers]].<ref name=Shelby/>{{rp|180,202,208\u2013210,213\u2013214,217,221}}\n\nAfter success with the Daytona Coupe in 1964, Shelby-American became more heavily involved in Ford's [[Ford GT40|GT40]] Sports Prototype racing program, which had experienced disappointing results.  Shelby made changes to running gear, particularly transmissions, to improve reliability, and designed their GT40 Mark II variant around Ford's 7.0-liter engine.  The results paid off spectacularly in 1966, with the Mark II bringing Ford the overall Constructors' title in the World Sportscar Championship, clinched with their 1-2-3 finish at Le Mans.  But Ford could not rest on its laurels in light of Ferrari's determined efforts, and was developing a radical new prototype with a lightweight chassis based on aluminum honeycomb panels.  Shelby was brought in to finalize development of the car after the project experienced setbacks in 1966.  The Mark IV was introduced for the 1967 [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and won handily, then was prepared for Le Mans.  Various misfortunes took Ford out of realistic contention for a repeat title, but the Shelby-American team delivered another record-breaking statement win at Le Mans.  An exclamation point was added to that statement when [[Dan Gurney]] shook and sprayed champagne on the podium, starting a tradition.  The Mark IV was Shelby's last prototype racer, as new limits on engine displacement for that class took all of Ford's high-performance engines out of eligibility.\n\nShelby's early racing successes led to a joint effort of Ford and Shelby-American to produce the Mustang-based [[Shelby GT350]], starting in 1965, then the [[Shelby GT500]], starting in 1967. Shelby produced those cars through 1968, then subsequent cars with the Shelby GT brand were produced in-house by Ford.\n\nAfter parting with Ford, Shelby moved on to help develop performance cars with divisions of the two other [[Big Three automobile manufacturers|Big 3]] American companies: [[Dodge]], and [[Oldsmobile]].\n\nIn the intervening years, Shelby had a series of ventures start and stop relating to production of \"completion\" Cobras&nbsp;\u2014 cars that were allegedly built using \"leftover\" parts and frames. In the 1960s, the [[FIA]] required entrants (Shelby, Ford, Ferrari, etc.) to produce at least 100 cars for [[homologated]] classes of racing. Shelby simply ordered an insufficient number of cars and skipped a large block of [[Vehicle Identification Number]]s, to create the illusion the company had imported large numbers of cars. Decades later in the 1990s, Carroll alleged that he had found the \"left over\" frames, and began selling cars which were supposedly finally \"completed\". After it was discovered the cars were built from scratch in collaboration with McCluskey, Ltd., they were re-termed \"continuation\" Cobras. The cars are still built to this day, known as the current CSX4000 series of Cobras.\n\nHe was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]] in 1991, the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]<ref name=MSHoF>[http://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/carroll-shelby.html Carroll Shelby] at the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]]</ref> in 1992, the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1992,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160319205857/http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/inductee/carroll-shelby/126/ Automotive Hall of Fame]</ref> and the [[Diecast Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

In 2004, a new '''[[Ford Shelby Cobra Concept]]''' was shown off at U.S. car shows. Built with a retro body mimicking the 1960s [[AC Cobra|Cobras]] mixed with modern touches, it was based on the [[Ford GT]] chassis (reworked for [[front engine]]/[[rear wheel drive]]) powered with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] that produced 605&nbsp;hp (451&nbsp;kW). It received overwhelmingly positive press reviews and has won the \"Best In Show\" award at Detroit International Auto Show.\n\nA coupe version of the Shelby Cobra roadster was introduced the following year. The '''[[Ford Shelby GR-1]]''' concept car of 2005. While sporting a completely modern design, it showed a nod to the 1960s [[Shelby Daytona]]. The GR-1, like the Cobra, is based on the GT's chassis. Press reviews for the GR-1 have been positive. The car was featured on the cover of ''[[Motor Trend]]'' and ''[[Car Magazine]]''. The Ford Shelby GR-1 could possibly be built, taking over the [[Ford GT]]'s production line after its production comes to an end.\n\nIn 2005, Carroll Shelby built his first modern Masterpiece, the CSM #00001 V6 Shelby Mustang CS6, to prove to Ford that he could still build high-performance cars, and that he did, with the V6 putting out 380HP it made the V6 Shelby faster than Ford's V8 300HP. Because Ford thought the CS6 would hurt Ford Mustang V8 sales, Ford told Shelby to go with the V8 instead. Few CS6 Shelbys were made by Shelby; consequently these are among the rarest Shelbys in the world.\n\nThe [[Shelby Mustang|Shelby GT500]] was revealed at the [[New York International Auto Show]], and became available in the summer of 2006 as part of the model year 2007 lineup. It was powered by a 5.4 Liter Modular V8, with four-valves-per-cylinder heads borrowed from the $150K Ford GT supercar, an Eaton M122 [[Roots-type supercharger]] and is rated by Ford at {{convert|500|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|480|ft.lbf|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. It boasts a [[Tremec]] T-6060 [[manual transmission]], reworked [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] geometry, 18-inch wheels, functional aerodynamic body kit, and still retains the [[Live axle|solid rear axle]]. The GT500 starts at an MSRP of $40,930 for the coupe, and $45,755 for the convertible version. Although Carroll Shelby had no hands-on involvement in the design of the car, he did provide Ford and SVT (Special Vehicle Team) input on what would make the car better and convinced Ford to enlist wider rear tires (from 255&nbsp;mm wide to 285&nbsp;mm wide).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nShelby, in cooperation with the [[Hertz Corporation]], produced 500 cars named \"Shelby GT-H\" in 2006. This was a special-edition Ford Mustang GT, available for rental from Hertz. A Ford Racing Performance Group FR1 Power Pack increased the GT's 4.6 L V8 engine to {{convert|325|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The cars included a custom Shelby hood and black and gold body styling, incorporating a gold-plated \"Hertz\" nameplate on both sides.\n\nA consumer version of the Shelby GT-H was available from Shelby through Ford dealers, called the Shelby GT. There were 5,682 vehicles for 2007 and 2,300 for 2008 were built. They had the same engine as the GT-H, but more suspension, appearance and drivetrain upgrades and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. White and black colors were available for 2007 models and grabber orange or vista blue were available for 2008. A convertible was available in 2008 also. An available upgrade from the Shelby factory in Las Vegas were a few different superchargers. It then was called a Shelby GT/SC.

The Superformance Brock Coupe was designed by [[Pete Brock]], who had also designed the original Daytona Coupe for Shelby. Shelby American sued Superformance after the company had developed and begun production of the Superformance Brock Coupe. Eventually, the litigation was settled, though the terms of the settlement have never been released to the public. As a result of the agreement between the two companies, the product is now known as the Shelby Daytona Coupe, despite being neither designed nor built by Shelby American. Nearly 150 of these new Shelby Daytona Coupes have been built as of February 2007.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 2002, Unique Performance, a company of Farmers Branch, Texas, purchased a license from Carroll Shelby Enterprises to place his name on a series of continuation vintage vehicles.

Like most Ferrari repairs, this was not going to be a cheap, simple fix. At the time, Laughlin was an active participant in the American sports car racing scene and was a close acquaintance of many of the key figures, including fellow Texan Shelby. The two had witnessed a number of V8-powered home-built specials challenge, and often defeat, the best that Europe had to offer. The idea developed that they should build a dual-purpose car based on the solid mechanicals of the Chevrolet Corvette. European-style alloy coachwork could help the chassis finally realize its potential. By chance, Laughlin owned a few Chevrolet dealerships and had a particularly valuable friend in Peter Coltrin, an automotive journalist who had gained an \u201cin\u201d with the influential Italians. Laughlin met with Jim Hall and Carroll Shelby to begin discussing what form their new Italian-American hybrid would take. The general consensus was that they should create a car that offered the best of both worlds \u2013 a Corvette with the distinction, performance and style of a Ferrari, but with the power and reliability of a Chevrolet. The aim was to create a genuine high-performance GT with enough leg and headroom to meet American expectations. Once this was decided, Coltrin put Laughlin in touch with Sergio Scaglietti. With the help of Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole, three 1959 Corvette chassis were discreetly acquired from the St. Louis Corvette plant before bodies could be fitted \u2013 one was specified with a \u201cfuelie\u201d and a four-speed, the others came with twin four barrels and automatics. During one of his frequent trips through Europe, Laughlin met with Sergio Scaglietti who agreed to produce a small run of bodies for the Corvette chassis. At the time, Scaglietti was busy turning out Ferrari's Tour de France and purpose-built racing cars. The Scaglietti Corvette would follow the lines of the Tour de France, albeit lines adapted to fit the Corvette's larger footprint. In an effort to impress, or perhaps, appease GM management, Laughlin specified a proper Corvette grille. The interior would be similarly hybridized with an intriguing combination of Americana \u2013 Stewart Warner gauges, T-handle parking brake, Corvette shift knob; and classic Italian GT \u2013 a purposeful crackle-finish dashboard, deeply bolstered leather seats and exquisite door hardware. \n[[File:ScagliettiCorvette.JPG|thumb|240px|right|1959 [[Scaglietti]] Corvette]]\nThe completed car arrived in Texas in the fall of 1960, almost 18 months after the chassis had been obtained. It proved to be the only one of the three to be finished in Italy and shipped back to the United States as a complete car. When Laughlin received the car, the fit and finish were not quite what he was expecting, especially as the project had taken nearly three years from conception to completion. Enzo Ferrari would have been quite unhappy to hear that his exclusive coach builder was working on side projects for a group of Texans, so, to Scaglietti's credit, the car was largely a prototype and the work was executed in a shroud of secrecy. Towards the end of the project, Carroll Shelby, who by then was living in Italy, received a late-night phone call from Ed Cole. Cole had been chastised by GM management and was told to drop the project. It was poor timing. American car companies were under pressure to cut down on their high-performance and racing programs. They simply could not deal with the repercussions of a GM-backed Italian bodied Corvette. The remaining cars were shipped to Houston in a partially completed state. Jim Hall took delivery of one. Shelby, who had helped conceive the project, ended up declining the remaining car and it was promptly sold.\n\n==Other projects==\nCarroll Shelby's name is associated with a chili fixings kit.

The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was part of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and was attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. The 1139th Engineer Combat Group fought from northern France to Austria in World War II, supporting General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s Third Army's rapid movements during the war.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group is credited with opening routes for the advancement of troops which included building 119 tactical bridges, of which 39 were 200 feet or longer, including the 1,896 foot \"longest floating tactical bridge constructed in the European Theater of Operations.\" The Group was first formed in December 1943 and deactivated in December 1946.\n\n=History=\n\n==Development of the Engineer Combat Group Concept==\nStarting with WWII, the United States Army defined a Combat Group to be similar to a Regiment, the unit from which the Group was evolved.  In general, a Regiment is composed of a fixed number of Battalions whose personnel and equipment are likewise fixed. The Battalions have only the minimum administrative personnel, with the result that administrative details are handled by the Regimental Headquarters.  In warfare as mobile and on as vast a scale as the European campaign was, it was felt that the Regiment was not sufficiently agile for achieving maximum effectiveness; therefor, the Group was created to be more flexible; units could be attached or detached as the situations warranted.\n\nIn the specific case of the Engineer Combat Group, all units were separate entities; the Group would consist of an unspecified number of separate companies and battalions, which were attached to and detached from the Group Headquarters as the situations demanded. Thus, in the instance of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group, there were as many as five battalions and three separate companies under their command at one time, and at other times they functioned with as little as a single company. The job of the 1139th was twofold; primarily they were responsible for the administration of the units under their command; and secondarily they acted in a supervisory capacity for all work assigned to the Group.  In addition to the combat engineer battalions, the group could have attached separate battalions and companies that specialized in and carried equipment for constructing specific types of bridges such as Heavy and Light [[Pontoon bridge|Ponton Bridges]], Treadway and Bailey Bridges, or other specialized support functions such as Area Lighting or Smoke Generation. The group was designed as a flexible organization set up to efficiently meet rapidly changing tactical requirements.  The units under control of Group Headquarters were used to support the Division's Engineer Operations, providing special equipment which the division engineers did not carry, and augmenting the personnel strength of the division Engineer Battalions.<ref name=\"1139th Engineers\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineer Combat Group Unit History; 1 July 1944 to 8 May 1945 |publisher=1139th Engineer Combat Group |page=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Engineer Combat Group had many duties; construction, repair and dismantling of various bridge types, clearing of obstacles, road repair and construction, ferrying troops in river crossings, and detecting, removing, and laying of mines and demolitions, in addition to offensive and defensive infantry functions.\n\n==1139th Engineer Combat Group Training and Deployment==\n[[File:Camp Ellis Eng Grp Train.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Engineer Group at Camp Ellis training on bridge building techniques, 1940]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945]]\n\nMany of the troops that would eventually make up the 1139th Engineer Combat Group received their initial training at [[Camp Ellis|Camp Ellis, Illinois]], the Army Services Training Center located southwest of Peoria, Illinois.

Patton|General Patton's]] army the mission of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was to travel directly behind the armor and remove mines, build bridges, fight as infantry and perform other engineering activities that allowed the rapid advancement of the XX Corps. (The XX Corps played a measurable role in [[Walton Walker|Patton's dash across France in August and early September 1944, earning the nickname \"Ghost Corps\" for the speed of its advance]]; starting in Bricquebec, France, they traveled 600 miles in their first 30 days).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=12}}</ref>   The XX Corps armored divisions typically traveled many miles ahead of the main body of the army, which resulted in many enemy positions being overrun before alarm could be given.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group arrived in the vicinity of Saint Jean sur Erve, France, on August 10, 1944, and was joined by their first battalions; the 135th, the 179th, and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.  The initial activity of the Group was to support the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]] in its thrust north against the enemy near Sainte-Suzanne, France.\n\nOn August 13, 1944, while en route during this advance, the Group removed landmines from roads and shoulders, and the first of the 1139th's bridges were constructed; two 60 foot [[Bailey bridge|Bailey Bridges]] built at St. Mars and St. George, France, on the sites of two bridges that had been blown up by the enemy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=2}}</ref>   (A Bailey Bridge is a temporary pre-fabricated, truss bridge, quickly assembled from prefabricated, standardized parts, assembled on land and then launched across an opening).<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=189}}</ref>   Two days later they constructed two [[Ponton bridge|Treadway Bridges M2]] across the Huisne River at La Fert\u00e9-Bernard, and at Nogent-le-Rotrou, France.

They engaged in firefight operations by cleaning out machine-gun and anti-tank gun nests in Bonville, France, suffering 6 dead and 12 wounded.  They constructed two short Treadway bridges at Luce, France, west of Chartres and removed twelve large bombs from bridges in [[Chartres]].  By the next day they were joined by the 7th Armored Division, and the city was finally liberated.\n\nThe Group then moved north to the vicinity of Treon, France, in support of the 7th Armored Division.  There they were tasked with clearing the roads of mines, removing booby-trapped vehicles from roads, de-booby-trapping the Railroad station at Dreux, France, and filling in road craters in the routes of the advancement.  They continued to move rapidly forward, and the Seine River was reached on August 23, 1944, where they bivouacked in an open field near Melun, France.  At Sainte Sauveur, France, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported the 7th Armored Division in its initial crossing of the Seine River at Tilly, France by manning assault boats, by establishing a beachhead and constructing a 504-foot Treadway Bridge while under direct fire, and by constructing a 204-foot footbridge across the canal at Melun, France.  The construction of the foot-bridge was carried on under heavy small arms and 88mm fire.  An 88mm shell blew out 50 feet of the bridge during construction, which had to be replaced while under intense enemy fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\">{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the Seine was bridged in three more places by the 991st and the 994th Engineer Treadway Bridge Companies, the 537th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 135th, 179th, and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.<ref name=\"1139Engp15\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=15}}</ref> These crossings consisted of multiple span continuous Bailey bridges, a 210-foot Bailey at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Frances, and a 420-foot Bailey at Champagne, France.

When the bridges were completed, they were guarded and maintained while under considerable fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\" />\n\nArriving at Montmiral, France on August 28, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group underwent a leadership change with Executive Officer Colonel Walker leaving to become the commanding officer of the 1103rd Engineer Combat Group, and Lt. Col Robert Eininger replacing him.\n\nThe next major objective of the Third Army was Verdun, France and the Moselle Valley, which offered a natural gap in Germany's frontier line.  Early in the morning of September 2, 1944, the XX Corps arrived 5 miles west of Verdun.  Within a matter of hours, the city fell to the armored division, and on September 4, 1944, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company had built a 200-foot Baily bridge over the Meuse River and a bridgehead was established on the eastern side of the river. At this point, the Third Army's Armored Divisions had outpaced the [[Red Ball Express|Redball]] gasoline supply column, and although emergency supply convoys were rushed south, the Germans had time to reinforce their [[Fortifications of Metz|positions at Metz, Germany]].  The American bridgehead had to be withdrawn from across the Meuse. While awaiting gasoline reinforcements the 1139th Engineer Combat Group completed a considerable amount of repair on the railroads in the vicinity.  Repairs were made by filling in bomb craters in the yards east of Verdun, and by rehabilitation of the track and roadbed from Conflans to Verdun, France, including construction of a 280-foot single track bridge at Conflans.<ref name=\"Headquarters Unit History, September 1\u201330, 1944\">{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; September 1-30, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=7}}</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 1944, when adequate supplies had finally reached the Third Army, they moved on toward Thiacourt, France. The 135th Engineer Combat Battalion working with the 180th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion constructed a 260-foot Heavy Ponton bridge at Pagny, France.  Because of a shortage of Engineer troops, it was necessary to form a provisional platoon from the Group Headquarters Company to assist in the construction.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>  Then working with the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, they constructed two 80 foot Bailey bridges across the Moselle River.

The cost in lives was high,<ref name=\"1139Engp15\" /> but it helped pave the way towards taking the heavily defended city of [[Metz]].

Over 5000 troops were under their command, including the 5th, 83rd, 90th, and 95th Infantry Divisions, the 179th and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions, the 991st Engineer Treadway Company, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 623rd Engineer Light Equipment Company.  This concentration of men and equipment was in preparation of supporting the crossing of the Moselle River by the 10th Armored Division and the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions.  In preparation for this, the troops were instructed in crossing techniques using [[Assault boat|Assault Boats]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Infantry Assault Boat Training Program |date=October 31, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified / Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20136}}</ref> and the Group experimented with building a rapid bridge-launching-device constructed on a tank frame.

These crossings were unusually difficult because the Moselle River was in a state of 30-year flood, and the enemy was continually making the bridging difficult with heavy artillery, machine gun and small arms fire.  The enemy fire at Cattenom, France, was so intense that the 440 foot Floating Bailey Bridge was eventually lost.  In most of these crossings the engineers had to first resort to ferrying operations in order for the infantry to clear a beachhead on the eastern shore so that the bridges could be constructed.  Numerous troop losses occurred during these crossings.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |pages=2\u20136}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bailey Bridge at Thionville, France.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Bailey Bridge built across the Moselle River at Thionville, France by the 1139th.]]\n\nAfter the successful crossing of the Moselle River by the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions and the 10th Armored Division, studies of aerial photographs revealed the need for all the engineers in the Group to help overcome the obstacles left by the enemy; extensive antitank ditches, craters, pill boxes, blown bridges, and numerous mine fields (one minefield alone was estimated to contain 10,000 mines).<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=7}}</ref>  The burden of this work was so great that the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion was reattached to the 1139th Engineer Combat Group for the purpose of taking over the work in the rear of the division, including filling craters and ditches, destroying pill boxes, constructing fords, marking minefields, posting road signs, changing town signs, and removing the dead to [[Mortuary Affairs|Graves Registration]].  Because of the large number of bridges under construction during November, it was also necessary to utilize the 88th Engineer Heavy Ponton Bridge Battalion to haul Bailey bridges from Army Supply Point No. 8 to Thionville, France, and to maintain the Group Bridge Dump there.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, November 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. infantry soliders deploying an M2 assault boat in Europe in World War II.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Combat engineer]]s ferrying infantry in [[assault boat#Assault Boats|M2 assault boat.]]]]\n\n[[File:Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Double Treadway M1 Pontoon Bridges built by 1139th at B\u00fcren, Germany, December 11, 1944.]]\n\n[[File:Infantry support bridge over Saar River erected by 289th Engineers at Volklingen.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ponton bridge|Infantry support bridge]] over [[Saar River]] erected by 289th Engineers at [[Volklingen]]]]\n\nIn December 1944, while planning the crossing of the Saar River, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was stationed at Niedaltdorf, France.

Following these operations the storm boats continued to evacuate wounded and to deliver supplies.  Although all operations of the river were carried out under continuous heavy artillery and small arms fire day and night, there was no letup in the steady flow of materials and supplies by the storm boats.

This was of importance since a floating bridge was not able to be constructed, since sections were shot away as rapidly as they were placed into the water.  The Saar across from Dillingen, Germany, continued to prove difficult to cross because of heavy fire<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=39}}</ref> from a large number of occupied German [[Pillbox (military)|pill boxes]] on the eastern side of the river where the [[Siegfried Line]] had been most heavily constructed.

When General Patton learned of the attack, he quickly repositioned six full divisions of his army from their locations along the Saar River to launch a counterattack north to relieve the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at Bastogne.  To replace the repositioned defensive divisions along the Saar River, the 90th Infantry Division withdrew from their eastern beachhead at Dillengen to join the 95th Infantry Division in defending the western side of the River.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported both divisions in constructing defensive barriers consisting of mine fields, roadblocks, and bridges prepared for demolition, as well as guarding many of these deterrents.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, December 1 - 31, 1944 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945]]\n\nDuring January 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group continued to support defensive operations on the west bank of the Saar River, consisting of barrier zone and roadwork maintenance, installation of an anti-mine boom at Maim\u00fchle, Germany, roadway snow-plowing and sanding, guarding displaced German citizens at Niedaltdorf, removing mines and booby traps at Thionville, and patrolling the banks of the Moselle River.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, January 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, January 1 - 31, 1945 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat from the Ardennes.

Because of sudden thaws supplemented by heavy rains, the Moselle River was swollen to flood heights again.  As a result, great ice floes were swept down the river with such force that it necessitated the removal of all floating bridges.  The salvaged materials were removed and placed in the storage dumps, and as soon as possible the bridges were reconstructed to allow traffic over the Moselle again.  On February 20, 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was given the mission of assisting the 94th Infantry Division in its assault crossing of the Saar River.

Finally, site reconnaissance at the river's edge by Group personnel determined the exact location for the bridge.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, March 1 - 31, 1945 |page=2}}</ref>  This crossing required two assault operations led by the 80th Infantry Division with support from the 135th Engineer Combat Battalion.<ref name=\"Builders and Fighters\">{{cite book |last1=Fowle |first1=Barry W. |title=Builders and Fighters U.S. Army Engineers in World War II |date=22 March 2005 |publisher=United States Army Corps of Engineers |location=Fort Belvoir, Virginia |isbn=9781410221773 |page=470 |edition=First Edition Revised 1992}}</ref>\n\nThe first infantry crossing (using assault boats) incurred a high causality rate, so the two battalions were then crossed by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported Navel units.  Once the infantry was ashore, ferrying operations were carried on by Navy operated boats, using 6 [[Landing Craft Mechanized|LCMs]] and 6 [[LCVP (United States)|Higgens Boats]].  During the launching there was heavy artillery fire, 20mm and small arms fire on the site, knocking out a bulldozer and killing a naval officer.  However, the 997th Engineer Treadway Company with assistance from the 160th Engineer Combat Battalion was able to construct a Treadway M2 Bridge across the Rhine 1,896 feet long; ''the Longest Tactical Bridge built in the European Theater of Operations''.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Builders and Fighters U.S. Army Engineers in World War II |page=471}}</ref><ref>The 1370 foot long pontoon bridge built by the [[107th Engineer Battalion]] was the longest tactical floating bridge as of March 22, 1945.</ref>  This bridge served the entire XX Corps in crossing the Rhine and marked the end of the assault phase of the Rhein in the Third Army area.<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=113.

On March 31, 1945 the Third Army started its run towards Berlin, from Mainz, Germany, traveling north-east through Frankfurt to Friedberg, to Alsfeld, then crossing the Fulda River with a 312-foot Treadway M2 Bridge, on to Reichensachsen, Germany.  Then traveling eastward they next bridged the Werra River and traveled to Langensalza, Germany, and after bridging the Helme River on April 11, 1945, they traveled along the [[Autobahn]] for two days constructing Bailey Bridges where needed to repair sections of the highway that had been destroyed by allied bombardment.  While traveling the Autobahn, they came across an area where the median strip had been paved as a landing airstrip and painted green, and on it sat an unusual-looking plane with no propeller.  It turned out to be one of the German Jet planes that had been abandoned during the rapid retreat of the German Army.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite news |last1=Gabriel |first1=Michael, SSGT, 1139th Engineer Combat Group |title=Personal Interview, July, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VE Day Passing out Champagne to 1139th troops.jpg|thumb|left|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group troops celebrating VE Day with Champagne, near Lambach, Austria, May 8, 1945]]\n\nThe 1139th stopped in Weimar, Germany, on April 13, 1945.  Here they were situated in the most luxurious barracks that they had stayed in; formerly used by German Anti-aircraft troops.  However, it was also here that they saw their most horrible of all sights; the [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald Concentration Camp]].  The Third Army had liberated the camp just two days earlier.  At the urging of General Patton, many of the 1139th troops visited the camp and saw the walking skeletons, stacks of withered corpses, and incompletely burned bodies, pits of lime covered bodies, and all saw emaciated inmates from the camp walking along the road towards Weimer, and heard firsthand accounts about the horrors from a former Captain of the Dutch army, who was taken in from the camp to act as an interpreter.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=26}}</ref>\n\nOn April 16, 1945, the Third army continued moving eastward until it arrived just outside of Chemnitz, Germany.  At this point, they were only 135 miles from Berlin.  However, with the threat of a [[National redoubt|National Redoubt]] (potential reorganization and resistance by the remainder of the German army), [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] ordered Patton's army southward toward Bavaria and Czechoslovakia, anticipating a last stand there by Nazi German forces.<ref>{{cite book |title=Crusade in Europe |page=397}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A Soldier's Story |page=536}}</ref> The XX Corps raced south-westward to Lichtenfels, Germany; bridging the Saale and the Weisse rivers, arriving April 18, 1945.  Then turning southeast they bridged the Main River and traveled to Pegnitz, Germany, and after spanning the Naab River with a 240-foot Treadway M2 Bridge arrived in Burglengenfeld, Germany on April 25, 1945.  On April 27, 1945, they traveled to Regensburg where they stopped to develop plans for crossing the Danube River.

On May 4, 1945, the 1139th constructed a 560-foot Heavy Ponton Bridge over the Inn River at Passau, Germany, and the next day they left Ortenburg, Germany and moved southeastward to Lambach, Austria, where contact was made with the Russian forces.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History 1 April 45 to 8 May 45 |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThis was the furthest they traveled in search for the National Redoubt by the German Army. It was here, on May 7, 1945, that the troops heard that finally Germany would officially surrender the next day.  The same day General Walton H. Walker, commander of the XX Corps, received the unconditional surrender of Generaloberst [[Lothar Rendulic]], commander of German Army Group South.<ref>[http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-71st-divisions-cavalry-reconnaissance-troop-find-the-german-army-group-south.htm 71st Division Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop find the German Army Group South]</ref>\n\nThe 1139th constructed a 516-foot Treadway M2 Bridge across the Isar River at Plattling, Austria, and on May 9, 1945, they constructed their final bridge, a 755-foot Heavy Ponton Bridge over the Inn River at Schaerding, Austria.<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=36}}</ref>  On May 10, 1945, the 1139th left Lambach, Austria and began their return home moving north-eastward to Ried im Innkreis, Austria.\n\n== The 1139th as part of the Army of Occupation in Germany ==\n\nAfter [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]], the 1139th was involved in assisting the German people rebuild their state as part of the U.S. Army of Occupation in Germany.  Initially, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group expected to be broken up following [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]], with some troops destined for the Pacific, while others moved to fill in personnel gaps in other units.\n\n[[File:Victoria Mine Saarland Germany June 1945.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Victoria Mine; Saarland, Germany, during preparations for operation, June 1945]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group troops on the way home.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group troops on the way home on a Kaiser Victory Ship.]]\n\nHowever, General Eisenhower felt that rehabilitation of the Ruhr area in Germany was vital to rebuilding the German economy, because nowhere else in Europe were there coal deposits of that quality and ease of access.  This coal was key to allowing Germany to rebuild its industries and in turn to feed its own population.<ref>{{cite book |title=Crusade in Europe |page=442}}</ref>\n\nColonel Niles and the 1139th Engineer Combat Group were given this duty. The 1139th was assigned to get the Bavarian and Saar coal mines back in operation.  This included clearing and preparing the mine sites for return to operations, and because there were few returning coal miners, the 1139th's Engineers were also required to providing training and education to the surviving populous on running the mine.  The 1139th worked on the mine projects for many months.  During these activities the 1139th was experiencing a slow reduction in troop size as the GIs with 45 VE Day points or more were discharged and returned home to the states.<ref name=\"Interview\" />\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group was disbanded in December 1946, with the last of the troops returning to the states.\n\n= Tables and Documents =\n\n== Table 1: Divisions and Regiments that were supported by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group ==\n{|class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n!

The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was part of the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and was attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. The 1139th Engineer Combat Group fought from northern France to Austria in World War II, supporting General [[George S. Patton|George Patton]]'s Third Army's rapid movements during the war.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group is credited with opening routes for the advancement of troops which included building 119 tactical bridges, of which 39 were 200 feet or longer, including the 1,896 foot \"longest floating tactical bridge constructed in the European Theater of Operations.\" The Group was first formed in December 1943 and deactivated in December 1946.\n\n=History=\n\n==Development of the Engineer Combat Group Concept==\nStarting with WWII, the United States Army defined a Combat Group to be similar to a Regiment, the unit from which the Group was evolved.  In general, a Regiment is composed of a fixed number of Battalions whose personnel and equipment are likewise fixed. The Battalions have only the minimum administrative personnel, with the result that administrative details are handled by the Regimental Headquarters.  In warfare as mobile and on as vast a scale as the European campaign was, it was felt that the Regiment was not sufficiently agile for achieving maximum effectiveness; therefor, the Group was created to be more flexible; units could be attached or detached as the situations warranted.\n\nIn the specific case of the Engineer Combat Group, all units were separate entities; the Group would consist of an unspecified number of separate companies and battalions, which were attached to and detached from the Group Headquarters as the situations demanded. Thus, in the instance of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group, there were as many as five battalions and three separate companies under their command at one time, and at other times they functioned with as little as a single company. The job of the 1139th was twofold; primarily they were responsible for the administration of the units under their command; and secondarily they acted in a supervisory capacity for all work assigned to the Group.  In addition to the combat engineer battalions, the group could have attached separate battalions and companies that specialized in and carried equipment for constructing specific types of bridges such as Heavy and Light [[Pontoon bridge|Ponton Bridges]], Treadway and Bailey Bridges, or other specialized support functions such as Area Lighting or Smoke Generation. The group was designed as a flexible organization set up to efficiently meet rapidly changing tactical requirements.  The units under control of Group Headquarters were used to support the Division's Engineer Operations, providing special equipment which the division engineers did not carry, and augmenting the personnel strength of the division Engineer Battalions.<ref name=\"1139th Engineers\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineer Combat Group Unit History; 1 July 1944 to 8 May 1945 |publisher=1139th Engineer Combat Group |page=4}}</ref>\n\nThe Engineer Combat Group had many duties; construction, repair and dismantling of various bridge types, clearing of obstacles, road repair and construction, ferrying troops in river crossings, and detecting, removing, and laying of mines and demolitions, in addition to offensive and defensive infantry functions.\n\n==1139th Engineer Combat Group Training and Deployment==\n[[File:Camp Ellis Eng Grp Train.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Engineer Group at Camp Ellis training on bridge building techniques, 1940]]\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group, 1944 - 1945]]\n\nMany of the troops that would eventually make up the 1139th Engineer Combat Group received their initial training at [[Camp Ellis|Camp Ellis, Illinois]], the Army Services Training Center located southwest of Peoria, Illinois.  From there they were sent to [[Beale Air Force Base|Camp Beale, California]], an Army training camp.  Most were consigned to \"the duration plus six months\".  In addition to their basic training courses, they received courses in camouflage, mine field clearing, mapping, reconnaissance, bridge building, and road construction.<ref name=\"Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders\">{{cite book |last1=Fitzharris |first1=Joseph C |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders: Company B, 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment |date=2007 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=978-1-58544-550-9 |page=186}}</ref> The 1139th was commanded by Colonel John S.

Barry]].  Early the next morning the ship joined a convoy heading to Scotland.  They arrived at the town of Greenock, Firth of Clyde, Scotland on July 12, 1944.  The next day they disembarked and traveled via a twelve-hour train trip to Doddington, [[Nantwich]], England, where they organized their men and supplies, and drew vehicles, trailers and other T/E equipment (equipment specified for their specific operations) as required.\n\nOn August 1, 1944, they traveled via truck convoy from Doddington to [[Bournemouth | Bournemouth, England]]; a large troop marshaling area in preparation of movement to Continental Europe.  On August 5, 1944, they left England sailing on the USAT George Custer and arrived on [[Utah Beach]] just two months after the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]] there.  Over the next two days, the unit disembarked and bivouacked in the Utah Beach area.\n\n== The 1139th in the European Theater of Operations ==\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Engineer Combat Group troops bivouacked in France, August 1944]]\n\nOn August 8, 1944, they proceeded in motor convoy across the Cherbourg Peninsula moving north to Bricquebec, France, and at that point they began to work as an operational unit taking its position in the line of advance, with the [[First United States Army|First Army]] on its left flank and the [[XII Corps (United States)|XII Corps]] on the right flank.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group was assigned to the [[United States Army Central|Third Army]] and attached for operations to the [[XX Corps (United States)|XX Corps]] in direct support of the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]]. (When a unit is \"assigned\", it becomes a permanent part of the headquarters to which it is assigned. When the unit is \"attached\", it comes under the administrative and operational control of that unit to which it is attached.)\n\n[[File:1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops.jpg|thumb|right|300px|1139th Engineer Combat Group Troops on the road]]\n\nIt was at that point that their Executive Officer, [[Walton Walker|Colonel Walton H. Walker]], outlined their responsibilities; as part of [[George S. Patton|General Patton's]] army the mission of the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was to travel directly behind the armor and remove mines, build bridges, fight as infantry and perform other engineering activities that allowed the rapid advancement of the XX Corps. (The XX Corps played a measurable role in [[Walton Walker|Patton's dash across France in August and early September 1944, earning the nickname \"Ghost Corps\" for the speed of its advance]]; starting in Bricquebec, France, they traveled 600 miles in their first 30 days).<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=12}}</ref>   The XX Corps armored divisions typically traveled many miles ahead of the main body of the army, which resulted in many enemy positions being overrun before alarm could be given.\n\nThe 1139th Engineer Combat Group arrived in the vicinity of Saint Jean sur Erve, France, on August 10, 1944, and was joined by their first battalions; the 135th, the 179th, and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.  The initial activity of the Group was to support the [[80th Division (United States)|80th Infantry Division]] in its thrust north against the enemy near Sainte-Suzanne, France.\n\nOn August 13, 1944, while en route during this advance, the Group removed landmines from roads and shoulders, and the first of the 1139th's bridges were constructed; two 60 foot [[Bailey bridge|Bailey Bridges]] built at St. Mars and St. George, France, on the sites of two bridges that had been blown up by the enemy.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=2}}</ref>   (A Bailey Bridge is a temporary pre-fabricated, truss bridge, quickly assembled from prefabricated, standardized parts, assembled on land and then launched across an opening).<ref>{{cite book |title=Patton's Fighting Bridge Builders |page=189}}</ref>   Two days later they constructed two [[Ponton bridge|Treadway Bridges M2]] across the Huisne River at La Fert\u00e9-Bernard, and at Nogent-le-Rotrou, France.  (A Treadway Bridge is a floating bridge, using pontoons to support a continuous deck for pedestrian and vehicle travel).  In his European campaign, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General Eisenhower]] recognized that the Treadway bridge was an essential piece of equipment to the campaign, easy to transport, quickly installed, and capable of sustaining heavy military loads.<ref name=\"Crusade in Europe\">{{cite book |last1=Eisenhower |first1=Dwight D. |title=Crusade in Europe |date=2 July 1997 |publisher=Doubleday & Company, Inc. |location=Garden City, New York |isbn=080185668X |page=380 |edition=1948 First}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px| 1139th Troops bivouacked near Melun, France, August 23, 1944]]\n\nOn August 17, 1944, the 1139th meet stiff resistance as they were trying to enter Chartres, France, requiring the 1139th Engineer Combat Group to take on their infantry role. They engaged in firefight operations by cleaning out machine-gun and anti-tank gun nests in Bonville, France, suffering 6 dead and 12 wounded.  They constructed two short Treadway bridges at Luce, France, west of Chartres and removed twelve large bombs from bridges in [[Chartres]].  By the next day they were joined by the 7th Armored Division, and the city was finally liberated.\n\nThe Group then moved north to the vicinity of Treon, France, in support of the 7th Armored Division.  There they were tasked with clearing the roads of mines, removing booby-trapped vehicles from roads, de-booby-trapping the Railroad station at Dreux, France, and filling in road craters in the routes of the advancement.  They continued to move rapidly forward, and the Seine River was reached on August 23, 1944, where they bivouacked in an open field near Melun, France.  At Sainte Sauveur, France, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported the 7th Armored Division in its initial crossing of the Seine River at Tilly, France by manning assault boats, by establishing a beachhead and constructing a 504-foot Treadway Bridge while under direct fire, and by constructing a 204-foot footbridge across the canal at Melun, France.  The construction of the foot-bridge was carried on under heavy small arms and 88mm fire.  An 88mm shell blew out 50 feet of the bridge during construction, which had to be replaced while under intense enemy fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\">{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, August 5-31, 1944 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days, the Seine was bridged in three more places by the 991st and the 994th Engineer Treadway Bridge Companies, the 537th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 135th, 179th, and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.<ref name=\"1139Engp15\">{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=15}}</ref> These crossings consisted of multiple span continuous Bailey bridges, a 210-foot Bailey at Vulaines-sur-Seine, Frances, and a 420-foot Bailey at Champagne, France.  Most of the construction was carried out at night, and took place under enemy fire, resulting in several lives lost.  When the bridges were completed, they were guarded and maintained while under considerable fire.<ref name=\"HQp4\" />\n\nArriving at Montmiral, France on August 28, 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group underwent a leadership change with Executive Officer Colonel Walker leaving to become the commanding officer of the 1103rd Engineer Combat Group, and Lt. Col Robert Eininger replacing him.\n\nThe next major objective of the Third Army was Verdun, France and the Moselle Valley, which offered a natural gap in Germany's frontier line.  Early in the morning of September 2, 1944, the XX Corps arrived 5 miles west of Verdun.  Within a matter of hours, the city fell to the armored division, and on September 4, 1944, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company had built a 200-foot Baily bridge over the Meuse River and a bridgehead was established on the eastern side of the river. At this point, the Third Army's Armored Divisions had outpaced the [[Red Ball Express|Redball]] gasoline supply column, and although emergency supply convoys were rushed south, the Germans had time to reinforce their [[Fortifications of Metz|positions at Metz, Germany]].  The American bridgehead had to be withdrawn from across the Meuse. While awaiting gasoline reinforcements the 1139th Engineer Combat Group completed a considerable amount of repair on the railroads in the vicinity.  Repairs were made by filling in bomb craters in the yards east of Verdun, and by rehabilitation of the track and roadbed from Conflans to Verdun, France, including construction of a 280-foot single track bridge at Conflans.<ref name=\"Headquarters Unit History, September 1\u201330, 1944\">{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; September 1-30, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=7}}</ref>\n\nOn September 15, 1944, when adequate supplies had finally reached the Third Army, they moved on toward Thiacourt, France. The 135th Engineer Combat Battalion working with the 180th Engineer Heavy Ponton Battalion constructed a 260-foot Heavy Ponton bridge at Pagny, France.  Because of a shortage of Engineer troops, it was necessary to form a provisional platoon from the Group Headquarters Company to assist in the construction.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944 |page=8}}</ref>  Then working with the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, they constructed two 80 foot Bailey bridges across the Moselle River.  The bridge building units worked under constant heavy mortar and artillery fire at these crossings, but were aided by the 161st Chemical Smoke Generating Company laying down a heavy smoke screen from hundreds of smoke generators and pots.  The cost in lives was high,<ref name=\"1139Engp15\" /> but it helped pave the way towards taking the heavily defended city of [[Metz]]. Despite the pressure of the continued rapid advance of the Group, morale among the troops remained at a high level.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, September 1-30, 1944 |page=9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rapid bridge-launching vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rapid bridge-launching vehicle, designed by the 1139th Engineer Combat Group.]]\n\n[[File:730 foot Heavy Ponton Bridge built at Uckange, France, by 1139th Engineer Combat Group, Nov 17 1944.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Heavy Ponton Bridge built across the Moselle River at Uckange, France, by 1139th Engineer Combat Group, November 17, 1944]]\n\nDuring the month of October 1944, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group grew to one of the largest tactical engineer groups in the United States Army.  Over 5000 troops were under their command, including the 5th, 83rd, 90th, and 95th Infantry Divisions, the 179th and 206th Engineer Combat Battalions, the 991st Engineer Treadway Company, the 509th Engineer Light Ponton Company, and the 623rd Engineer Light Equipment Company.  This concentration of men and equipment was in preparation of supporting the crossing of the Moselle River by the 10th Armored Division and the 90th and 95th Infantry Divisions.  In preparation for this, the troops were instructed in crossing techniques using [[Assault boat|Assault Boats]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Infantry Assault Boat Training Program |date=October 31, 1944 |publisher=Unclassified / Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20136}}</ref> and the Group experimented with building a rapid bridge-launching-device constructed on a tank frame.

These crossings were unusually difficult because the Moselle River was in a state of 30-year flood, and the enemy was continually making the bridging difficult with heavy artillery, machine gun and small arms fire.  The enemy fire at Cattenom, France, was so intense that the 440 foot Floating Bailey Bridge was eventually lost.  In most of these crossings the engineers had to first resort to ferrying operations in order for the infantry to clear a beachhead on the eastern shore so that the bridges could be constructed.

Following these operations the storm boats continued to evacuate wounded and to deliver supplies.  Although all operations of the river were carried out under continuous heavy artillery and small arms fire day and night, there was no letup in the steady flow of materials and supplies by the storm boats.

This was of importance since a floating bridge was not able to be constructed, since sections were shot away as rapidly as they were placed into the water.  The Saar across from Dillingen, Germany, continued to prove difficult to cross because of heavy fire<ref>{{cite book |title=1139th Engineers |page=39}}</ref> from a large number of occupied German [[Pillbox (military)|pill boxes]] on the eastern side of the river where the [[Siegfried Line]] had been most heavily constructed.

When General Patton learned of the attack, he quickly repositioned six full divisions of his army from their locations along the Saar River to launch a counterattack north to relieve the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at Bastogne.  To replace the repositioned defensive divisions along the Saar River, the 90th Infantry Division withdrew from their eastern beachhead at Dillengen to join the 95th Infantry Division in defending the western side of the River.  The 1139th Engineer Combat Group supported both divisions in constructing defensive barriers consisting of mine fields, roadblocks, and bridges prepared for demolition, as well as guarding many of these deterrents.<ref>{{cite book |title=Headquarters Unit History, December 1 - 31, 1944 |page=3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Treadway M2 Bridge built by 1139th across the Saar River at Schoden, Germany March 2, 1945]]\n\nDuring January 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group continued to support defensive operations on the west bank of the Saar River, consisting of barrier zone and roadwork maintenance, installation of an anti-mine boom at Maim\u00fchle, Germany, roadway snow-plowing and sanding, guarding displaced German citizens at Niedaltdorf, removing mines and booby traps at Thionville, and patrolling the banks of the Moselle River.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, January 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, January 1 - 31, 1945 |date=February 8, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat from the Ardennes. During the first three weeks of February 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was engaged in miscellaneous engineer activities in support of the 94th Infantry Division and the 3rd Calvary Regiment.  Because of sudden thaws supplemented by heavy rains, the Moselle River was swollen to flood heights again.  As a result, great ice floes were swept down the river with such force that it necessitated the removal of all floating bridges.  The salvaged materials were removed and placed in the storage dumps, and as soon as possible the bridges were reconstructed to allow traffic over the Moselle again.  On February 20, 1945, the 1139th Engineer Combat Group was given the mission of assisting the 94th Infantry Division in its assault crossing of the Saar River.  Under heavy enemy fire coming from strategically located pill boxes on the east bank, three successful assault crossings were made between the 21st and 23 February at Taben, Serrig, and Ayl, Germany.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History, February 1\u201328, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group, February 1 - 28, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\nThe first bridge crossings of the Saar River under the direction of the 1139th occurred February 24 and 26, 1945.

This, in turn, allowed a 286-foot Heavy Ponton bridge and a 336-foot Treadway bridge to be built across the Sarr at Niederleuken and Schoden, Germany, so that both Infantry and Armor could cross and reduce the enemy on the eastern side of the Saar.  On March 6, 1945, an additional 336-foot Treadway M2 C1 bridge was then established at Konz Karthaus, Germany by the 179th and the 206th Engineer Combat Battalions.\n\nDuring the first part of March 1945, the 1139th Group was engaged in engineering work necessary for the rapid advancement of the XX Corps from the Saar to the Rhine Rivers.  In addition to construction of many Bailey Bridges and small fixed bridges, they were tasked with supervising civilian labor on road work, preparing gun emplacements for artillery pieces, constructing camouflage screens and anti-mine booms at bridges, removing dead animals from minefields, hauling prisoners, demolishing buildings to widen roads, painting town signs, and destroying enemy tanks and artillery pieces.<ref name='\"Headquarters Unit History March 1\u201331, 1945\"'>{{cite book |last1=Niles, CE Colonel |first1=John S. |title=Headquarters Unit History 1139th Engineer Combat Group; March 1 - 31, 1945 |date=May 26, 1945 |publisher=Unclassified/ Declassified Holdings of the National Archives |location=Washington, D.C. |page=1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonel Jackson and Colonel Niles at Rhine River Mainz, Germany, April 1945.jpg|thumb|right|300px| Colonel Jackson (CO 160th) and Colonel Niles (CO 1139th) at Rhine River, Mainz, Germany, April 1945]]\n\nIn quick secession the American Armies were converging on the enemy in the Rhine-Moselle triangle; the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] from the North, the [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th]] and [[6th Armored Division (United States)|6th]] Armored Divisions from the South, and the [[United States Army Central|3rd]] and the [[Seventh United States Army|7th]] Armies from various locations.

Study of all available maps and photos determined that the downtown area of Mainz, Germany, was the best site, even though the Rhine was wider at that point.  Profiles were prepared for the entire area, showing which terrain areas had to be captured or neutralized by artillery fire, and hydraulic data and river bed materials were studied to understand the types and sizes of anchors necessary for the bridge.

The sixth mainline entry and a soft [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the ''[[Sakura Wars]]'' series, the game was released in 2019 in Asia and is scheduled for a worldwide release in 2020. It is the first ''Sakura Wars'' game not to be developed by [[Red Entertainment]]. The gameplay combines overlapping [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] elements. The base campaign was later expanded with [[downloadable content]] (DLC), adding further gameplay options such as additional costumes.\n\nThe game takes place in a fictionalised version of the [[Taish\u014d period]] in 1940, where the World Luxuriant Opera Federation fights against those who threaten peace around the world. Naval captain Seijuro Kamiyama is transferred to [[Tokyo]], where he must lead the struggling Imperial Combat Revue through a worldwide tournament of Combat Revues and fight the demons once again.\n\nDevelopment of ''Sakura Wars'' began in 2016 after a positive fan response at that year's Sega Fes convention. A combination of new and returning staff were involved in development; these include veteran Sega producer Tetsu Katano, director Tetsuya Otsubo, scenario director Takaharu Terada, ''Sakura Wars'' composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]], story writer [[Jiro Ishii]] and scenario writer Takaaki Suzuki. Manga artist [[Tite Kubo]] designed the main cast, while guest artists handled the supporting cast. The cinematics were produced by [[Sanzigen]]. The game was announced at Sega Fes 2018. It is the first mainline entry in the series since ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'' (2005). A [[manga]] adaptation is running in ''Young Jump''. An [[anime]] television series sequel by [[Sanzigen]] premiered on April 3, 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:New Sakura Wars pre-release screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|Pre-release screenshot of LIPS gameplay with lead heroine Sakura Amamiya]]\n''Sakura Wars'' is a [[cross-genre]] video game set in Tokyo during a fictionalized version of the [[Taish\u014d]] period. The player controls the main protagonist Seijuro Kamiyama and the all-female members of the Imperial Combat Revue's Flower Division, who must fight demons while participating in the Combat Revue World Games. Dubbed a \"dramatic 3D action adventure\" game, the player explores a fully 3-D version of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]] usually through a third-person perspective on foot and talks to various characters to trigger main story events and side objectives.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\" /><ref name=\"SilInfo\" /><ref name=\"GemComments\" /> As in ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'', the world of ''Sakura Wars'' is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature maps, as found in the earlier ''Sakura Wars'' games, every area is represented proportionally. A variant of the Kinematron, called the Teletron, is a [[smartphone]] that allows Kamiyama to see a map of Ginza and speak with other characters.<ref name=\"GemComments\" />\n\nAs with previous entries, the gameplay is split between adventure segments where Kamiyama explores Ginza and talks to the characters; and battle segments.<ref name=\"SilInfo\"/> A returning gameplay element is the traditional \"Live & Interactive Picture System\" (LIPS); during conversations, the player is presented with multiple choices to select within a time limit. What response the player selects directly affects Kamiyama's relationship with the protagonists and impacts their later performance in battle segments; Kamiyama's responses also affect supporting [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs). The version introduced in this game is \"Analog LIPS\", in which the player can move the camera around and highlight objects or people to trigger more dialogue.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"GemComments\"/><ref name=\"TwinfiniteGameplay\"/> In Communication Mode, the player can move the cursor over background elements or the characters to trigger internal monologues and varying responses from the characters.<ref name=\"JPManual17\"/> Players may save their game during [[eyecatch]]es, which also includes the statuses of the main heroines as well as supporting NPCs.<ref name=\"JPManual20\"/>\n\n''Sakura Wars'' is the first entry in the main ''Sakura Wars'' series to use an action-based battle system.<ref name=\"GameInformerBattleSystem\"/> Instead of using a menu interface, the player selects commands directly mapped to the buttons on the controller. The Combat Revue World Games can be played for up to a maximum of three rounds. The player can select up to two characters to assist Kamiyama in the matches.<ref name=\"FamCombatRevueWarGames\"/> During battle, each character has [[health points]] (HP) and [[magic points]] (MP). HP is depleted whenever a character is attacked. The game ends when all of the characters' HP levels reach zero, although the player can continue from the beginning of the battle or the last checkpoint.<ref name=\"JPManual26\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 1930, two years after the events of ''So Long, My Love'', the Great Demon War results in the annihilation of the Imperial and Paris Combat Revue's Flower Divisions and the New York Combat Revue's Star Division. With Earth at peace and the revues' actions becoming public, the World Luxuriant Opera Federation is formed with several international divisions; a biennial Combat Revue World Games tournament has been organized.<ref name=\"FamProjectSakura\"/>\n\nTen years later in 1940,<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraProduction\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/> the Combat Revue's commander Sumire Kanzaki ([[Michie Tomizawa]]) recruits [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ensign Seijuro Kamiyama (Yohei Azakami) to become the captain of the new Imperial Combat Revue's Flower Division in [[Tokyo]], which consists of: Sakura Amamiya ([[Ayane Sakura]]), a swordswoman; Hatsuho Shinonome ([[Maaya Uchida]]), a shrine maiden; Anastasia Palma ([[Ayaka Fukuhara]]), a newly-transferred Greek actress; Azami Mochizuki ([[Hibiku Yamamura]]), a ninja prodigy from the Mochizuki clan; and Clarissa \"Claris\" Snowflake ([[Saori Hayami]]), a Luxembourger noblewoman. The division once again faces a new demon invasion and participates in the upcoming tournament with Xiaolong Yang ([[Yuichiro Umehara]]) and Yui Huang ([[Sumire Uesaka]]) of the Shanghai Combat Revue, Arthur ([[Nobunaga Shimazaki]]) and Lancelot ([[Manami Numakura]]) of the London Combat Revue, and Elise ([[Nana Mizuki]]) and Margarete ([[Rie Kugimiya]]) of the Berlin Combat Revue\u2013while trying to keep their home at the Imperial Theater open.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SilInfo\"/>\n\n==Development==\nThe ''Sakura Wars'' series had been mostly inactive since the last mainline release, ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'', in 2005 (2010 internationally).<ref name=\"GemComments\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakura1\"/> Franchise owner [[Sega]] had decided to end the series in 2008, following the release of the spin-off title ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars'' and a final concert performance by the cast of ''So Long, My Love''.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> Scenario director Takaharu Terada would make yearly pitches to Sega, but these were repeatedly declined. At the 2016 Sega Fes in Tokyo, in response to a fan poll about dormant series, ''Sakura Wars'' was voted the most requested revival. While actual development had begun shortly before Sega Fes, the positive fan feedback gave the developers the boost they needed to begin full production.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> The staff included producer Tetsu Katano of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series fame and director Tetsuya Ootsubo. Katano was a newcomer to the series, but Ootsubo had previously worked with the series on ''[[Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?]]''.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> Because much time had passed between ''So Long, My Love'' and the production of this new game, and both the platform and most of the team were different, it was decided that ''Sakura Wars'' would be a soft reboot.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/><ref name=\"FamInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was developed by a team within Sega's CS Research & Development No. 2 division.<ref name=\"DengekiPlaystationInterview\"/><ref name=\"TwitterClafiry\"/> The basic gameplay was carried over, but extensively reworked and the world built entirely in 3D due to the greater hardware specs of the [[PlayStation 4]].<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakura4GamerInterview\"/> The game's engine was based on Hedgehog Engine 2, a proprietary first-party engine created by Sega for the ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' series. The cutscenes were crafted using techniques perfected for Sega's ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' series. Alongside the 3D conversion, the team worked to make transitions between different areas and between gameplay and cutscenes as seamless as possible. During production, internal staff who were fans of classic ''Sakura Wars'' would often be critical of the current team's work, putting pressure on them to create a product worthy of the series.<ref name=\"FamEngine\"/> The game features over 40 minutes of CGI cinematics produced by [[Sanzigen]]. All other cutscenes were created in real-time using the game's engine.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/>\n\nWhile there were a new cast and development team, the series romanticized [[steampunk]] setting remained intact. The narrative was described as a \"''Sakura Wars''-esque fantasy\".<ref name=\"GemComments\"/> Terada created the basic setting and scenario concept, the scenario draft was written by [[Jiro Ishii]], while the main script was handled by Takaaki Suzuki.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"GemComments\"/> Ishii was contacted in 2016 by Sega. Ishii was initially sceptical about his skill to manage the project due to the ''Sakura Wars'' franchise's prestige. He accepted as the one who approached him was ''[[428: Shibuya Scramble]]'' producer [[Koichi Nakamura]]; Ishii recognized that the challenge of ''Sakura Wars'' was equivalent to the relationship between ''428: Shibuya Scramble'' and its predecessor ''[[Machi (video game)|Machi]]''.<ref name=\"SilInfo\"/> During his work on the scenario, Suzuki offered suggestions to keep the game as historically accurate as possible.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/>\n\n===Character design===\nThe main characters and their weapons were designed by [[Tite Kubo]], a manga artist best known for the shonen manga ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]''.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/> Kubo had been suggested at an early stage, as the team wanted someone skilled at drawing traditional Japanese clothing for their characters. This wish traced back to the recurring protagonist archetype of a young Japanese woman in a kimono, first with Sakura Shinguji and then new female lead Sakura Amamiya. Kubo was contacted when full production began, and ended up not only designing the characters and weapons but made suggestions for the Koubu designs.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> Kubo described the character designs as difficult and fun as they did not follow his usual style.<ref name=\"SilInfo\"/> The characters were turned into 3D gameplay models by animator Masashi Kudou, who worked on the ''Bleach'' anime adaptation. Kubo vouched for Kudou originally, believing only he could carry over the character designs. The Koubu designs were by regular series mecha designer Mika Akitaka.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/> Other guest artists designed the supporting cast, with different anime artists for different Combat Revue teams and supporting characters.<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistA\"/><ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistC\"/> The artists included [[Yukiko Horiguchi]] (''[[K-On!]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistA\"/> BUNBUN (''[[Sword Art Online]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistB\"/> [[Ken Sugimori]] (''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistB\"/> [[Fumikane Shimada]] (''[[Girls und Panzer]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistC\"/> [[Noizi Ito]] (''[[Haruhi Suzumiya]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistD\"/> and [[Shigenori Soejima]] (''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'').<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistE\"/>\n\nWhile previous titles had used near-silent protagonists, as the 3D model would have more presence in player minds, it was decided that he should voice all his lines. Kamiyama's role was hard for Azakami, as due to the different LIPS responses he had five times more dialogue than any of the heroines. Sakura's role mirrored earlier principle heroines such as Sakura Shinguji and Gemini Sunrise, but with personality difference that would show her individuality despite emulating Shinguji's clothing and manners. Some characters, such as Sakura and Hatsuho, hearkened back to earlier ''Sakura Wars'' heroines while having altered personalities. Azami's loud clothing tied into both her personality and role in the narrative. Anastasia was intended to represent a mature and \"sexy\" archetype. Claris was included at Terada's insistence to fill the recurring \"gentlewoman\" archetype.<ref name=\"FamEngine\"/>\n\nTwo notable returning actors were [[Chisa Yokoyama]] who voiced the character Yasha, and [[Michie Tomizawa]] voicing returning character Sumire. Due to changes in their portrayal, recording for the two characters lasted longer than the other staff members.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraVoiceInterviewA\"/> Yokoyama was contacted during early 2018 by Sega about taking part in the game, and was surprised at being asked to voice a new character. She originally refused as she felt the new Yasha could be played by another actress, as while physically identical to her character Sakura Shinguji she had a very different personality. Yokoyama eventually accpeted, and worked with Sega to make the character more like the original Sakura.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraVoiceInterviewB\"/> Sumire's role was originally written as being similar to Ayame Fujieda, a severe leader character from the first game, but as voice recording took place the characterization shifted.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraVoiceInterviewA\"/> Tomizawa was initially anxious about reprising her role after reading the story outline, feeling almost like a traitor at being the only original member reprising a role, but was cheered up by Yokoyama's support. Due to input from Tomizawa, Sumire became a more mature version of her original self rather than a radically different character.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraVoiceInterviewB\"/>\n\n===Music===\nRegular series composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]] wrote the music. Because of his long association, Tanaka was happy to return and write for a new ''Sakura Wars'' game.<ref name=\"SilInfo\"/> When conceiving the project, the team decided firmly that the music was something that should not be changed, as it had helped maintain the series' popularity through stage shows and concerts in Japan during its dormancy.<ref name=\"FamEngine\"/> The developers aimed to have the largest number of vocal themes of any ''Sakura Wars'' game, ranging between 70 and 80. These included ensemble pieces and solo songs.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/> The main theme was a reworked version of the series' recurring theme \"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan\", titled {{nihongo foot|\"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan <Shinsh\u014d>\"|\u6a84! \u5e1d\u56fd\u83ef\u6483\u56e3 <\u65b0\u7ae0>|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} and performed by Ayane Sakura, Maaya Uchida, Hibiku Yamamura, Ayaka Fukuhara and Saori Hayami. The theme was composed by Tanaka and arranged by Takayuki Negishi, with lyrics by series creator [[Oji Hiroi]].<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/> The ending song, {{nihongo foot|\"Aratanaru\"|\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}}, was also composed by Tanaka, arranged by Negishi, written by Jiro Ishii and performed by Sakura, Uchida, Yamamura, Fukuhara, Hayami, Sumire Uesaka, Nana Mizuki and Manami Numakura.<ref name=\"SakuraWarsVocal\"/>\n\nA vocal collection album, containing 14 tracks, is scheduled to be released by Wave Master in Japan on April 29, 2020.<ref name=\"SakuraWarsVocal\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWarsVocalTwitter\"/>\n\n==Release==\nA new ''Sakura Wars'' title was first announced in April 2018 under the title ''New Sakura Wars''. The announcement stated that the game would \"inherit the DNA\" of the series.<ref name=\"ShinSakura1\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakura2\"/> Its first public appearance was at Sega Fes 2019 in March of that year, to a positive fan response.<ref name=\"DengekiPlaystationInterview\"/> The announcement of a Western release coincided with this, making ''Sakura Wars'' only the second ''Sakura Wars'' game to be localized at that time.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/> Development at the time was placed at between 50% and 60% complete; all the scenario and basic systems were completed and voice recording was nearly finished, with the next phase being bringing together the various elements and polishing them for release.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/> Speaking in a later statement, Sega said that they hoped to continue the series beyond ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraNewMedia\"/>\n\nA demo of ''Sakura Wars'' was released on November 21, 2019.<ref name=\"Demo\"/> The English localization was handled by Inbound Games and the French, German and Spanish localizations were handled by Keywords Studio; this was the first time a ''Sakura Wars'' title was localized in these languages.<ref name=\"Sakura2020Local\"/><ref name=\"WWRelease\"/> The game was released in Asia on December 12, 2019 and is scheduled to be released worldwide on April 28, 2020.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"WWRelease\"/> Additional fixes to the game were made through a [[patch (computing)|patch]] released on March 18, 2020 in Japan and concurrently with the worldwide release; it also included a tie-in to ''Sakura Wars the Animation''.<ref name=\"GematsuVersion101Japan\"/><ref name=\"GematsuVersion101West\"/> The Japanese release of the game was published in standard and deluxe editions. The deluxe edition included a five-disc CD collection containing songs from the main six ''Sakura Wars'' games as well as an artbook.<ref name=\"SWRelease\"/>\n\nFamitsu released a companion book: the ''Sakura Wars Complete Guide'' on February 21, 2020. It provides profiles of the characters and areas in Ginza, the complete story of ''Sakura Wars'', details on the adventure and battle scenarios, and details on each location.<ref name=\"FamitsuSakura2019StrategyGuide\"/> Kadokawa Game Linkage released the ''Sakura Wars Story Setting Collections'' on March 30, 2020. It included interviews with the developers, detailed character profiles, storyboards and a collection of artworks and illustrations.<ref name=\"FamitsuSakura2019Setting\"/>\n\nCosmetic and audio-based [[downloadable content]] (DLC) were released from December 2019 to January 2020 in Japan.<ref name=\"GematsuDLC\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = \n| Fam = 33/40<ref name=\"FamScores\"/>\n| JXV = 13/20<ref name=\"JXVReview\"/>\n}}\n\n===Sales===\nIn Japan, ''Sakura Wars'' was ranked second place during its first-week sales behind [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']], selling over 140,376 units.

The sixth mainline entry and a soft [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the ''[[Sakura Wars]]'' series, the game was released in 2019 in Asia and is scheduled for a worldwide release in 2020. It is the first ''Sakura Wars'' game not to be developed by [[Red Entertainment]]. The gameplay combines overlapping [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]], [[dating sim]] and [[visual novel]] elements. The base campaign was later expanded with [[downloadable content]] (DLC), adding further gameplay options such as additional costumes.\n\nThe game takes place in a fictionalised version of the [[Taish\u014d period]] in 1940, where the World Luxuriant Opera Federation fights against those who threaten peace around the world. Naval captain Seijuro Kamiyama is transferred to [[Tokyo]], where he must lead the struggling Imperial Combat Revue through a worldwide tournament of Combat Revues and fight the demons once again.\n\nDevelopment of ''Sakura Wars'' began in 2016 after a positive fan response at that year's Sega Fes convention. A combination of new and returning staff were involved in development; these include veteran Sega producer Tetsu Katano, director Tetsuya Otsubo, scenario director Takaharu Terada, ''Sakura Wars'' composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]], story writer [[Jiro Ishii]] and scenario writer Takaaki Suzuki. Manga artist [[Tite Kubo]] designed the main cast, while guest artists handled the supporting cast. The cinematics were produced by [[Sanzigen]]. The game was announced at Sega Fes 2018. It is the first mainline entry in the series since ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'' (2005). A [[manga]] adaptation is running in ''Young Jump''. An [[anime]] television series sequel by [[Sanzigen]] premiered on April 3, 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:New Sakura Wars pre-release screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|Pre-release screenshot of LIPS gameplay with lead heroine Sakura Amamiya]]\n''Sakura Wars'' is a [[cross-genre]] video game set in Tokyo during a fictionalized version of the [[Taish\u014d]] period. The player controls the main protagonist Seijuro Kamiyama and the all-female members of the Imperial Combat Revue's Flower Division, who must fight demons while participating in the Combat Revue World Games. Dubbed a \"dramatic 3D action adventure\" game, the player explores a fully 3-D version of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]] usually through a third-person perspective on foot and talks to various characters to trigger main story events and side objectives.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\" /><ref name=\"SilInfo\" /><ref name=\"GemComments\" /> As in ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'', the world of ''Sakura Wars'' is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature maps, as found in the earlier ''Sakura Wars'' games, every area is represented proportionally. A variant of the Kinematron, called the Teletron, is a [[smartphone]] that allows Kamiyama to see a map of Ginza and speak with other characters.<ref name=\"GemComments\" />\n\nAs with previous entries, the gameplay is split between adventure segments where Kamiyama explores Ginza and talks to the characters; and battle segments.<ref name=\"SilInfo\"/> A returning gameplay element is the traditional \"Live & Interactive Picture System\" (LIPS); during conversations, the player is presented with multiple choices to select within a time limit. What response the player selects directly affects Kamiyama's relationship with the protagonists and impacts their later performance in battle segments; Kamiyama's responses also affect supporting [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs). The version introduced in this game is \"Analog LIPS\", in which the player can move the camera around and highlight objects or people to trigger more dialogue.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"GemComments\"/><ref name=\"TwinfiniteGameplay\"/> In Communication Mode, the player can move the cursor over background elements or the characters to trigger internal monologues and varying responses from the characters.<ref name=\"JPManual17\"/> Players may save their game during [[eyecatch]]es, which also includes the statuses of the main heroines as well as supporting NPCs.<ref name=\"JPManual20\"/>\n\n''Sakura Wars'' is the first entry in the main ''Sakura Wars'' series to use an action-based battle system.<ref name=\"GameInformerBattleSystem\"/> Instead of using a menu interface, the player selects commands directly mapped to the buttons on the controller. The Combat Revue World Games can be played for up to a maximum of three rounds. The player can select up to two characters to assist Kamiyama in the matches.<ref name=\"FamCombatRevueWarGames\"/> During battle, each character has [[health points]] (HP) and [[magic points]] (MP). HP is depleted whenever a character is attacked. The game ends when all of the characters' HP levels reach zero, although the player can continue from the beginning of the battle or the last checkpoint.<ref name=\"JPManual26\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 1930, two years after the events of ''So Long, My Love'', the Great Demon War results in the annihilation of the Imperial and Paris Combat Revue's Flower Divisions and the New York Combat Revue's Star Division. With Earth at peace and the revues' actions becoming public, the World Luxuriant Opera Federation is formed with several international divisions; a biennial Combat Revue World Games tournament has been organized.<ref name=\"FamProjectSakura\"/>\n\nTen years later in 1940,<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraProduction\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/> the Combat Revue's commander Sumire Kanzaki ([[Michie Tomizawa]]) recruits [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] ensign Seijuro Kamiyama (Yohei Azakami) to become the captain of the new Imperial Combat Revue's Flower Division in [[Tokyo]], which consists of: Sakura Amamiya ([[Ayane Sakura]]), a swordswoman; Hatsuho Shinonome ([[Maaya Uchida]]), a shrine maiden; Anastasia Palma ([[Ayaka Fukuhara]]), a newly-transferred Greek actress; Azami Mochizuki ([[Hibiku Yamamura]]), a ninja prodigy from the Mochizuki clan; and Clarissa \"Claris\" Snowflake ([[Saori Hayami]]), a Luxembourger noblewoman. The division once again faces a new demon invasion and participates in the upcoming tournament with Xiaolong Yang ([[Yuichiro Umehara]]) and Yui Huang ([[Sumire Uesaka]]) of the Shanghai Combat Revue, Arthur ([[Nobunaga Shimazaki]]) and Lancelot ([[Manami Numakura]]) of the London Combat Revue, and Elise ([[Nana Mizuki]]) and Margarete ([[Rie Kugimiya]]) of the Berlin Combat Revue\u2013while trying to keep their home at the Imperial Theater open.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"SilInfo\"/>\n\n==Development==\nThe ''Sakura Wars'' series had been mostly inactive since the last mainline release, ''[[Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love]]'', in 2005 (2010 internationally).<ref name=\"GemComments\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakura1\"/> Franchise owner [[Sega]] had decided to end the series in 2008, following the release of the spin-off title ''Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars'' and a final concert performance by the cast of ''So Long, My Love''.<ref name=\"SakuraOverview\"/><ref name=\"TanakaBlog\"/> Scenario director Takaharu Terada would make yearly pitches to Sega, but these were repeatedly declined. At the 2016 Sega Fes in Tokyo, in response to a fan poll about dormant series, ''Sakura Wars'' was voted the most requested revival. While actual development had begun shortly before Sega Fes, the positive fan feedback gave the developers the boost they needed to begin full production.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> The staff included producer Tetsu Katano of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series fame and director Tetsuya Ootsubo. Katano was a newcomer to the series, but Ootsubo had previously worked with the series on ''[[Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?]]''.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> Because much time had passed between ''So Long, My Love'' and the production of this new game, and both the platform and most of the team were different, it was decided that ''Sakura Wars'' would be a soft reboot.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/><ref name=\"FamInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was developed by a team within Sega's CS Research & Development No. 2 division.<ref name=\"DengekiPlaystationInterview\"/><ref name=\"TwitterClafiry\"/> The basic gameplay was carried over, but extensively reworked and the world built entirely in 3D due to the greater hardware specs of the [[PlayStation 4]].<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakura4GamerInterview\"/> The game's engine was based on Hedgehog Engine 2, a proprietary first-party engine created by Sega for the ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' series. The cutscenes were crafted using techniques perfected for Sega's ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'' series. Alongside the 3D conversion, the team worked to make transitions between different areas and between gameplay and cutscenes as seamless as possible. During production, internal staff who were fans of classic ''Sakura Wars'' would often be critical of the current team's work, putting pressure on them to create a product worthy of the series.<ref name=\"FamEngine\"/> The game features over 40 minutes of CGI cinematics produced by [[Sanzigen]]. All other cutscenes were created in real-time using the game's engine.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/>\n\nWhile there were a new cast and development team, the series romanticized [[steampunk]] setting remained intact. The narrative was described as a \"''Sakura Wars''-esque fantasy\".<ref name=\"GemComments\"/> Terada created the basic setting and scenario concept, the scenario draft was written by [[Jiro Ishii]], while the main script was handled by Takaaki Suzuki.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"GemComments\"/> Ishii was contacted in 2016 by Sega. Ishii was initially sceptical about his skill to manage the project due to the ''Sakura Wars'' franchise's prestige. He accepted as the one who approached him was ''[[428: Shibuya Scramble]]'' producer [[Koichi Nakamura]]; Ishii recognized that the challenge of ''Sakura Wars'' was equivalent to the relationship between ''428: Shibuya Scramble'' and its predecessor ''[[Machi (video game)|Machi]]''.<ref name=\"SilInfo\"/> During his work on the scenario, Suzuki offered suggestions to keep the game as historically accurate as possible.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/>\n\n===Character design===\nThe main characters and their weapons were designed by [[Tite Kubo]], a manga artist best known for the shonen manga ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]''.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/> Kubo had been suggested at an early stage, as the team wanted someone skilled at drawing traditional Japanese clothing for their characters. This wish traced back to the recurring protagonist archetype of a young Japanese woman in a kimono, first with Sakura Shinguji and then new female lead Sakura Amamiya. Kubo was contacted when full production began, and ended up not only designing the characters and weapons but made suggestions for the Koubu designs.<ref name=\"FamInterview\"/> Kubo described the character designs as difficult and fun as they did not follow his usual style.<ref name=\"SilInfo\"/> The characters were turned into 3D gameplay models by animator Masashi Kudou, who worked on the ''Bleach'' anime adaptation. Kubo vouched for Kudou originally, believing only he could carry over the character designs. The Koubu designs were by regular series mecha designer Mika Akitaka.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/> Other guest artists designed the supporting cast, with different anime artists for different Combat Revue teams and supporting characters.<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistA\"/><ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistC\"/> The artists included [[Yukiko Horiguchi]] (''[[K-On!]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistA\"/> BUNBUN (''[[Sword Art Online]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistB\"/> [[Ken Sugimori]] (''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistB\"/> [[Fumikane Shimada]] (''[[Girls und Panzer]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistC\"/> [[Noizi Ito]] (''[[Haruhi Suzumiya]]''),<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistD\"/> and [[Shigenori Soejima]] (''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'').<ref name=\"ProjectSakuraArtistE\"/>\n\nWhile previous titles had used near-silent protagonists, as the 3D model would have more presence in player minds, it was decided that he should voice all his lines. Kamiyama's role was hard for Azakami, as due to the different LIPS responses he had five times more dialogue than any of the heroines. Sakura's role mirrored earlier principle heroines such as Sakura Shinguji and Gemini Sunrise, but with personality difference that would show her individuality despite emulating Shinguji's clothing and manners. Some characters, such as Sakura and Hatsuho, hearkened back to earlier ''Sakura Wars'' heroines while having altered personalities. Azami's loud clothing tied into both her personality and role in the narrative. Anastasia was intended to represent a mature and \"sexy\" archetype. Claris was included at Terada's insistence to fill the recurring \"gentlewoman\" archetype.<ref name=\"FamEngine\"/>\n\nTwo notable returning actors were [[Chisa Yokoyama]] who voiced the character Yasha, and [[Michie Tomizawa]] voicing returning character Sumire. Due to changes in their portrayal, recording for the two characters lasted longer than the other staff members.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraVoiceInterviewA\"/> Yokoyama was contacted during early 2018 by Sega about taking part in the game, and was surprised at being asked to voice a new character. She originally refused as she felt the new Yasha could be played by another actress, as while physically identical to her character Sakura Shinguji she had a very different personality. Yokoyama eventually accpeted, and worked with Sega to make the character more like the original Sakura.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraVoiceInterviewB\"/> Sumire's role was originally written as being similar to Ayame Fujieda, a severe leader character from the first game, but as voice recording took place the characterization shifted.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraVoiceInterviewA\"/> Tomizawa was initially anxious about reprising her role after reading the story outline, feeling almost like a traitor at being the only original member reprising a role, but was cheered up by Yokoyama's support. Due to input from Tomizawa, Sumire became a more mature version of her original self rather than a radically different character.<ref name=\"ShinSakuraVoiceInterviewB\"/>\n\n===Music===\nRegular series composer [[Kohei Tanaka (composer)|Kohei Tanaka]] wrote the music. Because of his long association, Tanaka was happy to return and write for a new ''Sakura Wars'' game.<ref name=\"SilInfo\"/> When conceiving the project, the team decided firmly that the music was something that should not be changed, as it had helped maintain the series' popularity through stage shows and concerts in Japan during its dormancy.<ref name=\"FamEngine\"/> The developers aimed to have the largest number of vocal themes of any ''Sakura Wars'' game, ranging between 70 and 80. These included ensemble pieces and solo songs.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/> The main theme was a reworked version of the series' recurring theme \"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan\", titled {{nihongo foot|\"Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan <Shinsh\u014d>\"|\u6a84! \u5e1d\u56fd\u83ef\u6483\u56e3 <\u65b0\u7ae0>|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}} and performed by Ayane Sakura, Maaya Uchida, Hibiku Yamamura, Ayaka Fukuhara and Saori Hayami. The theme was composed by Tanaka and arranged by Takayuki Negishi, with lyrics by series creator [[Oji Hiroi]].<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/> The ending song, {{nihongo foot|\"Aratanaru\"|\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b|group=lower-alpha|lead=yes}}, was also composed by Tanaka, arranged by Negishi, written by Jiro Ishii and performed by Sakura, Uchida, Yamamura, Fukuhara, Hayami, Sumire Uesaka, Nana Mizuki and Manami Numakura.<ref name=\"SakuraWarsVocal\"/>\n\nA vocal collection album, containing 14 tracks, is scheduled to be released by Wave Master in Japan on April 29, 2020.<ref name=\"SakuraWarsVocal\"/><ref name=\"SakuraWarsVocalTwitter\"/>\n\n==Release==\nA new ''Sakura Wars'' title was first announced in April 2018 under the title ''New Sakura Wars''. The announcement stated that the game would \"inherit the DNA\" of the series.<ref name=\"ShinSakura1\"/><ref name=\"ShinSakura2\"/> Its first public appearance was at Sega Fes 2019 in March of that year, to a positive fan response.<ref name=\"DengekiPlaystationInterview\"/> The announcement of a Western release coincided with this, making ''Sakura Wars'' only the second ''Sakura Wars'' game to be localized at that time.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"RPGprojectSakura\"/> Development at the time was placed at between 50% and 60% complete; all the scenario and basic systems were completed and voice recording was nearly finished, with the next phase being bringing together the various elements and polishing them for release.<ref name=\"GemComments\"/> Speaking in a later statement, Sega said that they hoped to continue the series beyond ''Sakura Wars''.<ref name=\"SakuraNewMedia\"/>\n\nA demo of ''Sakura Wars'' was released on November 21, 2019.<ref name=\"Demo\"/> The English localization was handled by Inbound Games and the French, German and Spanish localizations were handled by Keywords Studio; this was the first time a ''Sakura Wars'' title was localized in these languages.<ref name=\"Sakura2020Local\"/><ref name=\"WWRelease\"/> The game was released in Asia on December 12, 2019 and is scheduled to be released worldwide on April 28, 2020.<ref name=\"ProjectSakura\"/><ref name=\"WWRelease\"/> Additional fixes to the game were made through a [[patch (computing)|patch]] released on March 18, 2020 in Japan and concurrently with the worldwide release; it also included a tie-in to ''Sakura Wars the Animation''.<ref name=\"GematsuVersion101Japan\"/><ref name=\"GematsuVersion101West\"/> The Japanese release of the game was published in standard and deluxe editions. The deluxe edition included a five-disc CD collection containing songs from the main six ''Sakura Wars'' games as well as an artbook.<ref name=\"SWRelease\"/>\n\nFamitsu released a companion book: the ''Sakura Wars Complete Guide'' on February 21, 2020. It provides profiles of the characters and areas in Ginza, the complete story of ''Sakura Wars'', details on the adventure and battle scenarios, and details on each location.<ref name=\"FamitsuSakura2019StrategyGuide\"/> Kadokawa Game Linkage released the ''Sakura Wars Story Setting Collections'' on March 30, 2020. It included interviews with the developers, detailed character profiles, storyboards and a collection of artworks and illustrations.<ref name=\"FamitsuSakura2019Setting\"/>\n\nCosmetic and audio-based [[downloadable content]] (DLC) were released from December 2019 to January 2020 in Japan.<ref name=\"GematsuDLC\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = \n| Fam = 33/40<ref name=\"FamScores\"/>\n| JXV = 13/20<ref name=\"JXVReview\"/>\n}}\n\n===Sales===\nIn Japan, ''Sakura Wars'' was ranked second place during its first-week sales behind [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword'' and ''Shield'']], selling over 140,376 units.
