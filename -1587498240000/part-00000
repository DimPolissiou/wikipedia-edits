At fifteen, she won a shooting contest against experienced marksman [[Frank E. Butler]], whom she later married. The two of them joined Buffalo Bill in 1885, performing in Europe before royalty and other heads of state. Audiences were astounded to see her shooting-out a cigar from her husband\u2019s lips or splitting a playing-card edge-on at 30 paces, and she earned more than anyone except Buffalo Bill himself.\n\nAfter a bad rail accident in 1901, she had to settle for a less-taxing routine, and toured in a play written about her career, as well as instructing women in marksmanship, believing strongly in female self-defence. Her stage acts were filmed for one of Edison\u2019s earliest Kinetoscopes in 1894. Since her death, her story has been adapted for stage musicals and films, including ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nAnnie Oakley was born Phoebe Ann (Annie) Mosey<ref name=enddebate/><ref name=saysEdwards>{{cite web |url=http://www.annieoakleyfoundation.org/bio.html|title=Annie Oakley's Life and Career|last=Edwards|first=Bess |publisher=annieoakleyfoundation.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314232045/http://www.annieoakleyfoundation.org/bio.html|archive-date=March 14, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Mosesmyth/> on August 13, 1860, in a log cabin less than {{convert|2|mi|spell=in}} northwest of Woodland, now [[Willowdell, Ohio|Willowdell]], in [[Darke County, Ohio]], a rural county along the state's border with Indiana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ormiston.com/annieoakley/tales.html#YOUNG|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015053658/http://www.ormiston.com/annieoakley/tales.html#YOUNG|archivedate=October 15, 2002|title=Tall Tales and the Truth|at=Was Annie really born in 1866?|publisher=Annie Oakley Foundation}}</ref> Her birthplace is about five miles east of [[North Star, Ohio|North Star]].

In one shot, she snuffed out the flame with a whizzing bullet.

Newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] published a false story that Oakley had been arrested for stealing to support a cocaine habit. The woman actually arrested was a [[American burlesque|burlesque]] performer who told Chicago police that her name was Annie Oakley.\n\nMost of the newspapers that printed the story had relied on the Hearst article, and they immediately retracted it with apologies upon learning of the libelous error. Hearst, however, tried to avoid paying the anticipated court judgments of $20,000 ({{Inflation|US|20000|1904|r=-4|fmt=eq}}) by sending an investigator to Darke County, Ohio with the intent of collecting reputation-smearing gossip from Oakley's past.

At fifteen, she won a shooting contest against experienced marksman [[Frank E. Butler]], whom she later married. The two of them joined Buffalo Bill in 1885, performing in Europe before royalty and other heads of state. Audiences were astounded to see her shooting-out a cigar from her husband\u2019s lips or splitting a playing-card edge-on at 30 paces, and she earned more than anyone except Buffalo Bill himself.\n\nAfter a bad rail accident in 1901, she had to settle for a less-taxing routine, and toured in a play written about her career, as well as instructing women in marksmanship, believing strongly in female self-defence. Her stage acts were filmed for one of Edison\u2019s earliest Kinetoscopes in 1894.
