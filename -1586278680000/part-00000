The genre was characterised by alluding to words in languages other than Hebrew (''lo\u2018ez'') in order to provide clues to the solution. For example, one riddle includes the Hebrew phrase ''Eh ko nistarti'' ('I am hidden somewhere here'). The first two of these words sound the same as the Italian/Spanish word ''eco'' ('echo'), and 'echo' (Hebrew ''hed'') is indeed the solution to the poem. Each riddle would include an '[[emblem]]' (''tsurah'') near the opening in the form of an allusive picture, poem, or phrase, or a combination of these, after which the riddle proper would commence. Poems in this genre were [[occasional poems|occasional]], composed in celebration of specific high-society events such as weddings and circumcisions. The topic of the riddle would often reflect the occasion and audience (with solutions such as 'wisdom' for a gathering of scholars, or 'love' at a wedding), and the riddle might make use of information about the people at the gathering in ways which would make little sense to a wider audience.<ref>Arthur Lesley, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20689297 The Riddles of Dan Pagis]', ''Prooftexts'', 11.1 (January 1991), 76-80.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the [[Haggadah]], there is also the [[Echad Mi Yodea]], characterised by [[Joseph Jacobs]] as 'a curious riddle'.<ref name=\"Joseph Jacobs 1907\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n* Yehuda Ratzaby, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23415145 Halakhic Poetic Riddles of R.

The genre was characterised by alluding to words in languages other than Hebrew (''lo\u2018ez'') in order to provide clues to the solution. For example, one riddle includes the Hebrew phrase ''Eh ko nistarti'' ('I am hidden somewhere here'). The first two of these words sound the same as the Italian/Spanish word ''eco'' ('echo'), and 'echo' (Hebrew ''hed'') is indeed the solution to the poem. Each riddle would include an '[[emblem]]' (''tsurah'') near the opening in the form of an allusive picture, poem, or phrase, or a combination of these, after which the riddle proper would commence. Poems in this genre were [[occasional poems|occasional]], composed in celebration of specific high-society events such as weddings and circumcisions. The topic of the riddle would often reflect the occasion and audience (with solutions such as 'wisdom' for a gathering of scholars, or 'love' at a wedding), and the riddle might make use of information about the people at the gathering in ways which would make little sense to a wider audience.<ref>Arthur Lesley, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20689297 The Riddles of Dan Pagis]', ''Prooftexts'', 11.1 (January 1991), 76-80.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the [[Haggadah]], there is also the [[Echad Mi Yodea]], characterised by [[Joseph Jacobs]] as 'a curious riddle'.<ref name=\"Joseph Jacobs 1907\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n* Yehuda Ratzaby, '[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23415145 Halakhic Poetic Riddles of R.

Older high tank cast iron cisterns have been known to detach from the wall when the chain is pulled to flush, causing injuries to the user.

Some [[Latrodectus|black widow spiders]] like to spin their web below the toilet seat because insects abound in and around it. Therefore, several persons have been bitten while using a toilet, particularly an outhouse toilet. Although there is immediate pain at the bite site, these bites are rarely fatal.<ref>See, for instance, Raymond W.

This effect may be magnified by existing circulatory issues. It is further possible that people succumb on the toilet to chronic constipation, because the [[Valsalva maneuver]] is often dangerously used to aid in the expulsion of feces from the rectum during a bowel movement. According to Sharon Mantik Lewis, Margaret McLean Heitkemper and Shannon Ruff Dirksen, the \"Valsalva maneuver \u2026 occurs during straining to pass a hardened stool. If defecation is suppressed over long periods, problems can occur, such as constipation or stool impaction. Defecation can be facilitated by the Valsalva maneuver. This maneuver involves contraction of the chest muscles on a closed glottis with simultaneous contraction of the abdominal muscles.\"<ref>See Sharon Mantik Lewis, Margaret McLean Heitkemper, Shannon Ruff Dirksen, eds., ''Medical-Surgical Nursing: Assessment and Management of Clinical Problems'', 6th edition, Volume 2 (2004), p.951.</ref> This means that people can die while \"straining at stool.\" In chapter 8 of their ''Abdominal Emergencies'', David Cline and Latha Stead wrote that \"autopsy studies continue to reveal missed bowel obstruction as an unexpected cause of death\".<ref>David Cline and Latha Stead, ''Abdominal Emergencies'' (2007), p.56-65</ref>\n\nA 2001 ''[[The Sopranos|Sopranos]]'' episode \"[[He Is Risen (The Sopranos)|He is Risen]]\" shows a fictional depiction of the risk, when the character [[Gigi Cestone]] has a heart attack on the toilet of his social club while straining to defecate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/the-sopranos/episodes/3/34-he-is-risen/synopsis.html|title=The Sopranos Episode 34 He is Risen Synopsis|website=HBO|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Exploding toilets==\nIn the [[Victorian era]], there was a perceived risk of toilets exploding.

Sophie's major storylines start when there are problems when she is due to start secondary school. Sophie goes in on her first day but is sent home because she is not on the school's registers. When Sally finds out, she is furious however Sally is responsible as she did not fill in the application forms properly. Sophie kisses best friend [[Sian Powers]] ([[Sacha Parkinson]]). Sian later confronts Sophie, admitting that she is now confused and although she is not attracted to girls, she is now attracted to Sophie; and she deeply missed not being with her. As Sian kisses her, Sophie responds and they decided to be together, \"going out\" as a secret couple. Sophie and Sian join a Church choir so that they can see each other more often. [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) tells Sophie he saw her twin at the Manchester Gay Pride event. Sophie explains to her father that she loves Sian and they are dating. Kevin accepts their relationship.\n\nSophie is devastated to learn that Kevin is the father of [[Molly Dobbs]]'s ([[Vicky Binns]]) baby son, Jack, following an affair they had. Her mother angrily orders Kevin to leave. Rosie and Sophie stand by their mother. Sian helps Sophie through the difficult time and supports her as much as she can. In the months following, Sophie starts to spiral out of control, frequently skipping college and not doing her assignments. She tries to open up to Sally but is overlooked in favour of Jeff, her new boyfriend. As a result of all the arguments getting to her. Sophie later begins accusing Sian of cheating and they break up. Believing that their relationship is over, Sophie becomes depressed and starts drinking cider on the street, refusing [[Sunita Alahan]] ([[Shobna Gulati]])'s offers to talk. That night she ends up at the church she was rejected from previously, thinking that God hates her. Although the Pastor attempts to reason with her and ask her to come back to the choir, Sophie falls from the roof and is sent immediately to hospital. She escapes brain damage and reconciles with her family and Sian who begs Sophie to never leave her.\n\nSophie's friend [[Amber Kalirai]] ([[Nikki Patel]]) takes her to a lesbian bar. Sophie tells Amber that she wants to be with Sian and not to tell Sian where they went in case she gets the wrong idea. A few weeks later, Sian goes on holiday with her mum and Amber takes Sophie out again. Amber spikes Sophie's drink with vodka to help her loosen up and when a lad tries chatting Sophie up, Amber steps in and says that she is her girlfriend before kissing her. Amber tells Sophie the kiss was only to make the lad go away but Sophie is confused about her feelings, telling Sunita that she liked it and did not want it to end. Sunita tells Sophie the kiss did not mean anything to Amber and to focus on her relationship with Sian. Feeling guilty and taking Sunita's advice, Sophie proposes to Sian when she comes home from holiday early. Sian accepts and Sophie tells Sally and Kevin they are engaged, but they tell Sophie they would not give her permission to marry. Sophie asks Sian to talk to their parents again about getting married. They talk to Sally, but she tells them they are too young and they do not have her permission. Desperate to marry to make her feelings for Amber go away, Sophie tells Sian if they can not marry in Weatherfield, they should go to Gretna Green instead. They go to the coach station but Sally and Rosie arrive, and Sally tells Sophie she will let them marry in four weeks in Weatherfield as long as Kevin agrees, too. Sophie and Sian are delighted. The wedding day soon approaches, and on the hen night, Amber tells Sophie not to marry Sian as she likes Sophie as a friend and does not want her making a mistake. She even tries to kiss her but is stopped by Sunita, who then tells Kevin that Sophie is having doubts about getting married. However, on the wedding day, Sophie tells Kevin that she still wants to marry Sian. When they arrive at the church, Sian says her vows very well, but Sophie stumbles on hers. Kevin tells her that she does not have to do this and slips out that she told Sunita she was not ready. The whole church is confused and Sian begs to know what is going on, to which Sophie admits she can not do it. Sian flees the church in tears. Sian leaves her and Weatherfield, leaving Sophie breaking down on the cobbles hysterically, shouting to Sian that she loves her.\n\nFollowing her painful split from Sian, Sophie is left feeling bitterly depressed. She decides to resign from her job at the corner shop and decides that she does not like Amber. Sophie goes on a night out with her old friend [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]). Ryan is upset after finding out [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) was only in a relationship with him to annoy his mum Michelle and to split her up with Tracy's ex-husband, Steve. Ryan gets drunk and high on cocaine and starts playing chicken on a road of busy cars. Sophie finally persuades him to come home however as he is crossing the road a car comes, Sophie pushes him out of the way but she gets run over by the car. Sally and Kevin were both distraught when they find out that Ryan was involved in the accident, but Sophie defends his actions and makes them promise not to say anything to the police. Physiotherapist [[Jenna Kamara]] (Krissi Bohn) helps Sophie's pain go away, but Sophie develops feelings for her soon afterwards. Sophie picks up the courage to finally spend time with Jenna and even kiss her, and she responds back. The pair immediately begin dating, much to the disapproval of Jenna's mother Mandy and Kevin.

Jenny manages to defend herself, ensuring that everyone, especially Kevin, does not believe Sophie's concerns. However, in May 2015, Sophie's suspicions prove correct when Maddie catches Jenny attempting to kidnap Jack. Fleeing the house, Maddie rushes to tell Sophie, but not before leaving a voicemail on Sophie's phone, when she then gets caught up in an explosion at the builders' yard in the aftermath of the huge fire at the Victoria Court flats.

Sophie's major storylines start when there are problems when she is due to start secondary school. Sophie goes in on her first day but is sent home because she is not on the school's registers. When Sally finds out, she is furious however Sally is responsible as she did not fill in the application forms properly. Sophie kisses best friend [[Sian Powers]] ([[Sacha Parkinson]]). Sian later confronts Sophie, admitting that she is now confused and although she is not attracted to girls, she is now attracted to Sophie; and she deeply missed not being with her. As Sian kisses her, Sophie responds and they decided to be together, \"going out\" as a secret couple. Sophie and Sian join a Church choir so that they can see each other more often. [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) tells Sophie he saw her twin at the Manchester Gay Pride event. Sophie explains to her father that she loves Sian and they are dating. Kevin accepts their relationship.\n\nSophie is devastated to learn that Kevin is the father of [[Molly Dobbs]]'s ([[Vicky Binns]]) baby son, Jack, following an affair they had. Her mother angrily orders Kevin to leave. Rosie and Sophie stand by their mother. Sian helps Sophie through the difficult time and supports her as much as she can. In the months following, Sophie starts to spiral out of control, frequently skipping college and not doing her assignments. She tries to open up to Sally but is overlooked in favour of Jeff, her new boyfriend. As a result of all the arguments getting to her. Sophie later begins accusing Sian of cheating and they break up. Believing that their relationship is over, Sophie becomes depressed and starts drinking cider on the street, refusing [[Sunita Alahan]] ([[Shobna Gulati]])'s offers to talk. That night she ends up at the church she was rejected from previously, thinking that God hates her. Although the Pastor attempts to reason with her and ask her to come back to the choir, Sophie falls from the roof and is sent immediately to hospital. She escapes brain damage and reconciles with her family and Sian who begs Sophie to never leave her.\n\nSophie's friend [[Amber Kalirai]] ([[Nikki Patel]]) takes her to a lesbian bar. Sophie tells Amber that she wants to be with Sian and not to tell Sian where they went in case she gets the wrong idea. A few weeks later, Sian goes on holiday with her mum and Amber takes Sophie out again. Amber spikes Sophie's drink with vodka to help her loosen up and when a lad tries chatting Sophie up, Amber steps in and says that she is her girlfriend before kissing her. Amber tells Sophie the kiss was only to make the lad go away but Sophie is confused about her feelings, telling Sunita that she liked it and did not want it to end. Sunita tells Sophie the kiss did not mean anything to Amber and to focus on her relationship with Sian. Feeling guilty and taking Sunita's advice, Sophie proposes to Sian when she comes home from holiday early. Sian accepts and Sophie tells Sally and Kevin they are engaged, but they tell Sophie they would not give her permission to marry. Sophie asks Sian to talk to their parents again about getting married. They talk to Sally, but she tells them they are too young and they do not have her permission. Desperate to marry to make her feelings for Amber go away, Sophie tells Sian if they can not marry in Weatherfield, they should go to Gretna Green instead. They go to the coach station but Sally and Rosie arrive, and Sally tells Sophie she will let them marry in four weeks in Weatherfield as long as Kevin agrees, too. Sophie and Sian are delighted. The wedding day soon approaches, and on the hen night, Amber tells Sophie not to marry Sian as she likes Sophie as a friend and does not want her making a mistake. She even tries to kiss her but is stopped by Sunita, who then tells Kevin that Sophie is having doubts about getting married. However, on the wedding day, Sophie tells Kevin that she still wants to marry Sian. When they arrive at the church, Sian says her vows very well, but Sophie stumbles on hers. Kevin tells her that she does not have to do this and slips out that she told Sunita she was not ready. The whole church is confused and Sian begs to know what is going on, to which Sophie admits she can not do it. Sian flees the church in tears. Sian leaves her and Weatherfield, leaving Sophie breaking down on the cobbles hysterically, shouting to Sian that she loves her.\n\nFollowing her painful split from Sian, Sophie is left feeling bitterly depressed. She decides to resign from her job at the corner shop and decides that she does not like Amber. Sophie goes on a night out with her old friend [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]). Ryan is upset after finding out [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) was only in a relationship with him to annoy his mum Michelle and to split her up with Tracy's ex-husband, Steve. Ryan gets drunk and high on cocaine and starts playing chicken on a road of busy cars. Sophie finally persuades him to come home however as he is crossing the road a car comes, Sophie pushes him out of the way but she gets run over by the car. Sally and Kevin were both distraught when they find out that Ryan was involved in the accident, but Sophie defends his actions and makes them promise not to say anything to the police. Physiotherapist [[Jenna Kamara]] (Krissi Bohn) helps Sophie's pain go away, but Sophie develops feelings for her soon afterwards. Sophie picks up the courage to finally spend time with Jenna and even kiss her, and she responds back. The pair immediately begin dating, much to the disapproval of Jenna's mother Mandy and Kevin.

After giving birth to a girl, Faye comes home from the hospital and Sophie visits her. Sophie discovers that the father of Faye's daughter is a boy in Faye's class named Jackson and Sophie comforts Faye, who was devastated when Jackson rejected her after their one-night stand. Sophie soon became suspicious of Kevin's new girlfriend, [[Jenny Bradley]]'s ([[Sally Ann Matthews]]) growing attachment to her brother Jack. Jenny manages to defend herself, ensuring that everyone, especially Kevin, does not believe Sophie's concerns. However, in May 2015, Sophie's suspicions prove correct when Maddie catches Jenny attempting to kidnap Jack. Fleeing the house, Maddie rushes to tell Sophie, but not before leaving a voicemail on Sophie's phone, when she then gets caught up in an explosion at the builders' yard in the aftermath of the huge fire at the Victoria Court flats. Maddie later succumbs to her injuries in hospital, leaving Sophie devastated at the loss of another girlfriend. Whilst Sophie and Kevin attend Maddie's funeral, Jenny goes along with her plan to abduct Jack. Sophie and Kevin learn about Jenny's son, Tom, who died a few years prior and was the same age as Jack.

When Sally is targeted by an [[internet troll]], Sally decides to resign from the council, so Rosie and Sophie find out the address of the person who placed an obituary for Sally in the paper. They meet [[Leah Buckley]] (Molly McGlynn) and confront her, however, she denies being the troll, but her stepmother is to blame and will get her to stop. Leah visits the Websters and asks Rosie and Sophie if Sally is okay. After Sophie tells Rosie about Sally's state, Rosie goes to see Leah and is surprised to spot her aunt, [[Gina Seddon]] ([[Connie Hyde]]), realising she is Leah's stepmother. Leah admits Gina is the troll and explains that she is ill. Rosie tells Sophie who the troll is and they both go to confront Gina.

In 1918, the Booths built the Meeting House, which became the Bloomfield Hills School, opening for local children in 1922 (grades 1\u201312).\n\nSubsequently, the Booths decided to build a middle school and a college preparatory school. Cranbrook School for Boys, which began operations in 1927, was designed by world-renowned Finnish architect [[Eliel Saarinen]].  Completed in 1928, it was Saarinen's first executed architectural work in the United States.<ref>[http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=1 \"How one man's bad luck paved way for creation of Cranbrook\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130121150330/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=1 |date=2013-01-21 }}, Detroit News, January 14, 2002.</ref>  The name \"Cranbrook\" was chosen since [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook, England]] was the birthplace of George Booth's father. Kingswood School Cranbrook (for girls), also designed by Saarinen, opened in 1931. Cranbrook and Kingswood enrolled students from grades 7\u201312. The Bloomfield Hills School became an elementary school and was renamed Brookside School Cranbrook in 1930.\n\nUnlike the Cranbrook School for Boys, which has several buildings, the Kingswood School has only one building, which includes supporting facilities. It houses dormitories, a dining hall, an auditorium, classrooms, lounge/common areas, a bowling alley, and a ballroom. The education at Kingswood School Cranbrook was initially primarily viewed as a \"[[finishing school]]\".\n\nFor the Booths and Saarinen, the conception and design of the Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were greatly influenced by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which began in 19th-century England.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/travel/detroit/d1.htm|title= National Park Service, Itinerary, Register of Historical Places}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Booth founded an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] church to serve the nascent Cranbrook community, as well as surrounding communities. He chose the firm of [[Bertram Goodhue|Goodhue Associates]] to design the church. Groundbreaking took place in 1925, and Christ Church Cranbrook was consecrated on September 29, 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christchurchcranbrook.org/history.html |title=History of Christ Church Cranbrook |publisher=Christ Church Cranbrook |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090133/http://www.christchurchcranbrook.org/history.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> Originally Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were affiliated with the Episcopal Church, but they have since secularized. However, special occasions are still celebrated at Christ Church Cranbrook.\n\nCranbrook School, Kingswood School, and Brookside School operated separately until 1970, when it was decided to govern them together. This was followed by the creation of the [[Cranbrook Educational Community]]. In 1985, Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were merged to create a co-educational upper school institution.\n\nThe middle school did not become co-educational; it was divided into gender-specific campuses in 1984. The Community acquired Vaughan School to house the boys' middle school. The basement of Kingswood was at one point the girls' middle school. A new Middle School building opened in 2010. For boys and girls of grades 6\u20138, all classes are separate. The exceptions are those for the performing arts (Symphonic Band, Orchestra, and Choir). English, religion, and history classes are taught separately to boys and girls through the 10th grade.\n\nArchitecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the Cranbrook campus \"one of the greatest campuses ever created anywhere\".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://schools.cranbrook.edu/flash/cranbrook_place.pdf |title = Cranbrook |format = PDF |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100531121527/http://schools.cranbrook.edu/flash/cranbrook_place.pdf |archivedate = 2010-05-31 }}; Includes comments about the Cranbrook campus by architecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] and [[Florence Knoll]] (class of 1934)</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/magazine/the-cranbrook-vision.html|author = Paul Goldberger|title = The Cranbrook Vision |work=The New York Times|date= 8 April 1984}}</ref>\n\n==Cranbrook Schools today==\n[[File:ChristChurchCranbrook1.jpg|265px|right|thumb|Christ Church Cranbrook (1925\u20131928), by architect [[Bertram Goodhue]]]] In 1985, Cranbrook School and Kingswood School were merged to create a coeducational upper school, the Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School. While the majority of the classes are coeducational, Conceptual Physics and 9th and 10th grade English and History classes are taught separately to gender for educational purposes. Classes are taught on both the original Cranbrook and Kingswood campuses.\n\nFrequently, the school is referred to as \"CK\" by its students, faculty, and alumni. Cranbrook Kingswood now lays claim to 70 athletic teams, which have recently{{when|date=January 2017}} won state championships in hockey, tennis, lacrosse, golf and swimming. As of 2011, there were 795 students, approximately 1/3 of which are boarding students who live in single-sex residence halls.

These include day camps, a soccer clinic, a filmmaking seminar, a compensatory educational program for students from low-income families, a jazz ensemble, ice hockey, lacrosse, and tennis camps as well as the ''Cranbrook Theater School''. The actor [[Robert Englund]] taught one summer at the theater school.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000387/bio Robert Englund - Biography]</ref>\n\n=== Iconography ===\nThe Archer, the symbol of Cranbrook school, is based on an episode in [[s:Aeneid/Book V|Book V]] ([[s:la:Aeneis/Liber V|Latin]]) of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', by [[Virgil]], line 519:\n:''...tamen aerias telum contendit in auras...''\n:...he aimed an arrow high into the breezes of the air...\nIn an archery contest, a bird is tethered to a cord, and there are four archers. The first three in turn miss, then hit the bird, while the fourth, Acestes, instead shoots his arrow into the air, where it bursts into flames. For this miracle, Acestes is declared the victor.\n\nThe design was chosen by William Oliver Stevens, the first headmaster of Cranbrook School, who sketched it. The actual logo was designed by Eero Saarinen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://schools.cranbrook.edu/ftpimages/209/misc/misc_21139.pdf |author=W.

(Alumni and alumnae who were enrolled prior to the merger consider themselves graduates of either Cranbrook or Kingswood.) Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School has two different hymns: The Cranbrook Song and the Kingswood Song, which are sung at many school events. Only the boys are invited to attend the Cranbrook Senior Pageant. Freshmen year science, and Freshmen and Sophomore English and history are single-sex, and boys and girls have separate graduation ceremonies (although they do share in the same Baccalaureate service).\n* Since 1971 sophomores have taken part in the ''Wilderness Expedition'', a 10-day backpacking and wilderness camping trip in March that takes place in the [[Smoky Mountains]] along the North Carolina-Tennessee border\n* Junior leadership ceremonies to celebrate the transition of the juniors to the senior class: A ''Junior Ring ceremony'' for girls and the ''Passage of Leadership ceremony'' for boys is held at Christ Church Cranbrook\n* Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School maintains a relatively strict dress code: Jeans and sweatpants are not allowed on any day and on Wednesday (the so-called Dress Day) boys have to wear a dress shirt with a tie and girls have to wear dresses or dressy tops with skirts or slacks.\n* A convocation ceremony is held at the opening of the school year.\n*\n\n===Popular references===\n* ''[[Paper Lion]]'', [[George Plimpton]]'s non-fiction account of his faux tryout as quarterback for the [[Detroit Lions]] in 1963 was set in large measure at Cranbrook (where the Lions trained from 1957 through 1974).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1076329/index.htm|title= Zero of the Lions|publisher= Sports Illustrated|date= September 7, 1964}}</ref>\n* [[Eminem]]'s character, Rabbit, in the 2002 film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' mentions the Cranbrook Kingswood School in a rap battle with Papa Doc (portrayed by [[Anthony Mackie]]) when he questions Papa Doc's \"''gangsta''\" act because he attended Cranbrook.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505EEDE1631F93BA35752C1A9649C8B63|title= NYT Movie Review, 8 Mile|publisher = The New York Times | first=Elvis|last=Mitchell|date=8 November 2002}}</ref>\n* The Cranbrook School is also the model for the preparatory school portrayed in [[Edmund White]]\u00b4s autobiographical novel ''[[A Boy's Own Story]]''.<ref>[http://www.donshewey.com/arts_articles/edmund_white.html \"Edmund White's Own Story,\" by Don Shewey]</ref>\n* [[Lisa Birnbach]] makes note of Cranbrook in ''[[The Official Preppy Handbook]]'' and ''True Prep: It's a Whole New Old World''.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n{{Main|List of Cranbrook Kingswood School alumni}}\n\nCranbrook has many notable alumni, including designer [[Florence Knoll]], former U.S. Senator [[Alan K.

It attracts tourists from around the world.<ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/travel/ci_14325858 \"Michigan modern architecture a draw for travelers\"], denverpost.com, February 6, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.aaschool.ac.uk/downloads/briefs2012/AA_Intermediate_1_The_Passenger_Extended_Unit_Brief.pdf Class syllabus], [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]], London</ref> Approximately {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of Cranbrook Schools' campus are gardens.\n\nAs of 2015, Cranbrook Schools had an endowment of $233 million, among the fifteen largest held by America's boarding schools.<ref>[http://www.boardingschoolreview.com/largest_endowments/sort/1 Boarding School Review] Boarding Schools ranked by their endowments.</ref> In addition, the Cranbrook Educational Community, of which the Schools is a member, has an endowment in excess of $300 million.<ref>[http://www.metromodemedia.com/features/Cranbrook0047.aspx Why Cranbrook Matters]</ref>\n\n==History of Cranbrook Schools==\n[[File:Cranbrook Tower and Quadrangle.jpg|265px|left|thumb|The Quad in the Cranbrook Campus]]In 1915, George and Ellen Booth opened a portion of their property to the general public with the construction of a small Greek Theatre. In 1918, the Booths built the Meeting House, which became the Bloomfield Hills School, opening for local children in 1922 (grades 1\u201312).\n\nSubsequently, the Booths decided to build a middle school and a college preparatory school. Cranbrook School for Boys, which began operations in 1927, was designed by world-renowned Finnish architect [[Eliel Saarinen]].  Completed in 1928, it was Saarinen's first executed architectural work in the United States.<ref>[http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=1 \"How one man's bad luck paved way for creation of Cranbrook\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130121150330/http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=1 |date=2013-01-21 }}, Detroit News, January 14, 2002.</ref>  The name \"Cranbrook\" was chosen since [[Cranbrook, Kent|Cranbrook, England]] was the birthplace of George Booth's father. Kingswood School Cranbrook (for girls), also designed by Saarinen, opened in 1931. Cranbrook and Kingswood enrolled students from grades 7\u201312. The Bloomfield Hills School became an elementary school and was renamed Brookside School Cranbrook in 1930.\n\nUnlike the Cranbrook School for Boys, which has several buildings, the Kingswood School has only one building, which includes supporting facilities. It houses dormitories, a dining hall, an auditorium, classrooms, lounge/common areas, a bowling alley, and a ballroom. The education at Kingswood School Cranbrook was initially primarily viewed as a \"[[finishing school]]\".\n\nFor the Booths and Saarinen, the conception and design of the Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were greatly influenced by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which began in 19th-century England.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/travel/detroit/d1.htm|title= National Park Service, Itinerary, Register of Historical Places}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Booth founded an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] church to serve the nascent Cranbrook community, as well as surrounding communities. He chose the firm of [[Bertram Goodhue|Goodhue Associates]] to design the church. Groundbreaking took place in 1925, and Christ Church Cranbrook was consecrated on September 29, 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christchurchcranbrook.org/history.html |title=History of Christ Church Cranbrook |publisher=Christ Church Cranbrook |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090133/http://www.christchurchcranbrook.org/history.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> Originally Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were affiliated with the Episcopal Church, but they have since secularized. However, special occasions are still celebrated at Christ Church Cranbrook.\n\nCranbrook School, Kingswood School, and Brookside School operated separately until 1970, when it was decided to govern them together. This was followed by the creation of the [[Cranbrook Educational Community]]. In 1985, Cranbrook and Kingswood schools were merged to create a co-educational upper school institution.\n\nThe middle school did not become co-educational; it was divided into gender-specific campuses in 1984. The Community acquired Vaughan School to house the boys' middle school. The basement of Kingswood was at one point the girls' middle school. A new Middle School building opened in 2010. For boys and girls of grades 6\u20138, all classes are separate. The exceptions are those for the performing arts (Symphonic Band, Orchestra, and Choir). English, religion, and history classes are taught separately to boys and girls through the 10th grade.\n\nArchitecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the Cranbrook campus \"one of the greatest campuses ever created anywhere\".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://schools.cranbrook.edu/flash/cranbrook_place.pdf |title = Cranbrook |format = PDF |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100531121527/http://schools.cranbrook.edu/flash/cranbrook_place.pdf |archivedate = 2010-05-31 }}; Includes comments about the Cranbrook campus by architecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] and [[Florence Knoll]] (class of 1934)</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/08/magazine/the-cranbrook-vision.html|author = Paul Goldberger|title = The Cranbrook Vision |work=The New York Times|date= 8 April 1984}}</ref>\n\n==Cranbrook Schools today==\n[[File:ChristChurchCranbrook1.jpg|265px|right|thumb|Christ Church Cranbrook (1925\u20131928), by architect [[Bertram Goodhue]]]] In 1985, Cranbrook School and Kingswood School were merged to create a coeducational upper school, the Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School. While the majority of the classes are coeducational, Conceptual Physics and 9th and 10th grade English and History classes are taught separately to gender for educational purposes. Classes are taught on both the original Cranbrook and Kingswood campuses.\n\nFrequently, the school is referred to as \"CK\" by its students, faculty, and alumni. Cranbrook Kingswood now lays claim to 70 athletic teams, which have recently{{when|date=January 2017}} won state championships in hockey, tennis, lacrosse, golf and swimming. As of 2011, there were 795 students, approximately 1/3 of which are boarding students who live in single-sex residence halls.

These include day camps, a soccer clinic, a filmmaking seminar, a compensatory educational program for students from low-income families, a jazz ensemble, ice hockey, lacrosse, and tennis camps as well as the ''Cranbrook Theater School''. The actor [[Robert Englund]] taught one summer at the theater school.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000387/bio Robert Englund - Biography]</ref>\n\n=== Iconography ===\nThe Archer, the symbol of Cranbrook school, is based on an episode in [[s:Aeneid/Book V|Book V]] ([[s:la:Aeneis/Liber V|Latin]]) of the ''[[Aeneid]]'', by [[Virgil]], line 519:\n:''...tamen aerias telum contendit in auras...''\n:...he aimed an arrow high into the breezes of the air...\nIn an archery contest, a bird is tethered to a cord, and there are four archers. The first three in turn miss, then hit the bird, while the fourth, Acestes, instead shoots his arrow into the air, where it bursts into flames. For this miracle, Acestes is declared the victor.\n\nThe design was chosen by William Oliver Stevens, the first headmaster of Cranbrook School, who sketched it. The actual logo was designed by Eero Saarinen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://schools.cranbrook.edu/ftpimages/209/misc/misc_21139.pdf |author=W.

Only the boys are invited to attend the Cranbrook Senior Pageant. Freshmen year science, and Freshmen and Sophomore English and history are single-sex, and boys and girls have separate graduation ceremonies (although they do share in the same Baccalaureate service).\n* Since 1971 sophomores have taken part in the ''Wilderness Expedition'', a 10-day backpacking and wilderness camping trip in March that takes place in the [[Smoky Mountains]] along the North Carolina-Tennessee border\n* Junior leadership ceremonies to celebrate the transition of the juniors to the senior class: A ''Junior Ring ceremony'' for girls and the ''Passage of Leadership ceremony'' for boys is held at Christ Church Cranbrook\n* Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School maintains a relatively strict dress code: Jeans and sweatpants are not allowed on any day and on Wednesday (the so-called Dress Day) boys have to wear a dress shirt with a tie and girls have to wear dresses or dressy tops with skirts or slacks.\n* A convocation ceremony is held at the opening of the school year.\n*\n\n===Popular references===\n* ''[[Paper Lion]]'', [[George Plimpton]]'s non-fiction account of his faux tryout as quarterback for the [[Detroit Lions]] in 1963 was set in large measure at Cranbrook (where the Lions trained from 1957 through 1974).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1076329/index.htm|title= Zero of the Lions|publisher= Sports Illustrated|date= September 7, 1964}}</ref>\n* [[Eminem]]'s character, Rabbit, in the 2002 film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' mentions the Cranbrook Kingswood School in a rap battle with Papa Doc (portrayed by [[Anthony Mackie]]) when he questions Papa Doc's \"''gangsta''\" act because he attended Cranbrook.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505EEDE1631F93BA35752C1A9649C8B63|title= NYT Movie Review, 8 Mile|publisher = The New York Times | first=Elvis|last=Mitchell|date=8 November 2002}}</ref>\n* The Cranbrook School is also the model for the preparatory school portrayed in [[Edmund White]]\u00b4s autobiographical novel ''[[A Boy's Own Story]]''.<ref>[http://www.donshewey.com/arts_articles/edmund_white.html \"Edmund White's Own Story,\" by Don Shewey]</ref>\n* [[Lisa Birnbach]] makes note of Cranbrook in ''[[The Official Preppy Handbook]]'' and ''True Prep: It's a Whole New Old World''.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n{{Main|List of Cranbrook Kingswood School alumni}}\n\nCranbrook has many notable alumni, including designer [[Florence Knoll]], former U.S. Senator [[Alan K.
