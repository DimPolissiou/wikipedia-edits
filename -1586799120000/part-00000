The district is located in the southern foothills of the Lippe mountain range and in the area of Blomberger and Schwalenberger Heights.\n\nThe core city is located in the center of the so-called Blomberger basin, which lies about 150 m above sea level and clearly separates itself from the surrounding area. The hem of the basin to the north and east are the approximately 400 m high wooded ridges of Barntruper and Blomberger Stadtwald with the Dicker, Becker and Winterberg. To the west are the H\u00f6rntruper Berg, the Meierberg, the Mossenberg (228 m) and the P\u00fcllenberg (261 m), while the border in the south of Nessenberg (235 m), Spielberg (239 m) and Steinberg (342 m) is formed. The drainage of the eastern part of the Blomberger basin is made by the Diestel, a left tributary of the Emmer. Between the districts Istrup and Gro\u00dfenmarpe a watershed has formed. For this reason, the western part of the Blomberg basin is drained via the Marpe and its tributaries towards Bega / Werre. The lowest point of the municipality is at 139 m, the highest is the summit of the winter mountain at 429 m.\n\n== Geology ==\nThe municipality is located on the southern flank of the Pyrmont-Piesberger axis, there are almost exclusively rocks of the Middle (Km) and Upper Keupers (Ko) open-minded. The rock strata, which were once stored horizontally in the Middle Ages, were raised in the Tertiary around 30 million years ago and formed the Blomberger Sattel.\n\nBy erosion in the center of the saddle the older gray and red marl of the Middle Keuper (Km1) were uncovered, which is also called Gipskeuper because of switched-on layers of gypsum. The result was the clearly recognizable pelvic structure, this phenomenon is called relief reversal. The reed sandstone (Km2) then forms a first striking terrain level. The city itself is located on the western edge of this steep step. The reed sandstone was obtained in small quarries as quarry stone for construction purposes. The marls of the so-called Red Wall (Km3) are susceptible to weathering, only the following harder stone marls (Km4) give rise to another stage in the terrain. The outermost edge of the basin structure consists of harder rock layers of the Upper Keuper (Ko) R\u00e4tkeuper.\n\nIn the Tertiary it came in the inner basin edges consisting of gypsum Keuper to the dissolution of plaster layers. Through this process, also called subrosion, formed hollows. These were backfilled with the weathering marls from the immediate area. Because of their high clay content, these sediments formed the raw material basis for some brickworks. In the basin itself, loess has deposited in the course of the last ice age and weathered to loess clay. The amount of deposits is up to 150&nbsp;cm and is responsible for the good to very good quality of arable land.\n\nThe old Kleinstadt, classified district, covers an area of 99.12&nbsp;km\u00b2. The municipality has a maximum extent in east-west direction of about 12\u00bd km and in north-south direction of about 15\u00bd km.\n\nThe vast majority of the land is used by agriculture, in the area of wet creek lowlands mainly as grassland and pastures. The forest on the surrounding mountains consists of three quarters of deciduous trees, mostly beech, while on the R\u00e4tkeuper spruce cultures thrive. In comparison to the NRW state average of 49.4%, the agricultural area in Blomberg is 60%, while the forest area is 25.4% (NRW) and 26.5% (Blomberg).\n\nExtensive areas of the Blomberg urban area are good to very good for the use of geothermal heat sources using geothermal probes and heat generated by heat pump. In the central and southern urban area, however, the suitability is rather mediocre, and in some cases poor (see the adjacent map).\n\n== Neighbouring communities ==\nThe neighbouring committees are [[Bad Pyrmont]], (in Landkreis Hameln-Pyrmont, Niedersachsen), L\u00fcgde, Schieder-Schwalenberg, Horn-Bad Meinberg, Detmold, Lemgo, D\u00f6rentrup and [[Barntrup]] (all in Kreis Lippe).\n\n== Villages ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!

CSA was also a participating member in the [[Coalition for Space Exploration]]. It officially ceased operations on June 10, 2011.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nFormer schoolteacher, Assemblywoman and Congresswoman [[Andrea Seastrand]] served as the Executive Director of CSA, which was governed by a statewide board of directors, composed of twelve members elected by the CSA Membership.  Four directors were selected from each of CSA's three regions (Northern, Central, and Southern California) during elections that are held in the Fall in which each director was elected to a 3-year term.  The terms of office were staggered such that half of the seats on the board are up for election each year.  The Board would also fill additional 1-year seats with CSA members to ensure adequate representation was met across CSA's constituent types (industry, government, academia, large, small, etc.).\n\nDesignated as California's [[Spaceport]] Authority, CSA was tasked by the state of California to operate as a member-based \"enterprise\" association that worked closely with individual, corporate, state and local government and academic stakeholders throughout the state.  The main purpose of CSA was to facilitate California's competitiveness within the aerospace industry.  In this capacity, CSA was also authorized to facilitate development of California-based spaceports.\n\nIncluding space-related companies, individual entrepreneurs, [[government agencies]], non-profit organizations and College and University research programs, California's space enterprise provides or supports the delivery of hundreds of space-related products and services to the state and the nation.  The total [[economic impact]] of California's space enterprise (Commercial, Civil, National Security) was estimated to be in excess of $120 billion.  Representing 24% of the global space market, California space enterprise impacts over 251,000 jobs statewide.\n\nSome of the CSA's major responsibilities were to:<ref>{{cite web|title=California Space Authority|url=http://www.californiaspaceauthority.org/|work=Website|publisher=California Space Authority|accessdate=June 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n* Serve as the official voice of the State of California on space technology issues to the federal government, other state governments, local governments and the private sector;\n* Act as the official policy advisor to the Governor and State Legislature on space-related matters;\n* Link statewide resources and capital to California space and technology enterprises;\n* Promote California as an international center of space technology;\n* Coordinate the development of the California Strategic Space Plan, and;\n* Design and administer a competitive grant program.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe predecessor organization to the California Space Authority (CSA) was the California Space and Technology Alliance (CSTA).  The first CSA Board of Directors was seated in January 2001.\n\nThe California Space and Technology Alliance was established in 1996 as a [[501(c)(6)]] non-profit organization to foster development of space industry and was officially recognized by the state when Governor [[Pete Wilson]] signed Assembly [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] 1475 into law in October 1997.  AB 1475, co-sponsored by state Senator [[John Vasconcellos]] and Assemblymembers [[Jim Cunneen]], [[Elaine K. Alquist]] and [[Liz Figueroa]] created the CSTA ''\"to foster the development of specified activities in California related to space flight.\"'' The vision of the CSTA was that ''\"California leads the world in space education, research, technology, manufacturing, services and transportation.\"''\n\nThe bill also authorized the CSTA to function as the California Spaceport Authority (one of five spaceport authorities in the nation) and set forth the duties of the CSTA.  One such duty was to administer the Space Flight Competitive Grant Program.\n\nPrior to enactment of AB 1475, California, which had been a leader in the space industry, did not have a coordinated, statewide voice on space issues.  By creating the CSTA, AB 1475 provided a vehicle for such a unified voice.  The CSTA served as the official policy advisor to the Governor and the Legislature on space-related matters, while acting as an advocate for the state on space technology issues (CA Government Code 15333.3).\n\nGoverned by a statewide board of directors, the space authority was a private nonprofit group whose headline members included [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Boeing]], [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Raytheon]]. However, it had managed more than $16 million in taxpayer funds since the 1990s.\n\nOver the past decade, the group's major focus was the California Space Center, a proposed {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|adj=on|disp=flip}} complex envisioned as providing education, entertainment, cultural activities and office space just outside the only spaceport on the West Coast at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[Santa Barbara County]].\n\nIn January 2011, the CSA was within months of signing a final lease with the Air Force and breaking ground. However, just two months later in March, CSA leadership halted those plans. The space authority said it had determined the California Space Center would have had to navigate Santa Barbara County's strict environmental review process, which would have added three to five years of hearings and approvals before construction could start.<ref>{{cite news|last=Report|first=Staff|title=California Space Authority to dissolve|url=http://www.lompocrecord.com/news/local/military/vandenberg/article_2b703680-9397-11e0-8493-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=June 10, 2011|newspaper=Lompoc Record|date=June 10, 2011}}</ref> CSA had signaled its intent to move the center within the city limits of Lompoc, where city leaders welcomed the project.\n\nOn June 10, 2011, officials announced the CSA Board of Directors had agreed the previous Monday to begin the dissolution process, with members voting in favor of breaking up the organization. According to Janice Dunn, former deputy director, a lack of funding led to the decision. In the past few months, the organization learned an expected $5 million in federal money wouldn't be coming through, due in large part to the [[economic recession]].\n\n<ref>{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Bethany|title=California Space Authority and plans for Space Center in Lompoc are no more|url=http://www.ksby.com/news/california-space-authority-and-plans-for-space-center-in-lompoc-are-no-more/|work=News report|publisher=KSBY News 6 (NBC San Luis Obispo)|accessdate=June 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613222956/http://www.ksby.com/news/california-space-authority-and-plans-for-space-center-in-lompoc-are-no-more/|archivedate=June 13, 2011}}</ref> The dissolution also signaled an end to plans to develop the California Space Center.

By creating the CSTA, AB 1475 provided a vehicle for such a unified voice.  The CSTA served as the official policy advisor to the Governor and the Legislature on space-related matters, while acting as an advocate for the state on space technology issues (CA Government Code 15333.3).\n\nGoverned by a statewide board of directors, the space authority was a private nonprofit group whose headline members included [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Boeing]], [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Raytheon]]. However, it had managed more than $16 million in taxpayer funds since the 1990s.\n\nOver the past decade, the group's major focus was the California Space Center, a proposed {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|adj=on|disp=flip}} complex envisioned as providing education, entertainment, cultural activities and office space just outside the only spaceport on the West Coast at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[Santa Barbara County]].\n\nIn January 2011, the CSA was within months of signing a final lease with the Air Force and breaking ground. However, just two months later in March, CSA leadership halted those plans. The space authority said it had determined the California Space Center would have had to navigate Santa Barbara County's strict environmental review process, which would have added three to five years of hearings and approvals before construction could start.<ref>{{cite news|last=Report|first=Staff|title=California Space Authority to dissolve|url=http://www.lompocrecord.com/news/local/military/vandenberg/article_2b703680-9397-11e0-8493-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=June 10, 2011|newspaper=Lompoc Record|date=June 10, 2011}}</ref> CSA had signaled its intent to move the center within the city limits of Lompoc, where city leaders welcomed the project.\n\nOn June 10, 2011, officials announced the CSA Board of Directors had agreed the previous Monday to begin the dissolution process, with members voting in favor of breaking up the organization. According to Janice Dunn, former deputy director, a lack of funding led to the decision. In the past few months, the organization learned an expected $5 million in federal money wouldn't be coming through, due in large part to the [[economic recession]].\n\n<ref>{{cite web|last=Tucker|first=Bethany|title=California Space Authority and plans for Space Center in Lompoc are no more|url=http://www.ksby.com/news/california-space-authority-and-plans-for-space-center-in-lompoc-are-no-more/|work=News report|publisher=KSBY News 6 (NBC San Luis Obispo)|accessdate=June 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613222956/http://www.ksby.com/news/california-space-authority-and-plans-for-space-center-in-lompoc-are-no-more/|archivedate=June 13, 2011}}</ref> The dissolution also signaled an end to plans to develop the California Space Center.

This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the ''Billboard'' Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.)\n\nDuring the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to take the band in a heavier direction. Feeling that Evans and Simper would not fit well with a heavy rock style, both were replaced that summer.<ref>Joel Whitburn (2007). \"The Billboard Albums: Includes Every Album That Made the Billboard 200 Chart\". p.227.

The album contained strings and woodwind on one track (\"April\"), showcasing Lord's classical antecedents such as [[Bach]] and [[Rimsky-Korsakov]], and several other influences were in evidence, notably [[Vanilla Fudge]]. (Lord and Blackmore had even claimed the group wanted to be a \"Vanilla Fudge clone\".)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehighwaystar.com/interviews/blackmore/rb199102xx.html |title=Ritchie Blackmore, Interviews |publisher=Thehighwaystar.com |date= |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> This was the last recording by the original line-up.\n\nDeep Purple's troubled North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed production of the ''Deep Purple'' album until after the band's 1969 American tour ended. This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the ''Billboard'' Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.)\n\nDuring the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to take the band in a heavier direction. Feeling that Evans and Simper would not fit well with a heavy rock style, both were replaced that summer.<ref>Joel Whitburn (2007). \"The Billboard Albums: Includes Every Album That Made the Billboard 200 Chart\". p.227. Record Research Inc., 2007</ref> Paice stated, \"A change had to come.

The band sought out singer [[Ian Gillan]] from [[Episode Six]], a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving any great commercial success.

Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance \"you could have put the five smiles together and spanned the Thames.\" Lord would also write the ''[[Gemini Suite Live|Gemini Suite]]'', another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970.

Said Lord, \"We took from jazz, we took from old fashioned rock and roll, we took from the classics. Ritchie and myself...used to swap musical jokes and attacks. He would play something, and I'd have to see if I could match it. That provided a sense of humour, a sense of tension to the band, a sense of, 'what the hell's going to happen next?'
