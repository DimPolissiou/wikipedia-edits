In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

In the case of the [[Owenites]], they also overlapped with a number of other [[working-class]] and [[labour movement]]s such as the [[Chartism|Chartists]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vincent|2010|p=88}}\n\n[[Fenner Brockway]] identified three early democratic socialist groups during the [[English Civil War]] in his book ''Britain's First Socialists'', namely the [[Levellers]], who were pioneers of political democracy and the sovereignty of the people; the [[Agitators]], who were the pioneers of [[Workers' control|participatory control by the ranks at their workplace]]; and the [[Diggers]], who were pioneers of communal ownership, [[cooperation]] and [[egalitarianism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Brockway|1y=1980|2a1=Hain|2y=1995|2p=12}} The philosophy and tradition of the Diggers and the Levellers was continued in the period described by [[E.

Leaders in the movement also called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. The very first [[trade union]]s and [[consumers' cooperative]] societies also emerged in the hinterland of the Chartist movement as a way of bolstering the fight for these demands.{{sfn|Brandal|Bratberg|Thorsen|2013|p=20}} The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent as opposed to aristocratic privilege. Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism.{{sfn|Smitha}} Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].{{sfn|Australian National University (Birth of the Socialist Idea)}} He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to the progress of human civilisation.{{sfn|Newman|2005}} This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress, embodying a desire for a more directed or [[planned economy]].{{sfn|Smitha}} The British political philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] also came to advocate a form of [[Liberal socialism|economic socialism within a liberal context]]. In later editions of ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1848), Mill would argue that \"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2007|2a1=Baum|2y=2007|2ps=: \"Mill, in contrast, advances a form of liberal democratic socialism for the enlargement of freedom as well as to realize social and distributive justice.

Reformism arose as an alternative to revolution, with leading social democrat [[Eduard Bernstein]] proposing the concept of evolutionary socialism. Revolutionary socialists, encompassing multiple social and political movements that may define revolution differently from one another, quickly targeted the nascent ideology of reformism and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Eduard Bernstein#Opinions|Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay titled ''[[Social Reform or Revolution?]]'' The Social Democratic Party of Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe despite being an illegal organisation until the [[anti-socialist laws]] were officially repealed in 1890. In the [[1893 German federal election|1893 federal elections]], the party gained about 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast according to Engels. In 1895, the year of his death, Engels highlighted ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'''s emphasis on winning as a first step the \"battle of democracy\".{{sfnm|1a1=Engels|1a2=Marx|1y=1848|1p=52|2a1=Steger|2y=1997|2pp=247\u2013259|3a1=Steger|3y=1999|3pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nIn his introduction to the 1895 edition of Karl Marx's ''[[The Class Struggles in France 1848\u20131850|The Class Struggles in France]]'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist [[Reformist socialism|reformist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] socialists in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist policies while maintaining his belief that [[revolutionary]] seizure of power by the [[proletariat]] should remain a key goal of the socialist movement. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]].{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'' in which he argued that \"revolution\" and the \"so-called socialist society\" were not fixed concepts, but rather constantly changing social phenomena and said that this made \"us [socialists] all evolutionists\", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism. Engels also wrote that it would be \"suicidal\" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power which he predicted could happen \"as early as 1898\".{{sfnm|1a1=Steger|1y=1997|1pp=247\u2013259|2a1=Steger|2y=1999|2pp=181\u2013196}}\n\nEngels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion among political commentators and the public. Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances at that time and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism. As a result, Engels was deeply distressed when he discovered that his introduction to a new edition of ''The Class Struggles in France'' had been edited by Bernstein and [[Karl Kautsky]] in a manner which left the impression that he had become a proponent of a peaceful road to socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|pp=181\u2013196}} On 1 April 1895, four months before his death, Engels wrote to Kautsky as follows: <blockquote>I was amazed to see today in the ''Vorw\u00e4rts'' an excerpt from my 'Introduction' that had been printed without my knowledge and tricked out in such a way as to present me as a peace-loving proponent of legality [at all costs].

In the view of democratic socialists, capitalism, based on the primacy of private property, generates inherent inequalities of wealth and power and a dominant egoism that are incompatible with the democratic values of freedom, equality, and solidarity. Only a socialist society can fully realize democratic practices. The internal conflicts within capitalism require a transition to socialism.

In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership. The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Safra|first=Jacob E.|year=1998|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=The New Encyclopaedia Britannica|edition=15th|volume=10|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc.|page=920|isbn=|quote=[...] a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from capitalism to socialism using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Schweickart|first=David|editor1-last=Anderson|editor1-first=Gary L.|editor2-last=Herr|editor2-first=Kathryn G.|year=2007|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice|title=Democratic Socialism|publisher=SAGE Publications|volume=1|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=9781412918121|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Stevens|first=Mark A.|year=2000|title=Social democracy|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Encyclopedia|publisher=Merriam-Webster|page=1504|isbn=978-0-8777-9017-4|quote=Political ideology that advocates a peaceful, evolutionary transition of society from -capitalism to -socialism, using established political processes.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia|last=Wilson|first=Fred|date=10 July 2007|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mill/|title=John Stuart Mill|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=17 March 2008|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==== Journals ====\n{{refbegin|40em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Allen|first=Christopher S.|date=1 September 2009|title='Empty Nets': Social Democracy and the 'Catch-All Party Thesis' in Germany and Sweden|journal=Party Politics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=635\u2013653|doi=10.1177/1354068809336389|issn=13540688|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Andreasson|first=Stefan|year=2006|title=he African National Congress and its Critics: 'Predatory Liberalism', Black Empowerment and Intra-Alliance Tensions in Post-Apartheid South Africa|journal=Democratization|volume=13|issue=2|pages=303\u2013322|doi=10.1080/13510340500524018|issn=13510347|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Appadorai|first=A.|year=1968|title=Recent Socialist Thought in India|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=30|issue=3|pages=349\u2013362|doi=10.1017/S0034670500041024|jstor=1406397|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Avrich|first=Paul|date=July 1968|title=Russian Anarchists and the Civil War|journal=Russian Review|volume=27|issue=3|pages=296\u2013306|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Bardhan|first1=Pranab|last2=Roemer|first2=John E.|year=1992|title=Market Socialism: A Case for Rejuvenation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=6|issue=3|pages=101\u2013116|doi=10.1257/jep.6.3.101|issn=08953309|ref=harv|doi-access=free}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Batson|first=Andrew|date=March 2017|url=http://www.cebc.org.br/sites/default/files/the_state_of_the_state_sector.pdf|title=The State of the State Sector|publisher=Gavekal Dragonomics|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Benedetto|first1=Giacomo|last2=Hix|first2=Simon|last3=Mastrorocco|first3=Nicola|url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/hix/Working_Papers/BHM_Rise_and_Fall_of_SD.pdf|title=The Rise and Fall of Social Democracy, 1918\u20132017|date=1 July 2019|journal=Trinity Economics Papers|pages=1\u201343|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Berman|first1=Sheri|last2=Snegovaya|first2=Maria|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/populism-and-the-decline-of-social-democracy/|title=Populism and the Decline of Social Democracy|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=30|issue=3|pages=5\u201319|date=10 July 2019|doi=10.1353/jod.2019.0038|accessdate=29 November 2019|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last=Bilgrami|first=S.

In the face of growing economic instability in the Eurozone, as well as massive anti- austerity protests on the peripheries of Europe, the \"victims of communism\" narrative may be linked to a public relations effort to link all leftist political ideals to the horrors of Stalinism. Such a rhetorical move seems all the more potent when discursively combined with the idea that there is a moral equivalence between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and East European victims of Stalinism. This third coming of the German Historikerstreit is related to the precariousness of global capitalism, and perhaps the elite desire to discredit all political ideologies that threaten the primacy of private property and free markets.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite journal|last1=Gimpel|first1=James G.|last2=Hoffman|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Karen M.|date=May 2003|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e2be0e64b470a870fc28ac6462c58160d1432899|title=A Promise Fulfilled?

Remarks in New York|publisher=Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|accessdate=10 February 2020|quote=The directive was drafted by Senator Taft at that famous breakfast in New York City a few weeks ago. Senator Taft left that meeting and told the press what the General stands for. Taft explained that the great issue in this campaign is \"creeping socialism.\" Now that is the patented trademark of the special interest lobbies. Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years. Socialism is what they called public power. Socialism is what they called social security. Socialism is what they called farm price supports. Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance. Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations. Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people. When the Republican candidate inscribes the slogan \"Down With Socialism\" on the banner of his \"great crusade,\" that is really not what he means at all. What he really means is, \"Down with Progress\u2014down with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal,\" and \"down with Harry Truman's Fair Deal.\" That is what he means.|ref=harv}}\n: {{cite

Soon after the merger, the new company divested several businesses, including its animal health and nutrition business, Sanofi Sant\u00e9 Nutrition Animale.\n\nThis business was acquired through the first of four [[Leveraged buyout|leveraged management buyouts]] (LMBO) and resulted in the establishment in 1999 of Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animal. Following the third LMBO, in 2007 Ceva management and employees acquired the majority shareholding in the company.\n\nIn 2014, there was a Reshaping of Ceva's capital structure to accompany the launch of the company's ambition to become the first independent player within the top 5 global animal health companies by 2020. While management still retained the position of majority shareholders long-term strategic partners were selected to support the group's future growth ambitions:[[Temasek Holdings|Temasek]], [[CDH Investments]], Euromezzanine, [[About:blank|Sagard]] and M\u00e9rieux D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nSince 1999, Ceva has been the sole shareholder of Ceva-Phylaxia. Founded in Hungary in 1912, the Phylaxia Vaccine Production Co produced the first vaccine against [[classical swine fever]]. Scientists including [[J\u00f3zsef Marek]] and [[Alad\u00e1r Aujeszky]] were closely associated with the company. \n\nCeva has grown rapidly through both acquisitions and organic growth. In 2000 it ranked 18<sup>th</sup> globally with sales of US$140 million a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animalpharm.agribusinessintelligence.informa.com/AP012786/A-carousel-of-companies-Inside-the-industry-consolidation-of-19902000|title=A carousel of companies: Inside the industry consolidation of 1990-2000|date=2017-08-03|website=Animal Pharm|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n\n'''Major acquisitions by Ceva include:''' \n\n* 2017: Purchase of ex-Merial product range<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animalpharm.agribusinessintelligence.informa.com/AP011375/Ceva-closes-acquisition-of-Merial-assets|title=Ceva closes acquisition of Merial assets|date=2017-01-19|website=Animal Pharm|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n* 2017: Joint-venture agreement between EBVAC, China and Ceva to create a new business, Ceva Ebvac, focused on the swine vaccine sector\n* 2016: Hertape Saude Animale Ltda. and Inova Biotecnologia Saude Animale Ltda, Brazil, \n* 2016: Biovac, a manufacturer of autogeneous (bacterial) vaccines, allergy treatments and reagents based in Angers, France<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://objectifaquitaine.latribune.fr/business/2016-06-02/ceva-sante-animale-acquiert-le-laboratoire-biovac.html|title=Ceva Sant\u00e9 animale acquiert le laboratoire Biovac|website=La Tribune|language=fr|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n* 2015: Polchem, India<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160308006326/en/Ceva-Reports-Annual-Growth-12-Reaffirms-Ambition|title=Ceva Reports Annual Growth of 12% and Reaffirms Ambition to Enter the Global Top 5 by 2020|date=2016-03-08|website=www.businesswire.com|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n* 2013: Sogeval \n* 2011: Vetech Laboratories, Inc., a Canadian poultry vaccine manufacturer that produces live coccidiosis vaccines for poultry under the trade name Immucox\u00ae \n* 2011: First joint venture established in China, Ceva Huadu\n* 2010: Summit VetPharm, a New Jersey-based company\n* 2005: Biomune, a US poultry vaccine producer based in [[Lenexa, Kansas|Lenexa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kclifesciences.org/news/life-sciences-bulletin/volume-1-2014/ceva-going-beyond-animal-health/|title=Ceva: Going Beyond Animal Health {{!}} Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nIn 2016, Ceva won the best company in Europe category in Animal Pharm's annual industry awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pig333.com/company_news/ceva-best-company-in-europe-winner-animal-pharm-awards-2016_12105/|title=Ceva: Best Company in Europe winner Animal Pharm awards 2016|website=www.pig333.com|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Ceva's hatchery vaccination services program for poultry, the C.H.I.C.K Program, received quality recognition from the international testing and certification company, Bureau Veritas Group, based in Paris.

Soon after the merger, the new company divested several businesses, including its animal health and nutrition business, Sanofi Sant\u00e9 Nutrition Animale.\n\nThis business was acquired through the first of four [[Leveraged buyout|leveraged management buyouts]] (LMBO) and resulted in the establishment in 1999 of Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animal. Following the third LMBO, in 2007 Ceva management and employees acquired the majority shareholding in the company.\n\nIn 2014, there was a Reshaping of Ceva's capital structure to accompany the launch of the company's ambition to become the first independent player within the top 5 global animal health companies by 2020. While management still retained the position of majority shareholders long-term strategic partners were selected to support the group's future growth ambitions:[[Temasek Holdings|Temasek]], [[CDH Investments]], Euromezzanine, [[About:blank|Sagard]] and M\u00e9rieux D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nSince 1999, Ceva has been the sole shareholder of Ceva-Phylaxia. Founded in Hungary in 1912, the Phylaxia Vaccine Production Co produced the first vaccine against [[classical swine fever]]. Scientists including [[J\u00f3zsef Marek]] and [[Alad\u00e1r Aujeszky]] were closely associated with the company. \n\nCeva has grown rapidly through both acquisitions and organic growth. In 2000 it ranked 18<sup>th</sup> globally with sales of US$140 million a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animalpharm.agribusinessintelligence.informa.com/AP012786/A-carousel-of-companies-Inside-the-industry-consolidation-of-19902000|title=A carousel of companies: Inside the industry consolidation of 1990-2000|date=2017-08-03|website=Animal Pharm|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n\n'''Major acquisitions by Ceva include:''' \n\n* 2017: Purchase of ex-Merial product range<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animalpharm.agribusinessintelligence.informa.com/AP011375/Ceva-closes-acquisition-of-Merial-assets|title=Ceva closes acquisition of Merial assets|date=2017-01-19|website=Animal Pharm|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n* 2017: Joint-venture agreement between EBVAC, China and Ceva to create a new business, Ceva Ebvac, focused on the swine vaccine sector\n* 2016: Hertape Saude Animale Ltda. and Inova Biotecnologia Saude Animale Ltda, Brazil, \n* 2016: Biovac, a manufacturer of autogeneous (bacterial) vaccines, allergy treatments and reagents based in Angers, France<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://objectifaquitaine.latribune.fr/business/2016-06-02/ceva-sante-animale-acquiert-le-laboratoire-biovac.html|title=Ceva Sant\u00e9 animale acquiert le laboratoire Biovac|website=La Tribune|language=fr|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n* 2015: Polchem, India<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160308006326/en/Ceva-Reports-Annual-Growth-12-Reaffirms-Ambition|title=Ceva Reports Annual Growth of 12% and Reaffirms Ambition to Enter the Global Top 5 by 2020|date=2016-03-08|website=www.businesswire.com|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n* 2013: Sogeval \n* 2011: Vetech Laboratories, Inc., a Canadian poultry vaccine manufacturer that produces live coccidiosis vaccines for poultry under the trade name Immucox\u00ae \n* 2011: First joint venture established in China, Ceva Huadu\n* 2010: Summit VetPharm, a New Jersey-based company\n* 2005: Biomune, a US poultry vaccine producer based in [[Lenexa, Kansas|Lenexa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kclifesciences.org/news/life-sciences-bulletin/volume-1-2014/ceva-going-beyond-animal-health/|title=Ceva: Going Beyond Animal Health {{!}} Kansas City Area Life Sciences Institute|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nIn 2016, Ceva won the best company in Europe category in Animal Pharm's annual industry awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pig333.com/company_news/ceva-best-company-in-europe-winner-animal-pharm-awards-2016_12105/|title=Ceva: Best Company in Europe winner Animal Pharm awards 2016|website=www.pig333.com|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Ceva's hatchery vaccination services program for poultry, the C.H.I.C.K Program, received quality recognition from the international testing and certification company, Bureau Veritas Group, based in Paris.

A two-time winner of the [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|Road Race World Championship]] (1983 and 1989) and a three-time winner of the [[Tour de France]] (1986, 1989, and 1990), LeMond is considered by many to be the greatest [[Americans|American]] cyclist of all time. \n\nLeMond began his professional cycling career in 1981. In 1983, he became the first American male cyclist to win the Road World Championship. LeMond won the Tour de France in 1986; he is the first non-European professional cyclist to win the Tour. He was accidentally shot with pellets and seriously injured while hunting in 1987. Following the shooting, he underwent two surgeries and missed the next two Tours. At the [[1989 Tour de France|1989 Tour]], he completed an improbable comeback to win in dramatic fashion on the race's final stage. He successfully defended his Tour title the following year, becoming one of only seven riders to win three or more Tours. LeMond retired from competition in December 1994 and was inducted into the [[United States Bicycling Hall of Fame]] in 1996. He was the first professional cyclist to sign a million-dollar contract and the first cyclist to appear on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''. \n\nDuring his career, LeMond championed several technological advancements in pro cycling, including the introduction of [[Triathlon bars#Triathlon or aero bars|aerodynamic \"triathlon\" handlebars]] and [[Bicycle frame#Carbon fiber|carbon fiber bicycle frames]],<ref name=\"Walsh\">{{cite web|url=http://www.calfeedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cycle-Sport-Feature-Calfee-Design-and-Greg-Lemond.pdf|title=A Meeting of Minds|last=Walsh|first=Matt|work=Cycle Sport|access-date=December 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116012911/http://www.calfeedesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Cycle-Sport-Feature-Calfee-Design-and-Greg-Lemond.pdf|archive-date=November 16, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> which he later marketed through his company [[LeMond Racing Cycles|LeMond Bicycles]].

A two-time winner of the [[UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|Road Race World Championship]] (1983 and 1989) and a three-time winner of the [[Tour de France]] (1986, 1989, and 1990), LeMond is considered by many to be the greatest [[Americans|American]] cyclist of all time. \n\nLeMond began his professional cycling career in 1981. In 1983, he became the first American male cyclist to win the Road World Championship. LeMond won the Tour de France in 1986; he is the first non-European professional cyclist to win the Tour. He was accidentally shot with pellets and seriously injured while hunting in 1987. Following the shooting, he underwent two surgeries and missed the next two Tours. At the [[1989 Tour de France|1989 Tour]], he completed an improbable comeback to win in dramatic fashion on the race's final stage.

He found the record a \"generally a light affair\" from the singer, and felt that the blending of different musical styles made it cohesive sonically. Erlewine concluded by saying that ''Hurts 2B Human'' \"feels stylish and fashionable\" while staying true to the \"emotional gravity\" that Pink has accumulated during her career.<ref name=\"AllMusic\" /> Giving it a rating of \"B\", Maura Johnston of ''Entertainment Weekly'' commented that the optimistic nature of the album makes it enjoyable and relatable, and found [[country pop]] influences that show \"how [Pink's] true-to-life lyrics and soulful bellow can play in Nashville's finest honky-tonks.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\" />\n\nWhile reviewing the album along with [[Lizzo]]'s ''[[Cuz I Love You]]'' (2019), Mikael Wood wrote for ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that ''Hurts 2B Human'' comes off as \"strikingly aligned\", pointing out the songs' messages about \"overcoming obstacles and learning to trust in their abilities\" in contrast to the music of younger artists that approach topics such as depression and [[Substance abuse|drug consumption]].<ref name=\"LA\" /> Chris DeVille of ''Stereogum'' said that the album showcases an artist \"who's found her comfort zone and has successfully grown her music up along with her\", but disapproved the overly emotional songs that provide a feeling of \"mere product\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\" /> Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Sarah Grant characterized the record as \"passionately confessional\" and cited \"Courage\" and \"Happy\" as songs that find Pink at \"[the] most brazen and heartbroken she's ever sounded\", comparing the latter with her second studio album, ''[[Missundaztood]]'' (2001).<ref name=\"rolling\" />\n\nMike Wass of Idolator considered ''Hurts 2B Human'' to be Pink's best album since ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008) and simply described it as \"an accessible pop album for adults.\"<ref name=\"idolator\" /> Both Aimee Cliff of ''[[The Guardian]]'' and Amy O'Connor of ''Irish Times'' awarded the album three out of five stars. Cliff called the ballads that highlight Pink's vocals stand-out moments, but opined that the album fails to give a \"sense of constant evolution\".<ref name=\"guardian\" /> O'Connor shared a similar sentiment, feeling that the formulaic songwriting  was an attempt to replicate the success of ''Beautiful Trauma'' and calling ''Hurts 2B Human'' \"a little too safe to really pack a punch.\" Nevertheless, she commended songs like \"Can We Pretend\" and \"90 Days\", calling the former \"an ideal showcase\" of the singer's personality.<ref name=\"irish\" /> In a mixed review for ''Slant Magazine'', Alexa Camp noted that the collaborations don't manage to \"add much more than mere texture to the proceedings\", but praised the \"otherworldly quality\" of \"90 Days\".<ref name=\"Slant\" />\n\n==Commercial performance==\n\n''Hurts 2B Human'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart of the United States, selling 115,000 [[Album-equivalent unit|album-equivalent units]] in the week ending May 2 according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].

The album features guest appearances by [[Cash Cash]], [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]], [[Chris Stapleton]], and [[Wrabel]]. The album was officially announced during Pink's interview on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' broadcast in February 2019.\n\nMusically, ''Hurts 2B Human'' is a [[Pop music|pop]] record whose lyrics delve into themes of love, family, introspection, life, and self-worth.

Erlewine concluded by saying that ''Hurts 2B Human'' \"feels stylish and fashionable\" while staying true to the \"emotional gravity\" that Pink has accumulated during her career.<ref name=\"AllMusic\" /> Giving it a rating of \"B\", Maura Johnston of ''Entertainment Weekly'' commented that the optimistic nature of the album makes it enjoyable and relatable, and found [[country pop]] influences that show \"how [Pink's] true-to-life lyrics and soulful bellow can play in Nashville's finest honky-tonks.\"<ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\" />\n\nWhile reviewing the album along with [[Lizzo]]'s ''[[Cuz I Love You]]'' (2019), Mikael Wood wrote for ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that ''Hurts 2B Human'' comes off as \"strikingly aligned\", pointing out the songs' messages about \"overcoming obstacles and learning to trust in their abilities\" in contrast to the music of younger artists that approach topics such as depression and [[Substance abuse|drug consumption]].<ref name=\"LA\" /> Chris DeVille of ''Stereogum'' said that the album showcases an artist \"who's found her comfort zone and has successfully grown her music up along with her\", but disapproved the overly emotional songs that provide a feeling of \"mere product\".<ref name=\"Stereogum\" /> Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Sarah Grant characterized the record as \"passionately confessional\" and cited \"Courage\" and \"Happy\" as songs that find Pink at \"[the] most brazen and heartbroken she's ever sounded\", comparing the latter with her second studio album, ''[[Missundaztood]]'' (2001).<ref name=\"rolling\" />\n\nMike Wass of Idolator considered ''Hurts 2B Human'' to be Pink's best album since ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008) and simply described it as \"an accessible pop album for adults.\"<ref name=\"idolator\" /> Both Aimee Cliff of ''[[The Guardian]]'' and Amy O'Connor of ''Irish Times'' awarded the album three out of five stars. Cliff called the ballads that highlight Pink's vocals stand-out moments, but opined that the album fails to give a \"sense of constant evolution\".<ref name=\"guardian\" /> O'Connor shared a similar sentiment, feeling that the formulaic songwriting  was an attempt to replicate the success of ''Beautiful Trauma'' and calling ''Hurts 2B Human'' \"a little too safe to really pack a punch.\" Nevertheless, she commended songs like \"Can We Pretend\" and \"90 Days\", calling the former \"an ideal showcase\" of the singer's personality.<ref name=\"irish\" /> In a mixed review for ''Slant Magazine'', Alexa Camp noted that the collaborations don't manage to \"add much more than mere texture to the proceedings\", but praised the \"otherworldly quality\" of \"90 Days\".<ref name=\"Slant\" />\n\n==Commercial performance==\n\n''Hurts 2B Human'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart of the United States, selling 115,000 [[Album-equivalent unit|album-equivalent units]] in the week ending May 2 according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].
