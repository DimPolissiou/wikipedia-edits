Males, the dominant cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]] and continue to do so in many countries.<ref name = Brit/> Early elections in countries such as the [[Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Elections in the United States|the United States]] were dominated by [[landed gentry|landed]] or [[ruling class]] males.<ref name = Brit/> However, by 1920 all Western European and North American democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider [[women's suffrage]].<ref name = Brit/> Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections (see [[civil rights movement]]).<ref name = Brit/>\n\n==Characteristic==\n\n===Suffrage===\nThe question of who may vote is a central issue in elections. The electorate does not generally include the entire population; for example, many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting, all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting.\n\nIn Australia, Aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 (see [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum entry]]) and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for 3 years or more to vote (a large proportion of which were Aboriginal Australians).\n\nSuffrage is typically only for citizens of the country, though further limits may be imposed.\n\nHowever, in the European Union, one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an EU citizen; the nationality of the country of residence is not required. \n[[File:ElezioneMilano.jpg|thumb|right|Campaigners working on posters in [[Milan]], Italy, 2004]]\nIn some countries, voting is required by law; if an eligible voter does not cast a vote, he or she may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine. In Western Australia, the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a $20.00 fine, which increases to $50.00 if the offender refused to vote prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elections.wa.gov.au/vote/failure-vote|title=Failure to Vote {{!}} Western Australian Electoral Commission|website=www.elections.wa.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===Nomination of candidate===\nA [[representative democracy]] requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office. In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through [[preselection]] processes in organized political parties.<ref>Reuven Hazan, 'Candidate Selection', in Lawrence LeDuc, Richard Niemi and Pippa Norris (eds), ''Comparing Democracies 2'', Sage Publications, London, 2002</ref>\n\nNon-partisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations. In a [[direct democracy]], one type of [[non-partisan democracy]], any eligible person can be nominated. Although elections were used in ancient Athens, in Rome, and in the selection of popes and Holy Roman emperors, the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in Europe and North America beginning in the 17th century. In some systems no nominations take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting\u2014with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement\u2014in the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).\n\nAs far as partisan systems, in some countries, only members of a particular party can be nominated (see [[one-party state]]).  Or, any eligible person can be nominated through a process; thus allowing him or her to be listed.\n\n===Electoral systems===\nElectoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and [[voting system]]s that convert the vote into a political decision. The first step is to tally the votes, for which various [[vote counting systems]] and [[ballot]] types are used. Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either [[Proportional representation|proportional]] or [[majoritarian]].  Among the former are [[party-list proportional representation]] and [[additional member system]].  Among the latter are [[First Past the Post electoral system]] (relative majority) and [[absolute majority]].  Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as [[approval voting]], [[single transferable vote]], [[Instant-runoff voting|instant runoff voting]] or a [[Condorcet method]]; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.\n\nWhile openness and [[accountability]] are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception.  The [[secret ballot]] is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.\n\n===Scheduling===\nThe nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] to continue in office. For that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals. In the United States, elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level, with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office. There is a variety of schedules, for example presidents: the [[President of Ireland]] is elected every seven years, the [[President of Russia]] and the [[President of Finland]] every six years, the [[President of France]] every five years, [[President of the United States]] every four years.\n\nPre-decided or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability. However, they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make [[dissolution of parliament|dissolving the legislature]] (parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at time when dissolution is inconvenient (e.g. when war breaks out). Other states (e.g., the [[United Kingdom]]) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls. In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and choose an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a [[motion of no-confidence]]). This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority.\n\n===Election campaigns===\n{{main|Political campaign}}\nWhen elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns.  Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize [[campaign advertising]]. It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via [[Political Forecasting]] methods.\n\nThe most expensive election campaign included US$7 billion spent on the [[2012 United States presidential election]] and is followed by the US$5 billion spent on the [[2014 Indian general election]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.ndtv.com/elections/article/election-2014/india-s-spend-on-elections-could-challenge-us-record-report-493685\n| title = India's spend on elections could challenge US record: report\n| website = NDTV.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-25\n}}</ref>\n\n===Difficulties with elections===\n[[File:The Presidential Election in Argentina, the Polling-Station at the Church of La Merced, Buenos Ayres.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Buenos Aires]] 1892 \"The rival voters were kept back by an armed force of police out of sight to others. Only batches of two or three were allowed to enter the polling-office at a time. Armed sentries guarded the gates and the doors.\" ([[Godefroy Durand]], ''[[The Graphic]]'', [[21 May]] [[1892]]).]]\n{{main|Electoral fraud|Unfair election}}\n{{see also|Electoral integrity|Foreign electoral intervention}}\n\nIn many of the countries with weak [[rule of law]], the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being \"free and fair\" is interference from the incumbent government. [[Dictator]]s may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc.) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favor of removal. Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election.<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n\nNon-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud, which can result in improper casting or counting of votes. Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections. Problems that prevent an election from being \"free and fair\" take various forms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free and Fair Elections|url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/content/free-and-fair-elections|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=2008}}</ref>\n\n====Lack of open political debate or an informed electorate====\nThe electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of [[freedom of the press]], lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control, and/or lack of access to news and political media. [[Freedom of speech]] may be curtailed by the state, favoring certain viewpoints or state [[propaganda]].\n\n====Unfair rules====\n\n[[Gerrymandering]], exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, needlessly high restrictions on who may be a candidate, like [[ballot access]] rules, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favor a specific faction or candidate. It is named for Massachusetts Governor, Elbridge Gerry who signed a bill that created a partisan district in the [[Boston]] area that was compared to the shape of a [[Salamanders in folklore|mythological salamander]].\n\n====Interference with campaigns====\n{{see also|Foreign electoral intervention}}\nThose in power may arrest or assassinate candidates, suppress or even criminalize campaigning, close campaign headquarters, harass or beat campaign workers, or intimidate voters with violence.

Males, the dominant cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]] and continue to do so in many countries.<ref name = Brit/> Early elections in countries such as the [[Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Elections in the United States|the United States]] were dominated by [[landed gentry|landed]] or [[ruling class]] males.<ref name = Brit/> However, by 1920 all Western European and North American democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider [[women's suffrage]].<ref name = Brit/> Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections (see [[civil rights movement]]).<ref name = Brit/>\n\n==Characteristic==\n\n===Suffrage===\nThe question of who may vote is a central issue in elections. The electorate does not generally include the entire population; for example, many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting, all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting.\n\nIn Australia, Aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 (see [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum entry]]) and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for 3 years or more to vote (a large proportion of which were Aboriginal Australians).\n\nSuffrage is typically only for citizens of the country, though further limits may be imposed.\n\nHowever, in the European Union, one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an EU citizen; the nationality of the country of residence is not required. \n[[File:ElezioneMilano.jpg|thumb|right|Campaigners working on posters in [[Milan]], Italy, 2004]]\nIn some countries, voting is required by law; if an eligible voter does not cast a vote, he or she may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine. In Western Australia, the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a $20.00 fine, which increases to $50.00 if the offender refused to vote prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elections.wa.gov.au/vote/failure-vote|title=Failure to Vote {{!}} Western Australian Electoral Commission|website=www.elections.wa.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===Nomination of candidate===\nA [[representative democracy]] requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office. In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through [[preselection]] processes in organized political parties.<ref>Reuven Hazan, 'Candidate Selection', in Lawrence LeDuc, Richard Niemi and Pippa Norris (eds), ''Comparing Democracies 2'', Sage Publications, London, 2002</ref>\n\nNon-partisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations. In a [[direct democracy]], one type of [[non-partisan democracy]], any eligible person can be nominated. Although elections were used in ancient Athens, in Rome, and in the selection of popes and Holy Roman emperors, the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in Europe and North America beginning in the 17th century. In some systems no nominations take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting\u2014with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement\u2014in the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).\n\nAs far as partisan systems, in some countries, only members of a particular party can be nominated (see [[one-party state]]).  Or, any eligible person can be nominated through a process; thus allowing him or her to be listed.\n\n===Electoral systems===\nElectoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and [[voting system]]s that convert the vote into a political decision. The first step is to tally the votes, for which various [[vote counting systems]] and [[ballot]] types are used. Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either [[Proportional representation|proportional]] or [[majoritarian]].  Among the former are [[party-list proportional representation]] and [[additional member system]].  Among the latter are [[First Past the Post electoral system]] (relative majority) and [[absolute majority]].  Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as [[approval voting]], [[single transferable vote]], [[Instant-runoff voting|instant runoff voting]] or a [[Condorcet method]]; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.\n\nWhile openness and [[accountability]] are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception.  The [[secret ballot]] is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.\n\n===Scheduling===\nThe nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] to continue in office. For that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals. In the United States, elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level, with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office. There is a variety of schedules, for example presidents: the [[President of Ireland]] is elected every seven years, the [[President of Russia]] and the [[President of Finland]] every six years, the [[President of France]] every five years, [[President of the United States]] every four years.\n\nPre-decided or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability. However, they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make [[dissolution of parliament|dissolving the legislature]] (parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at time when dissolution is inconvenient (e.g. when war breaks out). Other states (e.g., the [[United Kingdom]]) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls. In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and choose an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a [[motion of no-confidence]]). This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority.\n\n===Election campaigns===\n{{main|Political campaign}}\nWhen elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns.  Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize [[campaign advertising]]. It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via [[Political Forecasting]] methods.\n\nThe most expensive election campaign included US$7 billion spent on the [[2012 United States presidential election]] and is followed by the US$5 billion spent on the [[2014 Indian general election]].<ref>{{Cite web\n| url = http://www.ndtv.com/elections/article/election-2014/india-s-spend-on-elections-could-challenge-us-record-report-493685\n| title = India's spend on elections could challenge US record: report\n| website = NDTV.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-25\n}}</ref>\n\n===Difficulties with elections===\n[[File:The Presidential Election in Argentina, the Polling-Station at the Church of La Merced, Buenos Ayres.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Buenos Aires]] 1892 \"The rival voters were kept back by an armed force of police out of sight to others. Only batches of two or three were allowed to enter the polling-office at a time. Armed sentries guarded the gates and the doors.\" ([[Godefroy Durand]], ''[[The Graphic]]'', [[21 May]] [[1892]]).]]\n{{main|Electoral fraud|Unfair election}}\n{{see also|Electoral integrity|Foreign electoral intervention}}\n\nIn many of the countries with weak [[rule of law]], the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being \"free and fair\" is interference from the incumbent government. [[Dictator]]s may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc.) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favor of removal. Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election.<ref name=\"Brit\" />\n\nNon-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud, which can result in improper casting or counting of votes. Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections. Problems that prevent an election from being \"free and fair\" take various forms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free and Fair Elections|url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/content/free-and-fair-elections|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=2008}}</ref>\n\n====Lack of open political debate or an informed electorate====\nThe electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of [[freedom of the press]], lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control, and/or lack of access to news and political media. [[Freedom of speech]] may be curtailed by the state, favoring certain viewpoints or state [[propaganda]].\n\n====Unfair rules====\n\n[[Gerrymandering]], exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, needlessly high restrictions on who may be a candidate, like [[ballot access]] rules, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favor a specific faction or candidate.\n\n====Interference with campaigns====\n{{see also|Foreign electoral intervention}}\nThose in power may arrest or assassinate candidates, suppress or even criminalize campaigning, close campaign headquarters, harass or beat campaign workers, or intimidate voters with violence.

This spin serves to [[gyroscope|gyroscopically]] stabilize the projectile by [[conservation of angular momentum]], improving its [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] stability and accuracy over [[smoothbore]] designs.\n\nRifling is often described by its '''twist rate''', which indicates the distance the rifling takes to complete one full revolution, such as \"1 turn in 10&nbsp;inches\" (1:10&nbsp;inches), or \"1 turn in 254&nbsp;mm\" (1:254&nbsp;mm; sometimes expressed as \"1:25.4\"cm, or similar, units usually easily inferred.)  A shorter distance indicates a \"faster\" twist, meaning that for a given velocity the projectile will be rotating at a higher spin rate.\n\nThe combination of length, weight and shape of a projectile determines the twist rate needed to stabilize it &ndash; barrels intended for short, large-diameter projectiles like spherical lead balls require a very low twist rate, such as 1 turn in 48&nbsp;inches (122&nbsp;cm).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/54_caliber_muzzleloader.htm |title=The .54 Caliber Muzzleloader |author=Randy D.

Due to the high cost and great difficulty of precision manufacturing, and the need to load readily and speedily from the muzzle, musket balls were generally a loose fit in the barrels.  Consequently, on firing the balls would often bounce off the sides of the barrel when fired and the final destination after leaving the muzzle was less predictable.  This was countered when accuracy was more important, for example when hunting, by using a tighter-fitting combination of a closer-to-bore-sized ball and a patch.  The accuracy was improved, but still not reliable for precision shooting over long distances.\n\nBarrel rifling was invented in [[Augsburg]], [[Germany]] in 1498.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lrml.org/historical/longrange/history02.htm |title=Long Range Shooting: A Historical Perspective |author=W.

''The Total Gun Manual'' (Canadian edition) (San Francisco: WeldonOwen, 2014), p.5.</ref>  In 1520 August Kotter, an armourer from [[Nuremberg]], improved upon this work.  Though true rifling dates from the mid-16th century, it did not become commonplace until the nineteenth century.\n\nThe concept of stabilizing the flight of a projectile by spinning it was known in the days of bows and arrows, but early firearms using black powder had difficulty with rifling because of the [[fouling]] left behind by the dirty combustion of the powder.  The most successful weapons using rifling with black powder were [[Breech-loading_weapon|breech loaders]] such as the [[Queen Anne pistol]].\n\n===Recent developments===\n\n====Polygonal rifling====\n[[File:Polygonal vs normal rifling.svg|thumb|right|Conventional rifling (left) and [[polygonal rifling]] (right). Both types of rifling use a spiraling pattern.]]\n{{main|Polygonal rifling}}\n[[File:Hammer forged 6-right polygonal rifling pattern.png|thumb|right|The spiraling pattern (here with polygonal rifling) is shown.]]\n\nThe grooves most commonly used in modern rifling have fairly sharp edges. More recently, [[polygonal rifling]], a throwback to the earliest types of rifling, has become popular, especially in [[handgun]]s. Polygonal barrels tend to have longer service lives because the reduction of the sharp edges of the land (the grooves are the spaces that are cut out, and the resulting ridges are called lands) reduces erosion of the barrel. Supporters of polygonal rifling also claim higher velocities and greater accuracy. Polygonal rifling is currently seen on pistols from [[\u010cesk\u00e1 zbrojovka Uhersk\u00fd Brod|CZ]], [[Heckler & Koch]], [[Glock]], [[Tanfoglio]], and [[Kahr Arms]], as well as the [[Desert Eagle]].\n\n====Extended range, full bore====\nFor tanks and artillery pieces, the '''extended range, full bore''' concept developed by [[Gerald Bull]] for the [[GC-45 howitzer]] reverses the normal rifling idea by using a projectile with small fins that ride in the grooves, as opposed to using a projectile with a slightly oversized [[driving band]] which is forced into the grooves. Such guns have achieved significant increases in muzzle velocity and range. Examples include the [[South Africa]]n [[G5 howitzer|G5]] and the [[Germany|German]] [[PzH 2000]].\n\n====Gain-twist rifling====\n{{unreferenced section|date = September 2013}}\nGain-twist rifling, also called progressive rifling, begins with very little change in the projectile's [[angular momentum]] during the first few inches of bullet travel after ignition during the transition from [[chamber (firearms)|chamber]] to '''throat'''. This enables the bullet to remain essentially undisturbed and trued to the case mouth. After engaging the rifling the bullet is progressively subjected to [[accelerate]]d [[angular momentum]] as burning powder propels it down the barrel. By only gradually increasing the spin rate, torque is spread along a much longer section of barrel, rather than only at the throat where rifling is eroded through repeated rifling engagement.\n\nGain-twist rifling was used prior to and during the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365). Colt [[Colt Army Model 1860|Army]] and [[Colt M1861 Navy|Navy]] revolvers both employed gain-twist rifling. Gain-twist rifling, however, is more difficult to produce than uniform rifling, and therefore is more expensive. The military has used gain-twist rifling in a variety of weapons such as the {{val|20|u=mm}} [[M61 Vulcan]] Gatling gun used in some current fighter jets and the larger {{val|30|u=mm}} [[GAU-8 Avenger]] Gatling gun used in the A10 Thunderbolt II close air support jet. In these applications it allows lighter construction of the barrels by decreasing chamber pressures through the use of low initial twist rates but ensuring the projectiles have sufficient stability once they leave the barrel.  It is seldom used in commercially available products, though notably on the [[Smith & Wesson Model 460]] (X-treme Velocity Revolver).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product4_750001_750051_765500_-1_757771_757767_757751_ProductDisplayErrorView_Y|title=Product: Model 460XVR\u2122|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Manufacture==\n[[Image:Canon1.JPG|thumb|200px|Rifling in a French 19th century cannon.]]\n{{further|Internal ballistics}}\nAn early method of introducing rifling to a pre-drilled barrel was to use a cutter mounted on a square-section rod, accurately twisted into a spiral of the desired pitch, mounted in two fixed square-section holes. As the cutter was advanced through the barrel it twisted at a uniform rate governed by the pitch. The first cut was shallow. The cutter points were gradually expanded as repeated cuts were made. The blades were in slots in a wooden [[dowel]] which were gradually packed out with slips of paper until the required depth was obtained. The process was finished off by casting a [[Slug (projectile)|slug]] of molten lead into the barrel, withdrawing it and using it with a paste of [[Emery (rock)|emery]] and oil to smooth the bore.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Henry|title=Engines of War, Or, Historical and Experimental Observations on Ancient and Modern Warlike Machines and Implements|date=1840|publisher=Longman|location=London|pages=108\u2013110|authorlink=|oclc=254626119}}</ref>\n\nMost rifling is created by either:\n*cutting one groove at a time with a [[machine tool|tool]] ('''cut rifling''' or '''single point cut rifling''');\n*cutting all grooves in one pass with a special progressive [[broach (metalwork)|broaching]] bit ('''broached rifling''');\n*[[machine press|pressing]] all grooves at once with a tool called a \"button\" that is pushed or pulled down the barrel ('''button rifling''');\n*[[forge|forging]] the [[gun barrel|barrel]] over a [[mandrel]] containing a reverse image of the rifling, and often the chamber as well ('''hammer forging''');\n*[[Shear forming#Flow forming|flow forming]] the [[gun barrel|barrel]] preform over a [[mandrel]] containing a reverse image of the rifling ('''rifling by flow forming''')\n*Using non-contact forces such as [[chemical reaction]] or [[heat]] from [[laser]] source to [[etch]] the rifling pattern ('''etching rifling''')\n*Machine the rifling grooves texture on a thin metal plate,then fold the plate into the inner bore of the barrel ('''liner rifling''')\n\nThe ''grooves'' are the spaces that are cut out, and the resulting ridges are called ''lands''. These lands and grooves can vary in number, depth, shape, direction of twist (right or left), and twist rate. The spin imparted by rifling significantly improves the stability of the projectile, improving both range and accuracy. Typically rifling is a constant rate down the barrel, usually measured by the length of travel required to produce a single turn. Occasionally firearms are encountered with a ''gain twist'', where the rate of spin increases from chamber to muzzle. While intentional gain twists are rare, due to manufacturing variance, a slight gain twist is in fact fairly common. Since a reduction in twist rate is very detrimental to accuracy, [[gunsmith]]s who are [[machining]] a new barrel from a rifled blank will often measure the twist carefully so they may put the faster rate, no matter how minute the difference is, at the muzzle end.\n\n==Construction and operation==\nA barrel of circular [[Gauge (bore diameter)|bore]] cross-section is not capable of imparting a spin to a projectile, so a rifled barrel has a non-circular cross-section.  Typically the rifled barrel contains one or more grooves that run down its length, giving it a cross-section resembling an [[internal gear]], though it can also take the shape of a [[polygonal rifling|polygon]], usually with rounded corners. Since the barrel is not circular in cross-section, it cannot be accurately described with a single diameter. Rifled bores may be described by the '''bore diameter''' (the diameter across the ''lands'' or high points in the rifling), or by '''groove diameter''' (the diameter across the ''grooves'' or low points in the rifling). Differences in naming conventions for [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] can cause confusion; for example, the projectiles of the [[.303 British]] are actually slightly larger in diameter than the projectiles of the [[.308 Winchester]], because the \".303\" refers to the bore diameter in inches (bullet is .312), while the \".308\" refers to the bullet diameter in inches (7.92&nbsp;mm and 7.82&nbsp;mm, respectively).\n\nDespite differences in form, the common goal of rifling is to deliver the projectile accurately to the target. In addition to imparting the spin to the bullet, the barrel must hold the projectile securely and concentrically as it travels down the barrel. This requires that the rifling meet a number of tasks:<ref name=lilja_accurate />\n*It must be sized so that the projectile will [[swage]] or [[obturate]] upon firing to fill the bore.\n*The diameter should be consistent, and must not increase towards the muzzle.\n*The rifling should be consistent down the length of the bore, without changes in cross-section, such as variations in groove width or spacing.\n*It should be smooth, with no scratches lying perpendicular to the bore, so it does not abrade material from the projectile.\n*The chamber and crown must smoothly transition the projectile into and out of the rifling.\n\nRifling may not begin immediately forward of the chamber. There may be an unrifled throat ahead of the chamber so a cartridge may be chambered without pushing the bullet into the rifling. This reduces the force required to load a cartridge into the chamber, and prevents leaving a bullet stuck in the rifling when an unfired cartridge is removed from the chamber. The specified diameter of the throat may be somewhat greater than groove diameter, and may be enlarged by use if hot powder gas melts the interior barrel surface when the rifle is fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hornady.com/team-hornady/ballistic-calculators/ballistic-resources/internal-ballistics |title=Internal Ballistics |last= |first= |website= |publisher=[[Hornady]] |accessdate=21 June 2018 }}</ref> [[Freebore]] is a groove-diameter length of [[smoothbore]] barrel without lands forward of the throat. Freebore allows the bullet to transition from [[static friction]] to sliding friction and gain linear [[momentum]] prior to encountering the resistance of increasing rotational momentum. Freebore may allow more effective use of propellants by reducing the initial pressure peak during the minimum volume phase of [[internal ballistics]] before the bullet starts moving down the barrel. Barrels with freebore length exceeding the rifled length have been known by a variety of trade names including [[Ball and shot gun|paradox]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicshooting.com/blogs/reading/17662636-definition-of-a-paradox-gun |title=Definition of a Paradox Gun |last=[[Holland & Holland]] |first= |website= |publisher=Classic Shooting Company |accessdate=21 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the projectile is swaged into the rifling, it takes on a mirror image of the rifling, as the lands push into the projectile in a process called ''engraving''. Engraving takes on not only the major features of the bore, such as the lands and grooves, but also minor features, like scratches and tool marks. The relationship between the bore characteristics and the engraving on the projectile are often used in [[forensic ballistics]].\n\n==Fitting the projectile to the bore==\n[[File:7,62x39 bullets - unfired and fired.JPG|right|thumb|57-N-231 standard [[7.62\u00d739mm]] military bullets with steel core - the one on the left is unfired, the one on the right is fired, with the rifling grooves visible.

Whether using a rifled or smooth bore, a good fit was needed to seal the bore and provide the best possible accuracy from the gun. To ease the force required to load the projectile, these early guns used an undersized ball, and a patch made of cloth, paper, or leather to fill the ''windage'' (the gap between the ball and the walls of the bore). The patch provided some degree of sealing, kept the ball seated on the charge of [[black powder]], and kept the ball concentric to the bore. In rifled barrels, the patch also provided a means to transfer the spin from the rifling to the bullet, as the patch is engraved rather than the ball. Until the advent of the hollow-base [[Mini\u00e9 ball]], which obturates upon firing to seal the bore and engage the rifling, the patch provided the best means of getting the projectile to engage the rifling.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Complete Blackpowder Handbook: The Latest Guns and Gear |author=Sam Fadala |publisher=Gun Digest |year=2006 |isbn=0-89689-390-1}} Chapter 18, The Cloth Patch</ref>\n\nIn [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading firearms]], the task of seating the projectile into the rifling is handled by the ''throat'' of the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]]. Next is the ''freebore'', which is the portion of the throat down which the projectile travels before the rifling starts. The last section of the throat is the ''throat angle'', where the throat transitions into the rifled barrel.\n\nThe throat is usually sized slightly larger than the projectile, so the loaded cartridge can be inserted and removed easily, but the throat should be as close as practical to the groove diameter of the barrel. Upon firing, the projectile expands under the pressure from the chamber, and obturates to fit the throat. The bullet then travels down the throat and engages the rifling, where it is engraved, and begins to spin. Engraving the projectile requires a significant amount of force, and in some firearms there is a significant amount of freebore, which helps keep chamber pressures low by allowing the propellant gases to expand before being required to engrave the projectile.

Large diameter bullets provide more stability, as the larger radius provides more [[angular momentum|gyroscopic inertia]], while long bullets are harder to stabilize, as they tend to be very backheavy and the aerodynamic pressures have a longer arm (\"lever\") to act on. The slowest twist rates are found in [[muzzleloading]] firearms meant to fire a round ball; these will have twist rates as low as 1 in {{convert|72|in|cm}}, or slightly longer, although for a typical multi-purpose muzzleloader rifle, a twist rate of 1 in {{convert|48|in|cm}} is very common. The [[M16 rifle|M16A2]] rifle, which is designed to fire the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109 ball and L110 tracer]] bullets, has a 1 in {{convert|7|in|cm|sing=on}} or 32 calibers twist. Civilian [[AR-15]] rifles are commonly found with 1 in {{convert|12|in|cm}} or 54.8 calibers for older rifles and 1 in {{convert|9|in|cm}} or 41.1 calibers for most newer rifles, although some are made with 1 in {{convert|7|in|cm}} or 32 calibers twist rates, the same as used for the M16 rifle. Rifles, which generally fire longer, smaller diameter bullets, will in general have higher twist rates than handguns, which fire shorter, larger diameter bullets.\n\n===Expressing twist rate===\nThere are three methods in use to describe the twist rate:\n\nThe, traditionally speaking, most common method expresses the twist rate in terms of the 'travel' (length) required to complete one full projectile revolution in the rifled barrel. This method does not give an easy or straightforward understanding of whether a twist rate is ''relatively'' slow or fast when bores of different diameters are compared.\n\nThe second method describes the 'rifled travel' required to complete one full projectile revolution in calibers or bore diameters.\n\n<math>{Twist} = \\frac{L}{D_{bore}}</math>\n\nwhere:\n* Twist = twist rate expressed in bore diameters\n* L = the twist length required to complete one full projectile revolution (in mm or in)\n* D<sub>bore</sub> = bore diameter (diameter of the lands, in mm or in)\nNote that the twist travel L and the bore diameter D must be expressed in a consistent unit of measure, i.e. metric (mm) ''or'' imperial (in).\n\nThe third method simply reports the angle of the grooves relative to the bore axis, measured in degrees.\n\nNote that the latter two methods have the inherent advantage of expressing twist rate as a ratio and give an easy understanding if a twist rate is ''relatively'' slow or fast even when comparing bores of differing diameters.\n\n===Twist rate and bullet stability===\nIn 1879, [[George Greenhill]], a professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy (RMA) at Woolwich]], London, UK<ref>School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland. ''Alfred George Greenhill'' (October 2003) .http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Greenhill.html</ref> developed a [[rule of thumb]] for calculating the optimal twist rate for lead-core bullets. This shortcut uses the bullet's length, needing no allowances for weight or nose shape.<ref>Mosdell, Matthew. ''The Greenhill Formula''.http://www.mamut.net/MarkBrooks/newsdet35.htm (Accessed 2009 AUG 19)</ref> The eponymous ''Greenhill Formula'', still used today, is:\n\n<math>Twist = \\frac{C D^2}{L} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{SG}{10.9}}</math>\n\nwhere:\n*C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)\n*D = bullet's diameter in inches\n*L = bullet's length in inches\n*SG = bullet's [[specific gravity]] (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)\n\nThe original value of C was 150, which yields a twist rate in inches per turn, when given the diameter D and the length L of the bullet in inches. This works to velocities of about 840&nbsp;m/s (2800&nbsp;ft/s); above those velocities, a C of 180 should be used. For instance, with a velocity of 600&nbsp;m/s (2000&nbsp;ft/s), a diameter of {{convert|0.5|in|mm}} and a length of {{convert|1.5|in|mm}}, the Greenhill formula would give a value of 25, which means 1 turn in {{convert|25|in|mm}}.\n\nImproved formulas for determining stability and twist rates include the [[Miller Twist Rule]]<ref>Miller, Don.

Once the bullet starts to yaw, any hope of accuracy is lost, as the bullet will begin to veer off in random directions as it [[Precession|precesses]].\n\nConversely, too-high a rate of twist can also cause problems. The excessive twist can cause accelerated barrel wear, and coupled with high velocities also induce a very high spin rate which can cause projectile [[Bullet#Materials|jacket]] ruptures causing high velocity spin stabilized projectiles to disintegrate in flight. Projectiles made out of mono metals cannot practically achieve flight and spin velocities such that they disintegrate in flight due to their spin rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsgroup.co.za/22x64.html|title=GS CUSTOM BULLETS - The 22x64 Experiment|publisher=}}</ref> [[Smokeless powder]] can produce muzzle velocities of approximately {{convert|1600|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for spin stabilized projectiles and more advanced propellants used in [[smoothbore]] tank guns can produce muzzle velocities of approximately {{convert|1800|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.defense-update.com/products/digits/120ke.htm | title=120mm Tank Gun KE Ammunition | publisher=Defense Update | accessdate=2007-09-03 | date=2006-11-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805005735/http://www.defense-update.com/products/digits/120ke.htm | archive-date=2007-08-05 | url-status=dead }}</ref> A higher twist than needed can also cause more subtle problems with accuracy: Any inconsistency within the bullet, such as a void that causes an unequal distribution of mass, may be magnified by the spin.

This spin serves to [[gyroscope|gyroscopically]] stabilize the projectile by [[conservation of angular momentum]], improving its [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] stability and accuracy over [[smoothbore]] designs.\n\nRifling is often described by its '''twist rate''', which indicates the distance the rifling takes to complete one full revolution, such as \"1 turn in 10&nbsp;inches\" (1:10&nbsp;inches), or \"1 turn in 254&nbsp;mm\" (1:254&nbsp;mm; sometimes expressed as \"1:25.4\"cm, or similar, units usually easily inferred.)  A shorter distance indicates a \"faster\" twist, meaning that for a given velocity the projectile will be rotating at a higher spin rate.\n\nThe combination of length, weight and shape of a projectile determines the twist rate needed to stabilize it &ndash; barrels intended for short, large-diameter projectiles like spherical lead balls require a very low twist rate, such as 1 turn in 48&nbsp;inches (122&nbsp;cm).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/54_caliber_muzzleloader.htm |title=The .54 Caliber Muzzleloader |author=Randy D.

Due to the high cost and great difficulty of precision manufacturing, and the need to load readily and speedily from the muzzle, musket balls were generally a loose fit in the barrels.  Consequently, on firing the balls would often bounce off the sides of the barrel when fired and the final destination after leaving the muzzle was less predictable.  This was countered when accuracy was more important, for example when hunting, by using a tighter-fitting combination of a closer-to-bore-sized ball and a patch.  The accuracy was improved, but still not reliable for precision shooting over long distances.\n\nBarrel rifling was invented in [[Augsburg]], [[Germany]] in 1498.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lrml.org/historical/longrange/history02.htm |title=Long Range Shooting: A Historical Perspective |author=W.

''The Total Gun Manual'' (Canadian edition) (San Francisco: WeldonOwen, 2014), p.5.</ref>  In 1520 August Kotter, an armourer from [[Nuremberg]], improved upon this work.  Though true rifling dates from the mid-16th century, it did not become commonplace until the nineteenth century.\n\nThe concept of stabilizing the flight of a projectile by spinning it was known in the days of bows and arrows, but early firearms using black powder had difficulty with rifling because of the [[fouling]] left behind by the dirty combustion of the powder.  The most successful weapons using rifling with black powder were [[Breech-loading_weapon|breech loaders]] such as the [[Queen Anne pistol]].\n\n===Recent developments===\n\n====Polygonal rifling====\n[[File:Polygonal vs normal rifling.svg|thumb|right|Conventional rifling (left) and [[polygonal rifling]] (right). Both types of rifling use a spiraling pattern.]]\n{{main|Polygonal rifling}}\n[[File:Hammer forged 6-right polygonal rifling pattern.png|thumb|right|The spiraling pattern (here with polygonal rifling) is shown.]]\n\nThe grooves most commonly used in modern rifling have fairly sharp edges. More recently, [[polygonal rifling]], a throwback to the earliest types of rifling, has become popular, especially in [[handgun]]s. Polygonal barrels tend to have longer service lives because the reduction of the sharp edges of the land (the grooves are the spaces that are cut out, and the resulting ridges are called lands) reduces erosion of the barrel. Supporters of polygonal rifling also claim higher velocities and greater accuracy. Polygonal rifling is currently seen on pistols from [[\u010cesk\u00e1 zbrojovka Uhersk\u00fd Brod|CZ]], [[Heckler & Koch]], [[Glock]], [[Tanfoglio]], and [[Kahr Arms]], as well as the [[Desert Eagle]].\n\n====Extended range, full bore====\nFor tanks and artillery pieces, the '''extended range, full bore''' concept developed by [[Gerald Bull]] for the [[GC-45 howitzer]] reverses the normal rifling idea by using a projectile with small fins that ride in the grooves, as opposed to using a projectile with a slightly oversized [[driving band]] which is forced into the grooves. Such guns have achieved significant increases in muzzle velocity and range. Examples include the [[South Africa]]n [[G5 howitzer|G5]] and the [[Germany|German]] [[PzH 2000]].\n\n====Gain-twist rifling====\n{{unreferenced section|date = September 2013}}\nGain-twist rifling, also called progressive rifling, begins with very little change in the projectile's [[angular momentum]] during the first few inches of bullet travel after ignition during the transition from [[chamber (firearms)|chamber]] to '''throat'''. This enables the bullet to remain essentially undisturbed and trued to the case mouth. After engaging the rifling the bullet is progressively subjected to [[accelerate]]d [[angular momentum]] as burning powder propels it down the barrel. By only gradually increasing the spin rate, torque is spread along a much longer section of barrel, rather than only at the throat where rifling is eroded through repeated rifling engagement.\n\nGain-twist rifling was used prior to and during the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365). Colt [[Colt Army Model 1860|Army]] and [[Colt M1861 Navy|Navy]] revolvers both employed gain-twist rifling. Gain-twist rifling, however, is more difficult to produce than uniform rifling, and therefore is more expensive. The military has used gain-twist rifling in a variety of weapons such as the {{val|20|u=mm}} [[M61 Vulcan]] Gatling gun used in some current fighter jets and the larger {{val|30|u=mm}} [[GAU-8 Avenger]] Gatling gun used in the A10 Thunderbolt II close air support jet. In these applications it allows lighter construction of the barrels by decreasing chamber pressures through the use of low initial twist rates but ensuring the projectiles have sufficient stability once they leave the barrel.  It is seldom used in commercially available products, though notably on the [[Smith & Wesson Model 460]] (X-treme Velocity Revolver).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product4_750001_750051_765500_-1_757771_757767_757751_ProductDisplayErrorView_Y|title=Product: Model 460XVR\u2122|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Manufacture==\n[[Image:Canon1.JPG|thumb|200px|Rifling in a French 19th century cannon.]]\n{{further|Internal ballistics}}\nAn early method of introducing rifling to a pre-drilled barrel was to use a cutter mounted on a square-section rod, accurately twisted into a spiral of the desired pitch, mounted in two fixed square-section holes. As the cutter was advanced through the barrel it twisted at a uniform rate governed by the pitch. The first cut was shallow. The cutter points were gradually expanded as repeated cuts were made. The blades were in slots in a wooden [[dowel]] which were gradually packed out with slips of paper until the required depth was obtained. The process was finished off by casting a [[Slug (projectile)|slug]] of molten lead into the barrel, withdrawing it and using it with a paste of [[Emery (rock)|emery]] and oil to smooth the bore.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Henry|title=Engines of War, Or, Historical and Experimental Observations on Ancient and Modern Warlike Machines and Implements|date=1840|publisher=Longman|location=London|pages=108\u2013110|authorlink=|oclc=254626119}}</ref>\n\nMost rifling is created by either:\n*cutting one groove at a time with a [[machine tool|tool]] ('''cut rifling''' or '''single point cut rifling''');\n*cutting all grooves in one pass with a special progressive [[broach (metalwork)|broaching]] bit ('''broached rifling''');\n*[[machine press|pressing]] all grooves at once with a tool called a \"button\" that is pushed or pulled down the barrel ('''button rifling''');\n*[[forge|forging]] the [[gun barrel|barrel]] over a [[mandrel]] containing a reverse image of the rifling, and often the chamber as well ('''hammer forging''');\n*[[Shear forming#Flow forming|flow forming]] the [[gun barrel|barrel]] preform over a [[mandrel]] containing a reverse image of the rifling ('''rifling by flow forming''')\n*Using non-contact forces such as [[chemical reaction]] or [[heat]] from [[laser]] source to [[etch]] the rifling pattern ('''etching rifling''')\n*Machine the rifling grooves texture on a thin metal plate,then fold the plate into the inner bore of the barrel ('''liner rifling''')\n\nThe ''grooves'' are the spaces that are cut out, and the resulting ridges are called ''lands''. These lands and grooves can vary in number, depth, shape, direction of twist (right or left), and twist rate. The spin imparted by rifling significantly improves the stability of the projectile, improving both range and accuracy. Typically rifling is a constant rate down the barrel, usually measured by the length of travel required to produce a single turn. Occasionally firearms are encountered with a ''gain twist'', where the rate of spin increases from chamber to muzzle. While intentional gain twists are rare, due to manufacturing variance, a slight gain twist is in fact fairly common. Since a reduction in twist rate is very detrimental to accuracy, [[gunsmith]]s who are [[machining]] a new barrel from a rifled blank will often measure the twist carefully so they may put the faster rate, no matter how minute the difference is, at the muzzle end.\n\n==Construction and operation==\nA barrel of circular [[Gauge (bore diameter)|bore]] cross-section is not capable of imparting a spin to a projectile, so a rifled barrel has a non-circular cross-section.  Typically the rifled barrel contains one or more grooves that run down its length, giving it a cross-section resembling an [[internal gear]], though it can also take the shape of a [[polygonal rifling|polygon]], usually with rounded corners. Since the barrel is not circular in cross-section, it cannot be accurately described with a single diameter. Rifled bores may be described by the '''bore diameter''' (the diameter across the ''lands'' or high points in the rifling), or by '''groove diameter''' (the diameter across the ''grooves'' or low points in the rifling). Differences in naming conventions for [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] can cause confusion; for example, the projectiles of the [[.303 British]] are actually slightly larger in diameter than the projectiles of the [[.308 Winchester]], because the \".303\" refers to the bore diameter in inches (bullet is .312), while the \".308\" refers to the bullet diameter in inches (7.92&nbsp;mm and 7.82&nbsp;mm, respectively).\n\nDespite differences in form, the common goal of rifling is to deliver the projectile accurately to the target. In addition to imparting the spin to the bullet, the barrel must hold the projectile securely and concentrically as it travels down the barrel. This requires that the rifling meet a number of tasks:<ref name=lilja_accurate />\n*It must be sized so that the projectile will [[swage]] or [[obturate]] upon firing to fill the bore.\n*The diameter should be consistent, and must not increase towards the muzzle.\n*The rifling should be consistent down the length of the bore, without changes in cross-section, such as variations in groove width or spacing.\n*It should be smooth, with no scratches lying perpendicular to the bore, so it does not abrade material from the projectile.\n*The chamber and crown must smoothly transition the projectile into and out of the rifling.\n\nRifling may not begin immediately forward of the chamber. There may be an unrifled throat ahead of the chamber so a cartridge may be chambered without pushing the bullet into the rifling. This reduces the force required to load a cartridge into the chamber, and prevents leaving a bullet stuck in the rifling when an unfired cartridge is removed from the chamber. The specified diameter of the throat may be somewhat greater than groove diameter, and may be enlarged by use if hot powder gas melts the interior barrel surface when the rifle is fired.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hornady.com/team-hornady/ballistic-calculators/ballistic-resources/internal-ballistics |title=Internal Ballistics |last= |first= |website= |publisher=[[Hornady]] |accessdate=21 June 2018 }}</ref> [[Freebore]] is a groove-diameter length of [[smoothbore]] barrel without lands forward of the throat. Freebore allows the bullet to transition from [[static friction]] to sliding friction and gain linear [[momentum]] prior to encountering the resistance of increasing rotational momentum. Freebore may allow more effective use of propellants by reducing the initial pressure peak during the minimum volume phase of [[internal ballistics]] before the bullet starts moving down the barrel. Barrels with freebore length exceeding the rifled length have been known by a variety of trade names including [[Ball and shot gun|paradox]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicshooting.com/blogs/reading/17662636-definition-of-a-paradox-gun |title=Definition of a Paradox Gun |last=[[Holland & Holland]] |first= |website= |publisher=Classic Shooting Company |accessdate=21 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nWhen the projectile is swaged into the rifling, it takes on a mirror image of the rifling, as the lands push into the projectile in a process called ''engraving''. Engraving takes on not only the major features of the bore, such as the lands and grooves, but also minor features, like scratches and tool marks. The relationship between the bore characteristics and the engraving on the projectile are often used in [[forensic ballistics]].\n\n==Fitting the projectile to the bore==\n[[File:7,62x39 bullets - unfired and fired.JPG|right|thumb|57-N-231 standard [[7.62\u00d739mm]] military bullets with steel core - the one on the left is unfired, the one on the right is fired, with the rifling grooves visible.

Whether using a rifled or smooth bore, a good fit was needed to seal the bore and provide the best possible accuracy from the gun. To ease the force required to load the projectile, these early guns used an undersized ball, and a patch made of cloth, paper, or leather to fill the ''windage'' (the gap between the ball and the walls of the bore). The patch provided some degree of sealing, kept the ball seated on the charge of [[black powder]], and kept the ball concentric to the bore. In rifled barrels, the patch also provided a means to transfer the spin from the rifling to the bullet, as the patch is engraved rather than the ball. Until the advent of the hollow-base [[Mini\u00e9 ball]], which obturates upon firing to seal the bore and engage the rifling, the patch provided the best means of getting the projectile to engage the rifling.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Complete Blackpowder Handbook: The Latest Guns and Gear |author=Sam Fadala |publisher=Gun Digest |year=2006 |isbn=0-89689-390-1}} Chapter 18, The Cloth Patch</ref>\n\nIn [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading firearms]], the task of seating the projectile into the rifling is handled by the ''throat'' of the [[Chamber (firearms)|chamber]]. Next is the ''freebore'', which is the portion of the throat down which the projectile travels before the rifling starts. The last section of the throat is the ''throat angle'', where the throat transitions into the rifled barrel.\n\nThe throat is usually sized slightly larger than the projectile, so the loaded cartridge can be inserted and removed easily, but the throat should be as close as practical to the groove diameter of the barrel. Upon firing, the projectile expands under the pressure from the chamber, and obturates to fit the throat. The bullet then travels down the throat and engages the rifling, where it is engraved, and begins to spin. Engraving the projectile requires a significant amount of force, and in some firearms there is a significant amount of freebore, which helps keep chamber pressures low by allowing the propellant gases to expand before being required to engrave the projectile. Minimizing freebore improves accuracy by decreasing the chance that a projectile will distort before entering the rifling.<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook for Shooters & Reloaders Volume II |author=P.

Large diameter bullets provide more stability, as the larger radius provides more [[angular momentum|gyroscopic inertia]], while long bullets are harder to stabilize, as they tend to be very backheavy and the aerodynamic pressures have a longer arm (\"lever\") to act on. The slowest twist rates are found in [[muzzleloading]] firearms meant to fire a round ball; these will have twist rates as low as 1 in {{convert|72|in|cm}}, or slightly longer, although for a typical multi-purpose muzzleloader rifle, a twist rate of 1 in {{convert|48|in|cm}} is very common. The [[M16 rifle|M16A2]] rifle, which is designed to fire the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109 ball and L110 tracer]] bullets, has a 1 in {{convert|7|in|cm|sing=on}} or 32 calibers twist. Civilian [[AR-15]] rifles are commonly found with 1 in {{convert|12|in|cm}} or 54.8 calibers for older rifles and 1 in {{convert|9|in|cm}} or 41.1 calibers for most newer rifles, although some are made with 1 in {{convert|7|in|cm}} or 32 calibers twist rates, the same as used for the M16 rifle. Rifles, which generally fire longer, smaller diameter bullets, will in general have higher twist rates than handguns, which fire shorter, larger diameter bullets.\n\n===Expressing twist rate===\nThere are three methods in use to describe the twist rate:\n\nThe, traditionally speaking, most common method expresses the twist rate in terms of the 'travel' (length) required to complete one full projectile revolution in the rifled barrel. This method does not give an easy or straightforward understanding of whether a twist rate is ''relatively'' slow or fast when bores of different diameters are compared.\n\nThe second method describes the 'rifled travel' required to complete one full projectile revolution in calibers or bore diameters.\n\n<math>{Twist} = \\frac{L}{D_{bore}}</math>\n\nwhere:\n* Twist = twist rate expressed in bore diameters\n* L = the twist length required to complete one full projectile revolution (in mm or in)\n* D<sub>bore</sub> = bore diameter (diameter of the lands, in mm or in)\nNote that the twist travel L and the bore diameter D must be expressed in a consistent unit of measure, i.e. metric (mm) ''or'' imperial (in).\n\nThe third method simply reports the angle of the grooves relative to the bore axis, measured in degrees.\n\nNote that the latter two methods have the inherent advantage of expressing twist rate as a ratio and give an easy understanding if a twist rate is ''relatively'' slow or fast even when comparing bores of differing diameters.\n\n===Twist rate and bullet stability===\nIn 1879, [[George Greenhill]], a professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy (RMA) at Woolwich]], London, UK<ref>School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland. ''Alfred George Greenhill'' (October 2003) .http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Greenhill.html</ref> developed a [[rule of thumb]] for calculating the optimal twist rate for lead-core bullets. This shortcut uses the bullet's length, needing no allowances for weight or nose shape.<ref>Mosdell, Matthew. ''The Greenhill Formula''.http://www.mamut.net/MarkBrooks/newsdet35.htm (Accessed 2009 AUG 19)</ref> The eponymous ''Greenhill Formula'', still used today, is:\n\n<math>Twist = \\frac{C D^2}{L} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{SG}{10.9}}</math>\n\nwhere:\n*C = 150 (use 180 for muzzle velocities higher than 2,800 f/s)\n*D = bullet's diameter in inches\n*L = bullet's length in inches\n*SG = bullet's [[specific gravity]] (10.9 for lead-core bullets, which cancels out the second half of the equation)\n\nThe original value of C was 150, which yields a twist rate in inches per turn, when given the diameter D and the length L of the bullet in inches. This works to velocities of about 840&nbsp;m/s (2800&nbsp;ft/s); above those velocities, a C of 180 should be used. For instance, with a velocity of 600&nbsp;m/s (2000&nbsp;ft/s), a diameter of {{convert|0.5|in|mm}} and a length of {{convert|1.5|in|mm}}, the Greenhill formula would give a value of 25, which means 1 turn in {{convert|25|in|mm}}.\n\nImproved formulas for determining stability and twist rates include the [[Miller Twist Rule]]<ref>Miller, Don. ''[http://www.jbmballistics.com/bibliography/articles/miller_stability_2.pdf How Good Are Simple Rules For Estimating Rifling Twist]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', Precision Shooting - June 2009</ref> and the [[McGyro]] program<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jbmballistics.com/ballistics/downloads/text/mcgyro.txt |type=BASIC |format=TXT |title=McGyro |author=R.

Once the bullet starts to yaw, any hope of accuracy is lost, as the bullet will begin to veer off in random directions as it [[Precession|precesses]].\n\nConversely, too-high a rate of twist can also cause problems. The excessive twist can cause accelerated barrel wear, and coupled with high velocities also induce a very high spin rate which can cause projectile [[Bullet#Materials|jacket]] ruptures causing high velocity spin stabilized projectiles to disintegrate in flight. Projectiles made out of mono metals cannot practically achieve flight and spin velocities such that they disintegrate in flight due to their spin rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsgroup.co.za/22x64.html|title=GS CUSTOM BULLETS - The 22x64 Experiment|publisher=}}</ref> [[Smokeless powder]] can produce muzzle velocities of approximately {{convert|1600|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}} for spin stabilized projectiles and more advanced propellants used in [[smoothbore]] tank guns can produce muzzle velocities of approximately {{convert|1800|m/s|ft/s|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.defense-update.com/products/digits/120ke.htm | title=120mm Tank Gun KE Ammunition | publisher=Defense Update | accessdate=2007-09-03 | date=2006-11-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805005735/http://www.defense-update.com/products/digits/120ke.htm | archive-date=2007-08-05 | url-status=dead }}</ref> A higher twist than needed can also cause more subtle problems with accuracy: Any inconsistency within the bullet, such as a void that causes an unequal distribution of mass, may be magnified by the spin. Undersized bullets also have problems, as they may not enter the rifling exactly [[concentric]] and [[coaxial]] to the bore, and excess twist will exacerbate the accuracy problems this causes.\n\n=== Bullet spin ===\nA bullet fired from a rifled barrel can spin at over 300,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] (5 [[kHz]]), depending on the bullet's [[muzzle velocity]] and the barrel's [[twist rate]].\n\nThe general definition of the spin <math>S</math> of an object rotating around a single axis can be written as\n\n:<math>S = \\frac{\\upsilon}{C}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\upsilon</math> is the linear [[velocity]] of a point in the rotating object (in units of distance/time) and <math>C</math> refers to the circumference of the circle that this measuring point performs around the axis of rotation.\n\nA bullet that matches the rifling of the firing barrel will exit that barrel with a spin\n\n:<math>S = \\frac{\\upsilon_0}{L}</math>\nwhere <math>\\upsilon_0</math> is the muzzle velocity and <math>L</math> is the twist rate.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://accurateshooter.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/calculating-bullet-rpm-spin-rates-and-stability/ |title= Calculating Bullet RPM |date= 3 June 2008 |accessdate= 4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nFor example, an M4 Carbine with a twist rate of 1 in {{convert|7|in|mm|1}} and a muzzle velocity of {{convert|3050|ft/s|m/s|0}} will give the bullet a spin of 930&nbsp;m/s / 0.1778 m = 5.2&nbsp;kHz (314,000 rpm).\n\nExcessive rotational speed can exceed the bullet's designed limits and the resulting centrifugal force can cause the bullet to disintegrate radially during flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loadammo.com/Topics/July01.htm |title=Twist Rate |date=18 August 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512015023/http://www.loadammo.com/Topics/July01.htm |archivedate=May 12, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{|\n| valign=top |\n*[[Rifle]]\n*[[Smoothbore]]\n*[[Paradox gun]]\n*[[Comparison microscope]] {{ns|23}}\n| valign=top |\n*[[Gun barrel sequence]] in ''James Bond'' films\n*[[Greenhill formula]]\n*[[Glossary of firearms terminology]]\n*[[Miller twist rate]]\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Rifling}}\n*[http://www.lasc.us/RangingShotBarrelMakingFeature.htm Article] on barrel making from an [[IHMSA]] shooter\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060621103003/http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/barrel_making/making_rifle_barrel.htm Article] on barrel making from Lilja, a maker of world class competition barrels\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060721153551/http://www.riflebarrels.com/articles/barrel_making/twist_machine.htm Article] on making and measuring rifling by Lilja; includes pictures of button rifling machine\n*[http://entrustmt.com/services/rifle-barrel-blanks/rifle-barrel-blank-manufacturing/ Article] on rifle barrel manufacturing process including gundrilling, reaming, rifling, and finishing\n*[http://www.6mmbr.citymaker.com/barrelFAQ.html 6mmBR article] on barrels\n*[http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinSlug.htm Bore slugging tutorial], explaining now to determine the true bore and groove size and choose appropriate bullet diameters\n*[http://accurateshooter.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/calculating-bullet-rpm-spin-rates-and-stability/ Calculating Bullet RPM \u2014 Spin Rates And Stability]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081956/http://lothar-walther.de/brcms/pdf/2103.pdf Common rifling dimensions of revolver, pistol and rifle ammunition]\n\n=== Calculators for stability and twist ===\n*[http://kwk.us/twist.html Bowman-Howell Twist Rate Calculator]\n*[http://www.jbmballistics.com/cgi-bin/jbmstab-5.1.cgi Miller Formula Calculator]\n*[http://www.jbmballistics.com/cgi-bin/jbmdrag-5.1.cgi Drag/Twist Calculator based on Bob McCoy's \"McGyro\" algorithm]\n\n[[Category:Artillery components]]\n[[Category:Firearm components]]\n[[Category:1498 introductions]]\n", "name_user": "2605:e000:1701:9341:b96f:90f6:1d47:3d0d", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifling"}
