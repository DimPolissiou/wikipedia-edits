He later became a pundit and commentator for [[BT Sport]], regularly working on their coverage of Scottish football. He is now also a pundit and occasional match co-commentator on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].\n\nHe played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1991 to 2007 for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Sutton scored over 150 career goals in over 400 league appearances spanning 16 years in the [[Premier League|English]] and [[Scottish Premier League]]s. He was [[cap (football)|capped]] once by [[England national football team|England]].\n\nSutton played principally in midfield or attack, although usually in the latter role as a striker. A very physical player, Sutton was a fairly prolific goalscorer throughout his career and was joint top goalscorer (with [[Dion Dublin]] and [[Michael Owen]]) in the [[FA Premier League 1997\u201398]] season. He was also known as being one of the foremost exponents of the glancing header. He scored many goals with this technique which made him particularly effective from set-pieces.\n\nIn September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], but he resigned due to personal reasons twelve months later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/lincoln_city/9043871.stm |title=Manager Chris Sutton leaves Lincoln City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2012, he came out of retirement briefly and featured for non-league [[Wroxham F.C.|Wroxham]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/276490/Former-England-striker-Chris-Sutton-comes-out-of-retirement|title=Former England striker Chris Sutton comes out of retirement|date=11 October 2012|work=Dailystar.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Norwich City (1991\u20131994)===\nHe started his career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], initially as a centre-half before being converted into a striker by manager [[Dave Stringer]].

He later became a pundit and commentator for [[BT Sport]], regularly working on their coverage of Scottish football. He is now also a pundit and occasional match co-commentator on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].\n\nHe played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1991 to 2007 for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Sutton scored over 150 career goals in over 400 league appearances spanning 16 years in the [[Premier League|English]] and [[Scottish Premier League]]s. He was [[cap (football)|capped]] once by [[England national football team|England]].\n\nSutton played principally in midfield or attack, although usually in the latter role as a striker. A very physical player, Sutton was a fairly prolific goalscorer throughout his career and was joint top goalscorer (with [[Dion Dublin]] and [[Michael Owen]]) in the [[FA Premier League 1997\u201398]] season. He was also known as being one of the foremost exponents of the glancing header. He scored many goals with this technique which made him particularly effective from set-pieces.\n\nIn September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], but he resigned due to personal reasons twelve months later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/lincoln_city/9043871.stm |title=Manager Chris Sutton leaves Lincoln City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2012, he came out of retirement briefly and featured for non-league [[Wroxham F.C.|Wroxham]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/276490/Former-England-striker-Chris-Sutton-comes-out-of-retirement|title=Former England striker Chris Sutton comes out of retirement|date=11 October 2012|work=Dailystar.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Norwich City (1991\u20131994)===\nHe started his career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], initially as a centre-half before being converted into a striker by manager [[Dave Stringer]].

Late in the game with the \"Gunners\" leading by a single goal, the ball was kicked out of play by Arsenal to allow an injured teammate to receive treatment. Under the unwritten sportsmanship rule, Arsenal would expect the ball to be returned to them unhindered. However, Sutton chased the ball instead of allowing it to be thrown back to Arsenal and won a corner from his efforts. Blackburn scored from this corner and as a result Arsenal missed out on a lucrative place in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on [[goal difference]].

Despite Ursula's disapproval, the teenage Patricia becomes romantically involved with Marcos ([[Jos\u00e9 Guillermo Cortines]]), a poor farm hand\u2014but the relationship comes to a tragic end when he is mortally wounded. Years later, still marked by the loss of Marcos, Patricia has become a bitter woman whose heart is closed to love, and has drowned her sorrow by devoting all her time to managing the family ranch as strictly as her grandmother. Patricia's, her sister's and David's father is the evil man Bruno Montesinos ([[Marcelo Buquet]]). Virginia's father is Alejandro (Fernando Carrera).\n\nThe arrival of the handsome, charming, and self-assured foreman just hired at the ranch, Armando Marcano ([[Guy Ecker]]), drastically changes Patricia's life. Armando has a sister, Rebecca. While at first Patricia fights hard against the feelings he inspires in her, rejecting him, passion ends up taking over both of them and Patricia falls deeply in love. But once again, happiness will not be easy to achieve. Aside from facing her grandmother's opposition to her relationship with someone she considers beneath her, Patricia is up against a formidable rival: her beautiful and wicked cousin Fedora (Jessica Mass), who wants Armando for herself. The situation becomes even more difficult when Marcos suddenly reappears, very much alive and now a rich, ruthless man who'll stop at nothing to get Patricia back.\n\nVirginia is in love with professor Ricardo Rey ([[Luis Jose Santander]]) but he is married to drunkard Sonia and they have two children. Mariela is in love with Ramiro Melendez (Carlos Augusto Maldonado). Sonia commits suicide. Bruno rapes Virginia. Patricia marries Alejandro but Marcos kills him; she is suspected of the murder. Marcos and Fedora team up against Patricia and Armando. Ursula has a friend whose niece is lawyer Leticia Bracamontes ([[Marjorie de Sousa]]). She decides to be Patricia's lawyer. David marries Rebeca and they have a daughter.\n\nRicardo Rey starts dating Graciela ([[Patty Alvarez]]), an ex-guardian at a prison from [[Mexico]], doctor Alvaro's ex-fianc\u00e9e. Fedora and Bruno kidnap Rebeca and her small daughter. Armando and David try to save them. Fedora hits Armando in the head; she advises him to go to the swamps area and cross the border. They leave David with his daughter and they take Rebecca and Armando as their hostages. Bruno is attacked. Fedora and Armando manage to escape. Marcos has illusions that he sees Satan and he almost kills his mother. He is committed at a mental hospital. The evil Teresa Rivas Gomez ([[Gabriela Rivero]]) ends up paralyzed and Virginia lets her stay in her house.\n\nMarcos admits that it was he who killed Alejandro. Leticia reveals Ricardo that, in the past, she wanted to have Graciela sentenced to life imprisonment because while she was guardian at a prison from Mexico she received millions from a very strong person to kill an inmate; Graciela decided to burn down the prison not to leave traces and 300 women died. Graciela has an accident, ends up in hospital and forces Ricardo to marry her. Virginia is imprisoned and she finds out that she is pregnant with Bruno's baby.\n\nFedora cuts Patricia's face with a knife and, as a result, Patricia wants to break off with Armando. Fedora helps Bruno get out of the hospital. Leticia falls in love with Armando. Graciela wants to burn Virginia but both of them are traped in a room by Teresa Rivas Gomez. Ricardo wants to save them but Teresa hits him in the head. Graciela dies impaled.\n\nBoth Fedora and Bruno are killed by Marcos.

It did not add other glyphs on the parts that cannot be seen on the 2D logo, but used that space to include small logos of the sister projects and information about Wikimania. A variant of that model was used to build a person-sized Wikiball that spun on a stand, featured during the event.<ref>It was torn down after the event. See [[:Commons:Category:Wikimania 2007 Wikiball|this Category of Commons images]] for a sense of its size.</ref> This led to a renewed interest in getting a proper 3D model for the logo.\n\n[[File:Wikimania 2007 puzzle ball.jpg|thumb|The 3D Wikipedia puzzle from Wikimania 2007]]\n\nBy 2007, users on [[listserv]]s discovered that the logo had some minor errors. The errors were not immediately fixed, because, according to Friedland, he could not locate the original project file. Friedland added that \"I have tried to reconstruct it, but it never looks right\" and that the logo \"should be redrawn by a professional illustrator.\"<ref name=\"NYT-20070625\"/> {{nihongo|Kizu Naoko|\u6728\u6d25 \u5c1a\u5b50}}<!--Leave name in Japanese order for now, pending dispute discussion-->, a Wikipedian, said that most Japanese users supported correcting the errors.

Most people don't take it serious{{sic}} and think the graphical logo is a sort of [[pot-au-feu]] of various letters without meaning.\"<ref name=\"NYT-20070625\"/>\n\nIn late 2009, the Wikimedia Foundation undertook to fix the errors and generally update the puzzle globe logo.

It features the new 3D rendering of the puzzle globe, with corrected characters (and the [[Klingon language|Klingon]] character replaced by a [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez]] character). The [[wordmark]] has been modified from the [[Hoefler Text]] font to the open-source [[Linux Libertine]] font, and the subtitle is no longer italicized. The \"W\" character, which was used in various other places in Wikipedia (such as the [[favicon]]) and was a \"distinctive part of the Wikipedia brand\", was stylized as crossed V's in the original logo, <span style=\"font-family:Garamond, Adobe Garamond Pro, Warnock, Warnock Pro, Bondoni, Bondoni MT, Goudy Old Style, Musica, serif\">{{angbr|W}}</span>, while the W in Linux Libertine is rendered with a single line.

It did not add other glyphs on the parts that cannot be seen on the 2D logo, but used that space to include small logos of the sister projects and information about Wikimania.

It features the new 3D rendering of the puzzle globe, with corrected characters (and the [[Klingon language|Klingon]] character replaced by a [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez]] character). The [[wordmark]] has been modified from the [[Hoefler Text]] font to the open-source [[Linux Libertine]] font, and the subtitle is no longer italicized.

The league's focus is to improve national soccer talent and the sport in Canada, with several rules in place to ensure this. These include a minimum quota of Canadian players on team rosters and starting line-ups, requirements for domestic under-21 players, and a university draft. \n\nThe league's first season included seven teams, while an eighth, [[Atl\u00e9tico Ottawa]], joined for the second season in 2020.

As the population grew to 20 by 1898, the settlement was now served by its own post office and the town was named Deerfield for the deer that grazed along the river.\n\nBy the early 20th century, as the town's population continued to grow, the [[Florida East Coast Railroad]] constructed tracks en route to Miami bisecting Deerfield. Deerfield's early settlers were mostly farmers who grew pineapples, tomatoes, green beans, squash and fished along the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]. Deerfield remained a largely agricultural community, but in 1939 the town's name was changed to Deerfield Beach to let tourists know it has a beach.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deerfield-beach.com/documents/Budget/APPROVED%20web%20version.PDF|title=City of Deerfield Beach 2010/2011 Approved Budget|publisher=City of Deerfield Beach|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205130941/http://www.deerfield-beach.com/documents/Budget/APPROVED%20web%20version.PDF|archivedate=2010-12-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> In 1952, the original Deerfield Beach Pier was built of wood.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deerfieldbeachhistoricalsociety.com/52-25/|title=52 Deerfield Moments: #25 - The First Deerfield Pier - Deerfield Beach Historical Society|date=2015-05-05|work=Deerfield Beach Historical Society|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 256\n|1920= 437\n|1930= 1483\n|1940= 1850\n|1950= 2088\n|1960= 9573\n|1970= 17130\n|1980= 39193\n|1990= 46997\n|2000= 64583\n|2010= 75018\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=80863\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: center; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 90%;\" \n!colspan=4|Deerfield Beach demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Deerfield Beach||Broward County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||75,018||1,748,066||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||+16.2%||+7.7%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||4,972.3/sq&nbsp;mi||1,444.9/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||65.8%||63.1%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||56.0%||43.5%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||25.6%||26.7%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||14.2%||25.1%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||1.5%||3.2%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.2%||0.3%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.0%||0.1%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (multiracial)]]||2.7%||2.9%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some other race]]||4.2%||3.7%||3.6%\n|}\n\n{{as of|2010}}, there were 42,671 households, of which 21.8% were vacant. {{as of|2000}}, 16.3% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.2% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.9% were non-families. 40.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 22.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

As the population grew to 20 by 1898, the settlement was now served by its own post office and the town was named Deerfield for the deer that grazed along the river.\n\nBy the early 20th century, as the town's population continued to grow, the [[Florida East Coast Railroad]] constructed tracks en route to Miami bisecting Deerfield. Deerfield's early settlers were mostly farmers who grew pineapples, tomatoes, green beans, squash and fished along the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]. Deerfield remained a largely agricultural community, but in 1939 the town's name was changed to Deerfield Beach to let tourists know it has a beach.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deerfield-beach.com/documents/Budget/APPROVED%20web%20version.PDF|title=City of Deerfield Beach 2010/2011 Approved Budget|publisher=City of Deerfield Beach|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205130941/http://www.deerfield-beach.com/documents/Budget/APPROVED%20web%20version.PDF|archivedate=2010-12-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> In 1952, the original Deerfield Beach Pier was built of wood.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deerfieldbeachhistoricalsociety.com/52-25/|title=52 Deerfield Moments: #25 - The First Deerfield Pier - Deerfield Beach Historical Society|date=2015-05-05|work=Deerfield Beach Historical Society|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 256\n|1920= 437\n|1930= 1483\n|1940= 1850\n|1950= 2088\n|1960= 9573\n|1970= 17130\n|1980= 39193\n|1990= 46997\n|2000= 64583\n|2010= 75018\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=80863\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: center; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 90%;\" \n!colspan=4|Deerfield Beach demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Deerfield Beach||Broward County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||75,018||1,748,066||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||+16.2%||+7.7%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||4,972.3/sq&nbsp;mi||1,444.9/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||65.8%||63.1%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||56.0%||43.5%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||25.6%||26.7%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||14.2%||25.1%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||1.5%||3.2%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.2%||0.3%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.0%||0.1%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (multiracial)]]||2.7%||2.9%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some other race]]||4.2%||3.7%||3.6%\n|}\n\n{{as of|2010}}, there were 42,671 households, of which 21.8% were vacant. {{as of|2000}}, 16.3% of households had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.2% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 48.9% were non-families. 40.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 22.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\".<ref name=\"SOTS\" /> It was influential in development of the federal government of the United States (see [[Connecticut Compromise]]).\n\nThe Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton).

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore]] presides.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

Despite this and the fact that Philip was her father's first cousin, the announcement of the marriage agreement was not well received at the French court, as there was little chance that Philip would become king of Spain, and that only a marriage with a crown prince or a king was deemed  worthy of a princess of France.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> The barrister Barbier wrote in his diary \"It seems extraordinary that the eldest Daughter of France is not marrying a crowned head\",<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> and d'Argenson speculated that the marriage was arranged only because of a plan to make Don Philip king of Naples and Sicily.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> \u00c9lisabeth herself \"considered her destiny to be less glorious than she had the right to expect\", and when she was asked if she would not feel pleased to be called Infanta, her face reportedly \"contracted into a scornful grimace\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nThe twelve-year-old \u00c9lisabeth was married by proxy in Versailles on 26 August 1739, and thereafter known as ''Madame Infanta'' in France. In September, she left for Spain, and the king was reportedly so moved that he entered her carriage and accompanied her for the first miles on her journey. She passed the border and met her nineteen-year-old husband some thirty kilometers northeast of [[Madrid]], at [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where the marriage ceremony took place on 25 October 1739.\n\n===Infanta of Spain===\n\u00c9lisabeth made a personal success upon her arrival in Spain and was soon the \"idol of Madrid\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> She made a favorable impression on her father-in-law, king Philip V, and upon her spouse, prince Philip. Her relationship with her mother-in-law, the domineering queen [[Elisabeth of Parma]], however, soon became one of mutual dislike. The queen was displeased over the fact that \u00c9lisabeth's dowry was not paid by France, nor did France assist Spain in the war with Britain;<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> further more, after about six months the queen reportedly realized that she would not be able to control or dominate \u00c9lisabeth, as she was accustomed to do with her husband and son, and that her daughter-in-law could potentially replace her own influence over her son.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> As a result, Elisabeth spent most of her time away from the Queen, playing with dolls and wrote of her unhappiness to her father.\n\n[[File:Marie Louise Elisabeth De France, Duchess of Parma by Jean Marc Nattier and Studio.jpg|thumb|\u00c9lisabeth in hunting dress, by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]].]]\n\n\u00c9lisabeth soon came to dominate Philip; though he was eight years her senior, he, as his father, was reportedly of a timid, passive and submissive nature, and \u00c9lisabeth reportedly felt affection for him but generally treated him as \"a boy much younger than herself although he was her senior by eight years\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> de Luynes later observed: \"Although the Prince at twenty-eight is as much of a child as he was at fourteen or fifteen, he has, nevertheless, an affectionate regard for the Infanta.\"<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n\u00c9lisabeth is described as \"keen, ambitious and enterprising, untiring in her energies and passionately fond of her changing Europe to the advantage of her House, of imbuing everyone with a love for France and of making her son a prince worthy of his great French forefathers\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nShe was not satisfied with her powerless position as the spouse of a prince with no prospects of being queen at the Spanish courts; she kept in contact with the French court through correspondence, in particular with her twin, informed her brother the Dauphin of all events at the Spanish court, and had already by 1740 established a net of contacts at the French court to assist her in her ambition to obtain an independent power position for herself and her spouse, \"worthy of the birth of both\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Her twin Henriette, otherwise regarded as habitually apathetic of politics and gentle, was reportedly passionately devoted to work for the political ambition of her elder twin \u00c9lisabeth, as did her younger sister Adelaide and her sister-in-law [[Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain]]; the powerful Noailles and [[Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ph\u00e9lypeaux, Count of Maurepas]] allied with the queen to achieve the same, and the French ambassador at Madrid, Monseigneur Vaurdal, Archbishop of Reims, was reportedly so willing to be of assistance that he was ridiculed for it.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nIn 1741, Philip was called to serve in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], through which it was hoped that he would be able to secure one of the duchies of Northern Italy.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Her mother-in-law Queen Elisabeth reportedly made sure that Philip stayed in camp for almost all of the War, separated from his wife, in order to prevent her from replacing his mother in his affection; through their correspondence, the queen repeatedly asked her son if he loved his wife: \"I want to know if you love . : [the sign which Elisabeth Farnese used to denote her daughter-in-law when writing to her son] Tell me the truth!\"<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Despite the mutual antipathy between \u00c9lisabeth and her mother-in-law the queen, however, they were in fact united in their ambition and work to provide prince Philip with an independent power position.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nDuring the war, Queen Elisabeth worked to secure her son Philip a throne in Italy, at the same time as her daughter-in-law used all her resources of her net of contacts to do the same. They succeeded in their common ambition in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]], when Philip was made ruler of the Duchy of Parma.\n\n===Duchess of Parma===\n[[File:Louise Elisabeth of France Parma5.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Louise \u00c9lisabeth by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]], c. 1754.]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]] which ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa]] had to cede the duchies of Parma, [[Piacenza]] and [[Guastalla]] to Ferdinand VI of Spain.

However, she felt it necessary to obtain a substantial income of their own rather than to be solely provided for by Spain, as that would in practice make them but vassals of Spain, and therefore left Madrid for the French court with the ambition to secure an income to Parma from her father.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n\u00c9lisabeth was met in Choisy by her twin and her brother the Dauphin, she arrived in Versailles in 11 December 1748 with her retinue, composed of her \ncamarera mayor the Marquise de Lcyde, her secretary of state the Duque de Monteiano as major domo-in-chief, and three maids-of-honour.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> The French court was amassed over her lack of pomp and elegance; it was said that she arrived in nothing more than what was absolutely necessary, and that she did not appear to own more clothes than what she had brought with her from France nine years earlier.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> She was described as clever, quick and practical, with a robust strength of mind, and efficiently focused on state affairs.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> A courtier described \u00c9lisabeth as \"charming\" and as having \"piercing eyes\" that \"express(ed) intelligence\" while another, less sympathetic observer claimed she looked like a \"well-endowed young woman, matured by motherhood\".<ref>L\u00e9v\u00eaque, Jean-Jacques, ''Versailles: The Palace of the Monarchy, The Museum of the Nation'', translated by Kirk McElhearn and Ellen Krabbe, ACR PocheCouler, Paris, 2000, p. 113.</ref>\nDuring her several-month stay in Versailles, she spent most of her time with her father the king, who several times daily went to her room via a private staircase to discuss business with her, and she successfully achieved her goal when her father granted two hundred thousand francs for the Duke of Parma.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Her strong will and influence on her father reportedly somewhat worried his [[ma\u00eetresse-en-titre]], [[Madame de Pompadour]].<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> When she left Versailles on 18 October 1749, she brought a French retinue of followers, a trosseau and so many gowns that D\u2019Argenson commented that her journey had cost the State twelve hundred thousand livres.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n[[File:Isabella Louise Elisabeth de Parma.jpg|thumb|230px|\u00c9lisabeth with her eldest daughter [[Princess Isabella of Parma|Isabella]] in [[Fontainebleau]], by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]].]]\n\nIn December 1749, \u00c9lisabeth and her retinue of Spanish and French courtiers arrived in the Duchy of Parma, where they were welcomed by Philip and greeted by public celebrations in her honor.

She brought with her the duke de Noailles, who assisted her in the political transactions she held with her father during her stay, helping her to navigate between the party fractions at court. \u00c9lisabeth presented Louis XV and his ministers with a report of the state of Parma, stressing its financial need.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>  The duke de Noailles was sent to the French ambassador in Madrid to open negotiations between France and Spain regarding the contributions of the Duchy of Parma in January 1753, in which \u00c9lisabeth participated with all her contacts in France and Spain, supporting the French suggestion that France and Spain would share the expenses of the Duchy of Parma if the latter could guarantee her independence.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> By the Franco-Spanish agreement of 1753, the Duchy of Parma was granted twenty five thousand francs, two millions in taxes and supplementary assistance when needed, in addition to making French influence in Parma formal and officially legal.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Elisabeth was hailed and praised in France for securing the French influence abroad by this agreement, in which she had played a vital part.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n[[File:La famiglia di Don Filippo di Borbone by Giuseppe Baldrighi (C. 1757).jpg|thumb|left|200px|\u00c9lisabeth with her husband [[Philip, Duke of Parma]] and their children [[Ferdinand, Duke of Parma|Ferdinand]] and [[Maria Luisa of Parma|Maria Luisa]]; [[Princess Isabella of Parma|Isabella]] is shown in a white dress; by [[Giuseppe Baldrighi]].]]\n[[File:Louise Elisabeth de France... - Adelaide Labille-Guiard.png|thumb|right|200px|Posthumous portrait of Louise \u00c9lisabeth with her son, by [[Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard]].

Upon her return, she appointed [[Guillaume du Tillot]] as chief minister and administrator of the principality, securing both her own pro-French policy as well as marking France's de facto conquest of Parma.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In her policy, \u00c9lisabeth worked to free Parma from Spanish influence; to secure the succession of the duchy for her son and if possibly obtain a greater throne for him with French help; and to secure dynastic marriages for her daughters.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> \nIn accordance with her ambitions, she viewed Spain as her enemy and therefore supported the Treaty of Versailles of 1756, which allied France with Austria.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In the Treaty, it had been suggested that Austria would cede the [[Austrian Netherlands]] as a kingdom for Philip, which would be even more favorable for France than to have Parma as a vassal, a plan which was supported by both Elisabeth and Louis XV.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In this plan, she worked together with [[Madame de Pompadour]] to secure the Franco-Austrian alliance, and they also joined in their support of Choiseul.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n\u00c9lisabeth returned to France again in September 1757, to attend the negotiations between France and Austria. In the issue of Austria's wish to make the Austrian Netherlands a Kingdom for Philip in exchange for retrieving Silesia from Prussia with the support of France, she supported the idea, as it would mean a final liberation from the tutelage of Spain: \"We shall not be happy until we get rid of them! This sentiment is more human than Christian. I am not sufficiently good to resist it!\"<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> She did however not succeed in her efforts.

During this time, Elisabeth also appointed the philosopher Condillac as her son's tutor despite the opposition of the Jesuits, and arrange the marriage of her daughter [[Isabella of Parma|Isabella]] to the Archduke Joseph of Austria, the future Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], which took place in 1760.\n\n\u00c9lisabeth fell ill while she was at Versailles, and died of [[smallpox]] on 6 December 1759 and was buried on 27 March 1760 at [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis Basilica]] beside her twin, Henriette.

Her younger sisters, [[Victoire of France (1733\u20131799)|Victoire]], [[Sophie of France (1734\u20131782)|Sophie]], [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of France (1736\u20131744)|Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se]] and [[Louise of France (1737\u20131787)|Louise Marie]], however, were sent to be raised in the Abbey of Fontevraud in June 1738.\n\n\u00c9lisabeth was not regarded to be as pretty as her twin: her nose was considered too short and too broad, her face too plump, her forehead too high and her complexion too dark and sometimes blotchy.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\">{{cite book |last=Latour |first=Louis Therese |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.66391/ |title=Princesses Ladies and Salonni\u00e8res of the Reign of Louis XV |year=1927 |translator-first=Ivy E. |translator-last=Clegg |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.}}</ref> As a person, she was sometimes described as dull and indolent, but usually as vivacious and decided: it was said of her that she \"knew how to exact obedience and to get her own way\", and she was generally considered as quite charming and a \"pleasing, piquant and intelligent personality\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nIn February 1739, when she was eleven years old, her prospective engagement to the [[Philip, Duke of Parma|Infante Philip of Spain]] was announced. Philip was the third son of Louis XV's uncle, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V d'Anjou, King of Spain]], and [[Elizabeth of Parma]].\n\nThis engagement followed a tradition dating back to 1559 of cementing military and political alliances between the Catholic powers of France and Spain with royal marriages. Despite this and the fact that Philip was her father's first cousin, the announcement of the marriage agreement was not well received at the French court, as there was little chance that Philip would become king of Spain, and that only a marriage with a crown prince or a king was deemed  worthy of a princess of France.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> The barrister Barbier wrote in his diary \"It seems extraordinary that the eldest Daughter of France is not marrying a crowned head\",<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> and d'Argenson speculated that the marriage was arranged only because of a plan to make Don Philip king of Naples and Sicily.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> \u00c9lisabeth herself \"considered her destiny to be less glorious than she had the right to expect\", and when she was asked if she would not feel pleased to be called Infanta, her face reportedly \"contracted into a scornful grimace\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nThe twelve-year-old \u00c9lisabeth was married by proxy in Versailles on 26 August 1739, and thereafter known as ''Madame Infanta'' in France. In September, she left for Spain, and the king was reportedly so moved that he entered her carriage and accompanied her for the first miles on her journey. She passed the border and met her nineteen-year-old husband some thirty kilometers northeast of [[Madrid]], at [[Alcal\u00e1 de Henares]], where the marriage ceremony took place on 25 October 1739.\n\n===Infanta of Spain===\n\u00c9lisabeth made a personal success upon her arrival in Spain and was soon the \"idol of Madrid\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> She made a favorable impression on her father-in-law, king Philip V, and upon her spouse, prince Philip. Her relationship with her mother-in-law, the domineering queen [[Elisabeth of Parma]], however, soon became one of mutual dislike. The queen was displeased over the fact that \u00c9lisabeth's dowry was not paid by France, nor did France assist Spain in the war with Britain;<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> further more, after about six months the queen reportedly realized that she would not be able to control or dominate \u00c9lisabeth, as she was accustomed to do with her husband and son, and that her daughter-in-law could potentially replace her own influence over her son.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> As a result, Elisabeth spent most of her time away from the Queen, playing with dolls and wrote of her unhappiness to her father.\n\n[[File:Marie Louise Elisabeth De France, Duchess of Parma by Jean Marc Nattier and Studio.jpg|thumb|\u00c9lisabeth in hunting dress, by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]].]]\n\n\u00c9lisabeth soon came to dominate Philip; though he was eight years her senior, he, as his father, was reportedly of a timid, passive and submissive nature, and \u00c9lisabeth reportedly felt affection for him but generally treated him as \"a boy much younger than herself although he was her senior by eight years\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> de Luynes later observed: \"Although the Prince at twenty-eight is as much of a child as he was at fourteen or fifteen, he has, nevertheless, an affectionate regard for the Infanta.\"<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n\u00c9lisabeth is described as \"keen, ambitious and enterprising, untiring in her energies and passionately fond of her changing Europe to the advantage of her House, of imbuing everyone with a love for France and of making her son a prince worthy of his great French forefathers\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nShe was not satisfied with her powerless position as the spouse of a prince with no prospects of being queen at the Spanish courts; she kept in contact with the French court through correspondence, in particular with her twin, informed her brother the Dauphin of all events at the Spanish court, and had already by 1740 established a net of contacts at the French court to assist her in her ambition to obtain an independent power position for herself and her spouse, \"worthy of the birth of both\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Her twin Henriette, otherwise regarded as habitually apathetic of politics and gentle, was reportedly passionately devoted to work for the political ambition of her elder twin \u00c9lisabeth, as did her younger sister Adelaide and her sister-in-law [[Infanta Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain]]; the powerful Noailles and [[Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ph\u00e9lypeaux, Count of Maurepas]] allied with the queen to achieve the same, and the French ambassador at Madrid, Monseigneur Vaurdal, Archbishop of Reims, was reportedly so willing to be of assistance that he was ridiculed for it.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nIn 1741, Philip was called to serve in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], through which it was hoped that he would be able to secure one of the duchies of Northern Italy.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Her mother-in-law Queen Elisabeth reportedly made sure that Philip stayed in camp for almost all of the War, separated from his wife, in order to prevent her from replacing his mother in his affection; through their correspondence, the queen repeatedly asked her son if he loved his wife: \"I want to know if you love . : [the sign which Elisabeth Farnese used to denote her daughter-in-law when writing to her son] Tell me the truth!\"<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Despite the mutual antipathy between \u00c9lisabeth and her mother-in-law the queen, however, they were in fact united in their ambition and work to provide prince Philip with an independent power position.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\nDuring the war, Queen Elisabeth worked to secure her son Philip a throne in Italy, at the same time as her daughter-in-law used all her resources of her net of contacts to do the same. They succeeded in their common ambition in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]], when Philip was made ruler of the Duchy of Parma.\n\n===Duchess of Parma===\n[[File:Louise Elisabeth of France Parma5.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Louise \u00c9lisabeth by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]], c. 1754.]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]] which ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa]] had to cede the duchies of Parma, [[Piacenza]] and [[Guastalla]] to Ferdinand VI of Spain. At Louis XV's instigation, Philip became Duke and of Parma, thus successfully achieving the ambition of both \u00c9lisabeth and her mother-in-law queen Elizabeth Farnese.\n\n[[File:Louise Elisabeth of France Parma.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Louise \u00c9lisabeth as [[Duchess of Parma]], by [[Charles-Andr\u00e9 van Loo]].]]\n\n\u00c9lisabeth was pleased with her new position and with leaving the powerless position she had occupied at the court of Spain. However, she felt it necessary to obtain a substantial income of their own rather than to be solely provided for by Spain, as that would in practice make them but vassals of Spain, and therefore left Madrid for the French court with the ambition to secure an income to Parma from her father.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n\u00c9lisabeth was met in Choisy by her twin and her brother the Dauphin, she arrived in Versailles in 11 December 1748 with her retinue, composed of her \ncamarera mayor the Marquise de Lcyde, her secretary of state the Duque de Monteiano as major domo-in-chief, and three maids-of-honour.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> The French court was amassed over her lack of pomp and elegance; it was said that she arrived in nothing more than what was absolutely necessary, and that she did not appear to own more clothes than what she had brought with her from France nine years earlier.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> She was described as clever, quick and practical, with a robust strength of mind, and efficiently focused on state affairs.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> A courtier described \u00c9lisabeth as \"charming\" and as having \"piercing eyes\" that \"express(ed) intelligence\" while another, less sympathetic observer claimed she looked like a \"well-endowed young woman, matured by motherhood\".<ref>L\u00e9v\u00eaque, Jean-Jacques, ''Versailles: The Palace of the Monarchy, The Museum of the Nation'', translated by Kirk McElhearn and Ellen Krabbe, ACR PocheCouler, Paris, 2000, p. 113.</ref>\nDuring her several-month stay in Versailles, she spent most of her time with her father the king, who several times daily went to her room via a private staircase to discuss business with her, and she successfully achieved her goal when her father granted two hundred thousand francs for the Duke of Parma.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Her strong will and influence on her father reportedly somewhat worried his [[ma\u00eetresse-en-titre]], [[Madame de Pompadour]].<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> When she left Versailles on 18 October 1749, she brought a French retinue of followers, a trosseau and so many gowns that D\u2019Argenson commented that her journey had cost the State twelve hundred thousand livres.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n[[File:Isabella Louise Elisabeth de Parma.jpg|thumb|230px|\u00c9lisabeth with her eldest daughter [[Princess Isabella of Parma|Isabella]] in [[Fontainebleau]], by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]].]]\n\nIn December 1749, \u00c9lisabeth and her retinue of Spanish and French courtiers arrived in the Duchy of Parma, where they were welcomed by Philip and greeted by public celebrations in her honor. In Parma, she and her Philip lived in the [[Ducal Palace of Colorno]].<ref>{{cite web|title=WALL LIGHTS, LOUIS XV, CIRCA 1752\u20131753 FROM THE DUCHESSE DE PARME AT COLORNO|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/mobilier-sculptures-objets-art-pf1401/lot.156.html|publisher=Sothebys}}</ref> Before the former duke of Parma, Philip' brother Charles, and left Parma to become king of Naples, he had reportedly stripped the palace in Parma of much of its interior decoration and furniture, and the residence also lacked a garden. \u00c9lisabeth spent great sums to create a residence and a host a court life to her taste; the whole arrangement and plan of the residence was redesigned, and she organised a ceremonial court life and hosted numerous festivities such as opera six times a week and trips to the second residence in Colonna and Piacenza.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> To enforce the status of the Duchy, she also introduced the presence of a regiment of one hundred carbineers and a regiment of curassiers, despite the fact that the Duchy was in fact formally under the protection of France and Spain.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\nAs duchess of Parma, \u00c9lisabeth was actively involved in state affairs; Philip never negotiated any business without consulting her, and she in turn never made a decision without considering the view of France and her French advisers.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Most of the officials of the court and government were French, and French was the language spoken at court, even by Philip, while she herself demonstratively promoted French influence in the duchy.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> The French influence in Parma was not popular in the Duchy, opposition among the Italian public raged against both the French and Spanish rulers.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In 1750, Elisabeth's lady-in-waiting Madame de Leydc was claimed by a rumor to have poisoned France's Chief Minister at Parma, supposedly for being French.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> The financial stress of the duchy was extensive, however, which created a problem.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n\u00c9lisabeth's twin sister Henriette died in 1752, and \u00c9lisabeth returned to France in September, visiting her tomb at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]] and remaining in Versailles for almost a year. She brought with her the duke de Noailles, who assisted her in the political transactions she held with her father during her stay, helping her to navigate between the party fractions at court. \u00c9lisabeth presented Louis XV and his ministers with a report of the state of Parma, stressing its financial need.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>  The duke de Noailles was sent to the French ambassador in Madrid to open negotiations between France and Spain regarding the contributions of the Duchy of Parma in January 1753, in which \u00c9lisabeth participated with all her contacts in France and Spain, supporting the French suggestion that France and Spain would share the expenses of the Duchy of Parma if the latter could guarantee her independence.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> By the Franco-Spanish agreement of 1753, the Duchy of Parma was granted twenty five thousand francs, two millions in taxes and supplementary assistance when needed, in addition to making French influence in Parma formal and officially legal.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> Elisabeth was hailed and praised in France for securing the French influence abroad by this agreement, in which she had played a vital part.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n[[File:La famiglia di Don Filippo di Borbone by Giuseppe Baldrighi (C. 1757).jpg|thumb|left|200px|\u00c9lisabeth with her husband [[Philip, Duke of Parma]] and their children [[Ferdinand, Duke of Parma|Ferdinand]] and [[Maria Luisa of Parma|Maria Luisa]]; [[Princess Isabella of Parma|Isabella]] is shown in a white dress; by [[Giuseppe Baldrighi]].]]\n[[File:Louise Elisabeth de France... - Adelaide Labille-Guiard.png|thumb|right|200px|Posthumous portrait of Louise \u00c9lisabeth with her son, by [[Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard]].

Upon her return, she appointed [[Guillaume du Tillot]] as chief minister and administrator of the principality, securing both her own pro-French policy as well as marking France's de facto conquest of Parma.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In her policy, \u00c9lisabeth worked to free Parma from Spanish influence; to secure the succession of the duchy for her son and if possibly obtain a greater throne for him with French help; and to secure dynastic marriages for her daughters.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> \nIn accordance with her ambitions, she viewed Spain as her enemy and therefore supported the Treaty of Versailles of 1756, which allied France with Austria.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In the Treaty, it had been suggested that Austria would cede the [[Austrian Netherlands]] as a kingdom for Philip, which would be even more favorable for France than to have Parma as a vassal, a plan which was supported by both Elisabeth and Louis XV.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> In this plan, she worked together with [[Madame de Pompadour]] to secure the Franco-Austrian alliance, and they also joined in their support of Choiseul.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n\u00c9lisabeth returned to France again in September 1757, to attend the negotiations between France and Austria. In the issue of Austria's wish to make the Austrian Netherlands a Kingdom for Philip in exchange for retrieving Silesia from Prussia with the support of France, she supported the idea, as it would mean a final liberation from the tutelage of Spain: \"We shall not be happy until we get rid of them! This sentiment is more human than Christian. I am not sufficiently good to resist it!\"<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> She did however not succeed in her efforts. In the treaty between Spain and Austria on the 3 October 1759, supported by Choiseul, the right of Philip in the Treaty of 1748 to succeed to the throne of Naples and Sicily should his brother Charles inherit the throne of Spain, was a great disappointment to her.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/> During her stay in France, she kept in contact with Philip by letters and informed him of her acts, negotiations, hopes and successes, as well as the intentions and actions of Louis\u2019 Government. During this time, Elisabeth also appointed the philosopher Condillac as her son's tutor despite the opposition of the Jesuits, and arrange the marriage of her daughter [[Isabella of Parma|Isabella]] to the Archduke Joseph of Austria, the future Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], which took place in 1760.\n\n\u00c9lisabeth fell ill while she was at Versailles, and died of [[smallpox]] on 6 December 1759 and was buried on 27 March 1760 at [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis Basilica]] beside her twin, Henriette.
