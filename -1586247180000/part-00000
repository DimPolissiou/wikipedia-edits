In the United States, the game series is simply known as '''''Initial D'''''.\n\n== Premise ==\nIn ''Initial D Arcade Stage'', players race against different opponents through various mountain passes featured in the manga. Vehicles that are prominently featured in the game are mostly licensed Japanese cars such as the [[Nissan Skyline GT-R]], [[Mazda RX-7]], [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]], [[Honda Civic]], as well as the [[Toyota AE86]]. Using the optional magnetic card system, players can save a customized car and their progress for future sessions; otherwise, game progress is lost. Players can continue progress with their cards on another ''Initial D'' cabinet of the same version. However, the card must be renewed every 50 plays.\n\nNote that resuming from another version is subject to following conditions:\n*There is no backwards compatibility (i.e. a version 2 card cannot be used on version 1 machine).\n*Upgrading the card to a more recent machine is permanent.\n*When upgrading from one version to another, remaining plays will be carried over and 50 plays will be credited to the card.\n\nThere are 12 games in the series so far: 9 for arcades and 3 for home consoles.\n\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.1'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3'' (Arcade)\n* ''[[Initial D Arcade Stage 4]]'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Special Stage'' ([[PlayStation 2]])\n* ''Initial D Street Stage'' ([[PlayStation Portable|PSP]])\n* ''[[Initial D Extreme Stage]]'' ([[PlayStation 3|PS3]])\n\n==Game modes==\n;Legend of the Streets\n:In the main story mode, players race with opponents from the manga. Opponents increase in difficulty with progression in the game. In the English versions of the game until ''Arcade Stage 4'', their names are derived from the Tokyopop manga.\n\n;Time attack\n:Players race against time to rank against other players at the current machine or online. From ''Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' to ''Arcade Stage 6 AA'', players could change stages' weather conditions. This feature was removed from ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''.\n\n;Bunta Challenge\n:First started in ''Arcade Stage Ver.2'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' the player races against Bunta Fujiwara, the legendary street racer. Each time Bunta is defeated, the player will gain a level, and difficulty increases. In ''Arcade Stage Ver.3'', the player loses 1000 points upon defeat. Regardless, the end credits still roll if you win or lose to Bunta. Bunta's car differs across levels. Level 1-6: AE86 Trueno, Level 7-11: AE86 Trueno w/TRD 20-Valve 4AGE Racing Engine, Level 12-15: GC8V Subaru Impreza WRX STi Version V. This mode was discontinued and removed in ''Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'' though Bunta appeared as a final boss in Akina. It later returned in ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' (Only in Legend mode after clearing Rebirth mode).\n\n;Online Battle\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'', which allowed the players race against others located in Japan and some areas Asia.\n\n;Racer's Event\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 5'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. 2 modes are only included such as online battle and time attack.\n\n;Tag Battle\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 6 AA'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. It allows players in the same location to team up. One player drives uphill and the other downhill to race with rivals. Matches are made based on past racing results, pitting drivers with similar levels against each other. When there is a difference in the level with your tag partner, stronger driver will match with strong, and weaker driver with the weak. Get the A(Ace) panel on the course. High score when you get the same color panel at the same section. Team with highest score wins.\n\n;Project Kanto's Fastest/Operation Kanto\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'', this mode is similar to tag battle mode, where players race against the rival characters based in the manga from Gunma to Kanagawa area. In races against Project.D's Ace, courses are random. In ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity'', new rivals include Tohru and Atsuro in Momiji Line, Sakamoto and Wataru in Sadamine Rain, and The Lan Evo Teams in Tsuchisaka.\n\n==Games==\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.1''===\nJapanese version: late 1999 / English version late 1996\n\nBeginning with 4 courses such as Myogi (Night Kids' home course), Usui (Impact Blue's home course), Akina (Takumi's home course) and Happogahara (Todo School's first home course).\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''===\nJapanese version: late 2000 / English version Mid-late 2001\n\nWith 2 new courses such as Akagi, Takahashi brothers/Akagi Red Suns' home course and Irohazaka, Emperor's home course.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''===\nJapanese version: late 2004 / English version early 2003 / Cycraft simulator version mid 2002\n\nNew courses such as Akina Snow (only night), Shomaru, which was originally an exclusive for ''Special Stage'' and Tsuchisaka, The Lan Evo Team's home course. Also, new opponents in the game are Tohru Suetsugu, Atsuro Kawai, Miki, and the Tsucisaka Lan Evo team. New cars featured in the game are the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution V, Lancer Evolution VI T.M. Edition, [[Mazda RX-8]], and the  Nissan Skyline 25GT-T. The game features original Eurobeat songs from artists including Matt Land, Powerful T., Ace Warrior, and Marco Polo.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''===\n{{Main|Initial D Arcade Stage 4}}\nJapanese Version: Late 2005/English Version Late 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\n\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''''', also known in update version (Version 1.50) as '''''Initial D Arcade Stage 4 Kai''''' is the fourth release in the ''Initial D Arcade Stage'' series. Unlike the first three versions of the game, ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4'' runs on the [[Sega Lindbergh]] hardware, uses a new card system, and features a new physics system. This arcade game also become the last game in Western before going to the next arcade game (Japanese language only). Only 2 new rivals such as God Hand and God Foot. Rivals from previous games such as Miki, the Tsucisaka Lan Evo team, Sakamoto, Nobuhiko Akiyama, and Tohru Suetsugu have been removed. New courses such as Lake Akina, Myogi (new layout with 4 sections) and Tsukuba Fruit Line. Some cars featured in previous games such as the Lancer Evolution VII and [[Toyota Celica]] have been removed.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 5''===\nReleased in 2008, '''''Initial D Arcade Stage 5''''' (return to Japanese version) is the fifth release in the ''Initial D Arcade Stage'' series. Released for the previous hardware for the second time (The screen is mostly like Sega's RingEdge). A few notable differences include heavy physics changes. Compared to ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'', which used \"drifting\" physics, ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'' featured more realistic driving physics which included tire and brake wear down. Although the tire and brake wear are not displayed anywhere in game, experienced players can notice the difference in the change in physics as they progress in races.\n\nNew characters that appeared for the first time in the game are: Kobayakawa, Satoshi Omiya, Imposter Project D, Kai Kogashiwa (R.T. Katagiri S.V.), and Hideo Minagawa.\nNew courses such as Happogahara, which used from ''Arcade Stage Ver.1'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' (only daytime used is night) and only ''Extreme Stage'' appeared with full daytimes between day and night and Nagao, R.T. Katagiri S.V.'s homecourse.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA''''' was released in June 2012.\n\nA new mode, Tag Battle, was introduced. Unlike its predecessor, it was released for the [[Sega RingEdge]] hardware for the first time. The game saw a change in its driving physics. Unlike ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'', a drift gauge and an updated tachometer was introduced to help inform players when they were drifting. The 'Legend of the Street' mode also introduced a \"Rolling Start\" for the first time since the story mode in ''Initial D Special Stage''. The tachometer now informed players whether or not their speed was below the gear range. Online network was extended to support regions in which earlier versions of the game was known to be popular in, finally achieving both national wide and international matches. New cars and courses were added to the game through online updates without upgrade kits like IDAS4 1.5. The game also added a mileage system to show players their total driven mileage. Mileages could be used to redeem exclusive cars that were later available in updates. New characters that appeared for the first time in the game include: Ryuji Ikeda, Hiroya Okuyama, Go Hojo and Rin Hojo.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} New course such as Usui, which used from ''Arcade Stage Ver.1'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' appeared with new layout, Tsubaki Line, Sadamine and Akina Snow, also appeared before in ''Arcade Stage Ver.3'' which daytime is night change into day.\n\nNote: AA = Double Ace\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX''===\n[[File:ID7AA.jpg|thumb|right|An arcade installed with two ''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' games]]\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX''''', was released for Sega RingEdge in January 2013. Like its predecessor, the legend of the streets mode from Original and Another mode are exactly the same as the previous one (''Arcade Stage 6 AA'') with Rebirth mode. The game is mostly a carry-over from ''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA'', including updates. New characters include Shinji Inui to complete the Sidewinder battles of Project D, also ''Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage''/''Arcade Stage Ver.3'' characters such as Nobuhiko Akiyama (Rebirth), Sakamoto and Tohru Suetsugu (only in Legend) appeared in this game and rewind of Keisuke, from Project.D using Kyoko's FD. New cars include the Toyota Sprinter Trueno 2door and the new Toyota 86 GT (to replace the FT-86 prototype from the previous game). A new class of vehicles is introduced in this game called \"Complete Cars\". These include pre-tuned cars from several tuning shops in Japan, such as [[RE Amemiya]]. Online battles now include tag battles, allowing two in-store machines linking together and with internet access to battle against two other players in tag battles. New courses such as Tsuchisaka, which previously used in ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' also appeared and Nanamagari, Team Spiral's home course. In this game, there are 3 songs which also used from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' and only a song from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' with new songs. The ending theme of this game is Gamble Rumble (7th Stage Version) by m.o.v.e., the opening theme remix of ''Initial D Third Stage'', ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' and ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity \u221e''''' was released March 6, 2015. Like its predecessor, this game carries over all game modes from the previous version with a notable addition of Initial D Factory and D Coins. In Story Mode, the players can play the Team Side or Rival Side to see Driving Training Curriculum or what mission is for each story. The game added a new feature \"1 Day 1 Time Continue\" to allow players to have a free continue per day without inserting credits. New courses such as Momiji Line, for the first time in ''Special Stage'', also appeared with new layout and Hakone, the place for battle between Ryosuke's FC and Rin Hojo's R32. ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' characters such as Miki, Atsuro Kawai and The Lan Evo Teams also return. This is the last game with Japanese voice actors before ''Arcade Stage Zero'', which does not feature voice anymore.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero''''' was released for the Sega Nu2 [[arcade system board]] in October 9, 2018. Unlike its predecessors, this game now uses a 6-speed gear shifter (similar to the ones found in the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games) as opposed to the sequential ones. The character designs are taken from ''[[New Initial D the Movie]]'' with entirely new BGMs that are rock songs from the films such as Backdraft Smiths, Clutcho, The Hug Me, The Valves, and Gekkou Green. A small number of Eurobeat songs from previous games are also featured, but have to be unlocked. Also, the vehicles have been reduced by original ones featured in previous games, with the exception of the [[Toyota 86]] which was featured in the films. However, more vehicles were added through free updates later in the year.\n\n===''Initial D Special Stage''===\n'''''Initial D Special Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) was released on June 26, 2003 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and was re-released on February 26, 2004 under the \"PlayStation 2 the Best\" label. ''Initial D Special Stage'' is based on ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2'' with additional Japanese voices for the first time and contains many features exclusive to this game. ''Initial D Special Stage'' is also the first home-console Initial D game published by Sega.\n\n''Initial D Special Stage'' contains a story mode that allows the player to reenact racing scenes from the ''Initial D'' manga series (up to Vol. 25 at the time of publication), as well as several new courses then not seen in the arcade versions of the game. In one of these courses, Shomaru went on to appear in ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage''. Real Myogi was later added back in ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage''. Momiji Line would not return until ''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. Bunta's Challenge is noticeably absent in the game. Additional features including replays for saved time-attack records and Iketani's car introduction.\n\nDue to [[PlayStation 2]]'s hardware limitations, the graphics of the game was downgraded from its arcade counterpart. The game is compatible with Logitech's Driving Force wheel series and other wheel controllers made for [[PlayStation 2]]. Sega also balanced all the cars in game due to the overpowering Integra DC2 from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''.\n\n===''Initial D Street Stage''===\n'''''Initial D Street Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8 \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) is a PSP-exclusive game based on ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''. This game features Dogfight by M.o.v.e. as it's intro theme which also used as the first opening theme of ''Initial D Fourth Stage''. The legend of the street mode which pits players against the rival characters are exactly the same as the arcade game but Akina (Snow) is removed, meaning the battle with Miki is also removed, although his theme can be found in the game's BGM files.\n\n===''Initial D Extreme Stage''===\n{{Main|Initial D Extreme Stage}}\n'''''Initial D Extreme Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0 \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) is a [[PlayStation 3]] game based on ''[[Initial D Arcade Stage 4]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n''Initial D Arcade Stage'' (2001) sold 2,534 hardware units in Japan up until 2004.<ref name=\"sega_sep04\">{{cite web|title=First Half Business Results (April\u2013September 2004)|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/settlement/2005/e_200503_2q_pre.pdf#page=4|publisher=[[Sega Sammy Holdings]]|accessdate=17 May 2012|page=4|date=11 November 2004}}</ref> ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver. 3'' sold 673 units between April 2004 and March 2005.<ref name=\"sega_mar05\">{{cite web|title=FY2004 Financial Results (for the year ended March 31, 2005)|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/settlement/2005/e_200503_4q_pre.pdf#page=11|publisher=[[Sega Sammy Holdings]]|page=11|accessdate=17 May 2012|location=Tokyo|date=25 May 2005}}</ref> Combined, both versions of the game sold approximately {{formatnum:{{#expr:2534+673}}|}} units up until March 2005.

However, the card must be renewed every 50 plays.\n\nNote that resuming from another version is subject to following conditions:\n*There is no backwards compatibility (i.e. a version 2 card cannot be used on version 1 machine).\n*Upgrading the card to a more recent machine is permanent.\n*When upgrading from one version to another, remaining plays will be carried over and 50 plays will be credited to the card.\n\nThere are 12 games in the series so far: 9 for arcades and 3 for home consoles.\n\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.1'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3'' (Arcade)\n* ''[[Initial D Arcade Stage 4]]'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero'' (Arcade)\n* ''Initial D Special Stage'' ([[PlayStation 2]])\n* ''Initial D Street Stage'' ([[PlayStation Portable|PSP]])\n* ''[[Initial D Extreme Stage]]'' ([[PlayStation 3|PS3]])\n\n==Game modes==\n;Legend of the Streets\n:In the main story mode, players race with opponents from the manga. Opponents increase in difficulty with progression in the game. In the English versions of the game until ''Arcade Stage 4'', their names are derived from the Tokyopop manga.\n\n;Time attack\n:Players race against time to rank against other players at the current machine or online. From ''Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' to ''Arcade Stage 6 AA'', players could change stages' weather conditions. This feature was removed from ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''.\n\n;Bunta Challenge\n:First started in ''Arcade Stage Ver.2'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' the player races against Bunta Fujiwara, the legendary street racer. Each time Bunta is defeated, the player will gain a level, and difficulty increases. In ''Arcade Stage Ver.3'', the player loses 1000 points upon defeat. Regardless, the end credits still roll if you win or lose to Bunta. Bunta's car differs across levels. Level 1-6: AE86 Trueno, Level 7-11: AE86 Trueno w/TRD 20-Valve 4AGE Racing Engine, Level 12-15: GC8V Subaru Impreza WRX STi Version V. This mode was discontinued and removed in ''Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'' though Bunta appeared as a final boss in Akina. It later returned in ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' (Only in Legend mode after clearing Rebirth mode).\n\n;Online Battle\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'', which allowed the players race against others located in Japan and some areas Asia.\n\n;Racer's Event\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 5'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. 2 modes are only included such as online battle and time attack.\n\n;Tag Battle\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 6 AA'' to ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. It allows players in the same location to team up. One player drives uphill and the other downhill to race with rivals. Matches are made based on past racing results, pitting drivers with similar levels against each other. When there is a difference in the level with your tag partner, stronger driver will match with strong, and weaker driver with the weak. Get the A(Ace) panel on the course. High score when you get the same color panel at the same section. Team with highest score wins.\n\n;Project Kanto's Fastest/Operation Kanto\n:Introduced in ''Arcade Stage 7 AAX'', this mode is similar to tag battle mode, where players race against the rival characters based in the manga from Gunma to Kanagawa area. In races against Project.D's Ace, courses are random. In ''Arcade Stage 8 Infinity'', new rivals include Tohru and Atsuro in Momiji Line, Sakamoto and Wataru in Sadamine Rain and The Lan Evo Teams in Tsuchisaka.\n\n==Games==\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.1''===\nJapanese version: late 1999 / English version late 1996\n\nBeginning with 4 courses such as Myogi (Night Kids' home course), Usui (Impact Blue's home course), Akina (Takumi's home course) and Happogahara (Todo School's first home course).\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''===\nJapanese version: late 2000 / English version Mid-late 2001\n\nWith 2 new courses such as Akagi, Takahashi brothers/Akagi Red Suns' home course and Irohazaka, Emperor's home course.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''===\nJapanese version: late 2004 / English version early 2003 / Cycraft simulator version mid 2002\n\nNew courses such as Akina Snow (only night), Shomaru, which was originally an exclusive for ''Special Stage'' and Tsuchisaka, The Lan Evo Team's home course. Also, new opponents in the game are Tohru Suetsugu, Atsuro Kawai, Miki, and the Tsucisaka Lan Evo team. New cars featured in the game are the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution V, Lancer Evolution VI T.M. Edition, [[Mazda RX-8]], and the  Nissan Skyline 25GT-T. The game features original Eurobeat songs from artists including Matt Land, Powerful T., Ace Warrior, and Marco Polo.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''===\n{{Main|Initial D Arcade Stage 4}}\nJapanese Version: Late 2005/English Version Late 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019\n\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''''', also known in update version (Version 1.50) as '''''Initial D Arcade Stage 4 Kai''''' is the fourth release in the ''Initial D Arcade Stage'' series. Unlike the first three versions of the game, ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4'' runs on the [[Sega Lindbergh]] hardware, uses a new card system, and features a new physics system. This arcade game also become the last game in Western before going to the next arcade game (Japanese language only). Only 2 new rivals such as God Hand and God Foot. Rivals from previous games such as Miki, the Tsucisaka Lan Evo team, Sakamoto, Nobuhiko Akiyama, and Tohru Suetsugu have been removed. New courses such as Lake Akina, Myogi (new layout with 4 sections) and Tsukuba Fruit Line. Some cars featured in previous games such as the Lancer Evolution VII and [[Toyota Celica]] have been removed.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 5''===\nReleased in 2008, '''''Initial D Arcade Stage 5''''' (return to Japanese version) is the fifth release in the ''Initial D Arcade Stage'' series. Released for the previous hardware for the second time (The screen is mostly like Sega's RingEdge). A few notable differences include heavy physics changes. Compared to ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage'', which used \"drifting\" physics, ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'' featured more realistic driving physics which included tire and brake wear down. Although the tire and brake wear are not displayed anywhere in game, experienced players can notice the difference in the change in physics as they progress in races.\n\nNew characters that appeared for the first time in the game are: Kobayakawa, Satoshi Omiya, Imposter Project D, Kai Kogashiwa (R.T. Katagiri S.V.), and Hideo Minagawa.\nNew courses such as Happogahara, which used from ''Arcade Stage Ver.1'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' (only daytime used is night) and only ''Extreme Stage'' appeared with full daytimes between day and night and Nagao, R.T. Katagiri S.V.'s homecourse.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA''''' was released in June 2012.\n\nA new mode, Tag Battle, was introduced. Unlike its predecessor, it was released for the [[Sega RingEdge]] hardware for the first time. The game saw a change in its driving physics. Unlike ''Initial D Arcade Stage 5'', a drift gauge and an updated tachometer was introduced to help inform players when they were drifting. The 'Legend of the Street' mode also introduced a \"Rolling Start\" for the first time since the story mode in ''Initial D Special Stage''. The tachometer now informed players whether or not their speed was below the gear range. Online network was extended to support regions in which earlier versions of the game was known to be popular in, finally achieving both national wide and international matches. New cars and courses were added to the game through online updates without upgrade kits like IDAS4 1.5. The game also added a mileage system to show players their total driven mileage. Mileages could be used to redeem exclusive cars that were later available in updates. New characters that appeared for the first time in the game include: Ryuji Ikeda, Hiroya Okuyama, Go Hojo and Rin Hojo.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} New course such as Usui, which used from ''Arcade Stage Ver.1'' to ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' appeared with new layout, Tsubaki Line, Sadamine and Akina Snow, also appeared before in ''Arcade Stage Ver.3'' which daytime is night change into day.\n\nNote: AA = Double Ace\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX''===\n[[File:ID7AA.jpg|thumb|right|An arcade installed with two ''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX'' games]]\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 7 AAX''''', was released for Sega RingEdge in January 2013. Like its predecessor, the legend of the streets mode from Original and Another mode are exactly the same as the previous one (''Arcade Stage 6 AA'') with Rebirth mode. The game is mostly a carry-over from ''Initial D Arcade Stage 6 AA'', including updates. New characters include Shinji Inui to complete the Sidewinder battles of Project D, also ''Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage''/''Arcade Stage Ver.3'' characters such as Nobuhiko Akiyama (Rebirth), Sakamoto and Tohru Suetsugu (only in Legend) appeared in this game and rewind of Keisuke, from Project.D using Kyoko's FD. New cars include the Toyota Sprinter Trueno 2door and the new Toyota 86 GT (to replace the FT-86 prototype from the previous game). A new class of vehicles is introduced in this game called \"Complete Cars\". These include pre-tuned cars from several tuning shops in Japan, such as [[RE Amemiya]]. Online battles now include tag battles, allowing two in-store machines linking together and with internet access to battle against two other players in tag battles. New courses such as Tsuchisaka, which previously used in ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' also appeared and Nanamagari, Team Spiral's home course. In this game, there are 3 songs which also used from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' and only a song from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' with new songs. The ending theme of this game is Gamble Rumble (7th Stage Version) by m.o.v.e., the opening theme remix of ''Initial D Third Stage'', ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''/''Special Stage'' and ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity \u221e''''' was released March 6, 2015. Like its predecessor, this game carries over all game modes from the previous version with a notable addition of Initial D Factory and D Coins. In Story Mode, the players can play the Team Side or Rival Side to see Driving Training Curriculum or what mission is for each story. The game added a new feature \"1 Day 1 Time Continue\" to allow players to have a free continue per day without inserting credits. New courses such as Momiji Line, for the first time in ''Special Stage'', also appeared with new layout and Hakone, the place for battle between Ryosuke's FC and Rin Hojo's R32. ''Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage'' characters such as Miki, Atsuro Kawai and The Lan Evo Teams also return. This is the last game with Japanese voice actors before ''Arcade Stage Zero'', which does not feature voice anymore.\n\n===''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero''===\n'''''Initial D Arcade Stage Zero''''' was released for the Sega Nu2 [[arcade system board]] in October 9, 2018. Unlike its predecessors, this game now uses a 6-speed gear shifter (similar to the ones found in the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune games) as opposed to the sequential ones. The character designs are taken from ''[[New Initial D the Movie]]'' with entirely new BGMs that are rock songs from the films such as Backdraft Smiths, Clutcho, The Hug Me, The Valves, and Gekkou Green. A small number of Eurobeat songs from previous games are also featured, but have to be unlocked. Also, the vehicles have been reduced by original ones featured in previous games, with the exception of the [[Toyota 86]] which was featured in the films. However, more vehicles were added through free updates later in the year.\n\n===''Initial D Special Stage''===\n'''''Initial D Special Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) was released on June 26, 2003 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and was re-released on February 26, 2004 under the \"PlayStation 2 the Best\" label. ''Initial D Special Stage'' is based on ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2'' with additional Japanese voices for the first time and contains many features exclusive to this game. ''Initial D Special Stage'' is also the first home-console Initial D game published by Sega.\n\n''Initial D Special Stage'' contains a story mode that allows the player to reenact racing scenes from the ''Initial D'' manga series (up to Vol. 25 at the time of publication), as well as several new courses then not seen in the arcade versions of the game. In one of these courses, Shomaru went on to appear in ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''/''Street Stage''. Real Myogi was later added back in ''Initial D Arcade Stage 4''/''Extreme Stage''. Momiji Line would not return until ''Initial D Arcade Stage 8 Infinity''. Bunta's Challenge is noticeably absent in the game. Additional features including replays for saved time-attack records and Iketani's car introduction.\n\nDue to [[PlayStation 2]]'s hardware limitations, the graphics of the game was downgraded from its arcade counterpart. The game is compatible with Logitech's Driving Force wheel series and other wheel controllers made for [[PlayStation 2]]. Sega also balanced all the cars in game due to the overpowering Integra DC2 from ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.2''.\n\n===''Initial D Street Stage''===\n'''''Initial D Street Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8 \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) is a PSP-exclusive game based on ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver.3''. This game features Dogfight by M.o.v.e. as it's intro theme which also used as the first opening theme of ''Initial D Fourth Stage''. The legend of the street mode which pits players against the rival characters are exactly the same as the arcade game but Akina (Snow) is removed, meaning the battle with Miki is also removed, although his theme can be found in the game's BGM files.\n\n===''Initial D Extreme Stage''===\n{{Main|Initial D Extreme Stage}}\n'''''Initial D Extreme Stage''''' (\u30a4\u30cb\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebD \u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0 \u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8) is a [[PlayStation 3]] game based on ''[[Initial D Arcade Stage 4]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n''Initial D Arcade Stage'' (2001) sold 2,534 hardware units in Japan up until 2004.<ref name=\"sega_sep04\">{{cite web|title=First Half Business Results (April\u2013September 2004)|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/settlement/2005/e_200503_2q_pre.pdf#page=4|publisher=[[Sega Sammy Holdings]]|accessdate=17 May 2012|page=4|date=11 November 2004}}</ref> ''Initial D Arcade Stage Ver. 3'' sold 673 units between April 2004 and March 2005.<ref name=\"sega_mar05\">{{cite web|title=FY2004 Financial Results (for the year ended March 31, 2005)|url=http://www.segasammy.co.jp/english/ir/library/pdf/settlement/2005/e_200503_4q_pre.pdf#page=11|publisher=[[Sega Sammy Holdings]]|page=11|accessdate=17 May 2012|location=Tokyo|date=25 May 2005}}</ref> Combined, both versions of the game sold approximately {{formatnum:{{#expr:2534+673}}|}} units up until March 2005.

Rather began his career in Texas, becoming a national name after his reporting saved thousands of lives during [[Hurricane Carla]] in September 1961. Rather spontaneously created the first radar weather report by overlaying a transparent map over a radar image of Hurricane Carla. In his first national broadcast, he helped initiate the successful evacuation of 350,000 people.\n\nRather reported from Dallas in November 1963 at the time of the President [[Kennedy assassination]]. Based on his reporting, he was promoted at [[CBS News]], where he served as White House correspondent beginning in 1964. He served as foreign correspondent in London and Vietnam over the next two years before returning to the White House correspondent position. He covered the [[presidency of Richard Nixon]], including Nixon's trip to China, the Watergate scandal, and the president's resignation.\n\nIn 1981, Rather was promoted to [[news presenter|news anchor]] for the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', a role he occupied for 24 years. Along with [[Peter Jennings]] at [[ABC News]] and [[Tom Brokaw]] at [[NBC News]], he was one of the \"Big Three\" nightly [[news anchor]]s in the U.S. from the 1980s through the early 2000s. He frequently contributed to CBS's weekly news magazine, ''[[60 Minutes]]''. Within a year of Brokaw's retirement and Jennings's death, Rather left the anchor desk in 2005 following a [[Killian documents]] controversy in which he presented unauthenticated documents in a news report on President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Vietnam War]]\u2013era service in the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]]. He continued to work with CBS until 2006.\n\nOn the cable channel [[AXS TV]] (then called HDNet), Rather hosted ''[[Dan Rather Reports]]'', a ''60 Minutes''\u2013style investigative news program, from 2006 to 2013. He also hosts several other projects for AXS TV, including ''Dan Rather Presents'', which provides in-depth reporting on broad topics such as mental health care or adoption, and ''The Big Interview with Dan Rather'', in which he conducts long-form interviews with musicians and other entertainers.

In contrast to the [[wikt:avuncular|avuncular]] Cronkite, who ended his newscast with \"That's the way it is\", Rather searched to find a broadcast ending more suitable to his tastes.

The Associated Press later confirmed the story. A teacher at the school backed up the Rather story, confirming that some students at the school had cheered at the principal's news about Kennedy.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Morning Record| date=November 27, 1963 |agency=AP |title=Dallas Students Cheer Shooting of Kennedy }}</ref> [[Eddie Barker]], local Dallas-area news director for CBS, said that Rather had in fact been aware that the children were merely happy about being sent home early and they had not been given a reason for early school closure (Barker's children attended the school, as he informed Rather). He stated that Rather had deliberately misrepresented the facts by indicating that the children were happy about the shooting. Barker attempted to fire Rather, but was overruled by the national CBS News management.<ref name=\"WeeklyStandardCBS\">Philip Chalk, ''[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/324nfvwe.asp Wrong from the Beginning: Even in 1963, Dan Rather was a poor excuse for a newsman]'', ''The Weekly Standard'', March 14, 2005.</ref>\n\n== Notable incidents and controversies ==\n\n=== 1968 Democratic convention ===\nDuring live coverage of the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], Rather attempted to interview a delegate from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] who appeared as though he were being forcibly removed by men without identification badges.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/aug/25/1968theyearofrevolt.democrats2008 |website=theguardian.com |publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd. |accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=CBS reporter Dan Rather assaulted at Democratic Convention 50 years ago this hour #OnThisDay #OTD (August 27, 1968) |url=https://retronewser.com/2018/08/27/cbs-reporter-dan-rather-assaulted-at-democratic-convention-50-years-ago-this-hour-onthisday-otd-aug-27-1968/ |website=retronewser.com |accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs Rather approached the delegate to question the apparent strong-arm tactics of the Chicago [[political machine]] under [[Richard J.

He asked the cab driver to take him to the home of writer [[Studs Terkel]], whom he was interviewing for ''60&nbsp;Minutes''. A police spokesman said that the cab driver refused to go to the address and instead \"wildly drove through the city streets\" with Rather shouting out the window asking for help. The driver was charged with disorderly conduct. Rather called the incident \"a rather minor thing\".\nBy the time the case was about to come to trial, he was about to add anchoring the \"CBS Evening News\" to his \"60 Minutes\" role at CBS News. Rather declined to press charges, citing a \"mounting schedule of reporting assignments\".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times\n|title=The Ride of Dan Rather\n|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/11/111306745.pdf\n|author=Albin Krebs and David Bird |date=November 11, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/28/nyregion/notes-on-people-rather-withdraws-charges-against-cab-driver.html\n|title=Rather Withdraws Charges Against Cab Driver\n|author=Albin Krebs and Robert McG.

The phrase \"What's the frequency, Kenneth?\" became a popular-culture reference over the years, such as in a scene in the graphic novel ''[[Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron]]'' by cartoonist [[Daniel Clowes]]. In 1994, the band [[R.E.M.]] released the song \"[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]\" on their album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]''.

He was upset that the news was being cut into to make room for sports and discussed it with the sports department and made it clear that if the newscast did not start on time then CBS Sports should fill the half hour. The [[Steffi Graf]]\u2013[[Lori McNeil]] tennis match coverage then ended sooner than expected at 6:32&nbsp;p.m., but Rather had disappeared. ([[CBS Sports]] had finally agreed to break away immediately after the match without commentary.) Thus, over 100 affiliates were forced to broadcast six minutes of dead air.<ref>{{cite news|last=Boyer|first=Peter J.|title=Rather Walked Off Set of CBS News|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/13/nyregion/rather-walked-off-set-of-cbs-news.html|work=The New York Times|date=September 13, 1987}}</ref> The next day, Rather apologized for leaving the anchor desk.

Similar to those used by [[baseball]] announcer [[Red Barber]], [[cycling]] commentator [[Phil Liggett]] and [[Formula 1]] commentator [[Murray Walker]], these \"Ratherisms\" are also called \"Texanisms\" or \"Danisms\" by some.

An animated caricature of him made a cameo appearance in the [[JibJab]] [[political cartoon]], ''Good to Be in D.C.'' In 1971 he had a cameo in an episode of the number one hit comedy series ''[[All in the Family]]''. Entitled ''The Man in the Street'', series star [[Carroll O'Connor]]'s Archie Bunker character excitedly awaits the viewing of a videotaped interview he gave earlier that day for the ''CBS Evening News''. At the last minute, to his dismay, the segment is preempted by the telecast of a Richard Nixon presidential address from the [[Oval Office]]. Rather appears, as himself, delivering post-speech analysis from actual news footage.

Rather began his career in Texas, becoming a national name after his reporting saved thousands of lives during [[Hurricane Carla]] in September 1961. Rather spontaneously created the first radar weather report by overlaying a transparent map over a radar image of Hurricane Carla. In his first national broadcast, he helped initiate the successful evacuation of 350,000 people. \n\nRather reported from Dallas in November 1963 at the time of the President [[Kennedy assassination]]. Based on his reporting, he was promoted at [[CBS News]], where he served as White House correspondent beginning in 1964. He served as foreign correspondent in London and Vietnam over the next two years before returning to the White House correspondent position. He covered the [[presidency of Richard Nixon]], including Nixon's trip to China, the Watergate scandal, and the president's resignation.\n\nIn 1981, Rather was promoted to [[news presenter|news anchor]] for the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', a role he occupied for 24 years. Along with [[Peter Jennings]] at [[ABC News]] and [[Tom Brokaw]] at [[NBC News]], he was one of the \"Big Three\" nightly [[news anchor]]s in the U.S. from the 1980s through the early 2000s. He frequently contributed to CBS's weekly news magazine, ''[[60 Minutes]]''. Within a year of Brokaw's retirement and Jennings's death, Rather left the anchor desk in 2005 following a [[Killian documents]] controversy in which he presented unauthenticated documents in a news report on President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[Vietnam War]]\u2013era service in the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]]. He continued to work with CBS until 2006.\n\nOn the cable channel [[AXS TV]] (then called HDNet), Rather hosted ''[[Dan Rather Reports]]'', a ''60 Minutes''\u2013style investigative news program, from 2006 to 2013. He also hosts several other projects for AXS TV, including ''Dan Rather Presents'', which provides in-depth reporting on broad topics such as mental health care or adoption, and ''The Big Interview with Dan Rather'', in which he conducts long-form interviews with musicians and other entertainers. In January 2018, he began hosting an online newscast called ''The News with Dan Rather'' on [[The Young Turks]]' YouTube channel.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Dan Rather boyhood home IMG 1055.JPG|thumb|Rather's boyhood home being restored at the Wharton County Museum]]\nDan Irvin Rather Jr. was born on October 31, 1931, in [[Wharton County, Texas|Wharton County]], [[Texas]], the son of Daniel Irvin Rather Sr., a ditch digger and pipe layer,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/biography|title=Biography &#124; Dan Rather|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180906052542/https://danratherjournalist.org/about-dan/biography|archive-date=September 6, 2018 |url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2018}}</ref> and the former Byrl Veda Page.

He conceived of overlaying a transparent map over the radar screen in order to show the size of Hurricane Carla to the audience. Convinced of the threat, more than 350,000 people evacuated from the area, the largest known evacuation to that time. Their actions are believed to have saved thousands of lives compared to the previous hurricane, which had killed 6000 to 12000 people.<ref>https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dan-rather-showed-the-first-radar-image-of-a-hurricane-on-tv/264246/</ref> Rather's live coverage of Carla was broadcast by New York and national stations.

Rather did not fit in easily on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. His first reports for CBS included coverage of the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 1]] in [[Jamaica Bay]], and a report on the suffocation of children at a hospital in [[Binghamton, New York]]. Shortly after, Rather was made chief of CBS's Southwest [[News bureau|bureau]] in [[Dallas]].

He later wrote: \n<blockquote>\"The moment I cleared the railroad tracks I saw a scene I will never forget. Some people were lying on the grass, some screaming, some running, some pointing.

In 1994, the band [[R.E.M.]] released the song \"[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]\" on their album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]''.

He was upset that the news was being cut into to make room for sports and discussed it with the sports department and made it clear that if the newscast did not start on time then CBS Sports should fill the half hour. The [[Steffi Graf]]\u2013[[Lori McNeil]] tennis match coverage then ended sooner than expected at 6:32&nbsp;p.m., but Rather had disappeared. ([[CBS Sports]] had finally agreed to break away immediately after the match without commentary.)

Similar to those used by [[baseball]] announcer [[Red Barber]], [[cycling]] commentator [[Phil Liggett]] and [[Formula 1]] commentator [[Murray Walker]], these \"Ratherisms\" are also called \"Texanisms\" or \"Danisms\" by some. A few of the more colorful ones, several of which were used throughout the 2008 [[HBO]] made-for-TV movie ''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]'' about the [[2000 U.S. presidential election|2000 Election]], include:\n* \"This race is shakier than cafeteria [[Jell-O]].\"<ref name=bias>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IQ7nBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT15&q=race%20is%20shakier%20than%20cafeteria%20Jello|title=Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News|author=Goldberg, Bernard|year=2001|isbn=9781596981485}}</ref>\n* \"This thing is as tight as the rusted lugnuts on a '55 Ford.\"<ref name=bias />\n* His characterization of the Republican Party's assessment of President Obama:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/03/08/dan-makes-watermelon-quip-depicting-gop-attacks-obama/ |work=Fox News |title=Dan Rather Makes 'Watermelon' Quip in Depicting GOP Attacks on Obama |date=March 8, 2010}}</ref> \"[He] couldn't sell watermelons if you gave him the state troopers to flag down the traffic.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Dan Rather says 'Articulate' Obama 'couldn't even sell watermelons' |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/dan-rather-says-articulate-obama-couldnt-even-sell-watermelons |website=washingtonexaminer.com |publisher=Washington Examiner |accessdate=August 11, 2019 |date=March 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Dan Rather (DIG13960 061).jpg|thumb|right|Rather at the [[LBJ Presidential Library]] in 2016]]\nRather has been referenced in the television shows ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'' and many films. An animated caricature of him made a cameo appearance in the [[JibJab]] [[political cartoon]], ''Good to Be in D.C.'' In 1971 he had a cameo in an episode of the number one hit comedy series ''[[All in the Family]]''. Entitled ''The Man in the Street'', series star [[Carroll O'Connor]]'s Archie Bunker character excitedly awaits the viewing of a videotaped interview he gave earlier that day for the ''CBS Evening News''. At the last minute, to his dismay, the segment is preempted by the telecast of a Richard Nixon presidential address from the [[Oval Office]]. Rather appears, as himself, delivering post-speech analysis from actual news footage. [[Jean Stapleton]], as Archie's scatterbrained wife Edith Bunker, says of Rather how he's there to \"...{{nbsp}}tell us what Mr. Nixon just said.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rich |first1=John |title=Warm Up the Snake: A Hollywood Memoir |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0472115782 |page=137}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, he was featured in the documentary film ''Barbecue: A Texas Love Story'' by Austin-based director [[Chris Elley]].<ref>[http://www.bbqfilm.com ''BBQ''.]</ref> Two years later, Rather and Elley educated a group of New Yorkers in [[Madison Square Park]] about the true meaning of BBQ and its significance to the identity of the Lone Star State.\n\nIn the 2006\u201307 graphic novel ''Shooting War'', which is set in the year 2011, an 80-year-old Dan Rather is shown to be one of the last journalists still reporting from Iraq. He had a cameo in the premiere of the Fall 2007 drama ''[[Dirty Sexy Money]]'' on ABC television. He guest-starred as himself in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode, \"[[E Pluribus Wiggum]]\".\n\nRather appeared on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' in May 2009 wearing an Afro wig and mutton-chop sideburns to narrate a segment about the late former President Nixon eating a burrito, as a parody of [[MSNBC]]'s extensive coverage of President Obama and Vice President Biden's hamburger lunch.<ref>{{cite episode |series=The Daily Show |airdate=May 6, 2009 |network=Comedy Central |title=Nixon Has a Burrito\n|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-may-6-2009/nixon-has-a-burrito}}</ref> He appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary ''[[Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Transcript {{!}} BOOGIE MAN: THE LEE ATWATER STORY |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/atwater/etc/script.html |website=pbs.org |accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA character \"Dano\", an imitation of Rather, appears on the ''Brad and Britt'' morning show on [[WYMY|WZTK]] radio.
