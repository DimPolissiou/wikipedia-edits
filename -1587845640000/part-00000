It is served by intercity [[Amtrak Cascades|Amtrak ''Cascades'']] trains and consists of a single [[train platform|platform]] and an adjacent parking lot.

New equipment was brought into the country from overseas. Two additional laboratories began testing for the virus in mid-April: the [[Enfer]] facility in [[Sallins]], [[County Kildare]], and the [[Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine]]'s laboratory in [[Backweston]].

Asness asserted that profits consistently beating market averages were attainable by exploiting both [[value investing|value]] and [[momentum investing|momentum]]. Asness concept of ''value'' was referred to in the context of [[fundamental analysis]] as a way of assessing the true worth of a security. His use of the concept of ''momentum'' referred to betting that the value will continue to go up or down as it did in the recent past. While he did not originate these concepts, Asness was credited with being the first to compile enough empirical evidence across a wide variety of markets to bring the ideas into the academic financial mainstream.

Asness concept of ''value'' was referred to in the context of [[fundamental analysis]] as a way of assessing the true worth of a security. His use of the concept of ''momentum'' referred to betting that the value will continue to go up or down as it did in the recent past. While he did not originate these concepts, Asness was credited with being the first to compile enough empirical evidence across a wide variety of markets to bring the ideas into the academic financial mainstream.

The screening of non-mainstream pictures at midnight was aimed at building a [[cult film]] audience, encouraging repeat viewing and social interaction in what was originally a [[counterculture|countercultural]] setting.\n\nThe national success of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' and the changing economics of the film exhibition industry altered the nature of the midnight movie phenomenon; as its association with broader trends of cultural and political opposition dwindled in the 1980s, the midnight movie became a more purely [[camp (style)|camp]] experience\u2014in effect, bringing it closer to the television form that shares its name. The term ''midnight movie'' is now often used in two different, though related, ways: as a synonym for ''[[B movie]]'', reflecting the relative cheapness characteristic of late-night movies both theatrically and on TV, and as a synonym for ''cult film''.<ref>See, e.g., Conrich (2006).</ref>\n\n==History==\n===On television===\nIn 1953, the [[Screen Actors Guild]] agreed to a [[Residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]] payment plan that greatly facilitated the distribution of B movies to television.<ref>Heffernan (2004), p. 161.</ref> A number of local television stations around the United States soon began showing inexpensive genre films in late-night slots; these late-night slots were after the [[watershed (broadcasting)|safe-harbor time]], meaning they were largely exempt from [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations on indecent content. In the spring of 1954, Los Angeles TV station [[KABC-TV|KABC]] expanded on the concept by having an appropriately offbeat host introduce the films: for a year on Saturday nights, ''[[The Vampira Show]]'', with [[Maila Nurmi]] in her newly adopted persona of a sexy bloodsucker (\"Your pin-down girl\"), presented low-budget movies with black humor and a low-cut black dress. The show\u2014which ran at midnight for four weeks before shifting to 11 p.m. and, later, 10:30\u2014aired horror pictures like ''Devil Bat's Daughter'' and ''Strangler of the Swamp'' and suspense films such as ''Murder by Invitation'', ''The Charge Is Murder'', and ''Apology for Murder''.<ref>[http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/VampiraShow.html The Vampira Show] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818080411/http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/VampiraShow.html |date=2006-08-18 }}.

As Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, Peterson became the most popular host in the arena of the TV midnight movie. Starting at L.A.'s [[KCAL-TV|KHJ-TV]] in 1981, Elvira's ''Movie Macabre'' was soon being syndicated nationally; Peterson presented mostly cut-rate horror films, interrupted on a regular basis for tongue-in-cheek commentary.<ref>See Gibron (2006) for a detailed analysis of the Elvira persona and ''Movie Macabre''.</ref> Some local stations aired the ''Movie Macabre'' package in late-night slots. Others showed it during [[prime time]] on weekend nights;  after a break for the local news, another genre film\u2014a literal midnight movie\u2014might follow, resulting in such virtual double bills as ''Dr. Heckyl & Mr. Hype'' and ''The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave''.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/elvirafilms.html Elvira's Movie Macabre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112083710/http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/elvirafilms.html |date=2006-11-12 }}.

From Saturday August 20 1966, BBC Two started to air a \"Midnight Movie\" every Saturday night on the channel. The first \"Midnight Movie\" was \"Blind Date\" starring Hardy Kr\u00fcger. The Midnight Movie would air every Saturday night on BBC Two, and would continue through the 1970s.  The Midnight Movie was an attempt by the BBC to provide a late night alternative, when the two other channels BBC One and ITV would normally end their Saturday programming at around 12-midnight. This was partly due to the restrictions imposed on the broadcasting hours of both BBC and ITV by the British government, normally no more than 8 hours in a given day. As BBC Two did not broadcast a large amount of daytime programming, they had plenty of hours to spare to remain on the air late into the night, especially on a Saturday, thus the creation of the \"Midnight Movie\" strand was started. Most of the films aired were at least a decade old, but from 1967 nearly all of the films broadcast were made in color, as BBC Two became the first UK channel in 1967 to transmit color television. It is also noted however, that the \"Midnight Movie\" never actually started at Midnight. The movie was designed to air \"through\" the midnight hour, and could start as early as 11.15pm. By 1983 the \"Midnight Movie\" strand was abandoned by BBC Two, with BBC One airing a late night movie on a Friday night instead, usually a horror film. The \"Midnight Movie\" slot on BBC Two would be replaced with late night sporting coverage or different genre of films on occasions, which would not use the \"Midnight Movie\" strand.\n\n===In the cinema===\nSince at least as far back as the 1930s, [[exploitation film]]s had sometimes been presented at midnight screenings, usually as part of independent roadshow operations.<ref>Schaefer (1999), pp. 124\u2013125.</ref> In 1957, [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]]' ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' set off a spate of midnight presentations.<ref>Heffernan (2004), p. 61.</ref> What film qualifies as the first true midnight movie in the sense of the term that emerged in the 1970s remains an open question. Critic Jennifer M. Wood points to the Palace Theater in San Francisco's [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] district where, in 1968, [[San Francisco Art Institute]] graduates [[Steven Arnold (Artist)|Steven Arnold]] and Michael Wiese, after a sellout screening of their [[Salvador Dal\u00ed|Dal\u00ed]]-esque thesis film ''Messages, Messages'', were invited to program offbeat films at midnight.<ref>Wood (2004).</ref> Author [[Gary Lachman]] claims that [[Kenneth Anger]]'s short ''[[Invocation of My Demon Brother]]'' (1969), a m\u00e9lange of occult symbology intercut with and superimposed on images from a [[Rolling Stones]] concert, \"inaugurat[ed] the midnight movie cult at the [[Elgin Theater|Elgin Theatre]].\"<ref>Lachman (2001), p. 305.</ref> The Elgin, in New York City's [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood, would soon become famous as a midnight venue when it gave the U.S. premiere of a very unusual Mexican movie directed and written by a rather Dal\u00ed-esque Chilean.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Midnight Movies Steven Arnold.png|thumb|300px|right|Screenshot from [[Steven Arnold]]'s '\"Messages, Messages\".]] -->\n\nThe movie generally recognized as igniting the theatrical midnight film movement is [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s surrealist ''[[El Topo]]'', which opened in December 1970 at the Elgin. Playing with the conventions of the [[spaghetti Western]], the film was described by one newspaper critic as \"full of tests and riddles\" and \"more phony gore than maybe 20 years of ''[[The Wild Bunch]]''.\"<ref>Greenspun (1971).</ref> ''El Topo'' regularly sold out every night for months, with many fans returning on a weekly basis. It ran at the theater through June 1971, until at the prompting of [[John Lennon]]\u2014who was reported to have seen the film at least three times\u2014Beatles manager [[Allen Klein]] purchased the film through his [[ABKCO Records|ABKCO]] film company and gave it a relatively orthodox rerelease.<ref>Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), pp. 80, 95. For a detailed synopsis of the film, see [http://www.hotweird.com/jodorowsky/peary.html El Topo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427073138/http://www.hotweird.com/jodorowsky/peary.html |date=2006-04-27 }} (note the film's Elgin premiere is misdated).</ref> The Elgin soon came up with another midnight hit in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s spree-killer thriller ''[[Targets]]'' (1968), featuring one of the last performances by horror movie mainstay [[Boris Karloff]] and a tale that resonated with the assassinations and other political violence of recent years. By November 1971, four Manhattan theaters beside the Elgin were featuring regularly scheduled midnight movies: the St. Marks (''[[Viva la muerte (film)|Viva la muerte]]'', a blast of surrealism in the Franco-Spanish tradition of [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] and another Lennon favorite), the Waverly (''[[Equinox (1970 film)|Equinox]]'', which had just replaced ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''), the Bijou (both ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'' and ''Night of the Living Dead''), and the Olympia (''[[Macuna\u00edma (film)|Macuna\u00edma]]'', a Brazilian political [[black comedy]]).<ref>Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 95.</ref> ''Equinox'' (1970) and ''Night of the Living Dead'' (1968), both low-budget horror pictures, demonstrate the ties between the old, TV brand of midnight movie and the newer phenomenon. [[George A. Romero]]'s zombie masterpiece, in particular, highlights the differences: produced completely outside of the organized studio system, it has a subversive posture evident throughout and especially in its conclusion, an unmistakable allegory of a racist lynching.<ref>Hutchings (2004), p. 112.</ref>{{dubious|date=April 2018}}\n\nShot over the winter of 1971\u201372, [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]'s \"filth epic\" ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', featuring incest and [[coprophagia]], became the best known of a group of campy midnight films focusing on sexual perversions and [[fetishism]].<ref>Waters (2006).</ref> Filmed on weekends in Waters's hometown of Baltimore, with a mile-long extension cord as a power conduit, it was also crucial in inspiring the growth of the [[independent film]] movement.<ref>[http://www.finelinefeatures.com/pink/prodnote.htm Pink Flamingos Production Notes]. Retrieved 11/15/06.</ref> In 1973, the Elgin Theater started midnight screenings of both ''Pink Flamingos'' and a crime drama from Jamaica with a remarkable soundtrack. In its mainstream release, ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' (1972) had been a flop, panned by critics after its U.S. distributor, [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Pictures]], marketed it as a [[blaxploitation]] picture. Rereleased as a midnight film, it screened around the country for six years, helping spur the popularity of [[reggae]] in the United States. While the midnight-movie potential of certain films was recognized only some time after they opened, a number during this period were distributed to take advantage of the market from the beginning\u2014in 1973, for instance, ''Broken Goddess'', ''Dragula'', ''The White Whore and the Bit Player'', and ''Elevator Girls in Bondage'' (as well as ''Pink Flamingos'') had their New York premieres at midnight screenings.<ref name=\"auto\">Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 13.</ref> In 1974, midnight opener ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'' evidenced how the phenomenon lent itself to flirtations with [[pornography]].\n\nAround this time, the black comedy ''[[Harold and Maude]]'' (1971) became the first major Hollywood studio movie of the era to develop a substantial cult audience of repeat viewers; though apparently it was not picked up by much of the midnight movie circuit during the 1970s, it subsequently became a late show staple as the phenomenon turned more to camp revivals.<ref>See Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 298.</ref> The midnight screening phenomenon was spreading around the country. In [[Milwaukee]], it began in May 1974, spurred by the sales manager of a local radio station who had already successfully sponsored such screenings in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. By the following February, four Milwaukee theaters were regularly showing midnight films, and the [[Marcus Corporation|Marcus chain]], the owner of one, had brought the concept to its theaters in four other Midwestern cities. \"Films that feature rock concerts draw big\", ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]]'' reported, \"as do those dealing with outer space and fantasy\". The trade paper noted one popular midnight film by name: ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]'' (1969), a comedy with political overtones starring folk singer [[Arlo Guthrie]].<ref>[http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_020375 \"Midnight Shows a Big Success in Milwaukee.\" ''Boxoffice'' Feb. 3, 1975, p. NC-3]</ref>\n\n[[File:LiquidSkyPoster3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Liquid Sky]]'' (1982) was one of the last independent films to become a midnight hit during the movement's most influential years. As critic Emanuel Levy describes, like many midnight classics, this \"perversely beautiful sci-fi movie...appeared out of nowhere.\"<ref>Levy (1999), p. 185.</ref>]]\nOn the midnight following April Fool's Day 1976, ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', which had flopped on initial release the year before, opened at the [[IFC Center|Waverly Theater]], a leading midnight movie venue in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. Midnight screenings of the film soon became a national sensation, amassing a cult following all over the United States. Every Friday and Saturday night, audience members would talk back to the screen, dress up as characters in the film, and act out scenes complete with props.<ref>See [http://www.rockyhorror.com/history/howapbegan.php History of the Rocky Horror Picture Show] and [http://www.rockyhorror.com/history/timeline.php Rocky Horror Timeline]. Retrieved 11/14/06.</ref> Where the social aspect had always been a part of the midnight movie's attraction, with ''Rocky Horror'' in an exaggerated way it became ''the'' attraction. By summer 1979, the film was playing on weekend midnights in twenty-odd suburban theaters in the New York region alone; [[20th Century Fox]] had approximately two hundred prints of the movie in circulation for midnight shows around the country.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Beginning in 1978, the Waverly developed another midnight success that was much smaller commercially, but more significant artistically: ''[[Eraserhead]]'', originally distributed the previous year. [[David Lynch]]'s feature debut, a model of shoestring surrealism, reaffirmed the midnight movie's most central traditions. Additionally, [[Concert film|concert films]], such as ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii]]'' (1972), ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'' (1976), ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Last Waltz]]'' (1978), became popular midnight screening selections during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe commercial viability of the sort of big-city arthouses that launched outsider pictures for the midnight movie circuit began to decline in the late 1970s as broad social and economic shifts weakened their countercultural base. Leading midnight movie venues were beginning to fold as early as 1977\u2014that year, New York's Bijou switched back permanently to the live entertainment for which it had been built, and the Elgin, after a brief run with gay porn, shut down completely.<ref>[http://cinematreasures.org/theater/2932/ Bijou Theatre]; [http://cinematreasures.org/theater/6353/ Elgin Theatre]. Retrieved 11/15/06.</ref> In succeeding years, the popularization of the [[VCR]] and the expansion of movieviewing possibilities on cable television meant the death of many additional independent theaters. While ''Rocky Horror'' soldiered on, by then a phenomenon unto itself, and new films like ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'' (1979), ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'' (1980), ''[[Forbidden Zone]]'' (1980), ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), ''[[Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall]]'' (1982), ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' (1984) and ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989)\u2014all from mainstream distributors\u2014were picked up by the midnight movie circuit, the core of exhibitors that energized the movement was disappearing. By the time the fabled [[Orson Welles Cinema]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, shut its doors after a fire in 1986, the days of the theatrical midnight movie as a significant countercultural phenomenon were already past.\n\nIn 1988, the midnight movie experience was institutionalized in a new manner with the introduction of the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]'s nightly Midnight Madness section.<ref>Corliss and Catto (2007).</ref> In the years since, new or recent films still occasionally emerge as midnight movie \"hits\" on the circuit of theaters that continue to show them. The most successful of the 1990s generation was the Australian drag queen road saga ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994). One of the theaters to show it regularly at midnight was New York's Waverly (also now closed), where ''Rocky Horror'' had played for a house record ninety-five weeks. A celebrated episode of television's ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' features a song-and-dance battle between ''Rocky Horror'' fans (led by [[Drew Carey]]) and ''Priscilla'' fans (led by [[Kathy Kinney|Mimi Bobeck]]).\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, the most notable success among newly minted midnight movies has been ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' (2001). Older films are also popular on the circuit, appreciated largely in an imposed [[camp (style)|camp]] fashion\u2014a midnight movie tradition that goes back to the 1972 revival of the hectoring anti-drug movie ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' (1938).<ref>See Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), pp. 261\u2013262. For their consideration of ''Freaks'' as part of the early midnight movie phenomenon, see pp. 3, 95, 99, 295\u2013297.</ref> ([[Tod Browning]]'s 1932 horror classic ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'', the original midnight movie revival, is both too dark and too sociologically acute to readily consume as camp.) Where the irony with which ''Reefer Madness'' was adopted as a midnight favorite had its roots in a countercultural sensibility, in the latter's place there is now the parodoxical element of [[nostalgia]]: the leading revivals on the circuit currently include the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] oeuvre\u2014''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' (1985), ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'' (1986), and ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (1986)\u2014and the preteen adventure film ''[[The Goonies]]'' (1985).<ref>Beale (2005).</ref> As of late 2006, ''Rocky Horror'' itself continues to play on a weekly basis at thirty-two venues around the country, and at least once a month at about two dozen others.<ref>[http://www.rockyhorror.com/participation/showtimes_listings.php?type=r Rocky Horror Showings List].

The screening of non-mainstream pictures at midnight was aimed at building a [[cult film]] audience, encouraging repeat viewing and social interaction in what was originally a [[counterculture|countercultural]] setting.\n\nThe national success of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' and the changing economics of the film exhibition industry altered the nature of the midnight movie phenomenon; as its association with broader trends of cultural and political opposition dwindled in the 1980s, the midnight movie became a more purely [[camp (style)|camp]] experience\u2014in effect, bringing it closer to the television form that shares its name. The term ''midnight movie'' is now often used in two different, though related, ways: as a synonym for ''[[B movie]]'', reflecting the relative cheapness characteristic of late-night movies both theatrically and on TV, and as a synonym for ''cult film''.<ref>See, e.g., Conrich (2006).</ref>\n\n==History==\n===On television===\nIn 1953, the [[Screen Actors Guild]] agreed to a [[Residual (entertainment industry)|residuals]] payment plan that greatly facilitated the distribution of B movies to television.<ref>Heffernan (2004), p. 161.</ref> A number of local television stations around the United States soon began showing inexpensive genre films in late-night slots; these late-night slots were after the [[watershed (broadcasting)|safe-harbor time]], meaning they were largely exempt from [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations on indecent content. In the spring of 1954, Los Angeles TV station [[KABC-TV|KABC]] expanded on the concept by having an appropriately offbeat host introduce the films: for a year on Saturday nights, ''[[The Vampira Show]]'', with [[Maila Nurmi]] in her newly adopted persona of a sexy bloodsucker (\"Your pin-down girl\"), presented low-budget movies with black humor and a low-cut black dress. The show\u2014which ran at midnight for four weeks before shifting to 11 p.m. and, later, 10:30\u2014aired horror pictures like ''Devil Bat's Daughter'' and ''Strangler of the Swamp'' and suspense films such as ''Murder by Invitation'', ''The Charge Is Murder'', and ''Apology for Murder''.<ref>[http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/VampiraShow.html The Vampira Show] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818080411/http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/VampiraShow.html |date=2006-08-18 }}.

As Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, Peterson became the most popular host in the arena of the TV midnight movie. Starting at L.A.'s [[KCAL-TV|KHJ-TV]] in 1981, Elvira's ''Movie Macabre'' was soon being syndicated nationally; Peterson presented mostly cut-rate horror films, interrupted on a regular basis for tongue-in-cheek commentary.<ref>See Gibron (2006) for a detailed analysis of the Elvira persona and ''Movie Macabre''.</ref> Some local stations aired the ''Movie Macabre'' package in late-night slots. Others showed it during [[prime time]] on weekend nights;  after a break for the local news, another genre film\u2014a literal midnight movie\u2014might follow, resulting in such virtual double bills as ''Dr. Heckyl & Mr. Hype'' and ''The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave''.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/elvirafilms.html Elvira's Movie Macabre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112083710/http://www.milwaukee-horror-hosts.com/elvirafilms.html |date=2006-11-12 }}.

In 1993, Buffalo's [[WKBW-TV]] began airing a late-night hosted mix of low-budget genre movies, foreign art films and eventually well-known classic films; ''[[Off Beat Cinema]]'' later became nationally syndicated (currently through [[Retro Television Network]]) and, as of 2013, originates from [[WBBZ-TV]]. In the 2000s, horror-oriented late-night movie programming has disappeared from many broadcast stations, though B pictures, mostly of a melodramatic nature, are still widely used in post\u2013prime time slots.

From Saturday August 20 1966, BBC Two started to air a \"Midnight Movie\" every Saturday night on the channel. The first \"Midnight Movie\" was \"Blind Date\" starring Hardy Kr\u00fcger. The Midnight Movie would air every Saturday night on BBC Two, and would continue through the 1970s.  The Midnight Movie was an attempt by the BBC to provide a late night alternative, when the two other channels BBC One and ITV would normally end their Saturday programming at around 12-midnight. This was partly due to the restrictions imposed on the broadcasting hours of both BBC and ITV by the British government, normally no more than 8 hours in a given day. As BBC Two did not broadcast a large amount of daytime programming, they had plenty of hours to spare to remain on the air late into the night, especially on a Saturday, thus the creation of the \"Midnight Movie\" strand was started. Most of the films aired were at least a decade old, but from 1967 nearly all of the films broadcast were made in color, as BBC Two became the first UK channel in 1967 to transmit color television. It is also noted however, that the \"Midnight Movie\" never actually started at Midnight. The movie was designed to air \"through\" the midnight hour, and could start as early as 11.15pm. By 1983 the \"Midnight Movie\" strand was abandoned by BBC Two, with BBC One airing a late night movie on a Friday night instead, usually a horror film. The \"Midnight Movie\" slot on BBC Two would be replaced with late night sporting coverage or different genre of films on occasions, which would not use the \"Midnight Movie\" strand.\n\n===In the cinema===\nSince at least as far back as the 1930s, [[exploitation film]]s had sometimes been presented at midnight screenings, usually as part of independent roadshow operations.<ref>Schaefer (1999), pp. 124\u2013125.</ref> In 1957, [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]]' ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' set off a spate of midnight presentations.<ref>Heffernan (2004), p. 61.</ref> What film qualifies as the first true midnight movie in the sense of the term that emerged in the 1970s remains an open question. Critic Jennifer M. Wood points to the Palace Theater in San Francisco's [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] district where, in 1968, [[San Francisco Art Institute]] graduates [[Steven Arnold (Artist)|Steven Arnold]] and Michael Wiese, after a sellout screening of their [[Salvador Dal\u00ed|Dal\u00ed]]-esque thesis film ''Messages, Messages'', were invited to program offbeat films at midnight.<ref>Wood (2004).</ref> Author [[Gary Lachman]] claims that [[Kenneth Anger]]'s short ''[[Invocation of My Demon Brother]]'' (1969), a m\u00e9lange of occult symbology intercut with and superimposed on images from a [[Rolling Stones]] concert, \"inaugurat[ed] the midnight movie cult at the [[Elgin Theater|Elgin Theatre]].\"<ref>Lachman (2001), p. 305.</ref> The Elgin, in New York City's [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood, would soon become famous as a midnight venue when it gave the U.S. premiere of a very unusual Mexican movie directed and written by a rather Dal\u00ed-esque Chilean.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Midnight Movies Steven Arnold.png|thumb|300px|right|Screenshot from [[Steven Arnold]]'s '\"Messages, Messages\".]] -->\n\nThe movie generally recognized as igniting the theatrical midnight film movement is [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s surrealist ''[[El Topo]]'', which opened in December 1970 at the Elgin. Playing with the conventions of the [[spaghetti Western]], the film was described by one newspaper critic as \"full of tests and riddles\" and \"more phony gore than maybe 20 years of ''[[The Wild Bunch]]''.\"<ref>Greenspun (1971).</ref> ''El Topo'' regularly sold out every night for months, with many fans returning on a weekly basis. It ran at the theater through June 1971, until at the prompting of [[John Lennon]]\u2014who was reported to have seen the film at least three times\u2014Beatles manager [[Allen Klein]] purchased the film through his [[ABKCO Records|ABKCO]] film company and gave it a relatively orthodox rerelease.<ref>Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), pp. 80, 95. For a detailed synopsis of the film, see [http://www.hotweird.com/jodorowsky/peary.html El Topo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427073138/http://www.hotweird.com/jodorowsky/peary.html |date=2006-04-27 }} (note the film's Elgin premiere is misdated).</ref> The Elgin soon came up with another midnight hit in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s spree-killer thriller ''[[Targets]]'' (1968), featuring one of the last performances by horror movie mainstay [[Boris Karloff]] and a tale that resonated with the assassinations and other political violence of recent years. By November 1971, four Manhattan theaters beside the Elgin were featuring regularly scheduled midnight movies: the St. Marks (''[[Viva la muerte (film)|Viva la muerte]]'', a blast of surrealism in the Franco-Spanish tradition of [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]] and another Lennon favorite), the Waverly (''[[Equinox (1970 film)|Equinox]]'', which had just replaced ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''), the Bijou (both ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'' and ''Night of the Living Dead''), and the Olympia (''[[Macuna\u00edma (film)|Macuna\u00edma]]'', a Brazilian political [[black comedy]]).<ref>Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 95.</ref> ''Equinox'' (1970) and ''Night of the Living Dead'' (1968), both low-budget horror pictures, demonstrate the ties between the old, TV brand of midnight movie and the newer phenomenon. [[George A. Romero]]'s zombie masterpiece, in particular, highlights the differences: produced completely outside of the organized studio system, it has a subversive posture evident throughout and especially in its conclusion, an unmistakable allegory of a racist lynching.<ref>Hutchings (2004), p. 112.</ref>{{dubious|date=April 2018}}\n\nShot over the winter of 1971\u201372, [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]'s \"filth epic\" ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', featuring incest and [[coprophagia]], became the best known of a group of campy midnight films focusing on sexual perversions and [[fetishism]].<ref>Waters (2006).</ref> Filmed on weekends in Waters's hometown of Baltimore, with a mile-long extension cord as a power conduit, it was also crucial in inspiring the growth of the [[independent film]] movement.<ref>[http://www.finelinefeatures.com/pink/prodnote.htm Pink Flamingos Production Notes]. Retrieved 11/15/06.</ref> In 1973, the Elgin Theater started midnight screenings of both ''Pink Flamingos'' and a crime drama from Jamaica with a remarkable soundtrack. In its mainstream release, ''[[The Harder They Come]]'' (1972) had been a flop, panned by critics after its U.S. distributor, [[Roger Corman]]'s [[New World Pictures]], marketed it as a [[blaxploitation]] picture. Rereleased as a midnight film, it screened around the country for six years, helping spur the popularity of [[reggae]] in the United States. While the midnight-movie potential of certain films was recognized only some time after they opened, a number during this period were distributed to take advantage of the market from the beginning\u2014in 1973, for instance, ''Broken Goddess'', ''Dragula'', ''The White Whore and the Bit Player'', and ''Elevator Girls in Bondage'' (as well as ''Pink Flamingos'') had their New York premieres at midnight screenings.<ref name=\"auto\">Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 13.</ref> In 1974, midnight opener ''[[Flesh Gordon]]'' evidenced how the phenomenon lent itself to flirtations with [[pornography]].\n\nAround this time, the black comedy ''[[Harold and Maude]]'' (1971) became the first major Hollywood studio movie of the era to develop a substantial cult audience of repeat viewers; though apparently it was not picked up by much of the midnight movie circuit during the 1970s, it subsequently became a late show staple as the phenomenon turned more to camp revivals.<ref>See Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), p. 298.</ref> The midnight screening phenomenon was spreading around the country. In [[Milwaukee]], it began in May 1974, spurred by the sales manager of a local radio station who had already successfully sponsored such screenings in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. By the following February, four Milwaukee theaters were regularly showing midnight films, and the [[Marcus Corporation|Marcus chain]], the owner of one, had brought the concept to its theaters in four other Midwestern cities. \"Films that feature rock concerts draw big\", ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice]]'' reported, \"as do those dealing with outer space and fantasy\". The trade paper noted one popular midnight film by name: ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]'' (1969), a comedy with political overtones starring folk singer [[Arlo Guthrie]].<ref>[http://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_020375 \"Midnight Shows a Big Success in Milwaukee.\" ''Boxoffice'' Feb. 3, 1975, p. NC-3]</ref>\n\n[[File:LiquidSkyPoster3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''[[Liquid Sky]]'' (1982) was one of the last independent films to become a midnight hit during the movement's most influential years. As critic Emanuel Levy describes, like many midnight classics, this \"perversely beautiful sci-fi movie...appeared out of nowhere.\"<ref>Levy (1999), p. 185.</ref>]]\nOn the midnight following April Fool's Day 1976, ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', which had flopped on initial release the year before, opened at the [[IFC Center|Waverly Theater]], a leading midnight movie venue in New York's [[Greenwich Village]]. Midnight screenings of the film soon became a national sensation, amassing a cult following all over the United States. Every Friday and Saturday night, audience members would talk back to the screen, dress up as characters in the film, and act out scenes complete with props.<ref>See [http://www.rockyhorror.com/history/howapbegan.php History of the Rocky Horror Picture Show] and [http://www.rockyhorror.com/history/timeline.php Rocky Horror Timeline]. Retrieved 11/14/06.</ref> Where the social aspect had always been a part of the midnight movie's attraction, with ''Rocky Horror'' in an exaggerated way it became ''the'' attraction. By summer 1979, the film was playing on weekend midnights in twenty-odd suburban theaters in the New York region alone; [[20th Century Fox]] had approximately two hundred prints of the movie in circulation for midnight shows around the country.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Beginning in 1978, the Waverly developed another midnight success that was much smaller commercially, but more significant artistically: ''[[Eraserhead]]'', originally distributed the previous year. [[David Lynch]]'s feature debut, a model of shoestring surrealism, reaffirmed the midnight movie's most central traditions. Additionally, [[Concert film|concert films]], such as ''[[Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii]]'' (1972), ''[[The Song Remains the Same (film)|The Song Remains the Same]]'' (1976), ''[[The Grateful Dead Movie]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Last Waltz]]'' (1978), became popular midnight screening selections during the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nThe commercial viability of the sort of big-city arthouses that launched outsider pictures for the midnight movie circuit began to decline in the late 1970s as broad social and economic shifts weakened their countercultural base. Leading midnight movie venues were beginning to fold as early as 1977\u2014that year, New York's Bijou switched back permanently to the live entertainment for which it had been built, and the Elgin, after a brief run with gay porn, shut down completely.<ref>[http://cinematreasures.org/theater/2932/ Bijou Theatre]; [http://cinematreasures.org/theater/6353/ Elgin Theatre]. Retrieved 11/15/06.</ref> In succeeding years, the popularization of the [[VCR]] and the expansion of movieviewing possibilities on cable television meant the death of many additional independent theaters. While ''Rocky Horror'' soldiered on, by then a phenomenon unto itself, and new films like ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'' (1979), ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'' (1980), ''[[Forbidden Zone]]'' (1980), ''[[The Evil Dead]]'' (1981), ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' (1981), ''[[Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall]]'' (1982), ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' (1984) and ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (1989)\u2014all from mainstream distributors\u2014were picked up by the midnight movie circuit, the core of exhibitors that energized the movement was disappearing. By the time the fabled [[Orson Welles Cinema]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, shut its doors after a fire in 1986, the days of the theatrical midnight movie as a significant countercultural phenomenon were already past.\n\nIn 1988, the midnight movie experience was institutionalized in a new manner with the introduction of the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]'s nightly Midnight Madness section.<ref>Corliss and Catto (2007).</ref> In the years since, new or recent films still occasionally emerge as midnight movie \"hits\" on the circuit of theaters that continue to show them. The most successful of the 1990s generation was the Australian drag queen road saga ''[[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]]'' (1994). One of the theaters to show it regularly at midnight was New York's Waverly (also now closed), where ''Rocky Horror'' had played for a house record ninety-five weeks. A celebrated episode of television's ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' features a song-and-dance battle between ''Rocky Horror'' fans (led by [[Drew Carey]]) and ''Priscilla'' fans (led by [[Kathy Kinney|Mimi Bobeck]]).\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, the most notable success among newly minted midnight movies has been ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' (2001). Older films are also popular on the circuit, appreciated largely in an imposed [[camp (style)|camp]] fashion\u2014a midnight movie tradition that goes back to the 1972 revival of the hectoring anti-drug movie ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' (1938).<ref>See Hoberman and Rosenbaum (1983), pp. 261\u2013262. For their consideration of ''Freaks'' as part of the early midnight movie phenomenon, see pp. 3, 95, 99, 295\u2013297.</ref> ([[Tod Browning]]'s 1932 horror classic ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'', the original midnight movie revival, is both too dark and too sociologically acute to readily consume as camp.) Where the irony with which ''Reefer Madness'' was adopted as a midnight favorite had its roots in a countercultural sensibility, in the latter's place there is now the parodoxical element of [[nostalgia]]: the leading revivals on the circuit currently include the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] oeuvre\u2014''[[The Breakfast Club]]'' (1985), ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'' (1986), and ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (1986)\u2014and the preteen adventure film ''[[The Goonies]]'' (1985).<ref>Beale (2005).</ref> As of late 2006, ''Rocky Horror'' itself continues to play on a weekly basis at thirty-two venues around the country, and at least once a month at about two dozen others.<ref>[http://www.rockyhorror.com/participation/showtimes_listings.php?type=r Rocky Horror Showings List].
