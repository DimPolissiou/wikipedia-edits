In other words, the basis in which the ship maintains its center of gravity is its distance set equally apart from both the aft and forward section of the ship.\n\nWhile a body floats on a liquid surface it still encounters the force of gravity pushing down on it. In order to stay afloat and avoid sinking there is an opposed force acting against the body known as the hydrostatic pressures. The forces acting on the body must be of the same magnitude and same line of motion in order to maintain the body at equilibrium. This description of equilibrium is only present when a freely floating body is in still water, when other conditions are present the magnitude of which these forces shifts drastically creating the swaying motion of the body.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Naval Architecture|last=Tupper|first=Eric|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=1996|isbn=|location=Oxford, England|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the body, in other words, the mass of the body is equal to the mass of the water displaced by the body. This adds an upward force to the body by the amount of surface area times the area displaced in order to create an equilibrium between the surface of the body and the surface of the water.\n\nThe stability of a ship under most conditions is able to overcome any form or restriction or resistance encountered in rough seas; however, ships have undesirable roll characteristics when the balance of oscillations in roll is two times that of oscillations in heave, thus causing the ship to capsize.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neves|first=M.

This demanding leadership role requires managerial qualities and the ability to bring together the often-conflicting demands of the various design constraints to produce a product which is fit for the purpose.<ref>{{cite web|title=Job Family Standard for Professional Work in the Engineering and Architecture Group, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, pp. 43\u201345 |url=http://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512122916/https://www.opm.gov/fedclass/gs0800P.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-12 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to this leadership role, a naval architect also has a specialist function in ensuring that a safe, economic, environmentally sound and [[seaworthy]] design is produced. To undertake all these tasks, a naval architect must have an understanding of many branches of engineering and must be in the forefront of high technology areas. He or she must be able to effectively utilize the services provided by scientists, lawyers, accountants, and business people of many kinds.\n\nNaval architects typically work for [[shipyard]]s, ship owners, design firms and consultancies, equipment manufacturers, [[Classification society|Classification societies]], regulatory bodies ([[Admiralty law]]), [[Navy|navies]], and governments.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Shipbuilding}}\n* {{annotated link|Hull (watercraft)}}\n* {{annotated link|Classification society}}\n* {{annotated link|International Maritime Organization}}\n* {{annotated link|Royal Institution of Naval Architects}}\n* {{annotated link|Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers}}\n* {{annotated link|Marine architecture}}\n* {{annotated link|Offshore construction}}\n* {{annotated link|Marine engineering|Marine Engineering}}\n* {{annotated link|Hydraulic engineering}}\n* {{annotated link|Engine officer}}\n* {{annotated link|List of maritime colleges}}\n* {{annotated link|Bulkhead (partition)}}\n* {{annotated link|Longitudinal framing}}\n* {{annotated link|Ship stability}}\n* {{annotated link|Ship motions}}\n* {{annotated link|Marine propulsion}}\n* {{annotated link|Naval ship}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Ferreiro |first=Larrie D. |date=2007 |title=Ships and Science: The Birth of Naval Architecture in the Scientific Revolution, 1600\u20131800 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-06259-6}}\n* Paasch, H.

He is a former [[electronics]] [[engineer]] who was once the business partner of Gregory Bestman; Bestman handled the finances whilst Toomes handled the inventions. One day, after creating a flight harness, Toomes eagerly rushed into Bestman's office to share the happy news. However, Bestman was not there, and Toomes discovered that Bestman had secretly been embezzling funds and that Toomes had no legal recourse, meaning he lost his job. Enraged, Toomes wrecked the business, discovering that the harness also granted him superhuman strength. He then decided to turn to crime professionally as the Vulture.\n\nThe Vulture employs a special harness of his own design that allows him to [[flight|fly]]; his flight is directed by a pair of wings worn on his arms. The harness also endows him with enhanced strength and (according to some sources) increases his lifespan. Although Toomes is advanced in age, he is a strong fighter and a remorseless killer. On one occasion, he restored his youth through biochemical means,<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #388\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #388</ref> though this wore off after exposure to an [[elemental]] [[superhuman]]'s corpse.<ref name=\"The Sensational Spider-Man #18\">''The Sensational Spider-Man #18</ref> At one point, he had used a device to steal Spider-Man's youth, leaving Vulture young and Spider-Man elderly, but this effect wore off within hours.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #387</ref>\n\nVulture was on a robbery and burglary spree throughout [[New York City]] when he first encountered [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man realized for the first time he could sell photos to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] after the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' offered a reward for a picture of Vulture.<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 18|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [Stan] Lee and [Steve] Ditko focused on Peter Parker's career when they had Spider-Man develop a knack for photography in the first of [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2's] two stories. As the sinister Vulture - soon to be a major foe of Spidey \u2013 debuted, Peter Parker set out to earn the reward money offered by ''The Daily Bugle'' for snapping a photo of the winged villain.}}</ref> Due to his preoccupation with his camera, Spider-Man was knocked out by Vulture and sealed in a watertank with sides too slippery to climb up, but was able to break free. Vulture then challenged the police, saying he was going to steal diamonds; however, he escaped through the sewer. Spider-Man had created a device that stopped Vulture's harness from working and activated it during an airborne fight with Vulture, causing the two to crash onto a roof, knocking Vulture unconscious. He was then arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2</ref> Vulture modified his harness, and attempted to rob the ''Daily Bugle'' payroll.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #7</ref> He joined [[Doctor Octopus]]'s first [[Sinister Six]], and gave the message to the ''Daily Bugle'' that they had captured [[Betty Brant]]. He was the last foe to battle Spider-Man before Doctor Octopus. He forced Spider-Man to remove his web-shooters by threatening to fly away, then squirted oil onto the roof, and tried to push Spider-Man off using a wind created by his wings, but Spider-Man escaped this. The Vulture was caught after Spider-Man swung onto him using a [[lasso]]. He then told Spider-Man where to find the lair of Doctor Octopus, and like the rest of the team was jailed by the end of the story.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref>\n\nLater, believing himself to be dying in prison due to injuries in the [[prison]] [[workshop]], Toomes revealed the location of an extra Vulture outfit on the prison grounds to his cellmate Blackie Drago (who became the second Vulture). Blackie revealed to Toomes he caused the accident for this purpose. Toomes was angry, but apparently fell unconscious within the next few minutes; Blackie knocked out a guard, dug up the wings, and escaped.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #48\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #48</ref> Drago, as the Vulture, teamed with [[Kraven the Hunter]] against Spider-Man.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #49\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #49</ref> Toomes ultimately got out of prison \u2013 crediting his hatred for Drago's actions with the strength to overcome his injuries \u2013 and defeated Drago.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #63\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #63</ref> Toomes then nearly defeated Spider-Man in battle, injuring his arm before Spider-Man managed to play possum and tricked Toomes into coming in close enough for Spider-Man to damage his power pack and force his enemy to back off.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #64</ref> Some time later, Dr. Clifton Shallot mutated his body into a form resembling Toomes', but possessing natural wings and flight capability.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #127\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #127</ref>\n\nVulture later humiliated the racketeering mobster Mr. Morgan, who hired the [[Hitman (Marvel Comics)|Hitman]] to kill Spider-Man, trying to rob the Vulture of his revenge.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #4\u20135</ref> Vulture then arranged the murder of New York's top mobsters to become New York's new crime lord, and battled Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #44\u201345</ref> Vulture later escaped prison, and battled Spider-Man again.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #224\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #224</ref>\n\nVulture came out of retirement to claim vengeance on Gregory Bestman, his former research partner who embezzled him out of the profits.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #240\u2013241</ref> He then confronted the [[#Vulturions|Vulturions]], a group of criminal youths who stole his designs.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #1\u20132</ref>\n\nHe became involved in Atlantic City casino racketeering to prepare for his own ostentatious funeral, but was thwarted by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #24</ref> Reduced to a \"mere salesman\", he journeyed to Las Vegas, where he attacked Morris \"Snake\" Diamond in the middle of the desert for stealing Toomes' blueprint journals for ultrasonic-sensitive dice. Intending to inject Snake with a mummification serum, Vulture was thwarted by Spider-Man (who had been granted a flight on Snake's plane back to New York) and agent Sara Glenville of the Central Intelligence Division.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #45</ref> He later confronted the mutants [[Rusty Collins]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] in an attempt to release [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #86</ref>\n\nOn more than one occasion, Toomes has been in league with several other Spider-Man villains in order to destroy the wall-crawler. Vulture has been in every incarnation of the Sinister Six, and appeared in the ranks of the Sinister Twelve. He has a strong friendship with fellow villain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]; the two of them nearly beat Spider-Man to death.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2</ref>\n\nDuring one of his many periods of ill health, Toomes struck up a friendship with Nathan Lubensky, a man who had become the new love of [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s life. Nathan was unaware of Toomes' true identity, and encouraged the injured criminal to take his chances with life and not to let handicaps drag him down (Nathan was a paraplegic). Toomes followed Nathan's advice and went on a crime spree as the Vulture while hiding out in his civilian identity at the same nursing home Nathan lived in, reasoning that the authorities would never think to look for him there. After Peter Parker visited the nursing home and recognized him, however, a battle ensued between the Vulture and Spider-Man. During the course of the fight, Toomes instinctively grabbed a hostage and threatened to kill him if Spider-Man didn't back down; however, as soon as Toomes realized that the hostage was Nathan, he decided he couldn't take the life of a man who had helped to save his own. He shoved Nathan's wheelchair at Spider-Man, distracting the web-slinger long enough for Toomes to make his getaway.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #224\"/>\n\nVulture would seemingly cherish Nathan's influence, but irony would serve him a cruel blow when he was hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to assassinate a high-ranking casino runner. During another conflict with Spider-Man just prior to joining Doctor Octopus's new Sinister Six, the Vulture sought to use a hostage as a shield, and selected May Parker from the crowd. Nathan, who was with May, leapt from his wheelchair and grabbed Toomes.  Not realizing who it was, Toomes flew high into the air with Nathan on his back.  The shock of seeing how high they were caused Nathan to suffer a fatal heart attack. Toomes fled as Nathan was falling. Though he was successfully caught by Spider-Man, Nathan would die in May's arms.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #336\u2013339</ref>\n\nToomes was later diagnosed with cancer, caused by frequent exposure to the essentials needed to power his flying apparatus. In an attempt to be forgiven for all of his previous sins, Vulture terrorized the Parker household, pleading that May Parker forgive him for indirectly causing Nathan's death. An enraged Parker attacked Toomes, forcing the Vulture to capture him and take him back to his old lair. After escaping Toomes, Peter switched to Spider-Man and brutally assaulted the Vulture, and in the ensuing battle, Vulture's own power pack malfunctioned and exploded, setting his wings ablaze. Spider-Man successfully ripped the burning pack off of Toomes, and the two crash landed in a muddy ditch.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #187</ref>\n\nAfter being arrested, Toomes was returned to the Parker home so May, reunited with Peter, could identify him. May hoped that Toomes' death would be slow and full of suffering. The next day, she visited Toomes in prison and apologized to him for her cruel remarks, but also stated that she could not forgive him, and that any kind of redemption would be left up to him and [[God]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #188</ref>\n\nVulture stumbled across a plot by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and the [[Harry Osborn|Green Goblin]] (Harry Osborn) to drive Spider-Man insane by having [[shapeshifting]] [[android (robot)|androids]] impersonate his late mother and father; due to Toomes' interference, the androids were destroyed, leading the wall-crawler to a brief nervous breakdown. The Vulture absorbed the artificial life force from the Mary Parker android, and the effect on the Vulture was twofold; not only did he become a young man again, but he was instantly cured of his cancer.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #388\"/> During this period he attempted to kill everyone who'd ever known him as an old man in an attempt to get a clean slate for his life, but this plan went wrong when he targeted a Prowler impersonator as the Prowler having once thwarted his attempted takeover of his old company; Toomes was unconcerned about the fact that the current Prowler was a thief who'd stolen costume of the original [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]] (Hobie Brown) and Spider-Man; although Toomes nearly gutted the fake Prowler, Spider-Man managed to get him to the hospital. During a later fight with Spider-Man, the Vulture was 'attacked' by David Kalen, a man capable of dissolving anything he touched who had turned his power on himself in his grief at the death of his brother. Toomes subsequently reverted to his old age, presumably due to Kalen's power having negated the youth effect.<ref name=\"The Sensational Spider-Man #18\"/>\n\nIn the ''[[Identity Disc]]'' series, it was revealed that Toomes, with the help of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], manipulated Marvel villains [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Deadpool]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] into laying siege to terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] headquarters in order to retrieve a disc containing the identities of undercover [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives (including that of Toomes' daughter, [[Valeria Toomes]], aka \"Valerie Jessup\").{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nDuring a brief time working for the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], he failed in a mission (and had his face brutally slashed by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]) and was severely beaten as punishment. He subsequently revealed himself as a member of [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Sinister Twelve]] \u2014 though he wore a helmet, presumably to mask the wounds.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #9\u201312</ref>\n\nUnder the tutelage of [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of Kraven the Hunter, Toomes briefly attempted a stint at heroism, but before long he returned to the other side of the law.<ref>''Spider-Man: Get Kraven'' #4</ref>\n\nAside from his daughter, Toomes also has a son whom he has dismissed, and a grandson from that son. The Vulture has come to care deeply for both his grandson and his mother, committing a series of robberies to finance a cure for his grandson's terminal illness. He once had a nephew, Malachai Toomes, and flew into a killing rage when he was murdered by a gang-lord.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n[[File:519px-Vulture.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Adrian Toomes in his red and black Vulture design in ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]''.

When he was found and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D., he complained, \"that lunatic broke my damn nose.\" After Spider-Man unmasked himself, Toomes was seen in his jail cell, knitting his fingers together. As someone on the television set said they hoped it would not be any trouble for Spider-Man, Toomes said, \"Oh I think it will be.\"<ref>''Civil War'' #2</ref>\n\nAfter Spider-Man goes rogue, Toomes is seen in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison cell speaking with Agent [[Jamie Madrox]], and commenting on Spider-Man's inherent weakness, that being his unwillingness to use his powers for personal gain. S.H.I.E.L.D. then returns his flying harness and encourages him to hunt down Spider-Man, saying that he \"is now an outlaw, same as you.\"<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #14</ref>\n\nLater, the Vulture attacks Spider-Man at a book signing, and manages to slash him with a powerful sedative. Toomes, however, falls unconscious and, sensing something is wrong, Spider-Man rushes him to the hospital.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #15</ref>\n\nToomes wakes up a few hours later, where a doctor reveals that he has suffered a [[stroke]], and many of his muscles on the left side of his body have been paralyzed. When the doctor leaves, Spider-Man sneaks in and Toomes asks him to kill him because he is weak. When Spider-Man refuses to do so, he says that Spider-Man is also weak, and always has been. After making remarks about Uncle Ben, Spider-Man takes a pillow and begins suffocating him. He fights back, and Spidey removes the pillow, commenting that \"For somebody who's begging to die, you fight for life pretty hard.\"<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #16</ref>\n\nWhen Alyosha Kravinoff began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Vulture was one of his captives.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol.2 #13</ref> To stop Vulture from using his intellect to find a way to remove his bomb collar, Kraven broke his hands repeatedly,<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol.2 #14</ref> but with the help of Rhino, Vulture escapes.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol.2 #15</ref>\n\nSpider-Man later visits Vulture's cell to ask him about the latest person who calls himself the Vulture. Toomes says calmly that he has no connection to him, though he heard that the new Vulture was made that way by the mob and is out for revenge. He just as blandly states that while he normally hates people who steal the Vulture name, he would have no problem with him killing Spider-Man.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #594\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #594</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Vulture returns as the leader of an unnamed gang of penthouse thieves and murderers who have vulture-like wings, but with a new gothic style. The members of his gang have the same name of an angel that matches with the black angel look they have.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #674</ref> However, it is swiftly revealed that the gang's technology is actually controlled by the Vulture, who designed their wings so that he could shut them down with a simple signal if they tried to act against him. Having used his new magnetically sensitive webbing to catch the gang and deactivate their wings, Spider-Man defeats Toomes despite his new use of his gravity-manipulating technology to give himself seemingly superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #675</ref>\n\n[[Carlie Cooper]] later works with the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) to investigate a series of crimes committed by the Vulture's gang. Superior Spider-Man confronts Vulture and attempts to bribe him into giving up crime by offering him a small fortune from Octavius's hidden bank accounts. Vulture does not believe a word of it, and has his midget henchmen attack. Superior Spider-Man accidentally knocks out one of the midget henchmen, who turns out to be a young boy. Realizing that the Vulture has been using children all this time and remembering his own abusive childhood, Superior Spider-Man attacks Vulture in a rage. After a brief midair struggle, Spider-Man blinds the Vulture with a searchlight, causing him to crash onto the roof. Carlie arrives and finds Vulture, broken and bloody but still alive.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #3</ref> The Vulture's child henchmen are then recruited by the Goblin King to be part of the Goblin Nation.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #4</ref> Vulture is later seen in the Raft's infirmary, along with [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]]. When [[Alistair Smythe]] escapes with the mini Spider-Slayers' help, the mini Spider-Slayers are sent into the infirmary to heal and enhance Vulture, Boomerang, and Scorpion in exchange for their assistance in killing Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref> While Superior Spider-Man fights Boomerang, Vulture is sent to attack the civilians in the Raft.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12</ref> [[Glory Grant]], [[Norah Winters]], and Smythe's lawyer plead with him to stop, claiming they can clear him of any charges, causing him to stop and consider his options. When Smythe dies, the Vulture's enhancements fail, leaving him blind once again. He is then tasered by Ted Shipley, the Raft's chief of security.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13</ref> Vulture eventually has another encounter with the Superior Spider-Man, seeking revenge for his recent defeats but is defeated again.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #1</ref> Vulture, Chameleon, Electro, Sandman, and [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]] are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the \"Superior Six\", which is forced via mind control to perform heroic (and occasionally dangerous) deeds as an act of \"redemption\". When they are not being controlled, they are kept in containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5</ref> They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, nearly destroying New York in the process.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6</ref> Superior Spider-Man barely manages to stop them with Sun Girl's help.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7</ref>\n\nAdrian Toomes later developed a modified version of his Electromagnetic Wing Harness that has a reinforced helmet and lightweight, razor-sharp, nano-woven wings which responded to his mental commands where he took on the '''[[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]''' name which he believed to be vacant at the time. He robbed a location in East Village where he fought Spider-Man until they were immobilized by a new [[Trapster]] who made off with Falcon's loot.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 Secret Empire''</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Hunt for Wolverine]]\" storyline, Spider-Man was seen thwarting Vulture's robbery when he is called in by Iron Man to help him, Luke Cage, and Jessica Jones find Wolverine's body when it goes missing from his unmarked grave.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: The Adamantium Agenda'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn a prelude to the \"Hunted\" storyline, Vulture is among the animal-themed characters captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] on Kraven the Hunter's behalf. He is among those who [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] publicly reveals as the [[Savage Six]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nVulture is revealed to have a son named Frankie Toomes who married to a woman named Lenora. When Frankie left Lenora, Toomes often visited Lenora and her daughter Tiana to support them. At one point, he as Vulture took Tiana on a ride in his Vulture suit. After Lenora died from a surgical error, Adrian started to take care of Tiana. As Tiana came to age, Adrian made her a suit similar to his so that Tiana can follow whatever destiny awaits for her. This led to Tiana becoming Starling.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nUtilizing his Vulture harness, Adrian Toomes is able to fly as if by natural winged flight. He wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric housing a tailored electromagnetic harness with bird-like wings attached beneath the arms. This consists of an electromagnetic anti-graviton generator worn on his body as a harness enabling him to fly silently with precise maneuverability. The Vulture harness also increases his resistance to injury to the point that he can survive blows from Spider-Man's enhanced strength. Another by-product of his exposure to the harness is that despite his age and lack of exercise, Toomes' physical strength represents the upper limit of human development. When he removes the harness some of his enhanced abilities slowly fade, although the rate at which this transpires remains unclear (some writers have suggested that his strength is permanent). Toomes is elderly and depends on his electromagnetic harness to augment his strength, vitality, and athletic prowess as well as absorbing life force to maintain his vitality. It has recently been revealed that, due to his prolonged use of the harness, Toomes can levitate or float his body even without the Vulture harness, although he requires his wings to maneuver while airborne. Toomes has a new version of his Vulture flight harness that has supposedly been augmented by the Green Goblin. Though he claimed that it increased his strength by five-hundred percent, it appeared to be a bluff to frighten the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] who proceeded to beat him half to death. Toomes is intellectually brilliant in the fields of electronics and mechanical engineering, with a great talent for invention. He has earned a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering.\n\n==Other characters named Vulture==\n\n===Blackie Drago===\n'''Raniero''' \"'''Blackie'''\" '''Drago''' was a prison cellmate of Adrian Toomes's. He tricked Toomes by causing an accident in the prison workshop that made Toomes think he could die soon, and stole the Vulture harness and costume which was recently rebuilt. He used the suit to make money through air piracy which led to a confrontation with Spider-Man, that Blackie believed ended in the wall-crawler's death (Spidey had merely collapsed due to a serious cold in reality).<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #48\"/> After robbing a helicopter, Drago was pursued by Kraven the Hunter, who resented his claims of victory over Spider-Man, and ended up fighting him until Spider-Man arrived. Spider-Man managed to defeat them both and webbed them up for the police.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #49\"/>\n\nDrago was later 'rescued' from prison by Toomes- who revealed that the revelation of Drago's role in his accident had given him the strength to overcome his injuries- but that was merely so that Toomes could prove himself the true Vulture once again. Once the two were free, he was subsequently defeated and humiliated by Toomes who regained the recognition he deserved. A humbled Blackie was taken away by the police, vowing \"I'm through!! I'll never put these wings on again!\"<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #63\"/>\n\nHe was seen in the same prison that Norman Osborn was incarcerated in during the \"Sinister Twelve\" storyline.<ref>''Marvel Knight: Spider-Man'' #10</ref>\n\n===Clifton Shallot===\nProfessor '''Clifton Shallot''' was an expert on bio-mutation and professor at [[Empire State University]].<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 30\u201333 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> He also had a Vulture wings and costume making project which he requisitioned from the State Prison Authority. When one of his courses was canceled by the university trustees, he snapped, and underwent the final stage of the mutation himself when he donned the Vulture costume \u2013 his face, teeth, and fingernails mutated, and for a short time, the wings became part of his body. The only one who knew his secret was his lab assistant Doctor Christine Murrow and her roommate Gloria Jenkins.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #128\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #128</ref>\n\n[[Mary Jane Watson]] witnessed him killing Gloria (whom he had mistaken for Christine) and she became a target. While flying around Mary Jane's apartment, he noticed Spider-Man and attacked him. Vulture managed to defeat Spider-Man and leave him for dead. Clifton then searched for a way to reverse the transformation. He stole some chemicals from a ship called D\u00fcsseldorf at Dock 20. The next morning as he was flying to Christine's lab, Vulture noticed Mary Jane in her car. He dove toward the car and grabbed Mary Jane. He was then encountered in the air by Spider-Man who dropped Mary Jane giving Vulture enough time to reach the Biology Lab. He attacked Christine only for Spider-Man to arrive and defend her. Vulture managed to rip the webbing with his talons and teeth. Their fight continued with Spider-Man blinding Vulture with the webbing as the cops arrived and threw a net over them. Still blinded by the webbing, Vulture broke free from the net and grabbed Spider-Man thinking he was Christine. When he saw it was Spider-Man, Vulture ended up dropping him.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #127\"/>\n\nVulture went back to his lab and transformed back into Clifton. He then had an agreement with Christine stating that he will not kill her if she does not betray his trust. Later that night, Vulture flew back to Dock 20 and stole some chemicals. He noticed that Peter Parker had followed him and picked him up and dropped him into the water. When he flew above Mary Jane's apartment, Vulture noticed her getting into a taxi. Vulture attacked the taxi and kidnapped Mary Jane only for Spider-Man to interrupt him causing Vulture to flee. He makes it back to his lab where Christine is. Spider-Man then arrives an hour later finding Christine there. Vulture then attacks Spider-Man who subdues him and force-feeds Vulture the antidote stolen from the D\u00fcsseldorf. After reverting from Vulture, Shallot fainted. Shallot is presumably still serving his sentence for the murder.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #128\"/>\n\n===Vulturions===\nWhile in prison for dealing [[heroin]], an engineer named '''Honcho''' is the cellmate of Adrian Toomes, who has revealed his Vulture harness designs to him. Memorizing how to construct the Vulture harness, Honcho (when released on parole) builds four red, yellow and silver Vulture harnesses with which he equips himself and three petty criminals ('''Gripes''', '''Pidgeon''' and '''Sugar Face'''). Gaining all the Vulture's abilities, the group members call themselves the '''Vulturions'''.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Louise Simonson|Penciller = Greg LaRocque|Inker = Jim Mooney|Story = Till Death Do Us Part!|Title = Web of Spider-Man|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|date = April 1985|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Wanting to make names for themselves and become big-time criminals, the Vulturions make several attempts to kill Spider-Man and accumulate wealth, ultimately failing in all their attempts.

Jonah Jameson. In truth, it was actually biochemist Dr. Charlie Goss who used the machines that were previously used by Dr. [[Farley Stillwell]] and his brother Dr. Harlan Stillwell so that they can have a newer Vulture. It was Charlie Goss that claimed that Jameson had a hand in his creation when he confessed to the authorities about Vulture.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #623</ref> After being fended off from Spider-Man, Vulture visited the mobster again who came clean about who was behind his transformation.

He apparently escapes while fleeing the vultures, but Spider-Man gets the money back. In the episode \"The Vulture's Prey\", Vulture commits penthouse robberies and traps [[J. Jonah Jameson]] in a clock tower after the publisher accidentally stumbles upon the Vulture's loot in there. He hears from Jameson about an experimental missile and steals it to try to help him commit crimes, using Jameson to inform him. He loses the missile due to Spider-Man.

Later, he used his Vulture talons to suck the youth out of people to temporarily make himself young, which he was able to do with the Tablet of Time he bought from [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. However, Vulture transformed into the Man-Spider after absorbing Spider-Man's DNA and youth. Eventually, Spider-Man enlisted [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]]'s aid to defeat Vulture and return Spider-Man's youth, although he reprogrammed the device so that Vulture would absorb the excess DNA that had [[The Six Arms Saga|originally caused]] Spider-Man to be the Man-Spider originally. The episode \"Partners\" reveals that Scorpion afterward captured Vulture (who then began shifting between his young and old selves while somehow having gotten rid of the Man-Spider mutation). Scorpion's intent was to have Vulture make a cure once securing enough money for a laboratory. Vulture saves Spider-Man, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and Scorpion from [[Silvermane]]'s clutches. He also becomes young full-time by swapping energy with the baby Silvermane, regressing Silvermane back to an old man.

It is explained the Vulture was a human who got Bestial powers, hanging out with Beastials and disrespecting humans while he was also playing with his human servant's son. When he caused his human friend trouble, he hated the [[High Evolutionary]] for what he did and rebelled against him.\n\n[[File:www.spidey2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Vulture (Adrian Toomes) in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series.]]\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Robert Englund]].<ref name=\"btva\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0802/11/index.htm|title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter:  Monday, February 11, 2008|website=www.comicscontinuum.com}}</ref> This version uses the black and red costume by [[Terry Dodson]] during his run on ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]'' with some differences and has a more bird-like nose. In his first episode \"Survival of the Fittest\", Toomes was an aerodynamics engineer who developed a magnetic air transport harness which enabled him to fly at high speeds and make agile aerial maneuvers. He showed his invention to Norman Osborn, but his concept is rejected. But when Osborn announces OsCorp Tech Flight, the outraged Toomes goes to OsCorp when Osborn interrupts him and assures that OsCorp has nothing to apologize for. Toomes accuses Norman of stealing his work, to which Osborn goes on to insulting Toomes as an 'old buzzard', saying that no one would believe he created Tech Flight because he had never amounted to any success before. As he is escorted out by security, Toomes declares that he no longer blames Otto Octavius for the theft of his work. Toomes then dons his suit, dubs himself the Vulture, and attacks Osborn. He is eventually defeated and jailed along with the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] by Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0712/08/index.htm|title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Saturday, December 8, 2007|website=www.comicscontinuum.com}}</ref> Toomes reappears in the episode \"Group Therapy\" in which he, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] are busted out of Ryker's Island by Electro, and has his Vulture flight tech upgraded with reinforced steel. As part of the [[Sinister Six]], he and the other villains surprise and openly attack Spider-Man in retaliation for the web-slinger interfering with their plans. During a later battle, Vulture is defeated again when Spider-Man damages his helmet, causing him to pass out mid-flight. Vulture escapes prison once again in the episode \"Reinforcement\" to join the Sinister Six created by the Master Planner. When Master Planner sends the Sinister Six to attack Spider-Man, Vulture teams up with Electro to fight the web-slinger at Rockefeller Center. Vulture is caught in Spider-Man's webs and tied to the [[Rockefeller Center]] Christmas tree, then zapped by the overeager Electro and trapped when the tree collapses, but he is retrieved before the police arrive. In the episode \"Shear Strength\", Vulture continues to aid Master Planner's plan for world domination by gaining control over all the computers in the world and attempts to kill Osborn with an explosion to satisfy his hunger for revenge, but is stopped by Spider-Man. Vulture is later sent with Electro to kidnap [[Gwen Stacy]] in order to blackmail [[George Stacy]] into downloading the codes that would give Master Planner access to all the computers in the United States, and possibly the world. Master Planner sends Toomes, now with a laser-firing attachment to his Vulture flight pack, to distract Homeland Security agents so that Stacy can more easily steal the codes. When the plan is foiled by Spider-Man, Master Planner sends Vulture the order to withdraw. In the episode \"Gangland\", Vulture accompanies Doctor Octopus to a sit-down with Silvermane and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]. When [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] instigated a fight between the three crime lords, Vulture leaped to protect Doctor Octopus but was quickly dispatched by Hammerhead. He escaped with [[Silver Sable]] before the police could arrest them.\n\n* A teenaged version of Adrian Toomes appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].<ref name=\"btva\"/><ref>{{cite episode|title=The Vulture|series=''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=6|airdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> Introduced in ''Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors'', this version is similar to Jimmy Natale in having organic wings and sonic shrieks along with a vulture-like anatomy (a beak, vulture feet, vulture feet-like hands and the presence of dark green feathers) that he can freely shift to from his human form. The episode \"The Vulture\" revealed that he turned out to be one of Doctor Octopus's animal serum experiments who had his mind wiped to make room for programming, resulting in his [[amnesia]]. While living in an abandoned building, Adrian searched for information about himself by stealing from other criminals in the streets, dubbed the 'Vulture' by the [[Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle Communications]] and now a target for S.H.I.E.L.D. After one of his nightly heists, Vulture met and befriended Spider-Man and promised to help him. After intimidating [[Harry Osborn]] fruitlessly for information, Spider-Man took him to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier to find answers. However, Doctor Octopus forced Adrian to attack Spider-Man by activating Vulture's mind programming. Vulture is ordered to free Doctor Octopus and the two head back to Vulture's hideout, which turns out to be one of Doctor Octopus's labs. Spider-Man follows and helps Vulture overcome his mind programming and they defeat Doctor Octopus. After Doctor Octopus' defeat, Spider-Man gave him an offer to join a [[New Warriors|team of superhero warriors]] but declined as he wanted to find his own path as he searches through any Oscorp leads for his missing past. He soon ended up a recruit of [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] (using stolen data from Doctor Octopus's computer of his real name). In the episode \"New Warriors\", Vulture ends up being a member of Taskmaster's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|team]] alongside [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]. Taskmaster's team attacks the Tri-Carrier and trick [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] and [[Amadeus Cho|Iron Spider]] into freeing several supervillains led by the Green Goblin. When Vulture sees Doctor Octopus among the villains, he wants revenge but Taskmaster tells him to wait and will get his chance for payback. When the escaped supervillains take off in a Quinjet, Taskmaster allows Vulture to get his revenge on Doctor Octopus by causing the Quinjet to crash onto the Tri-Carrier. While the other villains are defeated (sans the Goblin), Spider-Man lets Vulture escape as they were once friends. Vulture has a cameo appearance in the episode \"Contest of Champions\" [Part 1] among the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s villain collection against Spider-Man and the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six'', his character is equipped with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] armor that initially resembles Blackie Drago's green armor in the Ultimate universe and then his original counterpart's red and black armor. In the episode \"Iron Vulture\", Vulture tries to kill the Osborns (albeit reluctantly) in exchange for Doctor Octopus's information containing his past. The two, alongside an Octobot, end up fighting Spider-Man, [[Miles Morales|Kid Arachnid]], Iron Patriot and the Patrioteer. Using Iron Patriot's helmet, Adrian found no records of his past in Oscorp's files or Doctor Octopus's data files, causing Adrian to attack Doctor Octopus in rage. Wanting to keep a weapon and potential recruit for the [[Sinister Six]], Doctor Octopus's nanites overrides Vulture's armor, causing him to lose his free will. Before he loses his free will, Adrian tells Spider-Man that Doctor Octopus has a [[Ben Reilly|spy]] in S.H.I.E.L.D. and then takes off. In the episode \"Beached\", Spider-Man and Iron Spider were searching for the rogue Vulture before Doctor Octopus could find him. Vulture encounters Spider-Man and Iron Spider; Spider-Man's attempts to reach out foiled by Iron Spider seeing Vulture as a mindless monster. During a mid-air battle, Vulture left the young heroes on an island, where the two find Sandman being controlled by Doctor Octopus. After saving Sandman, Spider-Man and Iron Spider speculate that Vulture purposely led them to the island to help Sandman, believing Vulture might retain some of his free will. In the two-part series finale \"Graduation Day\", Vulture reappears as a member of Superior Sinister Six alongside the Rhino, [[Kraven the Hunter]], the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. At the docks, he and Kraven attack Cloak, Dagger, [[Squirrel Girl]] and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]. Squirrel Girl's squirrels subdue and capture him. Upon breaking out of his cell, Vulture joins the Superior Sinister Six and fights against Spider-Man. During the battle at Oscorp, Spider-Man used one of Doctor Octopus's antidote darts to cure Vulture, which also freed Adrian from his mind-controlling armor and helped him regain his memories of his past. Adrian and Alex O'Hirn briefly assist Spider-Man against Kraven, and later enrolls in S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy under Spider-Man's supervision.\n\n* Vulture appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/869243-marvels-animated-spider-man-voice-cast-and-premiere-date|title=Marvel's Animated Spider-Man Voice Cast and Premiere Date|date=14 July 2017|publisher=}}</ref>, voiced by [[Alastair Duncan (actor)|Alastair Duncan]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version is a middle-aged man with reddish-brown hair, and his Vulture flight suit has a visor and a neck device that enables him to perform sonic attacks. In the episode \"Horizon High\" Pt. 1, Vulture attacks Spider-Man after Spider-Man thwarts his henchmen's robbery of [[Vibranium]]. During the fight, Spider-Man had to let Vulture getaway when he causes a sonic attack that sends shards of the window glass towards two police officers. Vulture later crashes the aftermath of the sabotage to the Vibranium device where he abducts [[Max Modell]] as part of his revenge, as Toomes was a former employee of Horizon High but was fired for stealing equipment, though Vulture claimed that his technology was not of Modell. After saving Max, Spider-Man heads back to the school to obtain the Vibranium where [[Spencer Smythe]] was displeased with Vulture's interference. Vulture states to Spencer that he does not care for Spencer's personal issues towards Modell and does a sonic attack to knock down Spencer. Spider-Man manages to defeat Vulture just as the police arrive. In the episode \"Symbiotic Relationship\", the black-suited Spider-Man sights Vulture flying around the city and takes him down only for the police to vouch for Toomes as Norman Osborn had negotiated his release in exchange for being a teacher at Osborn Academy. Toomes is later seen working on his Vulture suit when Osborn comes in to discuss the Vulture Force as Adrian suspects that the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|V-252]] will be presented. After Osborn figures out that the V-252 is on Spider-Man, Adrian and Alistair attack Spider-Man with Vulture sonic attacks, enabling Spider-Man to break the V-252 off and steal the V-252's containment device from Osborn. In the episode \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", Adrian continues to acts as a confidant for Norman and learns about [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Raymond Warren]]'s spider experiments and the [[Spider-Slayers]]' purpose after Spencer attacked Oscorp as a diversion to steal some Warren's spider specimens.

They take the two a lab to take Spider-Man's blood, but the Ultimate Spider-Man stops them and fights Adrian off before he and Norman are forced to flee when the lab explodes. In the episode \"The Rise of Doc Ock\" Pt. 4, Vulture is shown to be a member of the Osborn Commandoes, though he gets brainwashed by Doctor Octopus as the Sinister Five's member. In the two-part episode \"Hobgoblin\", Vulture is still with the Sinister Five. Vulture and the others wear Spider-Man down long enough for Doctor Octopus to brainwash into the Sinister Six's newest member, only for them to be freed by Spider-Man and the Hobgoblin. Vulture is stated to have been taken into custody (off-screen) along with the rest of the Sinister Five by Hobgoblin. In the episode \"Rise Above It All\", Toomes works to reform himself but is given an upgraded Vulture suit by the Wake Riders. However, Vulture manages to escape. During the multi-episode \"Goblin War\", Toomes now uses Green Goblin-esque technology as the '''[[Goblin King (comics)|Goblin King]]''', the cult-like Goblin Nation organization's leader with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], Crossbones and Slivermane as enforcers. When Doctor Octopus sacrifices himself to use the Neuro Cortex to overload the Goblin Mech, Adrian ejects from it and is webbed up by Spider-Man.\n** A Vulturion-esque group called the '''Vulture Force''' appears in season one voiced by [[Max Mittelman]], [[Fred Tatasciore]], and [[Jim Cummings]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Symbiotic Relationship|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=7|airdate=September 16, 2017}}</ref> The group uses upgraded Vulture suits thanks to Oscorp.

After it's figured that the V-252 is on Spider-Man, Alistair and Adrian attack Spider-Man with Vulture sonic attacks, enabling Spider-Man to separate from the V-252 and steal the containment device. In the episode \"Stark Expo\", Norman uses the Vulture Force to be introduced at the Stark Expo only for their Vulture outfits to be hijacked by [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] to fight Spider-Man using the V-252. \n** Another Vulturion-esque group called the '''Wake Riders''' appears in season two.

His Vulture suit is made from [[Chitauri]] technology and comes equipped with mechanical turbine-powered wings and claw-like wingtips as well as boot-mounted talons. At the beginning of the film, Toomes' salvaging company is forced out of business by the creation of the Department of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]] following the [[The Avengers (2012 film)|Battle of New York]]. He persuades his employees not to give up the Chitauri technology they salvaged before Damage Control stepped in, and use it to start a black market weapons ring instead. Years later, his [[Liz Allan|daughter]] begins dating Peter Parker, who Toomes deduces is also Spider-Man, who had been attempting to stop him over the course of the film. Toomes threatens to harm Parker if he continues to interfere in his business. However, Spider-Man thwarts Toomes' attempt to hijack a plane carrying Avengers weaponry and Toomes is arrested, although Peter explicitly saves Toomes' life during the fight when his equipment malfunctions. His family moves out of state to avoid attention brought by his trial. In prison, Toomes is told by fellow inmate [[Mac Gargan]] that a rumor is circulating that he knows who Spider-Man is, but Toomes denies it.\n\n===Video games===\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appeared in the [[Sega CD]] adaptation of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appeared in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] ''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man Animated Series]]'' video game.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in the video game adaptation of ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> He is working with [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] to rob a jewelry store.

Vulture appears as a boss in the [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game, voiced again by Dwight Schultz.<ref name=\"btva\"/> He is broken out of prison by [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] alongside Mysterio and Shocker (although it is later revealed that he was broken out by accident, Rhino having been hired by [[Doctor Octopus]] to break out only Shocker), and goes on to plants bombs around the city, demanding ransom money. After Spider-Man defuses all his bombs, Vulture tries to escape, but Spider-Man defeats him at a construction site following a chase through the city and leaves him for the police, not before Vulture reveals to Spider-Man that he was kicked out of a job with Rhino and Shocker at the docks.\n\n* Adrian Toomes appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' game (for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]), voiced by [[Brian George]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version is shown to be a researcher at Trask Industries, owned by [[Bolivar Trask]], and a former colleague of Peter Parker and [[Eddie Brock]]'s fathers before their deaths. Toomes observes the battle between Peter Parker and Venom at the beginning of the game, after Eddie took the Venom [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] from Trask Industries all for himself, and then calls Trask to inform him about the Venom suit's return. Later, after Venom is captured by [[Silver Sable]] and brought to Trask Industries, Toomes and Trask speak to Eddie and convince him to test the suit for them. After a battle with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], during which he had more control over the Venom suit in the presence of Spider-Man, Eddie returns to Trask Industries and tells Toomes about it, who remarks that the suit was made using Richard Parker's DNA, meaning that Peter is Spider-Man and getting some of his DNA will help complete it; however, after being taken by Silver Sable to hunt Peter down, Venom escapes. Near the end of the game, after both Venom and Spider-Man are captured and brought to Trask Industries, Toomes inject Peter with a micro-sample of the Venom symbiote, while telling him that he knew his father. This ends up transforming Peter into [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], who knocks Toomes unconscious and then escapes.\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[Kristoffer Tabori]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version of the character uses wings with sword-like blades for feathers that can attach and detach from his suit through magnetic means, and, thus, can also be used as throwable projectiles. Early on in the game, Vulture is shown to be working for the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] as his enforcer and supplier of high-tech armor and [[Green Goblin|Goblin]] [[Hobgoblin (comics)|gliders]] for his goons. With info from either [[Moon Knight]] or [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], Spider-Man tracks down Vulture at his hideout in the Kronas Corporation building and fights him, alongside some of Kingpin's goons equipped with gliders. After defeating Vulture, Spider-Man leaves him for the police and, depending on the player's choice, can either joke about him, or threaten him not to mess with him again; regardless the choice, Vulture then becomes an ally and the player can summon him at any time during gameplay to help them fight enemies. Shortly before the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] invasion, Spider-Man has to choose between Vulture and Moon Knight to take him to Ryker's Island, in order to release the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]], in the hopes that he could find a countermeasure to the symbiotes. During the invasion, Vulture is shown to be working with both Kingpin and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to stop the symbiote threat, while the Tinkerer is working on a device that could destroy all the symbiotes without harming the hosts. Near the end of the game, Vulture gets infected by a symbiote and leads an attack of \"'''Vulturelings'''\" (his own offspring of symbiotes) to destroy the Tinkerer's device, but Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. stop him, with Spider-Man defeating Symbiote Vulture in an aerial battle and removing the symbiote. Afterward, Spider-Man takes Vulture with him to the device and prepares to activate it, but Vulture tells him that, once set off, it would mean losing the black suit and its powers forever, whereas destroying the device shall grant him complete control over the city. Depending on the choices made through the game, Spider-Man can either follow his moral code and activate the device, destroying all the symbiotes, including his black suit, or listen to Vulture and destroy it. If it's the latter, Vulture will then take Spider-Man to the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] to defeat [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] for good, and, alongside the other villain allies, helps fight off the symbiotes aboard while Spider-Man plants bombs to destroy the Helicarrier. Vulture guides Spider-Man and helps him find the bombs, but threatens to blow up the Helicarrier with him still aboard, although Spider-Man manages to defeat Venom and escapes from the Helicarrier just in time.\n\n* The Marvel Noir incarnation of Vulture appears as a villain character in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|title=San Diego Comic-Con 2010: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension Updates|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> voiced by [[Steve Blum]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> The Noir incarnation of Adrian Toomes is a deformed, murderous cannibal and described as Norman Osborn's \"right-hand monster\". It is specifically stated that Vulture not only killed [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] but actually ate alive, further increasing [[Spider-Man Noir|Spider-Man]]'s grudge against him. It is also stated that his love of human meat began with people laughing at him for his appearance during his time in a cage. In combat Vulture is as agile as Spider-Man, and uses throwing knives, bombs, shurikens, [[Molotov cocktail]]s, and bolas against Spider-Man. When Vulture uses a tablet fragment, he gains the ability to teleport away in a puff of black feathers. At one point, he is heard coveting the fragment, claiming that with this new power he no longer has to take orders from Osborn or anyone else. Light is his only weakness as he seems to have strong photosensitivity. Spider-Man manages to defeat him and claim the tablet fragment. During the credits, he is shown back in the cage having eaten a couple of birds while people stare at him. In the [[Nintendo DS]] version of the game, the 2099 incarnation of Vulture serves as a villain to [[Spider-Man 2099]].\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture is featured as a boss in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/20/lego-marvel-super-heroes-characters-and-cast-revealed|title=LEGO Marvel Super Heroes: Characters and Cast Revealed|first=Greg|last=Miller|date=20 July 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"btva\"/> In a bonus mission, he and [[Howard the Duck]] storm Marvel Comics HQ and hold the artists there hostage.

This version of Vulture features retractable wings and can use his \"feathers\" as throwable projectiles; he also wears a mouth-covering resembling a beak, which both helps him breathe at high altitudes, and gives him a more robotic-sounding voice. Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], Vulture serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having already fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, sometime prior to the events of the game, was defeated by Spider-Man and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum-security prison designed especially for supervillains. During one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s broadcast shows, it is revealed that Vulture has been diagnosed with spinal [[cancer]] and has been moved to the Raft's infirmary. After Otto Octavius (now calling himself \"[[Doctor Octopus]]\") attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft, resulting in massive prison breakouts, he releases Vulture, Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, and [[Mister Negative]] and recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires; Vulture wishes to be cured of his cancer. When Spider-Man comes to investigate the breakout, Vulture attacks the hero while he is chasing after Electro, and later joins his fellow Sinister Six members in ambushing the hero after Electro lured him to a landing pad. Spider-Man is easily defeated by the Sinister Six, although Octavius orders them not to kill him (because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Octavius is aware of Spider-Man's secret identity). The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Vulture and Electro being sent to cripple the city's power supply. After being lured into a trap by Otto, Spider-Man survives, only to be captured by Vulture, who brings him to Electro so that together they could finally kill the web-slinger. Spider-Man ultimately defeats both of them and leaves them for the police to take them back into custody. In his character biography, Spider-Man reveals that he had struggled a lot to defeat Vulture during their very first battles, as he proved to be much faster than he would have expected.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVq0zG_0P0Y Spider-Man vs. The Vulture in 2 Minutes- Marvel TL;DR] by Marvel Entertainment on YouTube\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Vulture_(Adrian_Toomes) Vulture I] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Vulture_(Blackie_Drago) Vulture II] at Marvel.com\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Adrian_Toomes_%28Earth-616%29 Vulture I] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Raniero_Drago_%28Earth-616%29 Vulture II] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Clifton_Shallot_%28Earth-616%29 Vulture III] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/James_Natale_%28Earth-616%29 Vulture IV] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/vulturedrago.htm|Vulture II}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/vultureshallot.htm|Vulture III}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/vulturenatalesm.htm|Vulture IV}}\n\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Sinister Six}}\n{{Black Cat}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gerry Conway]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Sr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Waid]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ross Andru]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with cancer]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters code names]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=Vulture (Adrian Toomes).png\n|caption= {{Descript-inner-art|Amazing Spider-Man Annual|1|1|October 1964|art=[[Steve Ditko]]|pub=Marvel}}\n|character_name=Vulture\n|real_name=Adrian Toomes\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #2 (May 1963)\n|creators=[[Stan Lee]]<br>[[Steve Ditko]]\n|alliances=[[Sinister Six]]<br>[[Savage Six]]\n|aliases=[[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]\n|powers=\n*Genius electrical engineer\n*Electromagnetic tailored body-harness grants:\n**Flight\n**Enhanced physical attributes\n}}\nThe '''Vulture (Adrian Toomes)''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

He is a former [[electronics]] [[engineer]] who was once the business partner of Gregory Bestman; Bestman handled the finances whilst Toomes handled the inventions. One day, after creating a flight harness, Toomes eagerly rushed into Bestman's office to share the happy news. However, Bestman was not there, and Toomes discovered that Bestman had secretly been embezzling funds and that Toomes had no legal recourse, meaning he lost his job. Enraged, Toomes wrecked the business, discovering that the harness also granted him superhuman strength. He then decided to turn to crime professionally as the Vulture.\n\nThe Vulture employs a special harness of his own design that allows him to [[flight|fly]]; his flight is directed by a pair of wings worn on his arms. The harness also endows him with enhanced strength and (according to some sources) increases his lifespan. Although Toomes is advanced in age, he is a strong fighter and a remorseless killer. On one occasion, he restored his youth through biochemical means,<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #388\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #388</ref> though this wore off after exposure to an [[elemental]] [[superhuman]]'s corpse.<ref name=\"The Sensational Spider-Man #18\">''The Sensational Spider-Man #18</ref> At one point, he had used a device to steal Spider-Man's youth, leaving Vulture young and Spider-Man elderly, but this effect wore off within hours.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #387</ref>\n\nVulture was on a robbery and burglary spree throughout [[New York City]] when he first encountered [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man realized for the first time he could sell photos to [[J.

Vulture then challenged the police, saying he was going to steal diamonds; however, he escaped through the sewer. Spider-Man had created a device that stopped Vulture's harness from working and activated it during an airborne fight with Vulture, causing the two to crash onto a roof, knocking Vulture unconscious. He was then arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2</ref> Vulture modified his harness, and attempted to rob the ''Daily Bugle'' payroll.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #7</ref> He joined [[Doctor Octopus]]'s first [[Sinister Six]], and gave the message to the ''Daily Bugle'' that they had captured [[Betty Brant]].

The Vulture was caught after Spider-Man swung onto him using a [[lasso]]. He then told Spider-Man where to find the lair of Doctor Octopus, and like the rest of the team was jailed by the end of the story.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref>\n\nLater, believing himself to be dying in prison due to injuries in the [[prison]] [[workshop]], Toomes revealed the location of an extra Vulture outfit on the prison grounds to his cellmate Blackie Drago (who became the second Vulture).

Vulture has been in every incarnation of the Sinister Six, and appeared in the ranks of the Sinister Twelve. He has a strong friendship with fellow villain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]; the two of them nearly beat Spider-Man to death.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2</ref>\n\nDuring one of his many periods of ill health, Toomes struck up a friendship with Nathan Lubensky, a man who had become the new love of [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s life. Nathan was unaware of Toomes' true identity, and encouraged the injured criminal to take his chances with life and not to let handicaps drag him down (Nathan was a paraplegic). Toomes followed Nathan's advice and went on a crime spree as the Vulture while hiding out in his civilian identity at the same nursing home Nathan lived in, reasoning that the authorities would never think to look for him there. After Peter Parker visited the nursing home and recognized him, however, a battle ensued between the Vulture and Spider-Man. During the course of the fight, Toomes instinctively grabbed a hostage and threatened to kill him if Spider-Man didn't back down; however, as soon as Toomes realized that the hostage was Nathan, he decided he couldn't take the life of a man who had helped to save his own. He shoved Nathan's wheelchair at Spider-Man, distracting the web-slinger long enough for Toomes to make his getaway.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #224\"/>\n\nVulture would seemingly cherish Nathan's influence, but irony would serve him a cruel blow when he was hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to assassinate a high-ranking casino runner. During another conflict with Spider-Man just prior to joining Doctor Octopus's new Sinister Six, the Vulture sought to use a hostage as a shield, and selected May Parker from the crowd. Nathan, who was with May, leapt from his wheelchair and grabbed Toomes.  Not realizing who it was, Toomes flew high into the air with Nathan on his back.  The shock of seeing how high they were caused Nathan to suffer a fatal heart attack. Toomes fled as Nathan was falling. Though he was successfully caught by Spider-Man, Nathan would die in May's arms.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #336\u2013339</ref>\n\nToomes was later diagnosed with cancer, caused by frequent exposure to the essentials needed to power his flying apparatus. In an attempt to be forgiven for all of his previous sins, Vulture terrorized the Parker household, pleading that May Parker forgive him for indirectly causing Nathan's death. An enraged Parker attacked Toomes, forcing the Vulture to capture him and take him back to his old lair. After escaping Toomes, Peter switched to Spider-Man and brutally assaulted the Vulture, and in the ensuing battle, Vulture's own power pack malfunctioned and exploded, setting his wings ablaze. Spider-Man successfully ripped the burning pack off of Toomes, and the two crash landed in a muddy ditch.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #187</ref>\n\nAfter being arrested, Toomes was returned to the Parker home so May, reunited with Peter, could identify him. May hoped that Toomes' death would be slow and full of suffering. The next day, she visited Toomes in prison and apologized to him for her cruel remarks, but also stated that she could not forgive him, and that any kind of redemption would be left up to him and [[God]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #188</ref>\n\nVulture stumbled across a plot by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and the [[Harry Osborn|Green Goblin]] (Harry Osborn) to drive Spider-Man insane by having [[shapeshifting]] [[android (robot)|androids]] impersonate his late mother and father; due to Toomes' interference, the androids were destroyed, leading the wall-crawler to a brief nervous breakdown. The Vulture absorbed the artificial life force from the Mary Parker android, and the effect on the Vulture was twofold; not only did he become a young man again, but he was instantly cured of his cancer.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #388\"/> During this period he attempted to kill everyone who'd ever known him as an old man in an attempt to get a clean slate for his life, but this plan went wrong when he targeted a Prowler impersonator as the Prowler having once thwarted his attempted takeover of his old company; Toomes was unconcerned about the fact that the current Prowler was a thief who'd stolen costume of the original [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]] (Hobie Brown) and Spider-Man; although Toomes nearly gutted the fake Prowler, Spider-Man managed to get him to the hospital. During a later fight with Spider-Man, the Vulture was 'attacked' by David Kalen, a man capable of dissolving anything he touched who had turned his power on himself in his grief at the death of his brother. Toomes subsequently reverted to his old age, presumably due to Kalen's power having negated the youth effect.<ref name=\"The Sensational Spider-Man #18\"/>\n\nIn the ''[[Identity Disc]]'' series, it was revealed that Toomes, with the help of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], manipulated Marvel villains [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Deadpool]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] into laying siege to terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] headquarters in order to retrieve a disc containing the identities of undercover [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives (including that of Toomes' daughter, [[Valeria Toomes]], aka \"Valerie Jessup\").{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nDuring a brief time working for the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], he failed in a mission (and had his face brutally slashed by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]) and was severely beaten as punishment. He subsequently revealed himself as a member of [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Sinister Twelve]] \u2014 though he wore a helmet, presumably to mask the wounds.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #9\u201312</ref>\n\nUnder the tutelage of [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of Kraven the Hunter, Toomes briefly attempted a stint at heroism, but before long he returned to the other side of the law.<ref>''Spider-Man: Get Kraven'' #4</ref>\n\nAside from his daughter, Toomes also has a son whom he has dismissed, and a grandson from that son. The Vulture has come to care deeply for both his grandson and his mother, committing a series of robberies to finance a cure for his grandson's terminal illness. He once had a nephew, Malachai Toomes, and flew into a killing rage when he was murdered by a gang-lord.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n[[File:519px-Vulture.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Adrian Toomes in his red and black Vulture design in ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]''. Art by [[Terry Dodson]].]]\n\nDuring the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', he was apprehended along with the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and the [[Trapster]], by [[Captain America]] and his growing Resistance, who chained him together with Grim Reaper to a pole and broke his nose. When he was found and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D., he complained, \"that lunatic broke my damn nose.\" After Spider-Man unmasked himself, Toomes was seen in his jail cell, knitting his fingers together. As someone on the television set said they hoped it would not be any trouble for Spider-Man, Toomes said, \"Oh I think it will be.\"<ref>''Civil War'' #2</ref>\n\nAfter Spider-Man goes rogue, Toomes is seen in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison cell speaking with Agent [[Jamie Madrox]], and commenting on Spider-Man's inherent weakness, that being his unwillingness to use his powers for personal gain. S.H.I.E.L.D. then returns his flying harness and encourages him to hunt down Spider-Man, saying that he \"is now an outlaw, same as you.\"<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #14</ref>\n\nLater, the Vulture attacks Spider-Man at a book signing, and manages to slash him with a powerful sedative. Toomes, however, falls unconscious and, sensing something is wrong, Spider-Man rushes him to the hospital.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #15</ref>\n\nToomes wakes up a few hours later, where a doctor reveals that he has suffered a [[stroke]], and many of his muscles on the left side of his body have been paralyzed. When the doctor leaves, Spider-Man sneaks in and Toomes asks him to kill him because he is weak. When Spider-Man refuses to do so, he says that Spider-Man is also weak, and always has been. After making remarks about Uncle Ben, Spider-Man takes a pillow and begins suffocating him. He fights back, and Spidey removes the pillow, commenting that \"For somebody who's begging to die, you fight for life pretty hard.\"<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #16</ref>\n\nWhen Alyosha Kravinoff began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Vulture was one of his captives.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol.2 #13</ref> To stop Vulture from using his intellect to find a way to remove his bomb collar, Kraven broke his hands repeatedly,<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol.2 #14</ref> but with the help of Rhino, Vulture escapes.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol.2 #15</ref>\n\nSpider-Man later visits Vulture's cell to ask him about the latest person who calls himself the Vulture. Toomes says calmly that he has no connection to him, though he heard that the new Vulture was made that way by the mob and is out for revenge. He just as blandly states that while he normally hates people who steal the Vulture name, he would have no problem with him killing Spider-Man.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #594\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #594</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Vulture returns as the leader of an unnamed gang of penthouse thieves and murderers who have vulture-like wings, but with a new gothic style. The members of his gang have the same name of an angel that matches with the black angel look they have.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #674</ref> However, it is swiftly revealed that the gang's technology is actually controlled by the Vulture, who designed their wings so that he could shut them down with a simple signal if they tried to act against him. Having used his new magnetically sensitive webbing to catch the gang and deactivate their wings, Spider-Man defeats Toomes despite his new use of his gravity-manipulating technology to give himself seemingly superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #675</ref>\n\n[[Carlie Cooper]] later works with the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) to investigate a series of crimes committed by the Vulture's gang. Superior Spider-Man confronts Vulture and attempts to bribe him into giving up crime by offering him a small fortune from Octavius's hidden bank accounts. Vulture does not believe a word of it, and has his midget henchmen attack. Superior Spider-Man accidentally knocks out one of the midget henchmen, who turns out to be a young boy. Realizing that the Vulture has been using children all this time and remembering his own abusive childhood, Superior Spider-Man attacks Vulture in a rage. After a brief midair struggle, Spider-Man blinds the Vulture with a searchlight, causing him to crash onto the roof. Carlie arrives and finds Vulture, broken and bloody but still alive.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #3</ref> The Vulture's child henchmen are then recruited by the Goblin King to be part of the Goblin Nation.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #4</ref> Vulture is later seen in the Raft's infirmary, along with [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]]. When [[Alistair Smythe]] escapes with the mini Spider-Slayers' help, the mini Spider-Slayers are sent into the infirmary to heal and enhance Vulture, Boomerang, and Scorpion in exchange for their assistance in killing Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref> While Superior Spider-Man fights Boomerang, Vulture is sent to attack the civilians in the Raft.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12</ref> [[Glory Grant]], [[Norah Winters]], and Smythe's lawyer plead with him to stop, claiming they can clear him of any charges, causing him to stop and consider his options. When Smythe dies, the Vulture's enhancements fail, leaving him blind once again. He is then tasered by Ted Shipley, the Raft's chief of security.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13</ref> Vulture eventually has another encounter with the Superior Spider-Man, seeking revenge for his recent defeats but is defeated again.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #1</ref> Vulture, Chameleon, Electro, Sandman, and [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]] are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the \"Superior Six\", which is forced via mind control to perform heroic (and occasionally dangerous) deeds as an act of \"redemption\". When they are not being controlled, they are kept in containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5</ref> They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, nearly destroying New York in the process.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6</ref> Superior Spider-Man barely manages to stop them with Sun Girl's help.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7</ref>\n\nAdrian Toomes later developed a modified version of his Electromagnetic Wing Harness that has a reinforced helmet and lightweight, razor-sharp, nano-woven wings which responded to his mental commands where he took on the '''[[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]''' name which he believed to be vacant at the time. He robbed a location in East Village where he fought Spider-Man until they were immobilized by a new [[Trapster]] who made off with Falcon's loot.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day Vol 2017 Secret Empire''</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Hunt for Wolverine]]\" storyline, Spider-Man was seen thwarting Vulture's robbery when he is called in by Iron Man to help him, Luke Cage, and Jessica Jones find Wolverine's body when it goes missing from his unmarked grave.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: The Adamantium Agenda'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn a prelude to the \"Hunted\" storyline, Vulture is among the animal-themed characters captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] on Kraven the Hunter's behalf. He is among those who [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] publicly reveals as the [[Savage Six]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nVulture is revealed to have a son named Frankie Toomes who married to a woman named Lenora. When Frankie left Lenora, Toomes often visited Lenora and her daughter Tiana to support them. At one point, he as Vulture took Tiana on a ride in his Vulture suit. After Lenora died from a surgical error, Adrian started to take care of Tiana. As Tiana came to age, Adrian made her a suit similar to his so that Tiana can follow whatever destiny awaits for her. This led to Tiana becoming Starling.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nUtilizing his Vulture harness, Adrian Toomes is able to fly as if by natural winged flight. He wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric housing a tailored electromagnetic harness with bird-like wings attached beneath the arms. This consists of an electromagnetic anti-graviton generator worn on his body as a harness enabling him to fly silently with precise maneuverability. The Vulture harness also increases his resistance to injury to the point that he can survive blows from Spider-Man's enhanced strength. Another by-product of his exposure to the harness is that despite his age and lack of exercise, Toomes' physical strength represents the upper limit of human development. When he removes the harness some of his enhanced abilities slowly fade, although the rate at which this transpires remains unclear (some writers have suggested that his strength is permanent). Toomes is elderly and depends on his electromagnetic harness to augment his strength, vitality, and athletic prowess as well as absorbing life force to maintain his vitality. It has recently been revealed that, due to his prolonged use of the harness, Toomes can levitate or float his body even without the Vulture harness, although he requires his wings to maneuver while airborne. Toomes has a new version of his Vulture flight harness that has supposedly been augmented by the Green Goblin. Though he claimed that it increased his strength by five-hundred percent, it appeared to be a bluff to frighten the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] who proceeded to beat him half to death. Toomes is intellectually brilliant in the fields of electronics and mechanical engineering, with a great talent for invention. He has earned a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering.\n\n==Other characters named Vulture==\n\n===Blackie Drago===\n'''Raniero''' \"'''Blackie'''\" '''Drago''' was a prison cellmate of Adrian Toomes's. He tricked Toomes by causing an accident in the prison workshop that made Toomes think he could die soon, and stole the Vulture harness and costume which was recently rebuilt. He used the suit to make money through air piracy which led to a confrontation with Spider-Man, that Blackie believed ended in the wall-crawler's death (Spidey had merely collapsed due to a serious cold in reality).<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #48\"/> After robbing a helicopter, Drago was pursued by Kraven the Hunter, who resented his claims of victory over Spider-Man, and ended up fighting him until Spider-Man arrived. Spider-Man managed to defeat them both and webbed them up for the police.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #49\"/>\n\nDrago was later 'rescued' from prison by Toomes- who revealed that the revelation of Drago's role in his accident had given him the strength to overcome his injuries- but that was merely so that Toomes could prove himself the true Vulture once again. Once the two were free, he was subsequently defeated and humiliated by Toomes who regained the recognition he deserved. A humbled Blackie was taken away by the police, vowing \"I'm through!! I'll never put these wings on again!\"<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #63\"/>\n\nHe was seen in the same prison that Norman Osborn was incarcerated in during the \"Sinister Twelve\" storyline.<ref>''Marvel Knight: Spider-Man'' #10</ref>\n\n===Clifton Shallot===\nProfessor '''Clifton Shallot''' was an expert on bio-mutation and professor at [[Empire State University]].<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 30\u201333 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> He also had a Vulture wings and costume making project which he requisitioned from the State Prison Authority. When one of his courses was canceled by the university trustees, he snapped, and underwent the final stage of the mutation himself when he donned the Vulture costume \u2013 his face, teeth, and fingernails mutated, and for a short time, the wings became part of his body. The only one who knew his secret was his lab assistant Doctor Christine Murrow and her roommate Gloria Jenkins.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #128\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #128</ref>\n\n[[Mary Jane Watson]] witnessed him killing Gloria (whom he had mistaken for Christine) and she became a target. While flying around Mary Jane's apartment, he noticed Spider-Man and attacked him. Vulture managed to defeat Spider-Man and leave him for dead. Clifton then searched for a way to reverse the transformation. He stole some chemicals from a ship called D\u00fcsseldorf at Dock 20. The next morning as he was flying to Christine's lab, Vulture noticed Mary Jane in her car. He dove toward the car and grabbed Mary Jane. He was then encountered in the air by Spider-Man who dropped Mary Jane giving Vulture enough time to reach the Biology Lab. He attacked Christine only for Spider-Man to arrive and defend her. Vulture managed to rip the webbing with his talons and teeth. Their fight continued with Spider-Man blinding Vulture with the webbing as the cops arrived and threw a net over them. Still blinded by the webbing, Vulture broke free from the net and grabbed Spider-Man thinking he was Christine. When he saw it was Spider-Man, Vulture ended up dropping him.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #127\"/>\n\nVulture went back to his lab and transformed back into Clifton. He then had an agreement with Christine stating that he will not kill her if she does not betray his trust. Later that night, Vulture flew back to Dock 20 and stole some chemicals. He noticed that Peter Parker had followed him and picked him up and dropped him into the water. When he flew above Mary Jane's apartment, Vulture noticed her getting into a taxi. Vulture attacked the taxi and kidnapped Mary Jane only for Spider-Man to interrupt him causing Vulture to flee. He makes it back to his lab where Christine is. Spider-Man then arrives an hour later finding Christine there. Vulture then attacks Spider-Man who subdues him and force-feeds Vulture the antidote stolen from the D\u00fcsseldorf. After reverting from Vulture, Shallot fainted. Shallot is presumably still serving his sentence for the murder.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #128\"/>\n\n===Vulturions===\nWhile in prison for dealing [[heroin]], an engineer named '''Honcho''' is the cellmate of Adrian Toomes, who has revealed his Vulture harness designs to him. Memorizing how to construct the Vulture harness, Honcho (when released on parole) builds four red, yellow and silver Vulture harnesses with which he equips himself and three petty criminals ('''Gripes''', '''Pidgeon''' and '''Sugar Face'''). Gaining all the Vulture's abilities, the group members call themselves the '''Vulturions'''.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Louise Simonson|Penciller = Greg LaRocque|Inker = Jim Mooney|Story = Till Death Do Us Part!|Title = Web of Spider-Man|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|date = April 1985|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Wanting to make names for themselves and become big-time criminals, the Vulturions make several attempts to kill Spider-Man and accumulate wealth, ultimately failing in all their attempts.

Jonah Jameson. In truth, it was actually biochemist Dr. Charlie Goss who used the machines that were previously used by Dr. [[Farley Stillwell]] and his brother Dr. Harlan Stillwell so that they can have a newer Vulture. It was Charlie Goss that claimed that Jameson had a hand in his creation when he confessed to the authorities about Vulture.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #623</ref> After being fended off from Spider-Man, Vulture visited the mobster again who came clean about who was behind his transformation.

He apparently escapes while fleeing the vultures, but Spider-Man gets the money back. In the episode \"The Vulture's Prey\", Vulture commits penthouse robberies and traps [[J.

He hears from Jameson about an experimental missile and steals it to try to help him commit crimes, using Jameson to inform him. He loses the missile due to Spider-Man.

Later, he used his Vulture talons to suck the youth out of people to temporarily make himself young, which he was able to do with the Tablet of Time he bought from [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]. However, Vulture transformed into the Man-Spider after absorbing Spider-Man's DNA and youth. Eventually, Spider-Man enlisted [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]]'s aid to defeat Vulture and return Spider-Man's youth, although he reprogrammed the device so that Vulture would absorb the excess DNA that had [[The Six Arms Saga|originally caused]] Spider-Man to be the Man-Spider originally. The episode \"Partners\" reveals that Scorpion afterward captured Vulture (who then began shifting between his young and old selves while somehow having gotten rid of the Man-Spider mutation). Scorpion's intent was to have Vulture make a cure once securing enough money for a laboratory. Vulture saves Spider-Man, [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and Scorpion from [[Silvermane]]'s clutches. He also becomes young full-time by swapping energy with the baby Silvermane, regressing Silvermane back to an old man. In the episode \"Six Forgotten Warriors\" part 1\u20135, Vulture became a member of the Insidious Six replacing [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]].

It is explained the Vulture was a human who got Bestial powers, hanging out with Beastials and disrespecting humans while he was also playing with his human servant's son. When he caused his human friend trouble, he hated the [[High Evolutionary]] for what he did and rebelled against him.\n\n[[File:www.spidey2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Vulture (Adrian Toomes) in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series.]]\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Robert Englund]].<ref name=\"btva\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0802/11/index.htm|title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter:  Monday, February 11, 2008|website=www.comicscontinuum.com}}</ref> This version uses the black and red costume by [[Terry Dodson]] during his run on ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]'' with some differences and has a more bird-like nose. In his first episode \"Survival of the Fittest\", Toomes was an aerodynamics engineer who developed a magnetic air transport harness which enabled him to fly at high speeds and make agile aerial maneuvers. He showed his invention to Norman Osborn, but his concept is rejected. But when Osborn announces OsCorp Tech Flight, the outraged Toomes goes to OsCorp when Osborn interrupts him and assures that OsCorp has nothing to apologize for. Toomes accuses Norman of stealing his work, to which Osborn goes on to insulting Toomes as an 'old buzzard', saying that no one would believe he created Tech Flight because he had never amounted to any success before. As he is escorted out by security, Toomes declares that he no longer blames Otto Octavius for the theft of his work. Toomes then dons his suit, dubs himself the Vulture, and attacks Osborn. He is eventually defeated and jailed along with the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] by Spider-Man.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0712/08/index.htm|title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Saturday, December 8, 2007|website=www.comicscontinuum.com}}</ref> Toomes reappears in the episode \"Group Therapy\" in which he, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Montana (comics)|Montana]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] are busted out of Ryker's Island by Electro, and has his Vulture flight tech upgraded with reinforced steel. As part of the [[Sinister Six]], he and the other villains surprise and openly attack Spider-Man in retaliation for the web-slinger interfering with their plans. During a later battle, Vulture is defeated again when Spider-Man damages his helmet, causing him to pass out mid-flight. Vulture escapes prison once again in the episode \"Reinforcement\" to join the Sinister Six created by the Master Planner. When Master Planner sends the Sinister Six to attack Spider-Man, Vulture teams up with Electro to fight the web-slinger at Rockefeller Center. Vulture is caught in Spider-Man's webs and tied to the [[Rockefeller Center]] Christmas tree, then zapped by the overeager Electro and trapped when the tree collapses, but he is retrieved before the police arrive. In the episode \"Shear Strength\", Vulture continues to aid Master Planner's plan for world domination by gaining control over all the computers in the world and attempts to kill Osborn with an explosion to satisfy his hunger for revenge, but is stopped by Spider-Man. Vulture is later sent with Electro to kidnap [[Gwen Stacy]] in order to blackmail [[George Stacy]] into downloading the codes that would give Master Planner access to all the computers in the United States, and possibly the world. Master Planner sends Toomes, now with a laser-firing attachment to his Vulture flight pack, to distract Homeland Security agents so that Stacy can more easily steal the codes. When the plan is foiled by Spider-Man, Master Planner sends Vulture the order to withdraw. In the episode \"Gangland\", Vulture accompanies Doctor Octopus to a sit-down with Silvermane and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]. When [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] instigated a fight between the three crime lords, Vulture leaped to protect Doctor Octopus but was quickly dispatched by Hammerhead. He escaped with [[Silver Sable]] before the police could arrest them.\n\n* A teenaged version of Adrian Toomes appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].<ref name=\"btva\"/><ref>{{cite episode|title=The Vulture|series=''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''|network=Disney XD|season=3|number=6|airdate=28 September 2014}}</ref> Introduced in ''Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors'', this version is similar to Jimmy Natale in having organic wings and sonic shrieks along with a vulture-like anatomy (a beak, vulture feet, vulture feet-like hands and the presence of dark green feathers) that he can freely shift to from his human form. The episode \"The Vulture\" revealed that he turned out to be one of Doctor Octopus's animal serum experiments who had his mind wiped to make room for programming, resulting in his [[amnesia]]. While living in an abandoned building, Adrian searched for information about himself by stealing from other criminals in the streets, dubbed the 'Vulture' by the [[Daily Bugle|Daily Bugle Communications]] and now a target for S.H.I.E.L.D. After one of his nightly heists, Vulture met and befriended Spider-Man and promised to help him. After intimidating [[Harry Osborn]] fruitlessly for information, Spider-Man took him to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier to find answers. However, Doctor Octopus forced Adrian to attack Spider-Man by activating Vulture's mind programming. Vulture is ordered to free Doctor Octopus and the two head back to Vulture's hideout, which turns out to be one of Doctor Octopus's labs. Spider-Man follows and helps Vulture overcome his mind programming and they defeat Doctor Octopus. After Doctor Octopus' defeat, Spider-Man gave him an offer to join a [[New Warriors|team of superhero warriors]] but declined as he wanted to find his own path as he searches through any Oscorp leads for his missing past. He soon ended up a recruit of [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] (using stolen data from Doctor Octopus's computer of his real name). In the episode \"New Warriors\", Vulture ends up being a member of Taskmaster's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|team]] alongside [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]. Taskmaster's team attacks the Tri-Carrier and trick [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] and [[Amadeus Cho|Iron Spider]] into freeing several supervillains led by the Green Goblin. When Vulture sees Doctor Octopus among the villains, he wants revenge but Taskmaster tells him to wait and will get his chance for payback. When the escaped supervillains take off in a Quinjet, Taskmaster allows Vulture to get his revenge on Doctor Octopus by causing the Quinjet to crash onto the Tri-Carrier. While the other villains are defeated (sans the Goblin), Spider-Man lets Vulture escape as they were once friends. Vulture has a cameo appearance in the episode \"Contest of Champions\" [Part 1] among the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]'s villain collection against Spider-Man and the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]]. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister Six'', his character is equipped with [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] armor that initially resembles Blackie Drago's green armor in the Ultimate universe and then his original counterpart's red and black armor. In the episode \"Iron Vulture\", Vulture tries to kill the Osborns (albeit reluctantly) in exchange for Doctor Octopus's information containing his past. The two, alongside an Octobot, end up fighting Spider-Man, [[Miles Morales|Kid Arachnid]], Iron Patriot and the Patrioteer. Using Iron Patriot's helmet, Adrian found no records of his past in Oscorp's files or Doctor Octopus's data files, causing Adrian to attack Doctor Octopus in rage. Wanting to keep a weapon and potential recruit for the [[Sinister Six]], Doctor Octopus's nanites overrides Vulture's armor, causing him to lose his free will. Before he loses his free will, Adrian tells Spider-Man that Doctor Octopus has a [[Ben Reilly|spy]] in S.H.I.E.L.D. and then takes off. In the episode \"Beached\", Spider-Man and Iron Spider were searching for the rogue Vulture before Doctor Octopus could find him. Vulture encounters Spider-Man and Iron Spider; Spider-Man's attempts to reach out foiled by Iron Spider seeing Vulture as a mindless monster. During a mid-air battle, Vulture left the young heroes on an island, where the two find Sandman being controlled by Doctor Octopus. After saving Sandman, Spider-Man and Iron Spider speculate that Vulture purposely led them to the island to help Sandman, believing Vulture might retain some of his free will. In the two-part series finale \"Graduation Day\", Vulture reappears as a member of Superior Sinister Six alongside the Rhino, [[Kraven the Hunter]], the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] and [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. At the docks, he and Kraven attack Cloak, Dagger, [[Squirrel Girl]] and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]. Squirrel Girl's squirrels subdue and capture him. Upon breaking out of his cell, Vulture joins the Superior Sinister Six and fights against Spider-Man. During the battle at Oscorp, Spider-Man used one of Doctor Octopus's antidote darts to cure Vulture, which also freed Adrian from his mind-controlling armor and helped him regain his memories of his past. Adrian and Alex O'Hirn briefly assist Spider-Man against Kraven, and later enrolls in S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy under Spider-Man's supervision.\n\n* Vulture appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/tv/news/869243-marvels-animated-spider-man-voice-cast-and-premiere-date|title=Marvel's Animated Spider-Man Voice Cast and Premiere Date|date=14 July 2017|publisher=}}</ref>, voiced by [[Alastair Duncan (actor)|Alastair Duncan]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version is a middle-aged man with reddish-brown hair, and his Vulture flight suit has a visor and a neck device that enables him to perform sonic attacks. In the episode \"Horizon High\" Pt. 1, Vulture attacks Spider-Man after Spider-Man thwarts his henchmen's robbery of [[Vibranium]]. During the fight, Spider-Man had to let Vulture getaway when he causes a sonic attack that sends shards of the window glass towards two police officers. Vulture later crashes the aftermath of the sabotage to the Vibranium device where he abducts [[Max Modell]] as part of his revenge, as Toomes was a former employee of Horizon High but was fired for stealing equipment, though Vulture claimed that his technology was not of Modell. After saving Max, Spider-Man heads back to the school to obtain the Vibranium where [[Spencer Smythe]] was displeased with Vulture's interference. Vulture states to Spencer that he does not care for Spencer's personal issues towards Modell and does a sonic attack to knock down Spencer. Spider-Man manages to defeat Vulture just as the police arrive. In the episode \"Symbiotic Relationship\", the black-suited Spider-Man sights Vulture flying around the city and takes him down only for the police to vouch for Toomes as Norman Osborn had negotiated his release in exchange for being a teacher at Osborn Academy. Toomes is later seen working on his Vulture suit when Osborn comes in to discuss the Vulture Force as Adrian suspects that the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|V-252]] will be presented. After Osborn figures out that the V-252 is on Spider-Man, Adrian and Alistair attack Spider-Man with Vulture sonic attacks, enabling Spider-Man to break the V-252 off and steal the V-252's containment device from Osborn. In the episode \"Ultimate Spider-Man\", Adrian continues to acts as a confidant for Norman and learns about [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Raymond Warren]]'s spider experiments and the [[Spider-Slayers]]' purpose after Spencer attacked Oscorp as a diversion to steal some Warren's spider specimens. In the episode \"Kraven's Amazing Hunt\", Adrian joins Norman in capturing with Spider-Man and Kraven the Hunter, after the latter's actions veer off his deal with Norman. They take the two a lab to take Spider-Man's blood, but the Ultimate Spider-Man stops them and fights Adrian off before he and Norman are forced to flee when the lab explodes. In the episode \"The Rise of Doc Ock\" Pt. 4, Vulture is shown to be a member of the Osborn Commandoes, though he gets brainwashed by Doctor Octopus as the Sinister Five's member. In the two-part episode \"Hobgoblin\", Vulture is still with the Sinister Five. Vulture and the others wear Spider-Man down long enough for Doctor Octopus to brainwash into the Sinister Six's newest member, only for them to be freed by Spider-Man and the Hobgoblin. Vulture is stated to have been taken into custody (off-screen) along with the rest of the Sinister Five by Hobgoblin. In the episode \"Rise Above It All\", Toomes works to reform himself but is given an upgraded Vulture suit by the Wake Riders. However, Vulture manages to escape. During the multi-episode \"Goblin War\", Toomes now uses Green Goblin-esque technology as the '''[[Goblin King (comics)|Goblin King]]''', the cult-like Goblin Nation organization's leader with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], Crossbones and Slivermane as enforcers. When Doctor Octopus sacrifices himself to use the Neuro Cortex to overload the Goblin Mech, Adrian ejects from it and is webbed up by Spider-Man.\n** A Vulturion-esque group called the '''Vulture Force''' appears in season one voiced by [[Max Mittelman]], [[Fred Tatasciore]], and [[Jim Cummings]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Symbiotic Relationship|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=7|airdate=September 16, 2017}}</ref> The group uses upgraded Vulture suits thanks to Oscorp.

After it's figured that the V-252 is on Spider-Man, Alistair and Adrian attack Spider-Man with Vulture sonic attacks, enabling Spider-Man to separate from the V-252 and steal the containment device. In the episode \"Stark Expo\", Norman uses the Vulture Force to be introduced at the Stark Expo only for their Vulture outfits to be hijacked by [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] to fight Spider-Man using the V-252. \n** Another Vulturion-esque group called the '''Wake Riders''' appears in season two.

Toomes threatens to harm Parker if he continues to interfere in his business.

Vulture appears as a boss in the [[PlayStation Portable]] version of the game, voiced again by Dwight Schultz.<ref name=\"btva\"/> He is broken out of prison by [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] alongside Mysterio and Shocker (although it is later revealed that he was broken out by accident, Rhino having been hired by [[Doctor Octopus]] to break out only Shocker), and goes on to plants bombs around the city, demanding ransom money. After Spider-Man defuses all his bombs, Vulture tries to escape, but Spider-Man defeats him at a construction site following a chase through the city and leaves him for the police, not before Vulture reveals to Spider-Man that he was kicked out of a job with Rhino and Shocker at the docks.\n\n* Adrian Toomes appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' game (for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]), voiced by [[Brian George]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version is shown to be a researcher at Trask Industries, owned by [[Bolivar Trask]], and a former colleague of Peter Parker and [[Eddie Brock]]'s fathers before their deaths. Toomes observes the battle between Peter Parker and Venom at the beginning of the game, after Eddie took the Venom [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] from Trask Industries all for himself, and then calls Trask to inform him about the Venom suit's return. Later, after Venom is captured by [[Silver Sable]] and brought to Trask Industries, Toomes and Trask speak to Eddie and convince him to test the suit for them. After a battle with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], during which he had more control over the Venom suit in the presence of Spider-Man, Eddie returns to Trask Industries and tells Toomes about it, who remarks that the suit was made using Richard Parker's DNA, meaning that Peter is Spider-Man and getting some of his DNA will help complete it; however, after being taken by Silver Sable to hunt Peter down, Venom escapes. Near the end of the game, after both Venom and Spider-Man are captured and brought to Trask Industries, Toomes inject Peter with a micro-sample of the Venom symbiote, while telling him that he knew his father. This ends up transforming Peter into [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], who knocks Toomes unconscious and then escapes.\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[Kristoffer Tabori]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> This version of the character uses wings with sword-like blades for feathers that can attach and detach from his suit through magnetic means, and, thus, can also be used as throwable projectiles. Early on in the game, Vulture is shown to be working for the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] as his enforcer and supplier of high-tech armor and [[Green Goblin|Goblin]] [[Hobgoblin (comics)|gliders]] for his goons. With info from either [[Moon Knight]] or [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], Spider-Man tracks down Vulture at his hideout in the Kronas Corporation building and fights him, alongside some of Kingpin's goons equipped with gliders. After defeating Vulture, Spider-Man leaves him for the police and, depending on the player's choice, can either joke about him, or threaten him not to mess with him again; regardless the choice, Vulture then becomes an ally and the player can summon him at any time during gameplay to help them fight enemies. Shortly before the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] invasion, Spider-Man has to choose between Vulture and Moon Knight to take him to Ryker's Island, in order to release the [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Tinkerer]], in the hopes that he could find a countermeasure to the symbiotes. During the invasion, Vulture is shown to be working with both Kingpin and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to stop the symbiote threat, while the Tinkerer is working on a device that could destroy all the symbiotes without harming the hosts. Near the end of the game, Vulture gets infected by a symbiote and leads an attack of \"'''Vulturelings'''\" (his own offspring of symbiotes) to destroy the Tinkerer's device, but Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. stop him, with Spider-Man defeating Symbiote Vulture in an aerial battle and removing the symbiote. Afterward, Spider-Man takes Vulture with him to the device and prepares to activate it, but Vulture tells him that, once set off, it would mean losing the black suit and its powers forever, whereas destroying the device shall grant him complete control over the city. Depending on the choices made through the game, Spider-Man can either follow his moral code and activate the device, destroying all the symbiotes, including his black suit, or listen to Vulture and destroy it. If it's the latter, Vulture will then take Spider-Man to the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] to defeat [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] for good, and, alongside the other villain allies, helps fight off the symbiotes aboard while Spider-Man plants bombs to destroy the Helicarrier. Vulture guides Spider-Man and helps him find the bombs, but threatens to blow up the Helicarrier with him still aboard, although Spider-Man manages to defeat Venom and escapes from the Helicarrier just in time.\n\n* The Marvel Noir incarnation of Vulture appears as a villain character in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates|title=San Diego Comic-Con 2010: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension Updates|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref> voiced by [[Steve Blum]].<ref name=\"btva\"/> The Noir incarnation of Adrian Toomes is a deformed, murderous cannibal and described as Norman Osborn's \"right-hand monster\". It is specifically stated that Vulture not only killed [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] but actually ate alive, further increasing [[Spider-Man Noir|Spider-Man]]'s grudge against him. It is also stated that his love of human meat began with people laughing at him for his appearance during his time in a cage. In combat Vulture is as agile as Spider-Man, and uses throwing knives, bombs, shurikens, [[Molotov cocktail]]s, and bolas against Spider-Man. When Vulture uses a tablet fragment, he gains the ability to teleport away in a puff of black feathers. At one point, he is heard coveting the fragment, claiming that with this new power he no longer has to take orders from Osborn or anyone else. Light is his only weakness as he seems to have strong photosensitivity. Spider-Man manages to defeat him and claim the tablet fragment. During the credits, he is shown back in the cage having eaten a couple of birds while people stare at him. In the [[Nintendo DS]] version of the game, the 2099 incarnation of Vulture serves as a villain to [[Spider-Man 2099]].\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture is featured as a boss in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/20/lego-marvel-super-heroes-characters-and-cast-revealed|title=LEGO Marvel Super Heroes: Characters and Cast Revealed|first=Greg|last=Miller|date=20 July 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"btva\"/> In a bonus mission, he and [[Howard the Duck]] storm Marvel Comics HQ and hold the artists there hostage.

The heroes are able to defeat the Sinister Six moments before [[Kang the Conqueror]] uses his technology to steal [[Manhattan]] and make it part of his battle arena called Chronopolis.\n\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game,<ref>{{cite web|title=Spider-Man E3 Gameplay Footage Reveals Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, And Vulture|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2018/2018/06/11/spider-man-e3-gameplay-footage-reveals-electro-rhino-scorpion-and-vulture|accessdate=11 June 2018}}</ref> voiced again by Dwight Schultz.<ref name=\"btva\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Spider-Man (2018 Video Game) Full Cast & Crew|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5807780/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|accessdate=19 September 2018|website=IMDb}}</ref> This version of the character is a former electronics engineer who turned to a life of crime and designed himself a high tech flight suit with wings that allows flying at very high speeds. This version of Vulture features retractable wings and can use his \"feathers\" as throwable projectiles; he also wears a mouth-covering resembling a beak, which both helps him breathe at high altitudes, and gives him a more robotic-sounding voice. Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Electro (comics)|Electro]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], Vulture serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having already fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, sometime prior to the events of the game, was defeated by Spider-Man and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum-security prison designed especially for supervillains. During one of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s broadcast shows, it is revealed that Vulture has been diagnosed with spinal [[cancer]] and has been moved to the Raft's infirmary. After Otto Octavius (now calling himself \"[[Doctor Octopus]]\") attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft, resulting in massive prison breakouts, he releases Vulture, Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, and [[Mister Negative]] and recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires; Vulture wishes to be cured of his cancer. When Spider-Man comes to investigate the breakout, Vulture attacks the hero while he is chasing after Electro, and later joins his fellow Sinister Six members in ambushing the hero after Electro lured him to a landing pad. Spider-Man is easily defeated by the Sinister Six, although Octavius orders them not to kill him (because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Octavius is aware of Spider-Man's secret identity). The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Vulture and Electro being sent to cripple the city's power supply. After being lured into a trap by Otto, Spider-Man survives, only to be captured by Vulture, who brings him to Electro so that together they could finally kill the web-slinger. Spider-Man ultimately defeats both of them and leaves them for the police to take them back into custody. In his character biography, Spider-Man reveals that he had struggled a lot to defeat Vulture during their very first battles, as he proved to be much faster than he would have expected.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVq0zG_0P0Y Spider-Man vs. The Vulture in 2 Minutes- Marvel TL;DR] by Marvel Entertainment on YouTube\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Vulture_(Adrian_Toomes) Vulture I] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Vulture_(Blackie_Drago) Vulture II] at Marvel.com\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Adrian_Toomes_%28Earth-616%29 Vulture I] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Raniero_Drago_%28Earth-616%29 Vulture II] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Clifton_Shallot_%28Earth-616%29 Vulture III] at Marvel Wiki\n* [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/James_Natale_%28Earth-616%29 Vulture IV] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/vulturedrago.htm|Vulture II}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/vultureshallot.htm|Vulture III}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/vulturenatalesm.htm|Vulture IV}}\n\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Sinister Six}}\n{{Black Cat}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n\n[[Category:Action film villains]]\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gerry Conway]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita Sr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Waid]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ross Andru]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with cancer]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters code names]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n", "name_user": "Ishansri", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulture_(Marvel_Comics)"}

For example, the faculty of \"philoprogenitiveness\", from the Greek for \"love of offspring\", was located centrally at the back of the head (see illustration of the chart from ''Webster's Academic Dictionary'').\n\nThese areas were said to be proportional to a person's propensities. The importance of an organ was derived from relative size compared to other organs. It was believed that the [[Human cranium|cranial]] skull\u2014like a glove on the hand\u2014accommodates to the different sizes of these areas of the brain, so that a person's capacity for a given personality trait could be determined simply by measuring the area of the skull that overlies the corresponding area of the brain.\n\nPhrenology, which focuses on personality and character, is distinct from [[craniometry]], which is the study of skull size, weight and shape, and [[physiognomy]], the study of facial features.\n\n==Method==\nPhrenology is a process that involves observing and/or feeling the skull to determine an individual's psychological attributes. [[Franz Joseph Gall]] believed that the brain was made up of 27 individual organs that determined [[personality]], the first 19 of these 'organs' he believed to exist in other animal species. Phrenologists would run their fingertips and palms over the skulls of their patients to feel for enlargements or indentations.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=2}} The phrenologist would often take measurements with a tape measure of the overall head size and more rarely employ a craniometer, a special version of a [[caliper]]. In general, instruments to measure sizes of cranium continued to be used after the mainstream phrenology had ended. The phrenologists put emphasis on using drawings of individuals with particular traits, to determine the character of the person and thus many phrenology books show pictures of subjects. From absolute and relative sizes of the skull the phrenologist would assess the character and temperament of the patient.\n\nGall's list of the \"brain organs\" was specific. An enlarged organ meant that the patient used that particular \"[[organ (anatomy)|organ]]\" extensively. The number \u2013 and more detailed meanings \u2013 of organs were added later by other phrenologists. The 27 areas varied in function, from sense of color, to religiosity, to being combative or destructive. Each of the 27 \"brain organs\" was located under a specific area of the skull. As a phrenologist felt the skull, he would use his knowledge of the shapes of heads and organ positions to determine the overall natural strengths and weaknesses of an individual. Phrenologists believed the head revealed natural tendencies but not absolute limitations or strengths of character. The first phrenological chart gave the names of the organs described by Gall; it was a single sheet, and sold for a cent. Later charts were more expansive.<ref>[Samuel Roberts Wells], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=020xAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=how+to+read+character:+a+new+illustrated+hand-book&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEi6XFwsHNAhWix4MKHbRuB2sQ6AEILDAA#v=onepage&q=how%20to%20read%20character%3A%20a%20new%20illustrated%20hand-book&f=false How to Read Character: A New Illustrated Hand-Book of Phrenology and Physiognomy, for Students and Examiners; with A Descriptive Chart]'' (New York: Fowler & Wells Co., 1885 and later editions), p.

It was Gall's collaborator [[Johann Spurzheim|Johann Gaspar Spurzheim]] who would popularize the term \"phrenology\".{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=49}}{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=56}}\n\nIn 1809 Gall began writing his principal<ref>1833, ''The American Journal of the Medical Sciences'', Southern Society for Clinical Investigation</ref> work, ''The Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System in General, and of the Brain in Particular, with Observations upon the possibility of ascertaining the several Intellectual and Moral Dispositions of Man and Animal, by the configuration of their Heads''. It was not published until 1819. In the introduction to this main work, Gall makes the following statement in regard to his doctrinal principles, which comprise the intellectual basis of phrenology:{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=53}}\n\n{{quote|\n* The Brain is the organ of the mind\n* The brain is not a homogenous unity, but an aggregate of mental organs with specific functions\n* The cerebral organs are topographically localized\n* Other things being equal, the relative size of any particular mental organ is indicative of the power or strength of that organ\n* Since the skull ossifies over the brain during infant development, external craniological means could be used to diagnose the internal states of the mental characters}}\n\nThrough careful observation and extensive experimentation, Gall believed he had established a relationship between aspects of character, called ''faculties'', with precise ''organs'' in the [[Human brain|brain]].\n\nJohann Spurzheim was Gall's most important collaborator. He worked as Gall's anatomist until 1813 when for unknown reasons they had a permanent falling out.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=49}} Publishing under his own name Spurzheim successfully disseminated phrenology throughout the United Kingdom during his lecture tours through 1814 and 1815{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=3}} and the United States in 1832 where he would eventually die.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=199}}\n\nGall was more concerned with creating a physical science, so it was through Spurzheim that phrenology was first spread throughout Europe and America.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=49}} Phrenology, while not universally accepted, was hardly a fringe phenomenon of the era. [[George Combe]] would become the chief promoter of phrenology throughout the English-speaking world after he viewed a brain dissection by Spurzheim, convincing him of phrenology's merits.\n\n[[File:COMBE.jpg|thumb|[[George Combe]]]]The popularization of phrenology in the middle and working classes was due in part to the idea that scientific knowledge was important and an indication of sophistication and modernity.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=25}} Cheap and plentiful pamphlets, as well as the growing popularity of scientific lectures as entertainment, also helped spread phrenology to the masses. Combe created a system of philosophy of the human mind{{sfn|Combe|1851|p=1}} that became popular with the masses because of its simplified principles and wide range of social applications that were in harmony with the liberal Victorian world view.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=3}} George Combe's book ''On the Constitution of Man and its Relationship to External Objects'' sold over 200,000 copies through nine editions.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=50}} Combe also devoted a large portion of his book to reconciling religion and phrenology, which had long been a sticking point. Another reason for its popularity was that phrenology balanced between free will and [[determinism]].{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=5}} A person's inherent faculties were clear, and no faculty was viewed as evil, though the abuse of a faculty was. Phrenology allowed for self-improvement and upward mobility, while providing fodder for attacks on aristocratic privilege.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=5}}{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=51}} Phrenology also had wide appeal because of its being a reformist philosophy not a radical one.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=6}} Phrenology was not limited to the common people, and both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert invited George Combe to read the heads of their children.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=1}}\n\nThe American brothers Lorenzo Niles Fowler (1811\u20131896) and [[Orson Squire Fowler]] (1809\u20131887) were leading phrenologists of their time. Orson, together with associates [[Charlotte Fowler Wells#career|Samuel Robert Wells]] and Nelson Sizer, ran the phrenological business and publishing house ''[[Fowler & Wells Company|Fowlers & Wells]]'' in [[New York City]]. Meanwhile, Lorenzo spent much of his life in England where he initiated the famous phrenological publishing house, L.N Fowler & Co., and gained considerable fame with his ''phrenology head'' (a [[porcelain|china]] head showing the phrenological faculties), which has become a symbol of the discipline.<ref name=\"Phrenological head\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/images/I025/10287384.aspx|title=Oops...|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318130249/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/images/I025/10287384.aspx|archive-date=2010-03-18|url-status=dead}}</ref> Orson Fowler was known for his [[Octagon house|octagonal house]].\n\nPhrenology came about at a time when scientific procedures and standards for acceptable evidence were still being codified.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=261}} In the context of Victorian society, phrenology was a respectable scientific theory. The [[Phrenological Society of Edinburgh]] founded by George and Andrew Combe was an example of the credibility of phrenology at the time, and included a number of extremely influential social reformers and intellectuals, including the publisher [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], the astronomer [[John Pringle Nichol]], the evolutionary environmentalist [[Hewett Cottrell Watson]], and asylum reformer [[William A.F. Browne]]. In 1826, out of the 120 members of the Edinburgh society an estimated one third were from a medical background.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=260}} By the 1840s there were more than 28 phrenological societies in London with over 1000 members.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=50}} Another important scholar was [[Luigi Ferrarese]], the leading Italian phrenologist.<ref name=\"Yasgur\">Yasgur's Homeopathic Dictionary, Jay Yasgur, 2003, p. 184.</ref> He advocated that governments should embrace phrenology as a scientific means of conquering many social ills, and his ''Memorie Riguardanti La Dottrina Frenologica'' (1836), is considered \"one of the fundamental 19th century works in the field\".<ref name=\"Yasgur\"/>\n\nTraditionally the mind had been studied through introspection. Phrenology provided an attractive, biological alternative that attempted to unite all mental phenomena using consistent biological terminology.{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=83}} Gall's approach prepared the way for studying the mind that would lead to the downfall of his own theories.{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=75}} Phrenology contributed to development of physical anthropology, forensic medicine, knowledge of the nervous system and brain anatomy as well as contributing to applied psychology.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|pp=259\u2013261}}\n\nJohn Elliotson was a brilliant but erratic heart specialist who became a phrenologist in the 1840s. He was also a [[Animal magnetism|mesmerist]] and combined the two into something he called phrenomesmerism or phrenomagnatism.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=260}} Changing behaviour through mesmerism eventually won out in Elliotson's hospital, putting phrenology in a subordinate role.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=261}} Others amalgamated phrenology and [[Animal magnetism|mesmerism]] as well, such as the practical phrenologists Collyer and [[Joseph Rodes Buchanan|Joseph R. Buchanan]]. The benefits of combining mesmerism and phrenology was that the trance the patient was placed in was supposed to allow for the manipulation of his/her penchants and qualities.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=260}} For example, if the organ of self-esteem was touched, the subject would take on a haughty expression.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=213}}\n\n{{Quote box |salign=right|align=right|width=20%\n|quote = Phrenology has been psychology's great [[wikt:faux pas#English|''faux pas'']].\n|author = {{mdash}}{{thinsp}}J.C.

This was due only in part to a growing amount of evidence against phrenology.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=260}} Phrenologists had never been able to agree on the most basic mental organ numbers, going from 27 to over 40,{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=259}}{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=52}} and had difficulty locating the mental organs. Phrenologists relied on cranioscopic readings of the skull to find organ locations.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=81}} [[Jean Pierre Flourens]]' experiments on the brains of pigeons indicated that the loss of parts of the brain either caused no loss of function, or the loss of a completely different function than what had been attributed to it by phrenology. Flourens' experiment, while not perfect, seemed to indicate that Gall's supposed organs were imaginary.{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=75}}{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=80}} Scientists had also become disillusioned with phrenology since its exploitation with the middle and working classes by entrepreneurs. The popularization had resulted in the simplification of phrenology and mixing in it of principles of physiognomy, which had from the start been rejected by Gall as an indicator of personality.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=56}} Phrenology from its inception was tainted by accusations of promoting materialism and atheism, and being destructive of morality. These were all factors which led to the downfall of phrenology.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=81}}{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=211}} Recent studies, using modern day technology like Magnetic Resonance Imaging have further disproven phrenology claims.<ref>{{Cite biorxiv |last1=Parker Jones |first1=F. |date=31 January 2018 |title=An empirical, 21st century evaluation of phrenology |biorxiv=243089}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 20th century, a revival of interest in phrenology occurred, partly because of studies of [[evolution]], [[criminology]] and [[anthropology]] (as pursued by [[Cesare Lombroso]]). The most famous British phrenologist of the 20th century was the [[London]] psychiatrist [[Bernard Hollander]] (1864\u20131934). His main works, ''The Mental Function of the Brain'' (1901) and ''Scientific Phrenology'' (1902), are an appraisal of Gall's teachings. Hollander introduced a quantitative approach to the phrenological diagnosis, defining a method for measuring the skull, and comparing the measurements with statistical averages.<ref name=Hollander>{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=Bernard|title=A Contribution to a Scientific Phrenology|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1891|volume=20|pages=227\u2013234|jstor=2842265|doi=10.2307/2842265}}</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, [[Paul Bouts]] (1900\u20131999) began studying phrenology from a pedagogical background, using the phrenological analysis to define an individual [[pedagogy]]. Combining phrenology with [[personality type|typology]] and [[graphology]], he coined a global approach known as [[psychognomy]].\n\nBouts, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest, became the main promoter of renewed 20th-century interest in phrenology and psychognomy in Belgium. He was also active in [[Brazil]] and [[Canada]], where he founded institutes for characterology. His works ''Psychognomie'' and ''Les Grandioses Destin\u00e9es individuelle et humaine dans la lumi\u00e8re de la Caract\u00e9rologie et de l'Evolution c\u00e9r\u00e9bro-cranienne'' are considered standard works in the field. In the latter work, which examines the subject of [[paleoanthropology]], Bouts developed a [[teleology|teleological]] and [[orthogenesis|orthogenetical]] view on a ''perfecting evolution,'' from the paleo-encephalical skull shapes of [[prehistory|prehistoric man]], which he considered still prevalent in [[criminal]]s and savages, towards a higher form of mankind, thus perpetuating phrenology's problematic racializing of the human frame. Bouts died on March 7, 1999. His work has been continued by the Dutch foundation PPP (''Per Pulchritudinem in Pulchritudine''), operated by Anette M\u00fcller, one of Bouts' students.\n\nDuring the 1930s Belgian colonial authorities in [[Rwanda]] used phrenology to explain the so-called superiority of [[Tutsi]]s over [[Hutu]]s.<ref name=Rwanda>{{cite web|last=Rea|first=Lisa|title=Applying Restorative Justice to the Genocide in Rwanda|url=http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=235:applying-restorative-justice-to-the-genocide-in-rwanda&catid=49:issue-6&Itemid=186|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Application==\n[[File:Phrenology journal (1848).jpg|thumb|1848 edition of ''American Phrenological Journal'' published by Fowlers & Wells, New York City]]\n\n=== Racism ===\nEuropeans looking for a [[scientific racism|scientific basis for their racism]] found phrenology attractive as justification for European superiority over other \"lesser\" races. By comparing skulls of different ethnic groups it supposedly allowed for ranking of races from least to most evolved. Broussais, a disciple of Gall, proclaimed that the Caucasians were the \"most beautiful\" while peoples like the [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] and [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] would never become civilized since they had no cerebral organ for producing great artists.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=59}} Few phrenologists argued against the [[Abolitionism|emancipation of the slaves]]. Instead they argued that through education and interbreeding the lesser peoples could improve.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=62}} Another argument was that the natural inequality of people could be used to situate them in the most appropriate place in society. [[Sexism|Gender stereotyping]] was also common with phrenology. Women whose heads were generally larger in the back with lower foreheads were thought to have underdeveloped organs necessary for success in the arts and sciences while having larger mental organs relating to the care of children and religion.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=64}} While phrenologists did not contend the existence of talented women, this minority did not provide justification for citizenship or participation in politics.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=65}}\n\n=== Education ===\nOne of the considered practical applications of phrenology was education. Due to the nature of phrenology people were naturally considered unequal, as very few people would have a naturally perfect balance between organs. Thus education would play an important role in creating a balance through rigorous exercise of beneficial organs while repressing baser ones. One of the best examples of this is [[F\u00e9lix Voisin]] who for approximately ten years ran a reform school in [[Issy-les-Moulineaux|Issy]] for the express purpose of correction of the mind of children who had suffered some hardship. Voisin focused on four categories of children for his reform school:{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=74}}\n* Slow learners\n* Spoiled, neglected, or harshly treated children\n* Willful, disorderly children\n* Children at high risk of inheriting mental disorders\n\n=== Criminology ===\nPhrenology was one of the first to bring about the idea of rehabilitation of criminals instead of vindictive punishments that would not stop criminals, only with the reorganizing a disorganized brain would bring about change.{{sfn|Lyons|2009|pp=79\u201380}} Voisin believed along with others the accuracy of phrenology in diagnosing criminal tendencies. Diagnosis could point to the type of offender, the insane, an idiot or brute, and by knowing this an appropriate course of action could be taken.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=74}} A strict system of reward and punishment, hard work and religious instruction, was thought to be able to correct those who had been abandoned and neglected with little education and moral ground works. Those who were considered mentally challenged could be put to work and housed collectively while only criminals of intellect and vicious intent needed to be confined and isolated.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=77}} Phrenology also advocated variable prison sentences, the idea being that those who were only defective in education and lacking in morals would soon be released while those who were mentally deficient could be watched and the truly abhorrent criminals would never be released.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=6}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=Punishing Criminals|journal=Phrenological Journal|date=March 1871|volume=LII|series=Num 3|issue=Whole Number 386|pages=200\u2013204}}</ref>{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=80}} For other patients phrenology could help redirect impulses, one homicidal individual became a butcher to control his impulses, while another became a [[military chaplain]] so he could witness killings.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=76}} Phrenology also provided reformist arguments for the lunatic asylums of the Victorian era. [[John Conolly]], a physician interested in psychological aspects of disease, used phrenology on his patients in an attempt to use it as a diagnostic tool. While the success of this approach is debatable, Conolly, through phrenology, introduced a more humane way of dealing with the mentally ill.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=261}}\n\n=== Psychiatry ===\nIn psychiatry, phrenology was proposed as a viable model in order to reform the disciplinary field. The South Italian psychiatrist Biagio Miraglia proposed a new classification of mental illness based on brain functions as they were described by Gall. In Biagio Gioacchino Miraglia's view, madness is consequent to dysfunctions of the cerebral organs: \u201cThe organs of the brain that may become ill in isolation or in complex get their activities infected through energy, or depression, or inertia or deficiency. So the madness can take the appearance of these three characteristic forms; i.e. for enhanced activity, or for depressed activity, or for inertia or deficiency of brain activities\u201d.<ref>Miraglia, Biagio G. (1874/2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-02.pdf A new classification of mental illness based on brain functions.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):636\u20137.</ref>\n\n=== Psychology ===\nIn the [[Victorian era]], phrenology as a psychology was taken seriously and permeated the literature and novels of the day. Many prominent public figures. such as the [[Henry Ward Beecher|Reverend Henry Ward Beecher]] (a college classmate and initial partner of Orson Fowler) promoted phrenology actively as a source of psychological insight and self-knowledge.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=204}} Especially in Britain and the US, people visited phrenologists to have their heads analysed. After such an examination, clients received a written delineation of their character or a standardized chart with their score, combined with advice on how to improve themselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sysling|first=Fenneke|date=June 2018|title=Science and self-assessment: phrenological charts 1840\u20131940|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|language=en|volume=51|issue=2|pages=261\u2013280|doi=10.1017/S0007087418000055|pmid=29576034|issn=0007-0874}}</ref> People also consulted phrenologists for advice in matters such as hiring personnel or finding suitable marriage partners.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=210}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pseudosciencepar00hine|title=Pseudoscience and the paranormal : a critical examination of the evidence|last=Hines, Terence.|date=1988|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=0879754192|location=Buffalo, N.Y.|oclc=17462273|url-access=registration}}</ref> As such, phrenology as a brain science waned but developed into the popular psychology of the 19th century.\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:(King1893NYC) pg330 FOWLER and WELLS CO, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF PHRENOLOGY, 27 EAST, 21ST STREET.jpg|thumb|American Institute of Phrenology (New York, 1893)]]\n\n===Britain===\nPhrenology was introduced at a time when the old theological and philosophical understanding of the mind was being questioned and no longer seemed adequate in a society that was experiencing rapid social and demographic changes.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=14}} Phrenology became one of the most popular movements of the Victorian Era. In part phrenology's success was due to George Combe tailoring phrenology for the middle class. Combe's book ''On the Constitution of Man and its Relationship to External Objects'' was one of the most popular of the time, selling over two hundred thousand copies in a ten-year period. Phrenology's success was also due in part because it was introduced at a time when scientific lectures were becoming a form of middle-class entertainment, exposing a large demographic of people to phrenological ideas who would not have heard them otherwise.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=2,9}} As a result of the changing of the times, along with new avenues for exposure and its multifaceted appeal, phrenology flourished in popular culture{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|pp=3\u20139}} although it was discredited as scientific theory by 1840.\n\n===France===\nWhile still not a fringe movement, there was not popular widespread support of phrenology in France. This was not only due to strong opposition of phrenology by French scholars but also once again accusations of promoting atheism, materialism and radical religious views. Politics in France also played a role in preventing rapid spread of phrenology.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=51\u201352}} In Britain phrenology had provided another tool to be used for situating demographic changes, the difference was there was less fear of revolutionary upheaval in Britain compared with France. Given that most French supporters of phrenology were liberal, left-wing or socialist, it was an objective of the social elite of France who held a restrained vision of social change that phrenology remain on the fringes. Another objection was that phrenology seemed to provide a built in excuse for criminal behaviour, since in its original form it was essentially [[Determinism|deterministic]] in nature.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=51\u201352}}\n\n===Ireland===\nPhrenology arrived in Ireland in 1815, through Spurzheim.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=30}} While Ireland largely mirrored British trends, with scientific lectures and demonstrations becoming a popular pastime of the age, by 1815 phrenology had already been ridiculed in some circles priming the audiences to its skeptical claims.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=28}} Because of this the general public valued it more for its comic relief than anything else, however it did find an audience in the [[English Dissenters|rational dissenters]] who found it an attractive alternative to explain human motivations without the attached superstitions of religion.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=28, 38}} The supporters of phrenology in Ireland were relegated to scientific subcultures because the Irish scholars neglected marginal movements like phrenology, denying it scientific support in Ireland.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=25}} In 1830 George Combe came to Ireland, his self-promotion barely winning out against his lack of medical expertise, still only drew lukewarm crowds. This was due to not only the [[Vatican City|Vatican's]] decree that phrenology was subversive of religion and morality but also that based on phrenology the \"Irish Catholics were sui generis a flawed and degenerate breed\".{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=35}} Because of the lack of scientific support, along with religious and prejudicial reasons phrenology never found a wide audience in Ireland.\n\n===United States===\nThrough the teachings of Gall and Spurzheim, phrenological teachings spread, and by 1834 when Combe came to lecture in the United States, phrenology had become a widespread popular movement.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|pp=205\u2013208}} Sensing commercial possibilities men like the Fowlers became phrenologists and sought additional ways to bring phrenology to the masses.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=208}} Though a popular movement, the intellectual elite of the United States found phrenology attractive because it provided a biological explanation of mental processes based on observation, yet it was not accepted uncritically. Some intellectuals accepted organology while questioning cranioscopy.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=206}} Gradually the popular success of phrenology undermined its scientific merits in the United States and elsewhere, along with its materialistic underpinnings, fostering radical religious views. There was increasing evidence to refute phrenological claims, and by the 1840s it had largely lost its credibility.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=210}} In the United States, especially in the South, phrenology faced an additional obstacle in the antislavery movement. While phrenologists usually claimed the superiority of the European race, they were often sympathetic to liberal causes including the antislavery movement; this sowed skepticism about phrenology among those who were pro-slavery.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=212}} The rise and surge in popularity in mesmerism, phrenomesmerism, also had a hand in the loss of interest in phrenology among intellectuals and the general public.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=213}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=APA handbook of personality and social psychology|others=Mikulincer, Mario., Shaver, Phillip R., Dovidio, John F., Simpson, Jeffrey A., American Psychological Association.|isbn=9781433816994|edition= First|location=Washington, DC|oclc=862928518|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Specific phrenological modules==\nFrom Combe:{{sfn|Combe|1851|pp=x\u2013xi}}\n[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An 1883 phrenology chart]]\n[[File:Earthenware phrenological bust, areas are marked off with an Wellcome L0057601.jpg|thumb|Phrenological bust]]\n<!--PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER-->\n\n===Propensities===\nPropensities do not form ideas; they solely produce propensities common to animals and man.\n* Adhesiveness\n* Alimentiveness\n* Amativeness\n* Acquisitiveness\n* Causality\n* [[Cautiousness]]\n* Combativeness\n* Concentrativeness\n* Constructiveness\n* Destructiveness\n* Ideality\n* Love of life\n* Philoprogenitiveness\n* Secretiveness\n\n===Sentiments===\n'''Lower sentiments'''\n\nThese are common to man and animal.\n* Cautiousness\n* Love of approbation\n* Self-esteem\n* Truthfulness\n\n'''Superior sentiments'''\n\nThese produce emotion or feeling lacking in animals.\n* [[Benevolence (phrenology)|Benevolence]]\n* Conscientiousness\n* Firmness\n* Hope\n* Ideality\n* Imitation\n* Veneration\n* Wit or Mirthfulness\n* Wonder\n\n===Intellectual faculties===\nThese are to know the external world and physical qualities\n* Coloring\n* Eventuality\n* Form\n* Hearing\n* Individuality\n* Language\n* Locality\n* Number\n* Order\n* Sight\n* Size\n* Smell\n* Taste\n* Time\n* Touch\n* Tune\n* Weight\n\n===Reflecting faculties===\nThese produce ideas of relation or reflect.

For example, the faculty of \"philoprogenitiveness\", from the Greek for \"love of offspring\", was located centrally at the back of the head (see illustration of the chart from ''Webster's Academic Dictionary'').\n\nThese areas were said to be proportional to a person's propensities. The importance of an organ was derived from relative size compared to other organs. It was believed that the [[Human cranium|cranial]] skull\u2014like a glove on the hand\u2014accommodates to the different sizes of these areas of the brain, so that a person's capacity for a given personality trait could be determined simply by measuring the area of the skull that overlies the corresponding area of the brain.\n\nPhrenology, which focuses on personality and character, is distinct from [[craniometry]], which is the study of skull size, weight and shape, and [[physiognomy]], the study of facial features.\n\n==Method==\nPhrenology is a process that involves observing and/or feeling the skull to determine an individual's psychological attributes. [[Franz Joseph Gall]] believed that the brain was made up of 27 individual organs that determined [[personality]], the first 19 of these 'organs' he believed to exist in other animal species. Phrenologists would run their fingertips and palms over the skulls of their patients to feel for enlargements or indentations.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=2}} The phrenologist would often take measurements with a tape measure of the overall head size and more rarely employ a craniometer, a special version of a [[caliper]]. In general, instruments to measure sizes of cranium continued to be used after the mainstream phrenology had ended. The phrenologists put emphasis on using drawings of individuals with particular traits, to determine the character of the person and thus many phrenology books show pictures of subjects. From absolute and relative sizes of the skull the phrenologist would assess the character and temperament of the patient.\n\nGall's list of the \"brain organs\" was specific. An enlarged organ meant that the patient used that particular \"[[organ (anatomy)|organ]]\" extensively. The number \u2013 and more detailed meanings \u2013 of organs were added later by other phrenologists. The 27 areas varied in function, from sense of color, to religiosity, to being combative or destructive. Each of the 27 \"brain organs\" was located under a specific area of the skull. As a phrenologist felt the skull, he would use his knowledge of the shapes of heads and organ positions to determine the overall natural strengths and weaknesses of an individual. Phrenologists believed the head revealed natural tendencies but not absolute limitations or strengths of character. The first phrenological chart gave the names of the organs described by Gall; it was a single sheet, and sold for a cent. Later charts were more expansive.<ref>[Samuel Roberts Wells], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=020xAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=how+to+read+character:+a+new+illustrated+hand-book&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEi6XFwsHNAhWix4MKHbRuB2sQ6AEILDAA#v=onepage&q=how%20to%20read%20character%3A%20a%20new%20illustrated%20hand-book&f=false How to Read Character: A New Illustrated Hand-Book of Phrenology and Physiognomy, for Students and Examiners; with A Descriptive Chart]'' (New York: Fowler & Wells Co., 1885 and later editions), p.

It was Gall's collaborator [[Johann Spurzheim|Johann Gaspar Spurzheim]] who would popularize the term \"phrenology\".{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=49}}{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=56}}\n\nIn 1809 Gall began writing his principal<ref>1833, ''The American Journal of the Medical Sciences'', Southern Society for Clinical Investigation</ref> work, ''The Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System in General, and of the Brain in Particular, with Observations upon the possibility of ascertaining the several Intellectual and Moral Dispositions of Man and Animal, by the configuration of their Heads''. It was not published until 1819. In the introduction to this main work, Gall makes the following statement in regard to his doctrinal principles, which comprise the intellectual basis of phrenology:{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=53}}\n\n{{quote|\n* The Brain is the organ of the mind\n* The brain is not a homogenous unity, but an aggregate of mental organs with specific functions\n* The cerebral organs are topographically localized\n* Other things being equal, the relative size of any particular mental organ is indicative of the power or strength of that organ\n* Since the skull ossifies over the brain during infant development, external craniological means could be used to diagnose the internal states of the mental characters}}\n\nThrough careful observation and extensive experimentation, Gall believed he had established a relationship between aspects of character, called ''faculties'', with precise ''organs'' in the [[Human brain|brain]].\n\nJohann Spurzheim was Gall's most important collaborator. He worked as Gall's anatomist until 1813 when for unknown reasons they had a permanent falling out.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=49}} Publishing under his own name Spurzheim successfully disseminated phrenology throughout the United Kingdom during his lecture tours through 1814 and 1815{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=3}} and the United States in 1832 where he would eventually die.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=199}}\n\nGall was more concerned with creating a physical science, so it was through Spurzheim that phrenology was first spread throughout Europe and America.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=49}} Phrenology, while not universally accepted, was hardly a fringe phenomenon of the era. [[George Combe]] would become the chief promoter of phrenology throughout the English-speaking world after he viewed a brain dissection by Spurzheim, convincing him of phrenology's merits.\n\n[[File:COMBE.jpg|thumb|[[George Combe]]]]The popularization of phrenology in the middle and working classes was due in part to the idea that scientific knowledge was important and an indication of sophistication and modernity.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=25}} Cheap and plentiful pamphlets, as well as the growing popularity of scientific lectures as entertainment, also helped spread phrenology to the masses. Combe created a system of philosophy of the human mind{{sfn|Combe|1851|p=1}} that became popular with the masses because of its simplified principles and wide range of social applications that were in harmony with the liberal Victorian world view.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=3}} George Combe's book ''On the Constitution of Man and its Relationship to External Objects'' sold over 200,000 copies through nine editions.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=50}} Combe also devoted a large portion of his book to reconciling religion and phrenology, which had long been a sticking point. Another reason for its popularity was that phrenology balanced between free will and [[determinism]].{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=5}} A person's inherent faculties were clear, and no faculty was viewed as evil, though the abuse of a faculty was. Phrenology allowed for self-improvement and upward mobility, while providing fodder for attacks on aristocratic privilege.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=5}}{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=51}} Phrenology also had wide appeal because of its being a reformist philosophy not a radical one.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=6}} Phrenology was not limited to the common people, and both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert invited George Combe to read the heads of their children.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=1}}\n\nThe American brothers Lorenzo Niles Fowler (1811\u20131896) and [[Orson Squire Fowler]] (1809\u20131887) were leading phrenologists of their time. Orson, together with associates [[Charlotte Fowler Wells#career|Samuel Robert Wells]] and Nelson Sizer, ran the phrenological business and publishing house ''[[Fowler & Wells Company|Fowlers & Wells]]'' in [[New York City]]. Meanwhile, Lorenzo spent much of his life in England where he initiated the famous phrenological publishing house, L.N Fowler & Co., and gained considerable fame with his ''phrenology head'' (a [[porcelain|china]] head showing the phrenological faculties), which has become a symbol of the discipline.<ref name=\"Phrenological head\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/images/I025/10287384.aspx|title=Oops...|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318130249/http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/images/I025/10287384.aspx|archive-date=2010-03-18|url-status=dead}}</ref> Orson Fowler was known for his [[Octagon house|octagonal house]].\n\nPhrenology came about at a time when scientific procedures and standards for acceptable evidence were still being codified.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=261}} In the context of Victorian society, phrenology was a respectable scientific theory. The [[Phrenological Society of Edinburgh]] founded by George and Andrew Combe was an example of the credibility of phrenology at the time, and included a number of extremely influential social reformers and intellectuals, including the publisher [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], the astronomer [[John Pringle Nichol]], the evolutionary environmentalist [[Hewett Cottrell Watson]], and asylum reformer [[William A.F. Browne]]. In 1826, out of the 120 members of the Edinburgh society an estimated one third were from a medical background.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=260}} By the 1840s there were more than 28 phrenological societies in London with over 1000 members.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=50}} Another important scholar was [[Luigi Ferrarese]], the leading Italian phrenologist.<ref name=\"Yasgur\">Yasgur's Homeopathic Dictionary, Jay Yasgur, 2003, p. 184.</ref> He advocated that governments should embrace phrenology as a scientific means of conquering many social ills, and his ''Memorie Riguardanti La Dottrina Frenologica'' (1836), is considered \"one of the fundamental 19th century works in the field\".<ref name=\"Yasgur\"/>\n\nTraditionally the mind had been studied through introspection. Phrenology provided an attractive, biological alternative that attempted to unite all mental phenomena using consistent biological terminology.{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=83}} Gall's approach prepared the way for studying the mind that would lead to the downfall of his own theories.{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=75}} Phrenology contributed to development of physical anthropology, forensic medicine, knowledge of the nervous system and brain anatomy as well as contributing to applied psychology.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|pp=259\u2013261}}\n\nJohn Elliotson was a brilliant but erratic heart specialist who became a phrenologist in the 1840s. He was also a [[Animal magnetism|mesmerist]] and combined the two into something he called phrenomesmerism or phrenomagnatism.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=260}} Changing behaviour through mesmerism eventually won out in Elliotson's hospital, putting phrenology in a subordinate role.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=261}} Others amalgamated phrenology and [[Animal magnetism|mesmerism]] as well, such as the practical phrenologists Collyer and [[Joseph Rodes Buchanan|Joseph R. Buchanan]]. The benefits of combining mesmerism and phrenology was that the trance the patient was placed in was supposed to allow for the manipulation of his/her penchants and qualities.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=260}} For example, if the organ of self-esteem was touched, the subject would take on a haughty expression.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=213}}\n\n{{Quote box |salign=right|align=right|width=20%\n|quote = Phrenology has been psychology's great [[wikt:faux pas#English|''faux pas'']].\n|author = {{mdash}}{{thinsp}}J.C.

This was due only in part to a growing amount of evidence against phrenology.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=260}} Phrenologists had never been able to agree on the most basic mental organ numbers, going from 27 to over 40,{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=259}}{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=52}} and had difficulty locating the mental organs. Phrenologists relied on cranioscopic readings of the skull to find organ locations.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=81}} [[Jean Pierre Flourens]]' experiments on the brains of pigeons indicated that the loss of parts of the brain either caused no loss of function, or the loss of a completely different function than what had been attributed to it by phrenology. Flourens' experiment, while not perfect, seemed to indicate that Gall's supposed organs were imaginary.{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=75}}{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=80}} Scientists had also become disillusioned with phrenology since its exploitation with the middle and working classes by entrepreneurs. The popularization had resulted in the simplification of phrenology and mixing in it of principles of physiognomy, which had from the start been rejected by Gall as an indicator of personality.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=56}} Phrenology from its inception was tainted by accusations of promoting materialism and atheism, and being destructive of morality. These were all factors which led to the downfall of phrenology.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=81}}{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=211}} Recent studies, using modern day technology like Magnetic Resonance Imaging have further disproven phrenology claims.<ref>{{Cite biorxiv |last1=Parker Jones |first1=F. |date=31 January 2018 |title=An empirical, 21st century evaluation of phrenology |biorxiv=243089}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 20th century, a revival of interest in phrenology occurred, partly because of studies of [[evolution]], [[criminology]] and [[anthropology]] (as pursued by [[Cesare Lombroso]]). The most famous British phrenologist of the 20th century was the [[London]] psychiatrist [[Bernard Hollander]] (1864\u20131934). His main works, ''The Mental Function of the Brain'' (1901) and ''Scientific Phrenology'' (1902), are an appraisal of Gall's teachings. Hollander introduced a quantitative approach to the phrenological diagnosis, defining a method for measuring the skull, and comparing the measurements with statistical averages.<ref name=Hollander>{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=Bernard|title=A Contribution to a Scientific Phrenology|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1891|volume=20|pages=227\u2013234|jstor=2842265|doi=10.2307/2842265}}</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, [[Paul Bouts]] (1900\u20131999) began studying phrenology from a pedagogical background, using the phrenological analysis to define an individual [[pedagogy]]. Combining phrenology with [[personality type|typology]] and [[graphology]], he coined a global approach known as [[psychognomy]].\n\nBouts, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest, became the main promoter of renewed 20th-century interest in phrenology and psychognomy in Belgium. He was also active in [[Brazil]] and [[Canada]], where he founded institutes for characterology. His works ''Psychognomie'' and ''Les Grandioses Destin\u00e9es individuelle et humaine dans la lumi\u00e8re de la Caract\u00e9rologie et de l'Evolution c\u00e9r\u00e9bro-cranienne'' are considered standard works in the field. In the latter work, which examines the subject of [[paleoanthropology]], Bouts developed a [[teleology|teleological]] and [[orthogenesis|orthogenetical]] view on a ''perfecting evolution,'' from the paleo-encephalical skull shapes of [[prehistory|prehistoric man]], which he considered still prevalent in [[criminal]]s and savages, towards a higher form of mankind, thus perpetuating phrenology's problematic racializing of the human frame. Bouts died on March 7, 1999. His work has been continued by the Dutch foundation PPP (''Per Pulchritudinem in Pulchritudine''), operated by Anette M\u00fcller, one of Bouts' students.\n\nDuring the 1930s Belgian colonial authorities in [[Rwanda]] used phrenology to explain the so-called superiority of [[Tutsi]]s over [[Hutu]]s.<ref name=Rwanda>{{cite web|last=Rea|first=Lisa|title=Applying Restorative Justice to the Genocide in Rwanda|url=http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=235:applying-restorative-justice-to-the-genocide-in-rwanda&catid=49:issue-6&Itemid=186|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Application==\n[[File:Phrenology journal (1848).jpg|thumb|1848 edition of ''American Phrenological Journal'' published by Fowlers & Wells, New York City]]\n\n=== Racism ===\nEuropeans looking for a [[scientific racism|scientific basis for their racism]] found phrenology attractive as justification for European superiority over other \"lesser\" races. By comparing skulls of different ethnic groups it supposedly allowed for ranking of races from least to most evolved. Broussais, a disciple of Gall, proclaimed that the Caucasians were the \"most beautiful\" while peoples like the [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] and [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] would never become civilized since they had no cerebral organ for producing great artists.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=59}} Few phrenologists argued against the [[Abolitionism|emancipation of the slaves]]. Instead they argued that through education and interbreeding the lesser peoples could improve.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=62}} Another argument was that the natural inequality of people could be used to situate them in the most appropriate place in society. [[Sexism|Gender stereotyping]] was also common with phrenology. Women whose heads were generally larger in the back with lower foreheads were thought to have underdeveloped organs necessary for success in the arts and sciences while having larger mental organs relating to the care of children and religion.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=64}} While phrenologists did not contend the existence of talented women, this minority did not provide justification for citizenship or participation in politics.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=65}}\n\n=== Education ===\nOne of the considered practical applications of phrenology was education. Due to the nature of phrenology people were naturally considered unequal, as very few people would have a naturally perfect balance between organs. Thus education would play an important role in creating a balance through rigorous exercise of beneficial organs while repressing baser ones. One of the best examples of this is [[F\u00e9lix Voisin]] who for approximately ten years ran a reform school in [[Issy-les-Moulineaux|Issy]] for the express purpose of correction of the mind of children who had suffered some hardship. Voisin focused on four categories of children for his reform school:{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=74}}\n* Slow learners\n* Spoiled, neglected, or harshly treated children\n* Willful, disorderly children\n* Children at high risk of inheriting mental disorders\n\n=== Criminology ===\nPhrenology was one of the first to bring about the idea of rehabilitation of criminals instead of vindictive punishments that would not stop criminals, only with the reorganizing a disorganized brain would bring about change.{{sfn|Lyons|2009|pp=79\u201380}} Voisin believed along with others the accuracy of phrenology in diagnosing criminal tendencies. Diagnosis could point to the type of offender, the insane, an idiot or brute, and by knowing this an appropriate course of action could be taken.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=74}} A strict system of reward and punishment, hard work and religious instruction, was thought to be able to correct those who had been abandoned and neglected with little education and moral ground works. Those who were considered mentally challenged could be put to work and housed collectively while only criminals of intellect and vicious intent needed to be confined and isolated.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=77}} Phrenology also advocated variable prison sentences, the idea being that those who were only defective in education and lacking in morals would soon be released while those who were mentally deficient could be watched and the truly abhorrent criminals would never be released.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=6}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=Punishing Criminals|journal=Phrenological Journal|date=March 1871|volume=LII|series=Num 3|issue=Whole Number 386|pages=200\u2013204}}</ref>{{sfn|Lyons|2009|p=80}} For other patients phrenology could help redirect impulses, one homicidal individual became a butcher to control his impulses, while another became a [[military chaplain]] so he could witness killings.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=76}} Phrenology also provided reformist arguments for the lunatic asylums of the Victorian era. [[John Conolly]], a physician interested in psychological aspects of disease, used phrenology on his patients in an attempt to use it as a diagnostic tool. While the success of this approach is debatable, Conolly, through phrenology, introduced a more humane way of dealing with the mentally ill.{{sfn|McGrew|1985|p=261}}\n\n=== Psychiatry ===\nIn psychiatry, phrenology was proposed as a viable model in order to reform the disciplinary field. The South Italian psychiatrist Biagio Miraglia proposed a new classification of mental illness based on brain functions as they were described by Gall. In Biagio Gioacchino Miraglia's view, madness is consequent to dysfunctions of the cerebral organs: \u201cThe organs of the brain that may become ill in isolation or in complex get their activities infected through energy, or depression, or inertia or deficiency. So the madness can take the appearance of these three characteristic forms; i.e. for enhanced activity, or for depressed activity, or for inertia or deficiency of brain activities\u201d.<ref>Miraglia, Biagio G.

Many prominent public figures. such as the [[Henry Ward Beecher|Reverend Henry Ward Beecher]] (a college classmate and initial partner of Orson Fowler) promoted phrenology actively as a source of psychological insight and self-knowledge.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=204}} Especially in Britain and the US, people visited phrenologists to have their heads analysed.

In part phrenology's success was due to George Combe tailoring phrenology for the middle class. Combe's book ''On the Constitution of Man and its Relationship to External Objects'' was one of the most popular of the time, selling over two hundred thousand copies in a ten-year period. Phrenology's success was also due in part because it was introduced at a time when scientific lectures were becoming a form of middle-class entertainment, exposing a large demographic of people to phrenological ideas who would not have heard them otherwise.{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|p=2,9}} As a result of the changing of the times, along with new avenues for exposure and its multifaceted appeal, phrenology flourished in popular culture{{sfn|Parssinen|1974|pp=3\u20139}} although it was discredited as scientific theory by 1840.\n\n===France===\nWhile still not a fringe movement, there was not popular widespread support of phrenology in France. This was not only due to strong opposition of phrenology by French scholars but also once again accusations of promoting atheism, materialism and radical religious views. Politics in France also played a role in preventing rapid spread of phrenology.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=51\u201352}} In Britain phrenology had provided another tool to be used for situating demographic changes, the difference was there was less fear of revolutionary upheaval in Britain compared with France. Given that most French supporters of phrenology were liberal, left-wing or socialist, it was an objective of the social elite of France who held a restrained vision of social change that phrenology remain on the fringes. Another objection was that phrenology seemed to provide a built in excuse for criminal behaviour, since in its original form it was essentially [[Determinism|deterministic]] in nature.{{sfn|Staum|2003|p=51\u201352}}\n\n===Ireland===\nPhrenology arrived in Ireland in 1815, through Spurzheim.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=30}} While Ireland largely mirrored British trends, with scientific lectures and demonstrations becoming a popular pastime of the age, by 1815 phrenology had already been ridiculed in some circles priming the audiences to its skeptical claims.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=28}} Because of this the general public valued it more for its comic relief than anything else, however it did find an audience in the [[English Dissenters|rational dissenters]] who found it an attractive alternative to explain human motivations without the attached superstitions of religion.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=28, 38}} The supporters of phrenology in Ireland were relegated to scientific subcultures because the Irish scholars neglected marginal movements like phrenology, denying it scientific support in Ireland.{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=25}} In 1830 George Combe came to Ireland, his self-promotion barely winning out against his lack of medical expertise, still only drew lukewarm crowds. This was due to not only the [[Vatican City|Vatican's]] decree that phrenology was subversive of religion and morality but also that based on phrenology the \"Irish Catholics were sui generis a flawed and degenerate breed\".{{sfn|Leaney|2006|p=35}} Because of the lack of scientific support, along with religious and prejudicial reasons phrenology never found a wide audience in Ireland.\n\n===United States===\nThrough the teachings of Gall and Spurzheim, phrenological teachings spread, and by 1834 when Combe came to lecture in the United States, phrenology had become a widespread popular movement.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|pp=205\u2013208}} Sensing commercial possibilities men like the Fowlers became phrenologists and sought additional ways to bring phrenology to the masses.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=208}} Though a popular movement, the intellectual elite of the United States found phrenology attractive because it provided a biological explanation of mental processes based on observation, yet it was not accepted uncritically. Some intellectuals accepted organology while questioning cranioscopy.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=206}} Gradually the popular success of phrenology undermined its scientific merits in the United States and elsewhere, along with its materialistic underpinnings, fostering radical religious views. There was increasing evidence to refute phrenological claims, and by the 1840s it had largely lost its credibility.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=210}} In the United States, especially in the South, phrenology faced an additional obstacle in the antislavery movement. While phrenologists usually claimed the superiority of the European race, they were often sympathetic to liberal causes including the antislavery movement; this sowed skepticism about phrenology among those who were pro-slavery.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=212}} The rise and surge in popularity in mesmerism, phrenomesmerism, also had a hand in the loss of interest in phrenology among intellectuals and the general public.{{sfn|McCandless|1992|p=213}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=APA handbook of personality and social psychology|others=Mikulincer, Mario., Shaver, Phillip R., Dovidio, John F., Simpson, Jeffrey A., American Psychological Association.|isbn=9781433816994|edition= First|location=Washington, DC|oclc=862928518|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Specific phrenological modules==\nFrom Combe:{{sfn|Combe|1851|pp=x\u2013xi}}\n[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An 1883 phrenology chart]]\n[[File:Earthenware phrenological bust, areas are marked off with an Wellcome L0057601.jpg|thumb|Phrenological bust]]\n<!--PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER-->\n\n===Propensities===\nPropensities do not form ideas; they solely produce propensities common to animals and man.\n* Adhesiveness\n* Alimentiveness\n* Amativeness\n* Acquisitiveness\n* Causality\n* [[Cautiousness]]\n* Combativeness\n* Concentrativeness\n* Constructiveness\n* Destructiveness\n* Ideality\n* Love of life\n* Philoprogenitiveness\n* Secretiveness\n\n===Sentiments===\n'''Lower sentiments'''\n\nThese are common to man and animal.\n* Cautiousness\n* Love of approbation\n* Self-esteem\n* Truthfulness\n\n'''Superior sentiments'''\n\nThese produce emotion or feeling lacking in animals.\n* [[Benevolence (phrenology)|Benevolence]]\n* Conscientiousness\n* Firmness\n* Hope\n* Ideality\n* Imitation\n* Veneration\n* Wit or Mirthfulness\n* Wonder\n\n===Intellectual faculties===\nThese are to know the external world and physical qualities\n* Coloring\n* Eventuality\n* Form\n* Hearing\n* Individuality\n* Language\n* Locality\n* Number\n* Order\n* Sight\n* Size\n* Smell\n* Taste\n* Time\n* Touch\n* Tune\n* Weight\n\n===Reflecting faculties===\nThese produce ideas of relation or reflect.

Thomas is writing this account several months after the war in order to describe the odyssey of his Norwegian-homeported ship, the USS ''Nathan James'' (DDG-80), in the aftermath of the conflict.\n\nThomas begins by describing his ship to the reader. He discusses the ethics of commanding a warship, the capabilities of nuclear strike forces, daily life aboard a U.S. Navy ship in the [[Arctic Circle]], and the nature of his ship's mission. Captain Thomas remarks that, despite the reduction in the land-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] arsenal, there is still considerable power in the [[submarine-launched ballistic missile|SLBM]]s and [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk]]s; his ship alone has more power than several [[missile silo]]s combined.\n\n==Plot==\n\nOn December 21, without warning, Thomas, the captain of the U.S. Navy destroyer, USS ''Nathan James'' (DDG-80), receives authenticated orders to carry out a nuclear strike on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] city of [[Oryol|Orel]] and its nearby {{abbr|ICBM|intercontinental ballistic missile}} silos. The nuclear-tipped Tomahawks are fired off in an emotionless, automated manner. Over a period of hours the crew watches them make landfall on radar and listens as the radio stations from Orel go off the air. With the mission completed, they report back to their superiors, and a reply from the U.S. Navy comes through, ordering them to break with general orders in this situation (operating under which they would proceed to the [[North Sea]]), but the message garbles to gibberish towards the end without relating their new orders. With one exception later in the book, this is the last official communication from the U.S. Navy that ''Nathan James'' ever receives.\n\nWhile they can later surmise there must have been a series of major exchanges, as a simple, single exchange of 'counter-force' strikes would not account for the sheer scale of the fallout they later find, and they can also conclude other nuclear powers, like [[India]], [[Pakistan]], etc., have also fired at each other, the crew never learns with certainty what led to the launches or the exact sequence of events.\n\nThomas then decides to head southward into the North Sea and then to the [[United Kingdom]], in order to re-establish contact with friendly forces. The ship encounters dense clouds of radioactive smoke all around [[Great Britain]], through which can be seen the ruins of [[Big Ben]] and [[London]].\n\nLacking information, the ship sets off to scout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coastline]], counterclockwise from southern [[Italy]] to [[Gibraltar]]. Off the coast of [[Brittany]] the ship encounters a non-communicative submarine which tails them until the ship arrives off the destroyed [[Rock of Gibraltar]], where it vanishes. ''Nathan James'' continues to scout the Mediterranean coastline, finding only masses of people suffering from radiation sickness who have fled the chaos inland. Off the coast of [[France]], ''Nathan James'' finds a luxury sailboat with the passengers apparently killed mid-meal, suggesting the use of a [[neutron bomb]] on a coastal city. The corpse of the ship's radioman is found deeper within, along with his limited report of areas hit with nuclear weapons, painting a bleak picture for [[Europe]], the Soviet Union, and [[North America]]. Returning to Gibraltar, the Soviet Navy [[ballistic missile submarine]] ''[[Pushkin]]'' surfaces to make direct contact.\n\nThe two vessels quickly establish a truce and agree to a joint operation. The ''Pushkin'', fully fueled but low on food, will first scout western Africa, then attempt to reach a secret Soviet supply base in the Arctic and retrieve supplies and nuclear fuel for ''Nathan James''. The U.S. Navy destroyer, relatively well-stocked with food but low on nuclear fuel, will scout northern Africa, then make her way to the Pacific Ocean in search of habitable land for the two crews. Thomas keeps the deal he made with the Soviet captain (trading food and a place for the Soviets in any society the ''Nathan James''{{'}} crew builds on land for nuclear fuel, if found at the Soviet base) from most of his crew, in order to not get their hopes up.\n\n''Nathan James'' scouts Mediterranean Africa, but strangely, despite not seeing visible direct hits, finds no people but reads radiation levels which steadily increase the farther inland any shore party ventures. Throughout, the crew salvages relatively uncontaminated farming equipment, plants, and even two goats from a small island to potentially start farming any hospitable land.\n\nEventually ''Nathan James'' receives a message from the [[National Command Authority]] ordering all recipients to reply. They do so, but the message repeats unaltered with machine-like precision; they conclude it is just an automated transmission. Based on his knowledge of the Soviet Union's targeting of North America, the Soviet submarine captain's report, the French radioman's report, and what he has seen of Europe, Thomas, along with most of the ship's officers, concludes that the United States has simply ceased to exist,  and what remains of North America is uninhabitable.\n\nMany of the crew, though, wish to go home to the U.S. to see what happened. This would require them to expend most of their remaining fuel, rendering them unable to reach the Pacific to look for habitable land. If the U.S. were anything like Europe or Africa, the ship would simply be trapped. Thomas thus decides to proceed to the Pacific Ocean by way of the [[Suez Canal]].\n\nAt Suez, the ship's Combat Systems Officer (CSO) states his belief that parts of North America may still be habitable and demands that the ship return to the U.S. East Coast, so they can see for themselves. The captain tries to discourage the CSO, but the latter challenges the captain's authority, reminding him that the U.S. Navy (under which Thomas is legally bestowed the title of captain) no longer exists, meaning Thomas is no longer in lawful command, and demands a vote on the correct course of action. Thomas, angered at this [[mutiny]], allows a vote thinking the CSO has little support, but is shocked when nearly a third of the crew side with the CSO. The mutineers demand rafts and the [[captain's gig]] in order to sail thousands of miles to the United States. With a mixture of sadness and outrage, Thomas agrees, and the mutineers depart.\n\nIn the following weeks the ship proceeds through the Suez Canal, which is luckily open, and travels through treacherous seas in the Indian Ocean as [[nuclear winter]] begins to take full effect, with dramatic temperature drops and black snow at the equator.\n\nThey notice a pattern where the amount of fallout increases with the size of nearby landmasses. Approaching Singapore, the fallout becomes so dense that the crew cannot go onto the weather decks. Luckily, ''Nathan James'' was designed with cold weather and fallout in mind, and Thomas orders the ship hermetically sealed and people stationed on the bridge in short rotations.\n\nDespite this, the crew suffers from mild radiation sickness, and their passage through the dense fallout becomes so trying psychologically that many crew vanish overboard. Things become even bleaker when they lose contact with the Soviet submarine, assuming she, with the nuclear fuel, was lost while scouting the Soviet coastline.\n\n''Nathan James'' eventually reaches the remote South Pacific and, with the ship's nuclear fuel nearly gone, discovers a small, uncontaminated island in [[French Polynesia]]. The ship's crew establishes a community on the island, and they begin to try to conceive children to continue civilization. An archival project is started, wherein everyone is encouraged to write out their knowledge for future generations.\n\nThey work out a system to allow genetic diversity with anonymous fatherhood, with the women always in strict control. However, no pregnancies occur. They worry that the radiation of the nuclear winter may have rendered everyone sterile.\n\nSome time later, the ''Pushkin'' appears on the horizon.

Thomas is writing this account several months after the war in order to describe the odyssey of his Norwegian-homeported ship, the USS ''Nathan James'' (DDG-80), in the aftermath of the conflict.\n\nThomas begins by describing his ship to the reader. He discusses the ethics of commanding a warship, the capabilities of nuclear strike forces, daily life aboard a U.S. Navy ship in the [[Arctic Circle]], and the nature of his ship's mission. Captain Thomas remarks that, despite the reduction in the land-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]] arsenal, there is still considerable power in the [[submarine-launched ballistic missile|SLBM]]s and [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk]]s; his ship alone has more power than several [[missile silo]]s combined.\n\n==Plot==\n\nOn December 21, without warning, Thomas, the captain of the U.S. Navy destroyer, USS ''Nathan James'' (DDG-80), receives authenticated orders to carry out a nuclear strike on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] city of [[Oryol|Orel]] and its nearby {{abbr|ICBM|intercontinental ballistic missile}} silos. The nuclear-tipped Tomahawks are fired off in an emotionless, automated manner. Over a period of hours the crew watches them make landfall on radar and listens as the radio stations from Orel go off the air. With the mission completed, they report back to their superiors, and a reply from the U.S. Navy comes through, ordering them to break with general orders in this situation (operating under which they would proceed to the [[North Sea]]), but the message garbles to gibberish towards the end without relating their new orders. With one exception later in the book, this is the last official communication from the U.S. Navy that ''Nathan James'' ever receives.\n\nWhile they can later surmise there must have been a series of major exchanges, as a simple, single exchange of 'counter-force' strikes would not account for the sheer scale of the fallout they later find, and they can also conclude other nuclear powers, like [[India]], [[Pakistan]], etc., have also fired at each other, the crew never learns with certainty what led to the launches or the exact sequence of events.\n\nThomas then decides to head southward into the North Sea and then to the [[United Kingdom]], in order to re-establish contact with friendly forces. The ship encounters dense clouds of radioactive smoke all around [[Great Britain]], through which can be seen the ruins of [[Big Ben]] and [[London]].\n\nLacking information, the ship sets off to scout the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coastline]], counterclockwise from southern [[Italy]] to [[Gibraltar]]. Off the coast of [[Brittany]] the ship encounters a non-communicative submarine which tails them until the ship arrives off the destroyed [[Rock of Gibraltar]], where it vanishes. ''Nathan James'' continues to scout the Mediterranean coastline, finding only masses of people suffering from radiation sickness who have fled the chaos inland. Off the coast of [[France]], ''Nathan James'' finds a luxury sailboat with the passengers apparently killed mid-meal, suggesting the use of a [[neutron bomb]] on a coastal city. The corpse of the ship's radioman is found deeper within, along with his limited report of areas hit with nuclear weapons, painting a bleak picture for [[Europe]], the Soviet Union, and [[North America]]. Returning to Gibraltar, the Soviet Navy [[ballistic missile submarine]] ''[[Pushkin]]'' surfaces to make direct contact.\n\nThe two vessels quickly establish a truce and agree to a joint operation. The ''Pushkin'', fully fueled but low on food, will first scout western Africa, then attempt to reach a secret Soviet supply base in the Arctic and retrieve supplies and nuclear fuel for ''Nathan James''. The U.S. Navy destroyer, relatively well-stocked with food but low on nuclear fuel, will scout northern Africa, then make her way to the Pacific Ocean in search of habitable land for the two crews. Thomas keeps the deal he made with the Soviet captain (trading food and a place for the Soviets in any society the ''Nathan James''{{'}} crew builds on land for nuclear fuel, if found at the Soviet base) from most of his crew, in order to not get their hopes up.\n\n''Nathan James'' scouts Mediterranean Africa, but strangely, despite not seeing visible direct hits, finds no people but reads radiation levels which steadily increase the farther inland any shore party ventures. Throughout, the crew salvages relatively uncontaminated farming equipment, plants, and even two goats from a small island to potentially start farming any hospitable land.\n\nEventually ''Nathan James'' receives a message from the [[National Command Authority]] ordering all recipients to reply. They do so, but the message repeats unaltered with machine-like precision; they conclude it is just an automated transmission. Based on his knowledge of the Soviet Union's targeting of North America, the Soviet submarine captain's report, the French radioman's report, and what he has seen of Europe, Thomas, along with most of the ship's officers, concludes that the United States has simply ceased to exist,  and what remains of North America is uninhabitable.\n\nMany of the crew, though, wish to go home to the U.S. to see what happened. This would require them to expend most of their remaining fuel, rendering them unable to reach the Pacific to look for habitable land. If the U.S. were anything like Europe or Africa, the ship would simply be trapped. Thomas thus decides to proceed to the Pacific Ocean by way of the [[Suez Canal]].\n\nAt Suez, the ship's Combat Systems Officer (CSO) states his belief that parts of North America may still be habitable and demands that the ship return to the U.S. East Coast, so they can see for themselves. The captain tries to discourage the CSO, but the latter challenges the captain's authority, reminding him that the U.S. Navy (under which Thomas is legally bestowed the title of captain) no longer exists, meaning Thomas is no longer in lawful command, and demands a vote on the correct course of action. Thomas, angered at this [[mutiny]], allows a vote thinking the CSO has little support, but is shocked when nearly a third of the crew side with the CSO. The mutineers demand rafts and the [[captain's gig]] in order to sail thousands of miles to the United States. With a mixture of sadness and outrage, Thomas agrees, and the mutineers depart.\n\nIn the following weeks the ship proceeds through the Suez Canal, which is luckily open, and travels through treacherous seas in the Indian Ocean as [[nuclear winter]] begins to take full effect, with dramatic temperature drops and black snow at the equator.\n\nThey notice a pattern where the amount of fallout increases with the size of nearby landmasses. Approaching Singapore, the fallout becomes so dense that the crew cannot go onto the weather decks. Luckily, ''Nathan James'' was designed with cold weather and fallout in mind, and Thomas orders the ship hermetically sealed and people stationed on the bridge in short rotations.\n\nDespite this, the crew suffers from mild radiation sickness, and their passage through the dense fallout becomes so trying psychologically that many crew vanish overboard. Things become even bleaker when they lose contact with the Soviet submarine, assuming she, with the nuclear fuel, was lost while scouting the Soviet coastline.\n\n''Nathan James'' eventually reaches the remote South Pacific and, with the ship's nuclear fuel nearly gone, discovers a small, uncontaminated island in [[French Polynesia]]. The ship's crew establishes a community on the island, and they begin to try to conceive children to continue civilization. An archival project is started, wherein everyone is encouraged to write out their knowledge for future generations.\n\nThey work out a system to allow genetic diversity with anonymous fatherhood, with the women always in strict control. However, no pregnancies occur. They worry that the radiation of the nuclear winter may have rendered everyone sterile.\n\nSome time later, the ''Pushkin'' appears on the horizon. Its crew is on the verge of starvation but bears an abundance of nuclear fuel. ''Nathan James'' is at last free to sail again, keeping the island as its home base. They even believe the Soviet submariners, who may have been free of contamination due to being submerged, can take their place in the genetic pool.\n\nBut then a new disaster strikes: a group of the ship's sailors, abhorring the remaining nuclear missiles aboard the ship, launches them without Thomas' permission. One of the missiles accidentally detonates while in flight, triggering a chain reaction among all of the other missiles, destroying ''Nathan James'' and contaminating the island.\n\nThomas, his remaining crew, and the Soviet crew immediately embark aboard the ''Pushkin'' to escape, beginning a new search for another sanctuary. They eventually reach the U.S. research facility at [[McMurdo Station]] in [[Antarctica]], which is abandoned but contains years' worth of food and supplies.\n\nThe ''Pushkin'' is modified during the escape to McMurdo Station by jettisoning its nuclear missiles into the ocean, so they can use the freed space in the silos for living space and a nursery. The introduction of the Soviet crew into the U.S. breeding program has resulted in at least three pregnancies. The ''Pushkin'' has the fuel and food from McMurdo to conduct long, thorough explorations of the world. Now well-provisioned, the survivors prepare to rediscover the world.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Vermont C. Royster|V.C.

They function as [[Parasitic plant|facultative]] [[intracellular parasite]]s, causing [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic disease]], which usually persists for life. Four species infect humans: ''B. abortus'', ''B. canis'', ''B. melitensis'', and ''B. suis''. ''B. abortus'' is less virulent than ''B. melitensis'' and is primarily a disease of cattle. ''B. canis'' affects dogs. ''B. melitensis'' is the most virulent and invasive species; it usually infects goats and occasionally sheep. ''B. suis'' is of intermediate virulence and chiefly infects pigs. Symptoms include profuse sweating and joint and muscle pain. Brucellosis has been recognized in animals and humans since the 20th century.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[File:BrucellosisGraph.png|right|thumb|200px|A graph of the cases of brucellosis in humans in the United States from the years 1993\u20132010 surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System<ref>{{cite web|website=CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/resources/surveillance.html|title=Brucellosis: Resources: Surveillance|date=2018-10-09}}</ref>]]\n\nThe symptoms are like those associated with many other [[fever|febrile]] diseases, but with emphasis on muscular pain and night sweats. The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years.\n\nIn the first stage of the disease, [[bacteremia]] occurs and leads to the classic triad of undulant fevers, sweating (often with characteristic foul, moldy smell sometimes likened to wet hay), and migratory [[arthralgia]] and [[myalgia]] (joint and muscle pain). Blood tests characteristically reveal a [[leukopenia|low number of white blood cells]] and [[anemia|red blood cells]], show some elevation of [[liver enzyme]]s such as [[aspartate aminotransferase]]<!-- (AST) --> and [[alanine aminotransferase]]<!-- (ALT) -->, and demonstrate positive Bengal rose and Huddleston reactions. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 70% of cases and include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[decreased appetite]], unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], [[hepatomegaly|an enlarged liver]], [[hepatitis|liver inflammation]], [[liver abscess]], and [[splenomegaly|an enlarged spleen]].\n\nThis complex is, at least in Portugal, Israel, Syria, and Jordan, known as Malta fever. During episodes of Malta fever, melitococcemia (presence of brucellae in blood) can usually be demonstrated by means of blood culture in tryptose medium or Albini medium. If untreated, the disease can give origin to focalizations or become chronic. The focalizations of brucellosis occur usually in bones and joints, and [[osteomyelitis]] or [[spondylodiscitis]] of the lumbar spine accompanied by [[sacroiliitis]] is very characteristic of this disease. [[Orchitis]] is also common in men.\n\nDiagnosis of brucellosis relies on:\n# Demonstration of the agent: blood cultures in tryptose broth, bone marrow cultures: The growth of brucellae is extremely slow (they can take up to two months to grow) and the culture poses a risk to laboratory personnel due to high infectivity of brucellae.\n# Demonstration of antibodies against the agent either with the classic Huddleson, Wright, and/or Bengal Rose reactions, either with ELISA or the 2-mercaptoethanol assay for IgM antibodies associated with chronic disease\n# Histologic evidence of granulomatous hepatitis on hepatic biopsy\n# Radiologic alterations in infected vertebrae: the Pedro Pons sign (preferential erosion of the anterosuperior corner of lumbar vertebrae) and marked osteophytosis are suspicious of brucellic spondylitis.\n\nThe consequences of ''Brucella'' infection are highly variable and may include [[arthritis]], [[spondylitis]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[meningitis]], [[uveitis]], [[optic neuritis]], [[endocarditis]], and various neurological disorders collectively known as neurobrucellosis.\n\n==Cause==\n[[Image:Brucella granuloma.jpg|thumb|[[Granuloma]] and [[necrosis]] in the liver of a guinea pig infected with ''Brucella suis'']]\nBrucellosis in humans is usually associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses made from the milk of infected animals\u2014primarily goats, infected with ''B. melitensis'' and with occupational exposure of laboratory workers, veterinarians, and slaughterhouse workers.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|last=Wyatt|first=Harold Vivian|date=October 2005|title=How Themistocles Zammit found Malta Fever (brucellosis) to be transmitted by the milk of goats|volume=98|issue=10|pages=451\u2013454|pmc=1240100|pmid=16199812|issn=0141-0768|doi=10.1258/jrsm.98.10.451|oclc=680110952|publisher=The Royal Society of Medicine Press|location=[[University of Leeds]], London}}</ref> Some vaccines used in livestock, most notably ''B. abortus'' strain 19, also cause disease in humans if accidentally injected.

The inability to diagnose ''B. canis'' by SAT due to lack of cross-reaction is another drawback. False-negative SAT may be caused by the presence of blocking antibodies (the [[prozone phenomenon]]) in the \u03b12-globulin (IgA) and in the \u03b1-globulin (IgG) fractions.\n\nDipstick assays are new and promising, based on the binding of ''Brucella'' IgM antibodies, and are simple, accurate, and rapid.

However, the use of more than one antibiotic is needed for several weeks, because the bacteria incubate within [[cell (biology)|cells]].\n\nSurveillance using serological tests, as well as tests on milk such as the milk ring test, can be used for screening and play an important role in campaigns to eliminate the disease. Also, individual animal testing both for trade and for disease-control purposes is practiced. In endemic areas, vaccination is often used to reduce the incidence of infection. An [[Brucellosis vaccine|animal vaccine]] is available that uses modified live bacteria. The [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] ''Manual of Diagnostic Test and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals'' provides detailed guidance on the production of vaccines. As the disease is closer to being eliminated, a test and eradication program is required to completely eliminate it.\n\nThe gold standard treatment for adults is daily [[intramuscular injection]]s of streptomycin 1&nbsp;g for 14 days and oral [[doxycycline]] 100&nbsp;mg twice daily for 45 days (concurrently).

[[Ciprofloxacin]] and co-trimoxazole therapy is associated with an unacceptably high rate of relapse. In brucellic [[endocarditis]], surgery is required for an optimal outcome. Even with optimal antibrucellic therapy, relapses still occur in 5 to 10% of patients with Malta fever.\n\nThe main way of preventing brucellosis is by using fastidious hygiene in producing raw milk products, or by [[pasteurization|pasteurizing]] all milk that is to be ingested by human beings, either in its unaltered form or as a derivative, such as [[cheese]].\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe mortality of the disease in 1909, as recorded in the British Army and Navy stationed in Malta, was 2%. The most frequent cause of death was [[endocarditis]]. Recent advances in [[antibiotics]] and surgery have been successful in preventing death due to endocarditis. Prevention of human brucellosis can be achieved by eradication of the disease in animals by vaccination and other veterinary control methods such as testing herds/flocks and slaughtering animals when infection is present. Currently, no effective vaccine is available for humans. Boiling milk before consumption, or before using it to produce other dairy products, is protective against transmission via ingestion. Changing traditional food habits of eating raw meat, liver, or bone marrow is necessary, but difficult to implement.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Patients who have had brucellosis should probably be excluded indefinitely from donating blood or organs.

When the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) wanted a biological warfare capability, the Chemical Corps offered Agent US in the [[M114 bomblet]], based on the four-pound bursting bomblet developed for spreading [[anthrax]] during World War II. Though the capability was developed, operational testing indicated the weapon was less than desirable, and the USAF designed it as an interim capability until it could eventually be replaced by a more effective biological weapon.\n\nThe main drawback of using the M114 with Agent US was that it acted mainly as an incapacitating agent, whereas the USAF administration wanted weapons that were deadly. Also, the stability of M114 in storage was too low to allow for storing it at forward air bases, and the logistical requirements to neutralize a target were far higher than was originally planned. Ultimately, this would have required too much logistical support to be practical in the field.\n\nAgents US and AA had a median infective dose of 500 organisms/person, and for Agent AM it was 300 organisms/person. The time-of-incubation was believed to be about 2 weeks, with a duration of infection of several months. The lethality estimate was based on epidemiological information at 1 to 2%. Agent AM was believed to be a somewhat more virulent disease, with a fatality rate of 3% being expected.\n\n==Other animals==\nSpecies infecting domestic livestock are ''[[Brucella abortus|B. abortus]]'' (cattle, bison, and elk), ''[[Brucella canis|B. canis]]'' (dogs), ''[[Brucella melitensis|B. melitensis]]'' (goats and sheep), ''[[Brucella ovis|B. ovis]]'' (sheep), and ''[[Swine brucellosis|B. suis]]'' (caribou and pigs). ''Brucella'' species have also been isolated from several marine mammal species (cetaceans and pinnipeds).\n\n===Cattle===\n''[[Brucella abortus|B. abortus]]'' is the principal cause of brucellosis in cattle. The bacteria are shed from an infected animal at or around the time of calving or [[Spontaneous abortion|abortion]]. Once exposed, the likelihood of an animal becoming infected is variable, depending on age, pregnancy status, and other intrinsic factors of the animal, as well as the number of bacteria to which the animal was exposed.<ref>Radostits, O.M., C.C. Gay, D.C. Blood, and K.W. Hinchcliff. (2000). ''Veterinary Medicine, A textbook of the Diseases of Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Goats and Horses''. Harcourt Publishers Limited, London, pp. 867\u2013882. {{ISBN|0702027774}}.</ref> The most common clinical signs of cattle infected with ''B. abortus'' are high incidences of abortions, arthritic joints, and retained [[placenta]].\n\nThe two main causes for spontaneous abortion in animals are [[erythritol]], which can promote infections in the fetus and placenta, and the lack of anti-''Brucella'' activity in the amniotic fluid. Males can also harbor the bacteria in their reproductive tracts, namely [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[ampulla of ductus deferens|ampullae]], [[testicle]]s, and [[Epididymis|epididymes]].\n\n===Dogs===\nThe causative agent of brucellosis in [[dog]]s, ''[[Brucella canis|B. canis]]'', is transmitted to other dogs through breeding and contact with aborted fetuses. Brucellosis can occur in humans who come in contact with infected aborted tissue or semen. The bacteria in dogs normally infect the genitals and [[lymphatic system]], but can also spread to the eyes, [[kidney]]s, and [[intervertebral disc]]s. Brucellosis in the intervertebral disc is one possible cause of [[discospondylitis]]. Symptoms of brucellosis in dogs include abortion in female dogs and  [[scrotum|scrotal]] inflammation and [[orchitis]] in males. Fever is uncommon. Infection of the eye can cause [[uveitis]], and infection of the intervertebral disc can cause pain or weakness. Blood testing of the dogs prior to breeding can prevent the spread of this disease. It is treated with antibiotics, as with humans, but it is difficult to cure.<ref name=\"Ettinger_1995\">{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B.

First discovered in the aborted fetus of a [[bottlenose dolphin]], the structure of ''B. ceti'' is similar to ''Brucella'' in land animals. ''B. ceti'' is commonly detected in two suborders of cetaceans, the [[Mysticeti]] and [[Odontoceti]]. The Mysticeti include four families of [[baleen whales]], filter-feeders, and the Odontoceti include two families of toothed cetaceans ranging from dolphins to sperm whales. ''B. ceti'' is believed to transfer from animal to animal through sexual intercourse, maternal feeding, aborted fetuses, placental issues, from mother to fetus, or through fish reservoirs. Brucellosis is a reproductive disease, so has an extreme negative impact on the population dynamics of a species. This becomes a greater issue when the already low population numbers of cetaceans are taken into consideration. ''B. ceti'' has been identified in four  of the 14 cetacean families, but the antibodies have been detected in seven of the families. This indicates that ''B. ceti'' is common amongst cetacean families and populations. Only a small percentage of exposed individuals become ill or die. However, particular species apparently are more likely to become infected by ''B. ceti''. The harbor porpoise, striped dolphin, white-sided dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, and common dolphin have the highest frequency of infection amongst ondontocetes. In the mysticetes families, the northern minke whale is by far the most infected species. Dolphins and porpoises are more likely to be infected than cetaceans such as whales. With regard to sex and age biases, the infections do not seem influenced by the age or sex of an individual. Although fatal to cetaceans, ''B. ceti'' has a low infection rate for humans.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=22919595|pmc=3417395|year=2012|last1=Guzm\u00e1n-Verri|first1=C|title=Brucella ceti and brucellosis in cetaceans|journal=Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology|volume=2|pages=3|last2=Gonz\u00e1lez-Barrientos|first2=R|last3=Hern\u00e1ndez-Mora|first3=G|last4=Morales|first4=J.

They function as [[Parasitic plant|facultative]] [[intracellular parasite]]s, causing [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic disease]], which usually persists for life. Four species infect humans: ''B. abortus'', ''B. canis'', ''B. melitensis'', and ''B. suis''. ''B. abortus'' is less virulent than ''B. melitensis'' and is primarily a disease of cattle. ''B. canis'' affects dogs. ''B. melitensis'' is the most virulent and invasive species; it usually infects goats and occasionally sheep. ''B. suis'' is of intermediate virulence and chiefly infects pigs. Symptoms include profuse sweating and joint and muscle pain. Brucellosis has been recognized in animals and humans since the 20th century.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[File:BrucellosisGraph.png|right|thumb|200px|A graph of the cases of brucellosis in humans in the United States from the years 1993\u20132010 surveyed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System<ref>{{cite web|website=CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/resources/surveillance.html|title=Brucellosis: Resources: Surveillance|date=2018-10-09}}</ref>]]\n\nThe symptoms are like those associated with many other [[fever|febrile]] diseases, but with emphasis on muscular pain and night sweats. The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years.\n\nIn the first stage of the disease, [[bacteremia]] occurs and leads to the classic triad of undulant fevers, sweating (often with characteristic foul, moldy smell sometimes likened to wet hay), and migratory [[arthralgia]] and [[myalgia]] (joint and muscle pain). Blood tests characteristically reveal a [[leukopenia|low number of white blood cells]] and [[anemia|red blood cells]], show some elevation of [[liver enzyme]]s such as [[aspartate aminotransferase]]<!-- (AST) --> and [[alanine aminotransferase]]<!-- (ALT) -->, and demonstrate positive Bengal rose and Huddleston reactions. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur in 70% of cases and include [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[decreased appetite]], unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], [[hepatomegaly|an enlarged liver]], [[hepatitis|liver inflammation]], [[liver abscess]], and [[splenomegaly|an enlarged spleen]].\n\nThis complex is, at least in Portugal, Israel, Syria, and Jordan, known as Malta fever. During episodes of Malta fever, melitococcemia (presence of brucellae in blood) can usually be demonstrated by means of blood culture in tryptose medium or Albini medium. If untreated, the disease can give origin to focalizations or become chronic. The focalizations of brucellosis occur usually in bones and joints, and [[osteomyelitis]] or [[spondylodiscitis]] of the lumbar spine accompanied by [[sacroiliitis]] is very characteristic of this disease. [[Orchitis]] is also common in men.\n\nDiagnosis of brucellosis relies on:\n# Demonstration of the agent: blood cultures in tryptose broth, bone marrow cultures: The growth of brucellae is extremely slow (they can take up to two months to grow) and the culture poses a risk to laboratory personnel due to high infectivity of brucellae.\n# Demonstration of antibodies against the agent either with the classic Huddleson, Wright, and/or Bengal Rose reactions, either with ELISA or the 2-mercaptoethanol assay for IgM antibodies associated with chronic disease\n# Histologic evidence of granulomatous hepatitis on hepatic biopsy\n# Radiologic alterations in infected vertebrae: the Pedro Pons sign (preferential erosion of the anterosuperior corner of lumbar vertebrae) and marked osteophytosis are suspicious of brucellic spondylitis.\n\nThe consequences of ''Brucella'' infection are highly variable and may include [[arthritis]], [[spondylitis]], [[thrombocytopenia]], [[meningitis]], [[uveitis]], [[optic neuritis]], [[endocarditis]], and various neurological disorders collectively known as neurobrucellosis.\n\n==Cause==\n[[Image:Brucella granuloma.jpg|thumb|[[Granuloma]] and [[necrosis]] in the liver of a guinea pig infected with ''Brucella suis'']]\nBrucellosis in humans is usually associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses made from the milk of infected animals\u2014primarily goats, infected with ''B. melitensis'' and with occupational exposure of laboratory workers, veterinarians, and slaughterhouse workers.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|last=Wyatt|first=Harold Vivian|date=October 2005|title=How Themistocles Zammit found Malta Fever (brucellosis) to be transmitted by the milk of goats|volume=98|issue=10|pages=451\u2013454|pmc=1240100|pmid=16199812|issn=0141-0768|doi=10.1258/jrsm.98.10.451|oclc=680110952|publisher=The Royal Society of Medicine Press|location=[[University of Leeds]], London}}</ref> Some vaccines used in livestock, most notably ''B. abortus'' strain 19, also cause disease in humans if accidentally injected.

However, the use of more than one antibiotic is needed for several weeks, because the bacteria incubate within [[cell (biology)|cells]].\n\nSurveillance using serological tests, as well as tests on milk such as the milk ring test, can be used for screening and play an important role in campaigns to eliminate the disease. Also, individual animal testing both for trade and for disease-control purposes is practiced. In endemic areas, vaccination is often used to reduce the incidence of infection. An [[Brucellosis vaccine|animal vaccine]] is available that uses modified live bacteria. The [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] ''Manual of Diagnostic Test and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals'' provides detailed guidance on the production of vaccines. As the disease is closer to being eliminated, a test and eradication program is required to completely eliminate it.\n\nThe gold standard treatment for adults is daily [[intramuscular injection]]s of streptomycin 1&nbsp;g for 14 days and oral [[doxycycline]] 100&nbsp;mg twice daily for 45 days (concurrently).

[[Ciprofloxacin]] and co-trimoxazole therapy is associated with an unacceptably high rate of relapse. In brucellic [[endocarditis]], surgery is required for an optimal outcome. Even with optimal antibrucellic therapy, relapses still occur in 5 to 10% of patients with Malta fever.\n\nThe main way of preventing brucellosis is by using fastidious hygiene in producing raw milk products, or by [[pasteurization|pasteurizing]] all milk that is to be ingested by human beings, either in its unaltered form or as a derivative, such as [[cheese]].\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe mortality of the disease in 1909, as recorded in the British Army and Navy stationed in Malta, was 2%. The most frequent cause of death was [[endocarditis]]. Recent advances in [[antibiotics]] and surgery have been successful in preventing death due to endocarditis. Prevention of human brucellosis can be achieved by eradication of the disease in animals by vaccination and other veterinary control methods such as testing herds/flocks and slaughtering animals when infection is present. Currently, no effective vaccine is available for humans. Boiling milk before consumption, or before using it to produce other dairy products, is protective against transmission via ingestion. Changing traditional food habits of eating raw meat, liver, or bone marrow is necessary, but difficult to implement.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Patients who have had brucellosis should probably be excluded indefinitely from donating blood or organs.

Such illnesses ranged from undiagnosed and untreated gastrointestinal upset to misdiagnosed<ref name=\"de_Kruif_1932\"/> febrile and painful versions, some even fatal.

When the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) wanted a biological warfare capability, the Chemical Corps offered Agent US in the [[M114 bomblet]], based on the four-pound bursting bomblet developed for spreading [[anthrax]] during World War II. Though the capability was developed, operational testing indicated the weapon was less than desirable, and the USAF designed it as an interim capability until it could eventually be replaced by a more effective biological weapon.\n\nThe main drawback of using the M114 with Agent US was that it acted mainly as an incapacitating agent, whereas the USAF administration wanted weapons that were deadly. Also, the stability of M114 in storage was too low to allow for storing it at forward air bases, and the logistical requirements to neutralize a target were far higher than was originally planned. Ultimately, this would have required too much logistical support to be practical in the field.\n\nAgents US and AA had a median infective dose of 500 organisms/person, and for Agent AM it was 300 organisms/person. The time-of-incubation was believed to be about 2 weeks, with a duration of infection of several months. The lethality estimate was based on epidemiological information at 1 to 2%. Agent AM was believed to be a somewhat more virulent disease, with a fatality rate of 3% being expected.\n\n==Other animals==\nSpecies infecting domestic livestock are ''[[Brucella abortus|B. abortus]]'' (cattle, bison, and elk), ''[[Brucella canis|B. canis]]'' (dogs), ''[[Brucella melitensis|B. melitensis]]'' (goats and sheep), ''[[Brucella ovis|B. ovis]]'' (sheep), and ''[[Swine brucellosis|B. suis]]'' (caribou and pigs). ''Brucella'' species have also been isolated from several marine mammal species (cetaceans and pinnipeds).\n\n===Cattle===\n''[[Brucella abortus|B. abortus]]'' is the principal cause of brucellosis in cattle. The bacteria are shed from an infected animal at or around the time of calving or [[Spontaneous abortion|abortion]]. Once exposed, the likelihood of an animal becoming infected is variable, depending on age, pregnancy status, and other intrinsic factors of the animal, as well as the number of bacteria to which the animal was exposed.<ref>Radostits, O.M., C.C. Gay, D.C. Blood, and K.W. Hinchcliff. (2000). ''Veterinary Medicine, A textbook of the Diseases of Cattle, Sheep, Pigs, Goats and Horses''. Harcourt Publishers Limited, London, pp. 867\u2013882. {{ISBN|0702027774}}.</ref> The most common clinical signs of cattle infected with ''B. abortus'' are high incidences of abortions, arthritic joints, and retained [[placenta]].\n\nThe two main causes for spontaneous abortion in animals are [[erythritol]], which can promote infections in the fetus and placenta, and the lack of anti-''Brucella'' activity in the amniotic fluid. Males can also harbor the bacteria in their reproductive tracts, namely [[seminal vesicle]]s, [[ampulla of ductus deferens|ampullae]], [[testicle]]s, and [[Epididymis|epididymes]].\n\n===Dogs===\nThe causative agent of brucellosis in [[dog]]s, ''[[Brucella canis|B. canis]]'', is transmitted to other dogs through breeding and contact with aborted fetuses. Brucellosis can occur in humans who come in contact with infected aborted tissue or semen. The bacteria in dogs normally infect the genitals and [[lymphatic system]], but can also spread to the eyes, [[kidney]]s, and [[intervertebral disc]]s. Brucellosis in the intervertebral disc is one possible cause of [[discospondylitis]]. Symptoms of brucellosis in dogs include abortion in female dogs and  [[scrotum|scrotal]] inflammation and [[orchitis]] in males. Fever is uncommon. Infection of the eye can cause [[uveitis]], and infection of the intervertebral disc can cause pain or weakness. Blood testing of the dogs prior to breeding can prevent the spread of this disease. It is treated with antibiotics, as with humans, but it is difficult to cure.<ref name=\"Ettinger_1995\">{{cite book|author1=Ettinger, Stephen J |author2=Feldman, Edward C. |title=Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine|edition=4th|publisher=W.B.

First discovered in the aborted fetus of a [[bottlenose dolphin]], the structure of ''B. ceti'' is similar to ''Brucella'' in land animals. ''B. ceti'' is commonly detected in two suborders of cetaceans, the [[Mysticeti]] and [[Odontoceti]]. The Mysticeti include four families of [[baleen whales]], filter-feeders, and the Odontoceti include two families of toothed cetaceans ranging from dolphins to sperm whales. ''B. ceti'' is believed to transfer from animal to animal through sexual intercourse, maternal feeding, aborted fetuses, placental issues, from mother to fetus, or through fish reservoirs. Brucellosis is a reproductive disease, so has an extreme negative impact on the population dynamics of a species. This becomes a greater issue when the already low population numbers of cetaceans are taken into consideration. ''B. ceti'' has been identified in four  of the 14 cetacean families, but the antibodies have been detected in seven of the families. This indicates that ''B. ceti'' is common amongst cetacean families and populations. Only a small percentage of exposed individuals become ill or die. However, particular species apparently are more likely to become infected by ''B. ceti''. The harbor porpoise, striped dolphin, white-sided dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, and common dolphin have the highest frequency of infection amongst ondontocetes. In the mysticetes families, the northern minke whale is by far the most infected species. Dolphins and porpoises are more likely to be infected than cetaceans such as whales. With regard to sex and age biases, the infections do not seem influenced by the age or sex of an individual. Although fatal to cetaceans, ''B. ceti'' has a low infection rate for humans.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=22919595|pmc=3417395|year=2012|last1=Guzm\u00e1n-Verri|first1=C|title=Brucella ceti and brucellosis in cetaceans|journal=Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology|volume=2|pages=3|last2=Gonz\u00e1lez-Barrientos|first2=R|last3=Hern\u00e1ndez-Mora|first3=G|last4=Morales|first4=J.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men military age standards were modified to take on those from 18\u201350 years old.  Later it was found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

[[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19th the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/>With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]](UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and United States [[Marine Corps]].\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry_harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]]. <ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion had returned to England ending the Seabees Atlantic story.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes enroute to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well. Those in the UDTs would make Naval/Marine Corps awards History.  Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April, 1945, p. 46</ref> \n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[ Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Once ashore, before the island was secured, Seabee bulldozers were at work completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days. Work on the first airfield began until D+5<ref name=\"CBHISTORY\"/>\n\n\"Seabees provided critical support at [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] where the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|24th Army Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps|Third Marine Amphibious Corps]] landed off Rhinos and causeways of the 130th CB.  The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.  Nearly 55,000 Seabees, in four brigades would do the job.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men military age standards were modified to take on those from 18\u201350 years old.  Later it was found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked be the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades. They would become renowned for the unofficial trades of souvenir making, and the arts of obtaining materials by unofficial and unorthodox means<ref group=note>\"Cumshaw\" ({{cite web|title=Cumshaw definition|work=Merrian Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cumshaw}}) and \"moonlight procurement\"</ref> The key tools of the Seabees were [[bulldozers]], float [[pontoons]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}, [[Marston Mat]], corregated steel, applied with \"some ingenuity and [[elbow grease]]\"<ref name= \"USNWWII\">{{cite |title=The U.S. Navy in WWII |first= Mark |last=Henry|publisher= Osprey Publishing| series=Elite 80 |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> Nearly 11,400 officers joined the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] during the war, and 7,960 of them served with CBs.  The Seebees simultaneously constructed on multiple islands, across vast distances in support of American forces. On February 13th, 1945 the Chief of Naval Operations,  Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], approved the retention of CBs as a permanent part of the Navy.<ref>{{ cite |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/02/11/This-Week-in-Seabee-History-February-11-February-17/On |date=February 11, 2018 |title=This Date in Seabee History |work=Seabee Online Magazine}}</ref>  Before that happened they would provide the men and skills needed by the top secret [[Chemical Warfare Service]] [[Flame tank|Flame Tank]] Group.\n\n== Pre-war naval construction development ==\nIn the late 1930s the US was not yet actively involved in fighting [[World War II]], but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19th the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/>With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged. The same was done at the ABD Receiving Barracks [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], for the east coast.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\">{{cite report|title=History of the Seabees, Command Historian, Naval Facilities Engineering Command|year=1996|page=13|url=https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Publications/1996/01/01/History-of-the-Seabees-Command|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n===CB rates===\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html |title=U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Structure |website=bluejacket.com |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Naval Construction Battalions, Administration Manual |date=January 1944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R610ZqnWj9AC&pg=SL24-PA70 |publisher= |pages=27\u201330 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |via=google books}}</ref>  These indicate the construction trade in which a Seabee is skilled.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]](UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and United States [[Marine Corps]].\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.

The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]]. <ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both. Seabees moving supplies and ammo across their causeways were amongst them. For many months Seabees remained at Anzio under continuous German fire. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one more Mediterranean task in [[Operation Dragoon]] at [[Toulon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first projects were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]] at bases acquired from Great Britain.  These installations provided airfields and ports to protect [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the North Atlantic. To complete a defense line across the North Atlantic, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to prepare for [[Operation Overlord]]. From [[Milford Haven]] in  [[Wales]] to [[Plymouth]] and over to [[Exeter]], the Seabees built invasion bases and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU) along with the Army's Engineers. Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy German fire. Ignoring danger NCDUs worked until all their charges were placed and detonated. The result created gaps in the obstacles allowing the landing to progress. Once the invasion fleet arrived off the coast, the 10,000 Seabees of Naval Construction Regiment 25 began placeing their pontoon causeways. It was over these causeways that the invasion force went ashore to reach the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nAnother Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material were ferried ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to provide a port until French ports were captured and brought back into use. Even after the harbor destroyed by a storm the Seabees continued to landed thousands of tons supplies daily. In the first 28 days they were responsible for thousands of troops getting ashore.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed by the Allies. Foreseeing this the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships at a time. Seabees made the same thing happen at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even ferried Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to serve in Germany.  They also were the first CB to be deployed by air when they were flown from England to [[Bremen]] in April 1945. The battalion set up camp just outside the city. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational for the Allies.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the Hq of the U.S. Navy in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion had returned to England ending the Seabees Atlantic story.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes enroute to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

CBs of the 7th Amphibious group built advance bases and depots from Australia and [[New Guinea]] through the [[Philippines]] to Okinawa.  The landing at [[Treasury Island]] became Seabee legend.  An 87th Seabee with a bulldozer took out a machine gun nest for a [[Silver Star]] there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/> By V-J Day NCF Seabees would be awarded 5 [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]], 33 Silver Stars, and over 2000 [[Purple Heart]]s.  Many would receive citations and commendations from the Matine Corps.  Seabees serving outside the NCF received numerous awards as well. Those in the UDTs would make Naval/Marine Corps awards History.  Admiral Turner put up over 60 officers for the Silver star and over 300 enlisted for the Bronze star loop with Vs.\n\n\"By mid-1943 at [[Merauke]], [[New Guinea]] Seabees built an air strip and comm station at [[Port Moresby]].  In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April, 1945, p. 46</ref> \n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[ Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Once ashore, before the island was secured, Seabee bulldozers were at work completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days. Work on the first airfield began until D+5<ref name=\"CBHISTORY\"/>\n\n\"Seabees provided critical support at [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] where the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|24th Army Corps]] and [[III Amphibious Corps|Third Marine Amphibious Corps]] landed off Rhinos and causeways of the 130th CB.  The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.  Nearly 55,000 Seabees, in four brigades would do the job.

Its legacy is largely intertwined with that of its founder, [[Herb Abrams]].\n\nA Season 2 episode of ''[[Dark Side of the Ring]]'' focused on the promotion will air in May 2020.<ref>https://www.tvinsider.com/927543/dark-side-of-the-ring-season-2-premiere-chris-benoit/</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Herb Abrams]] founded the UWF in 1990 to try and challenge [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[World Wrestling Federation]] on a national level. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''. The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.184)</ref> The top homegrown talent included \"Wild Thing\" Steve Ray and \"Cutie Pie\" [[Louie Spicolli]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991. Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]]. The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n| first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n| last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n| num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n| opentheme = \n| website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and ran until 1993. The program also featured matches from the [[Ladies Major League Wrestling|Wild Women of Wrestling]] promotion.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].

Its legacy is largely intertwined with that of its founder, [[Herb Abrams]].\n\nA Season 2 episode of ''[[Dark Side of the Ring]]'' focused on the promotion will air in May 2020.<ref>https://www.tvinsider.com/927543/dark-side-of-the-ring-season-2-premiere-chris-benoit/</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Herb Abrams]] founded the UWF in 1990 to try and and challenge [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[World Wrestling Federation]] on a national level. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''. The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.184)</ref> The top homegrown talent included \"Wild Thing\" Steve Ray and \"Cutie Pie\" [[Louie Spicolli]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991. Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]]. The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n| first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n| last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n| num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n| opentheme = \n| website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and ran until 1993. The program also featured matches from the [[Ladies Major League Wrestling|Wild Women of Wrestling]] promotion.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].
