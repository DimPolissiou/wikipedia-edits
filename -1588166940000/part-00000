Over the series, the ODC have to overcome logistical difficulties, production errors, infrastructure problems and troublesome contributors. The main character is Ian Fletcher, the Head of Deliverance, who is in overall charge of the ODC, and is generally efficient but often has to clean up a PR disaster after the other managers make a mistake. A running thread in series one are the hints that his marriage to a high-flying lawyer is breaking down, which comes to a head in episode six. It is evident that his PA Sally is in love with him, although this remains unspoken.\n\nMeanwhile, Siobhan Sharpe is the excitable, but ultimately clueless Head of Brand through her PR company Perfect Curve. She answers almost every problem with phrases that have almost no substance whatsoever, and never turns her phone off during meetings with the other managers. Consequently, the rest of the managers find her ideas and enthusiastic attitude tiresome, particularly Nick Jowett, Head of Contracts, a blunt Yorkshireman who generally opposes ideas without making alternative suggestions, whilst emphasising that he is from Yorkshire. Jowett briefly becomes Acting Head of Deliverance in Series 2 when Ian Fletcher becomes incapacitated.\n\nKay Hope, Head of Sustainability, is in charge of sorting out what will happen to the buildings, stadia and other Olympic venues after the games. Hope is emphatic that Legacy is something separate from Sustainability although no one makes any attempt to differentiate these two apparently identical areas. She continually mentions that she is a single mother after a bitter divorce, and is paranoid about her public image. In series two Fi Healey joins the team as a new 'Head of Legacy', and instantly becomes Kay's nemesis due to being younger, ambitious and career savvy; the pair constantly clash.

The main character is Ian Fletcher, the Head of Deliverance, who is in overall charge of the ODC, and is generally efficient but often has to clean up a PR disaster after the other managers make a mistake. A running thread in series one are the hints that his marriage to a high-flying lawyer is breaking down, which comes to a head in episode six. It is evident that his PA Sally is in love with him, although this remains unspoken.\n\nMeanwhile, Siobhan Sharpe is the excitable, but ultimately clueless Head of Brand through her PR company Perfect Curve. She answers almost every problem with phrases that have almost no substance whatsoever, and never turns her phone off during meetings with the other managers. Consequently, the rest of the managers find her ideas and enthusiastic attitude tiresome, particularly Nick Jowett, Head of Contracts, a blunt Yorkshireman who generally opposes ideas without making alternative suggestions, whilst emphasising that he is from Yorkshire. Jowett briefly becomes Acting Head of Deliverance in Series 2 when Ian Fletcher becomes incapacitated.\n\nKay Hope, Head of Sustainability, is in charge of sorting out what will happen to the buildings, stadia and other Olympic venues after the games. Hope is emphatic that Legacy is something separate from Sustainability although no one makes any attempt to differentiate these two apparently identical areas. She continually mentions that she is a single mother after a bitter divorce, and is paranoid about her public image. In series two Fi Healey joins the team as a new 'Head of Legacy', and instantly becomes Kay's nemesis due to being younger, ambitious and career savvy; the pair constantly clash. Finally, Head of Infrastructure Graham Hitchens gives the impression that he knows everything about the London transport and traffic systems, but is completely ignorant, has no clue about deadlines and frequently upsets various officials.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"72%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character \n!! rowspan=\"2\" | Actor\n!! rowspan=\"2\" | Position \n!! colspan=\"2\" | Series\n|-\n! width=\"5%\" | One\n! width=\"5%\" | Two\n|-\n| Ian Fletcher || [[Hugh Bonneville]] || Head of Deliverance of the Olympic Deliverance Commission|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Main'''\n|-\n|Kay Hope || |[[Amelia Bullmore]] || Head of Sustainability|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Main'''\n|-\n| Sally Owen || [[Olivia Colman]] || Ian Fletcher's personal assistant|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Main'''\n|-\n|Nick Jowett || [[Vincent Franklin]] || Head of Contracts|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Main'''\n|-\n|Siobhan Sharpe || [[Jessica Hynes]] || Head of Brand|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Main'''\n|-\n|Graham Hitchins || [[Karl Theobald]] || Head of Infrastructure|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Main'''\n|-\n|Fi Healey || [[Morven Christie]] || Head of Legacy|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Main'''\n|-\n|Daniel Stroud || [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] || Ian Fletcher's personal assistant|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Main'''\n|-\n|Karl Marx|| [[Joel Fry (actor)|Joel Fry]] ||Brand consultant|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Recurrent'''\n|-\n|Barney Lumsden|| [[Alex Beckett (actor)|Alex Beckett]] ||Brand consultant|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Recurrent'''\n|-\n|Coco Lomax|| [[Sara Pascoe]] ||Brand consultant|| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#dfd; text-align:center;\" | '''Recurrent'''\n|}\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series 1===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style = \"background: #7B8FF6;\"|No.\n! style = \"background: #7B8FF6;\"|Title\n! style = \"background: #7B8FF6;\"|Overnight viewers\n! style = \"background: #7B8FF6;\"|Original airdate\n|-\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = Countdown\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2011|3|14|df=y}}\n| Aux1 = 417,000\n| ShortSummary = PR consultant Siobhan Sharpe is preparing to unveil a countdown clock in front of [[Tate Modern]].

The '''physical impacts of climate change''' foremost include globally rising temperatures of the lower atmosphere, the land, and oceans. Temperature rise is not uniform, with land masses and the [[Polar amplification|Arctic region warming faster]] than the global average. Effects on weather encompass increased heavy [[precipitation]], reduced amounts of cold days, increase in [[Heat wave|heat waves]] and [[Tropical cyclones and climate change|various effects on tropical cyclones]]. The enhanced [[greenhouse effect]] causes the higher part of the atmosphere, the [[stratosphere]], to cool. Geochemical cycles are also impacted, with absorption of {{CO2}} causing [[ocean acidification]], and rising ocean water decreasing the ocean's ability to absorb further carbon dioxide. Annual snow cover has decreased, sea ice is declining and [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|widespread melting of glaciers]] is underway. Thermal expansion and glacial retreat cause [[Sea level rise|sea levels to increase]]. Retreat of ice mass may impact various geological processes as well, such as [[volcanism]] and [[Earthquake|earthquakes]]. Increased temperatures and other human interference with the climate system can lead to [[Tipping points in the climate system|tipping points]] to be crossed such as the [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|collapse of the thermohaline circulation]] or the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Some of these physical impacts also affect social and economic systems.\n\n==Global warming==\n{{See also|Instrumental temperature record}}\n[[File:Global Temperature Anomaly.svg|alt=The instrumental temperature record shows a long-term trend of global warming between 1880 and 2009|thumb|Global mean surface temperature change compared to the 1951-1980 average.|330x330px]]\nGlobal surface temperatures in 2016 had increased about 1.0&nbsp;\u00b0C since 1901.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/1/|title=Climate Science Special Report.

Future [[global warming]] is expected to be accompanied by a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some [[equatorial region]]s. In other words, regions which are dry at present will generally become even drier, while regions that are currently wet will generally become even wetter. This projection does not apply to every locale, and in some cases can be modified by local conditions.

The oceans serve as a sink for carbon dioxide, taking up much that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere, but increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> have led to [[ocean acidification]]. Furthermore, as the temperature of the oceans increases, they become less able to absorb excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Global warming is projected to have a number of effects on the oceans. Ongoing effects include rising sea levels due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and warming of the ocean surface, leading to increased temperature stratification. Other possible effects include large-scale changes in ocean circulation.\n\n====Sea level rise====\n{{Main|Current sea level rise}}\n{{further|Amundsen Sea}}\n\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Holocene Sea Level.png|image2=Recent Sea Level Rise.png|width=200|caption1=Sea level rise during the Holocene.|caption2=Sea level has been rising {{#expr: 20/120 round 1}} cm/year, based on measurements of [[sea level rise]] from 23 long [[tide gauge]] records in geologically stable environments.}}\n\nIPCC (2007a:5) reported that since 1961, global average sea level had risen at an average rate of 1.8 [1.3 to 2.3] mm/yr.<ref name=ar4wg1/> Between 1993 and 2003, the rate increased above the previous period to 3.1 [2.4 to 3.8] mm/yr. IPCC (2007a) were uncertain whether the increase in rate from 1993 to 2003 was due to natural variations in sea level over the time period, or whether it reflected an increase in the underlying long-term trend.\n\nIPCC (2007a:13, 14) projected sea level rise to the end of the 21st century using the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|SRES]] emission [[economics of global warming#Scenarios|scenarios]]. Across the six SRES marker scenarios, sea level was projected to rise by 18 to 59&nbsp;cm (7.1 to 23.2&nbsp;inches). This projection was for the time period 2090\u20132099, with the increase in level relative to average sea levels over the 1980\u20131999 period. Due to a lack of scientific understanding, this sea level rise estimate does not include all of the possible contributions of ice sheets.\n\nWith increasing average global temperature, the [[water]] in the oceans expands in volume, and additional water enters them which had previously been locked up on land in [[glaciers]] and [[ice sheets]].

Hansen]] ''et al.'' claimed that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion, but that another according to the geological record, the [[ice sheet]]s can suddenly destabilize when a certain threshold is exceeded. In this paper Hansen ''et al.'' state:\n\n<blockquote>Our concern that BAU GHG scenarios would cause large sealevel rise this century (Hansen 2005) differs from estimates of IPCC (2001, 2007), which foresees little or no contribution to twentyfirst century sealevel rise from Greenland and Antarctica. However, the IPCC analyses and projections do not well account for the nonlinear physics of wet ice sheet disintegration, ice streams and eroding ice shelves, nor are they consistent with the palaeoclimate evidence we have presented for the absence of discernible lag between ice sheet forcing and sealevel rise.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hansen |first=James |year=2007 |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022020035/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-10-22 |title=Climate change and trace gases |journal=Phil.

The loss of mass in the region around the ice sheet would decrease the [[gravitational potential]] there, reducing the amount of local sea level rise or even causing local sea level fall. The loss of the localized mass would also change the [[moment of inertia]] of the Earth, as flow in the [[Earth's mantle]] will require 10\u201315 thousand years to make up the mass deficit. This change in the moment of inertia results in [[true polar wander]], in which the Earth's rotational axis remains fixed with respect to the sun, but the rigid sphere of the Earth rotates with respect to it. This changes the location of the [[equatorial bulge]] of the Earth and further affects the [[geoid]], or global potential field. A 2009 study of the effects of collapse of the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] shows the result of both of these effects. Instead of a global 5-meter sea level rise, western Antarctica would experience approximately 25 centimeters of sea level fall, while the United States, parts of Canada, and the Indian Ocean, would experience up to 6.5 meters of sea level rise.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1166510 |title=The Sea-Level Fingerprint of West Antarctic Collapse |year=2009 |last1=Mitrovica |first1=J.

The '''physical impacts of climate change''' foremost include globally rising temperatures of the lower atmosphere, the land, and oceans. Temperature rise is not uniform, with land masses and the [[Polar amplification|Arctic region warming faster]] than the global average. Effects on weather encompass increased heavy [[precipitation]], reduced amounts of cold days, increase in [[Heat wave|heat waves]] and [[Tropical cyclones and climate change|various effects on tropical cyclones]]. The enhanced [[greenhouse effect]] causes the higher part of the atmosphere, the [[stratosphere]], to cool. Geochemical cycles are also impacted, with absorption of {{CO2}} causing [[ocean acidification]], and rising ocean water decreasing the ocean's ability to absorb further carbon dioxide. Annual snow cover has decreased, sea ice is declining and [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|widespread melting of glaciers]] is underway. Thermal expansion and glacial retreat cause [[Sea level rise|sea levels to increase]]. Retreat of ice mass may impact various geological processes as well, such as [[volcanism]] and [[Earthquake|earthquakes]]. Increased temperatures and other human interference with the climate system can lead to [[Tipping points in the climate system|tipping points]] to be crossed such as the [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|collapse of the thermohaline circulation]] or the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Some of these physical impacts also affect social and economic systems.\n\n==Global warming==\n{{See also|Instrumental temperature record}}\n[[File:Global Temperature Anomaly.svg|alt=The instrumental temperature record shows a long-term trend of global warming between 1880 and 2009|thumb|Global mean surface temperature change compared to the 1951-1980 average.|330x330px]]\nGlobal surface temperatures in 2016 had increased about 1.0&nbsp;\u00b0C since 1901.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/1/|title=Climate Science Special Report.

Future [[global warming]] is expected to be accompanied by a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some [[equatorial region]]s. In other words, regions which are dry at present will generally become even drier, while regions that are currently wet will generally become even wetter. This projection does not apply to every locale, and in some cases can be modified by local conditions. Drying is projected to be strongest near the poleward margins of the subtropics (for example, [[South Africa]], [[southern Australia]], the [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]], and the [[Southwestern United States|south-western U.S.]]), a pattern that can be described as a poleward expansion of these semi-arid zones.<!-- This entire paragraph is based on the following reference --><ref name=\"gfdl rainfall projections\"/>\n\nThis large-scale pattern of change is a robust feature present in nearly all of the simulations conducted by the world's climate modeling groups for the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|4th Assessment]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), and is also evident in observed 20th century precipitation trends.<ref name=\"gfdl rainfall projections\"/>\n\nChanges in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land, with most warming at high northern [[latitudes]], and least warming over the [[Southern Ocean]] and parts of the North Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=\"IPCC AR4 SYR 2007\">IPCC, [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spm.html Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers], [http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/spms3.html Section 3: Projected climate change and its impacts], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR4 SYR|2007}}.\n</ref>\n\nFuture changes in precipitation are expected to follow existing trends, with reduced precipitation over [[subtropical]] land areas, and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some [[equator]]ial regions.<ref>{{Cite journal\n |author=NOAA\n |date=February 2007\n |url=http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/cms-filesystem-action/user_files/kd/pdf/gfdlhighlight_vol1n5.pdf\n |title=Will the wet get wetter and the dry drier?\n |journal=GFDL Climate Modeling Research Highlights\n |volume=1\n |issue=5\n |ref=harv\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226153828/https://gfdl.noaa.gov/cms-filesystem-action/user_files/kd/pdf/gfdlhighlight_vol1n5.pdf\n |archivedate=26 February 2013\n |page=1}}</ref>\n\nA 2015 study published in ''[[Nature Climate Change]]'', states: {{quote|About 18% of the moderate daily precipitation extremes over land are attributable to the observed temperature increase since pre-industrial times, which in turn primarily results from human influence.

A [[positive feedback]] intensifies the original process, and a negative feedback reduces it (IPCC, 2007d:78).<ref name=ar4syn/> Models suggest that the interaction of the climate system and the carbon cycle is one where the feedback effect is positive (Schneider ''et al''., 2007:792).<ref name=schneider/>\n\nUsing the A2 SRES emissions scenario, Schneider ''et al''.

Hansen]] ''et al.'' claimed that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion, but that another according to the geological record, the [[ice sheet]]s can suddenly destabilize when a certain threshold is exceeded. In this paper Hansen ''et al.'' state:\n\n<blockquote>Our concern that BAU GHG scenarios would cause large sealevel rise this century (Hansen 2005) differs from estimates of IPCC (2001, 2007), which foresees little or no contribution to twentyfirst century sealevel rise from Greenland and Antarctica. However, the IPCC analyses and projections do not well account for the nonlinear physics of wet ice sheet disintegration, ice streams and eroding ice shelves, nor are they consistent with the palaeoclimate evidence we have presented for the absence of discernible lag between ice sheet forcing and sealevel rise.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hansen |first=James |year=2007 |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022020035/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-10-22 |title=Climate change and trace gases |journal=Phil.

The loss of mass in the region around the ice sheet would decrease the [[gravitational potential]] there, reducing the amount of local sea level rise or even causing local sea level fall. The loss of the localized mass would also change the [[moment of inertia]] of the Earth, as flow in the [[Earth's mantle]] will require 10\u201315 thousand years to make up the mass deficit. This change in the moment of inertia results in [[true polar wander]], in which the Earth's rotational axis remains fixed with respect to the sun, but the rigid sphere of the Earth rotates with respect to it. This changes the location of the [[equatorial bulge]] of the Earth and further affects the [[geoid]], or global potential field. A 2009 study of the effects of collapse of the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] shows the result of both of these effects. Instead of a global 5-meter sea level rise, western Antarctica would experience approximately 25 centimeters of sea level fall, while the United States, parts of Canada, and the Indian Ocean, would experience up to 6.5 meters of sea level rise.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1166510 |title=The Sea-Level Fingerprint of West Antarctic Collapse |year=2009 |last1=Mitrovica |first1=J.

The convicted traitor was fastened to a [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then [[hanged]] (almost to the point of death), [[emasculation|emasculated]], [[disembowelment|disembowelled]], [[decapitation|beheaded]], and [[Dismemberment|quartered]] (chopped into four pieces). His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such as [[London Bridge]], to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]].\n\nThe severity of the sentence was [[Retributive justice|measured against the seriousness of the crime]]. As an attack on the monarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests executed during the [[Elizabethan era]], and several of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] involved in the 1649 [[execution of Charles I]].\n\nAlthough the [[Act of Parliament]] defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England [[Forfeiture Act 1870|in 1870]]. The death penalty for treason was abolished [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998|in 1998]].\n\n==Treason in England==\n[[Image:Drawing of William de Marisco.jpg|thumb|300px|As illustrated in [[Matthew Paris]]'s ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', [[William de Marisco]] is drawn to his execution behind a horse.]]\nDuring the [[High Middle Ages]] those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging. In the 13th century other more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering. The 13th-century English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] described how in 1238 \"a certain man at arms, a man of some education (''armiger literatus'')\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1949|pp=54\u201358}}</ref> attempted to kill [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].

Suspects were first questioned in private by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] before they were publicly tried. They were allowed no witnesses or defence [[counsel]], and were generally presumed guilty from the outset. This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians prompted the introduction of the [[Treason Act 1695]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomkovicz|2002|p=6}}</ref> This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Execution of the sentence==\n{{See also|List of people hanged, drawn and quartered}}\nOnce sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution.

A government spy, John Munday, was in 1582 present for the execution of [[Thomas Ford (martyr)|Thomas Ford]]. Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=194}}</ref> The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=199}}</ref>\n\nThe condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them. The priest [[James Bell (priest)|James Bell]] was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, [[John Finch (martyr)|John Finch]], was \"a-quarter-inge.\" [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]] and Francis Edwardes were made to witness [[Ralph Crockett]]'s execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s religious supremacy before they were themselves executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=201}}</ref> Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart.

(BnF Fr 2643-6)|Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse]]]]\n\nTo be '''hanged, drawn and quartered''' was, [[Treason Act 1351|from 1352]], a [[statutory]] penalty in England for men convicted of [[high treason]], although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216\u20131272). The convicted traitor was fastened to a [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then [[hanged]] (almost to the point of death), [[emasculation|emasculated]], [[disembowelment|disembowelled]], [[decapitation|beheaded]], and [[Dismemberment|quartered]] (chopped into four pieces). His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such as [[London Bridge]], to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]].\n\nThe severity of the sentence was [[Retributive justice|measured against the seriousness of the crime]]. As an attack on the monarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests executed during the [[Elizabethan era]], and several of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] involved in the 1649 [[execution of Charles I]].\n\nAlthough the [[Act of Parliament]] defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England [[Forfeiture Act 1870|in 1870]]. The death penalty for treason was abolished [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998|in 1998]].\n\n==Treason in England==\n[[Image:Drawing of William de Marisco.jpg|thumb|300px|As illustrated in [[Matthew Paris]]'s ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', [[William de Marisco]] is drawn to his execution behind a horse.]]\nDuring the [[High Middle Ages]] those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging. In the 13th century other more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering. The 13th-century English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] described how in 1238 \"a certain man at arms, a man of some education (''armiger literatus'')\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1949|pp=54\u201358}}</ref> attempted to kill [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]. His account records in gruesome detail how the would-be assassin was executed: \"dragged asunder, then beheaded, and his body divided into three parts; each part was then dragged through one of the principal cities of England, and was afterwards hung on a gibbet used for robbers.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Giles|1852|p=139}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|\"''<!-- Quo cognito -->Rex eum, quasi regiae majestatis (occisorem), membratim laniatum equis apud Coventre, exemplum terribile et spectaculum comentabile praebere (iussit) omnibus audentibus talia machinari.

De Marisco was captured in 1242 and on Henry's order dragged from Westminster to the [[Tower of London]] to be executed. There he was hanged from a [[gibbet]] until dead. His corpse was disembowelled, his entrails burned, his body quartered and the parts distributed to cities across the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|Paris|1987|p=234}}</ref> The punishment is more frequently recorded during [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s reign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Diehl|Donnelly|2009|p=58}}</ref>  \n\nThe [[Welsh people|Welsh]] Prince [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] became the first nobleman in England to be hanged, drawn, and quartered after he turned against the king and proclaimed himself [[Prince of Wales]] and Lord of Snowdon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beadle|Harrison|2008|p=11}}</ref> Dafydd's rebellion infuriated [[Edward I]] so much that he demanded a novel punishment. Therefore, following his capture and trial in 1283, for his betrayal he was drawn by horse to his place of execution. For killing English nobles he was hanged alive. For killing those nobles at Easter he was eviscerated and his entrails burned. For conspiring to kill the king in various parts of the realm, his body was quartered and the parts sent across the country; his head was placed on top of the [[Tower of London]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2004|pp=23\u201326}}</ref> A similar fate was suffered by the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] leader [[William Wallace|Sir William Wallace]].

They were allowed no witnesses or defence [[counsel]], and were generally presumed guilty from the outset. This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians prompted the introduction of the [[Treason Act 1695]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomkovicz|2002|p=6}}</ref> This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Execution of the sentence==\n{{See also|List of people hanged, drawn and quartered}}\nOnce sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution.

Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=194}}</ref> The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=199}}</ref>\n\nThe condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them. The priest [[James Bell (priest)|James Bell]] was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, [[John Finch (martyr)|John Finch]], was \"a-quarter-inge.\" [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]] and Francis Edwardes were made to witness [[Ralph Crockett]]'s execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s religious supremacy before they were themselves executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=201}}</ref> Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart. On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air. The aim was usually to cause [[strangulation]] and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest [[John Payne (martyr)|John Payne]]'s death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs. Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular [[William Hacket]] (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally [[emasculated]]\u2014the latter, according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], to \"show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood.\"{{refn|group=\"nb\"|For an explanation of \"corruption of blood\", see [[Attainder]].}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Though many say that the disembowelling involved the criminal being slit open from the breastbone down, Geoffrey Robertson <ref>(2005) ''The Tyrannicide Brief'', London  Chatto & Windus</ref> shows photographs of the screw irons used, he states, to 'draw' the entrails through the anus, the opening having been first cut open it more than natural.

Influenced by his friend, [[Jeremy Bentham]], Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the [[Bloody Code|severity of England's laws]] was responsible for an increase in crime. When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as \"Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|p=42}}</ref> He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy,<!-- this cited to previous citation, block/hostettler, no need for two cites so close together --> and [[Treason Act 1814|in 1814]] proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal.

The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife. As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled. A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison. Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls.<ref>{{Citation | last = Belchem | first = John | title = Brandreth, Jeremiah (1786/1790\u20131817) | volume = 1 | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | origyear = 2004 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3270 | accessdate = 19 August 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/3270}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> The plot was the last crime for which the sentence was applied.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=161\u2013162}}</ref>\n\nReformation of England's capital punishment laws continued throughout the 19th century, as politicians such as [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]], sought to remove from the statute books many of the capital offences that remained.<ref>{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|pp=51\u201358}}</ref> [[Robert Peel]]'s drive to ameliorate law enforcement saw petty treason abolished by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]], which removed the distinction between crimes formerly considered as petty treason, and murder.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wiener|2004|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Dubber|2005|p=27}}</ref> The [[Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864-1866]] recommended that there be no change to treason law, quoting the \"more merciful\" [[Treason Felony Act 1848]], which limited the punishment for most treasonous acts to [[penal servitude]].
