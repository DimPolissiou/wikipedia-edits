{"title_page": "Binary number", "text_new": "{{short description|Number expressed though the symbols 0 and 1}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{Table Numeral Systems}}\nIn mathematics and [[digital electronics]], a '''binary number''' is a [[number]] expressed in the '''base-2 numeral system''' or '''binary numeral system''', which uses only two symbols: typically \"0\" ([[zero]]) and \"1\" ([[one]]).\n\nThe base-2 numeral system is a [[positional notation]] with a [[radix]] of 2. Each digit is referred to as a [[bit]]. Because of its straightforward implementation in [[Digital electronics|digital electronic circuitry]] using [[logic gate]]s, the binary system is used by almost all modern [[computer|computers and computer-based devices]].\n\n==History==\nThe modern binary number system was studied in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries by [[Thomas Harriot]], [[Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. However, systems related to binary numbers have appeared earlier in multiple cultures including ancient Egypt, China, and India. Leibniz was specifically inspired by the Chinese [[I Ching]].\n\n===Egypt===\n{{See also|Ancient Egyptian mathematics}}\n[[File:Oudjat.SVG|thumb|240px|left|Arithmetic values thought to have been represented by parts of the Eye of Horus]]\nThe scribes of ancient Egypt used two different systems for their fractions, [[Egyptian fraction]]s (not related to the binary number system) and [[Eye of Horus|Horus-Eye]] fractions (so called because many historians of mathematics believe that the symbols used for this system could be arranged to form the eye of [[Horus]], although this has been disputed).<ref>{{citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Mathematics|editor1-first=Eleanor|editor1-last=Robson|editor1-link=Eleanor Robson|editor2-first=Jacqueline|editor2-last=Stedall|editor2-link=Jackie Stedall|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199213122|page=790|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZMSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA790|contribution=Myth No. 2: the Horus eye fractions}}</ref> Horus-Eye fractions are a binary numbering system for fractional quantities of grain, liquids, or other measures, in which a fraction of a [[hekat]] is expressed as a sum of the binary fractions 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, and 1/64. Early forms of this system can be found in documents from the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt]], approximately 2400 BC, and its fully developed hieroglyphic form dates to the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]], approximately 1200 BC.<ref>{{citation|title=Numerical Notation: A Comparative History|first=Stephen|last=Chrisomalis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521878180|pages=42\u201343|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ux--OWgWvBQC&pg=PA42}}.</ref>\n\nThe method used for [[ancient Egyptian multiplication]] is also closely related to binary numbers. In this method, multiplying one number by a second is performed by a sequence of steps in which a value (initially the first of the two numbers) is either doubled or has the first number added back into it; the order in which these steps are to be performed is given by the binary representation of the second number. This method can be seen in use, for instance, in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]], which dates to around 1650 BC.<ref>{{citation|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|first=Peter Strom|last=Rudman|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2007|isbn=9781615921768|pages=135\u2013136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtcQq4RUfkUC&pg=PA135}}.</ref>\n\n===China===\n[[File:Bagua-name-earlier.svg|thumb|160px|Daoist Bagua]]\nThe [[I Ching]] dates from the 9th century BC in China.<ref name=\"HackerMoore2002\">{{cite book|author1=Edward Hacker|author2=Steve Moore|author3=Lorraine Patsco|title=I Ching: An Annotated Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S5hLpfFiMCQC&pg=PR13|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93969-0|page=13}}</ref> The binary notation in the ''I Ching'' is used to interpret its [[quaternary numeral system|quaternary]]  [[I Ching divination|divination]] technique.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|p=227}}\n\nIt is based on taoistic duality of [[yin and yang]].<ref name=\"scientific\">{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Shectman|title=Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the 18th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsbChdIiflsC&pg=PA29|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|isbn=978-0-313-32015-6|page=29}}</ref>\n[[Ba gua|eight trigrams (Bagua)]] and a set of [[Hexagram (I Ching)|64 hexagrams (\"sixty-four\" gua)]], analogous to the three-bit and six-bit binary numerals, were in use at least as early as the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou Dynasty of ancient China]].<ref name=\"HackerMoore2002\"/>\n\nThe [[Song Dynasty]] scholar [[Shao Yong]] (1011\u20131077) rearranged the hexagrams in a format that resembles modern binary numbers, although he did not intend his arrangement to be used mathematically.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|p=227}} Viewing the [[least significant bit]] on top of single hexagrams in [http://www.biroco.com/yijing/sequence.htm Shao Yong's square] and reading along rows either from bottom right to top left with solid lines as 0 and broken lines as 1 or from top left to bottom right with solid lines as 1 and broken lines as 0 hexagrams can be interpreted as sequence from 0 to 63.\n<ref name=\"Shao Yong\u2019s \u201dXiantian Tu\u2018\u2018\">{{cite book|last1=Zhonglian|first1=Shi|last2=Wenzhao|first2=Li|last3=Poser|first3=Hans|title=Leibniz' Binary System and Shao Yong's \"Xiantian Tu'' in :Das Neueste \u00fcber China: G.W.

For example, the binary numeral 100 is pronounced ''one zero zero'', rather than ''one hundred'', to make its binary nature explicit, and for purposes of correctness. Since the binary numeral 100 represents the value four, it would be confusing to refer to the numeral as ''one hundred'' (a word that represents a completely different value, or amount). Alternatively, the binary numeral 100 can be read out as \"four\" (the correct ''value''), but this does not make its binary nature explicit.\n\n==Counting in binary==\n{{Aligned table |class=wikitable |cols=2\n|style=float:right; |rowstyle=text-align:right;\n|row1header=y\n| Decimal<br>number | Binary<br>number\n|  0 |    0\n|  1 |    1\n|  2 |   10\n|  3 |   11\n|  4 |  100\n|  5 |  101\n|  6 |  110\n|  7 |  111\n|  8 | 1000\n|  9 | 1001\n| 10 | 1010\n| 11 | 1011\n| 12 | 1100\n| 13 | 1101\n| 14 | 1110\n| 15 | 1111\n}}\nCounting in binary is similar to counting in any other number system. Beginning with a single digit, counting proceeds through each symbol, in increasing order. Before examining binary counting, it is useful to briefly discuss the more familiar [[decimal]] counting system as a frame of reference.\n\n===Decimal counting===\n[[Decimal]] counting uses the ten symbols ''0'' through ''9''.  Counting begins with the incremental substitution of the least significant digit (rightmost digit) which is often called the ''first digit''. When the available symbols for this position are exhausted, the least significant digit is reset to ''0'', and the next digit of higher significance (one position to the left) is incremented (''overflow''), and incremental substitution of the low-order digit resumes. This method of reset and overflow is repeated for each digit of significance. Counting progresses as follows:\n\n:000, 001, 002, ... 007, 008, 009, (rightmost digit is reset to zero, and the digit to its left is incremented)\n:0'''1'''0, 011, 012, ...\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...\n:090, 091, 092, ... 097, 098, 099, (rightmost two digits are reset to zeroes, and next digit is incremented)\n:'''1'''00, 101, 102, ...\n\n===Binary counting===\n[[File:Binary counter.gif|thumb|This counter shows how to count in binary from numbers zero through thirty-one.]]\nBinary counting follows the same procedure, except that only the two symbols ''0'' and ''1'' are available. Thus, after a digit reaches 1 in binary, an increment resets it to 0 but also causes an increment of the next digit to the left:\n\n:0000,\n:000'''1''', (rightmost digit starts over, and next digit is incremented)\n:00'''1'''0, 0011, (rightmost two digits start over, and next digit is incremented)\n:0'''1'''00, 0101, 0110, 0111, (rightmost three digits start over, and the next digit is incremented)\n:'''1'''000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111 ...\n\nIn the binary system, each digit represents an increasing power of 2, with the rightmost digit representing 2<sup>0</sup>, the next representing 2<sup>1</sup>, then 2<sup>2</sup>, and so on. The value of a binary number is the sum of the powers of 2 represented by each \"1\"\u202fdigit. For example, the binary number 100101 is converted to decimal form as follows:\n\n:100101<sub>2</sub> = [ ( '''1''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>5</sup> ] + [ ( '''0''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>4</sup> ] + [ ( '''0''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>3</sup> ] + [ ( '''1''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>2</sup> ] + [ ( '''0''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>1</sup> ] + [ ( '''1''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>0</sup> ]\n\n:100101<sub>2</sub> = [ '''1''' \u00d7 32 ] + [ '''0''' \u00d7 16 ] + [ '''0''' \u00d7 8 ] + [ '''1''' \u00d7 4 ] + [ '''0''' \u00d7 2 ] + [ '''1''' \u00d7 1 ]\n\n:'''100101<sub>2</sub> = 37<sub>10</sub>'''\n\n==Fractions==\n\nFractions in binary arithmetic terminate only if [[2 (number)|2]]  is the only [[prime factor]] in the [[denominator]]. As a result, 1/10 does not have a finite binary representation ('''10''' has prime factors '''2''' and '''5'''). This causes 10 \u00d7 0.1 not to precisely equal 1 in [[floating-point arithmetic]]. As an example, to interpret the binary expression for 1/3 = .010101..., this means: 1/3 = 0 \u00d7 '''2<sup>\u22121</sup>''' + 1 \u00d7 '''2<sup>\u22122</sup>''' + 0 \u00d7 '''2<sup>\u22123</sup>''' +  1 \u00d7 '''2<sup>\u22124</sup>''' + ... = 0.3125 + ... An exact value cannot be found with a sum of a finite number of inverse powers of two, the zeros and ones in the binary representation of 1/3 alternate forever.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on binary numerals.\n\n===Addition===\n{{main | Adder (electronics)}}\n[[Image:Half Adder.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|The [[circuit diagram]] for a binary [[Adder (electronics)|half adder]], which adds two bits together, producing sum and carry bits]]\n\nThe simplest arithmetic operation in binary is addition. Adding two single-digit binary numbers is relatively simple, using a form of carrying:\n\n:0 + 0 \u2192 0\n:0 + 1 \u2192 1\n:1 + 0 \u2192 1\n:1 + 1 \u2192 0, carry 1 (since 1 + 1 = 2 = 0 + (1 \u00d7 2<sup>1</sup>)  )\nAdding two \"1\" digits produces a digit \"0\", while 1 will have to be added to the next column. This is similar to what happens in decimal when certain single-digit numbers are added together; if the result equals or exceeds the value of the radix (10), the digit to the left is incremented:\n\n:5 + 5 \u2192 0, carry 1 (since 5 + 5 = 10 = 0 + (1 \u00d7 10<sup>1</sup>)  )\n:7 + 9 \u2192 6, carry 1 (since 7 + 9 = 16 = 6 + (1 \u00d7 10<sup>1</sup>)  )\n\nThis is known as ''carrying''. When the result of an addition exceeds the value of a digit, the procedure is to \"carry\" the excess amount divided by the radix (that is, 10/10) to the left, adding it to the next positional value. This is correct since the next position has a weight that is higher by a factor equal to the radix. Carrying works the same way in binary:\n\n   {{brown|1 1 1 1 1    (carried digits)}}\n     0 1 1 0 1\n +   1 0 1 1 1\n -------------\n = 1 0 0 1 0 0 = 36\n\nIn this example, two numerals are being added together: 01101<sub>2</sub> (13<sub>10</sub>) and 10111<sub>2</sub> (23<sub>10</sub>). The top row shows the carry bits used. Starting in the rightmost column, 1 + 1 = 10<sub>2</sub>. The 1 is carried to the left, and the 0 is written at the bottom of the rightmost column. The second column from the right is added: 1 + 0 + 1 = 10<sub>2</sub> again; the 1 is carried, and 0 is written at the bottom. The third column: 1 + 1 + 1 = 11<sub>2</sub>. This time, a 1 is carried, and a 1 is written in the bottom row. Proceeding like this gives the final answer 100100<sub>2</sub> (36 decimal).\n\nWhen computers must add two numbers, the rule that:\nx [[Exclusive or|xor]] y = (x + y) [[Modulo operation|mod]] 2\nfor any two bits x and y allows for very fast calculation, as well.\n\n====Long carry method====\nA simplification for many binary addition problems is the [[Long Carry Method]] or [[Brookhouse Method of Binary Addition]]. This method is generally useful in any binary addition in which one of the numbers contains a long \"string\" of ones. It is based on the simple premise that under the binary system, when given a \"string\" of digits composed entirely of {{varserif|n}} ones (''where:'' {{varserif|n}} is any integer length), adding 1 will result in the number 1 followed by a string of {{var|n}} zeros. That concept follows, logically, just as in the decimal system, where adding 1 to a string of {{varserif|n}} 9s will result in the number 1 followed by a string of {{var|n}} 0s:\n\n      Binary                        Decimal\n     1 1 1 1 1     likewise        9 9 9 9 9\n  +          1                  +          1\n   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014                   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 0 0 0 0 0                   1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSuch long strings are quite common in the binary system.  From that one finds that large binary numbers can be added using two simple steps, without excessive carry operations. In the following example, two numerals are being added together: 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0<sub>2</sub> (958<sub>10</sub>) and 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1<sub>2</sub> (691<sub>10</sub>), using the traditional carry method on the left, and the long carry method on the right:\n\n Traditional Carry Method                       Long Carry Method\n                                 vs.\n   {{brown|1 1 1   1 1 1 1 1      (carried digits)   1 \u2190     1 \u2190}}            carry the 1 until it is one digit past the \"string\" below\n     1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0                       <s>1 1 1</s> 0 <s>1 1 1 1 1</s> 0  cross out the \"string\",\n +   1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1                   +   1 0 <s>1</s> 0 1 1 0 0 <s>1</s> 1  and cross out the digit that was added to it\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014                    \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n = 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1                     1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1\n\nThe top row shows the carry bits used. Instead of the standard carry from one column to the next, the lowest-ordered \"1\" with a \"1\" in the corresponding place value beneath it may be added and a \"1\" may be carried to one digit past the end of the series.  The \"used\" numbers must be crossed off, since they are already added. Other long strings may likewise be cancelled using the same technique. Then, simply add together any remaining digits normally. Proceeding in this manner gives the final answer of 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1<sub>2</sub> (1649<sub>10</sub>).  In our simple example using small numbers, the traditional carry method required eight carry operations, yet the long carry method required only two, representing a substantial reduction of effort.\n\n====Addition table====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" |\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" | 0\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" | 1\n|-\n! 0\n| 0\n| 1\n|-\n! 1\n| 1\n| 10\n|}\n\nThe binary addition table is similar, but not the same, as the [[Logical disjunction#Truth table|truth table]] of the [[logical disjunction]] operation <math>\\lor</math>. The difference is that <math>1</math><math>\\lor </math><math>1=1</math>, while <math>1+1=10</math>.\n\n=== Subtraction ===\n{{further|signed number representations|two's complement}}\n\n[[Subtraction]] works in much the same way:\n\n:0 \u2212 0 \u2192 0\n:0 \u2212 1 \u2192 1, borrow 1\n:1 \u2212 0 \u2192 1\n:1 \u2212 1 \u2192 0\nSubtracting a \"1\" digit from a \"0\" digit produces the digit \"1\", while 1 will have to be subtracted from the next column. This is known as ''borrowing''. The principle is the same as for carrying. When the result of a subtraction is less than 0, the least possible value of a digit, the procedure is to \"borrow\" the deficit divided by the radix (that is, 10/10) from the left, subtracting it from the next positional value.\n\n     *   * * *   (starred columns are borrowed from)\n   1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n \u2212     1 0 1 1 1\n ----------------\n = 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\n\n   *             (starred columns are borrowed from)\n   1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n -   1 0 1 0 1 1\n ----------------\n = 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nSubtracting a positive number is equivalent to ''adding'' a [[negative number]] of equal [[absolute value]]. Computers use [[signed number representations]] to handle negative numbers\u2014most commonly the [[two's complement]] notation. Such representations eliminate the need for a separate \"subtract\" operation. Using two's complement notation subtraction can be summarized by the following formula:\n\n'''A \u2212 B = A + not B + 1'''\n\n===Multiplication===<!-- This section is linked from [[Binary-coded decimal]] -->\n[[Multiplication]] in binary is similar to its decimal counterpart. Two numbers {{varserif|A}} and {{varserif|B}} can be multiplied by partial products: for each digit in {{varserif|B}}, the product of that digit in {{varserif|A}} is calculated and written on a new line, shifted leftward so that its rightmost digit lines up with the digit in {{varserif|B}} that was used. The sum of all these partial products gives the final result.\n\nSince there are only two digits in binary, there are only two possible outcomes of each partial multiplication:\n* If the digit in {{varserif|B}} is 0, the partial product is also 0\n* If the digit in {{varserif|B}} is 1, the partial product is equal to {{varserif|A}}\n\nFor example, the binary numbers 1011 and 1010 are multiplied as follows:\n\n            1 0 1 1   ({{varserif|A}})\n          \u00d7 1 0 1 0   ({{varserif|B}})\n          ---------\n            0 0 0 0   \u2190 Corresponds to the rightmost 'zero' in {{varserif|B}}\n    +     1 0 1 1     \u2190 Corresponds to the next 'one' in {{varserif|B}}\n    +   0 0 0 0\n    + 1 0 1 1\n    ---------------\n    = 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nBinary numbers can also be multiplied with bits after a [[binary point]]:\n\n                1 0 1 . 1 0 1     {{varserif|A}} (5.625 in decimal)\n              \u00d7 1 1 0 . 0 1       {{varserif|B}} (6.25  in decimal)\n              -------------------\n                    1 . 0 1 1 0 1   \u2190 Corresponds to a 'one' in {{varserif|B}}\n      +           0 0 . 0 0 0 0     \u2190 Corresponds to a 'zero' in {{varserif|B}}\n      +         0 0 0 . 0 0 0\n      +       1 0 1 1 . 0 1\n      +     1 0 1 1 0 . 1\n      ---------------------------\n      =   1 0 0 0 1 1 . 0 0 1 0 1  (35.15625 in decimal)\n\nSee also [[Booth's multiplication algorithm]].\n\n====Multiplication table====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" |\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" | 0\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" | 1\n|-\n! 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|-\n! 1\n| 0\n| 1\n|}\n\nThe binary multiplication table is the same as the [[Logical conjunction#Truth table|truth table]] of the [[logical conjunction]] operation <math>\\land</math>.\n\n===Division===\n{{Main|Long division#Binary division}}\n{{See also|Division algorithm#Integer division (unsigned) with remainder}}\n\n[[Long division]] in binary is again similar to its decimal counterpart.\n\nIn the example below, the [[divisor]] is 101<sub>2</sub>, or 5 in decimal, while the [[Division (mathematics)|dividend]] is 11011<sub>2</sub>, or 27 in decimal. The procedure is the same as that of decimal [[long division]]; here, the divisor 101<sub>2</sub> goes into the first three digits 110<sub>2</sub> of the dividend one time, so a \"1\" is written on the top line. This result is multiplied by the divisor, and subtracted from the first three digits of the dividend; the next digit (a \"1\") is included to obtain a new three-digit sequence:\n\n               1\n         ___________\n 1 0 1   ) 1 1 0 1 1\n         \u2212 1 0 1\n           -----\n           0 0 1\n\nThe procedure is then repeated with the new sequence, continuing until the digits in the dividend have been exhausted:\n\n              1 0 1\n        ___________\n 1 0 1  ) 1 1 0 1 1\n        \u2212 1 0 1\n          -----\n              1 1 1\n          \u2212   1 0 1\n              -----\n                1 0\n\nThus, the [[quotient]] of 11011<sub>2</sub> divided by 101<sub>2</sub> is 101<sub>2</sub>, as shown on the top line, while the remainder, shown on the bottom line, is 10<sub>2</sub>. In decimal, this corresponds to the fact that 27 divided by 5 is 5, with a remainder of 2.\n\nAside from long division, one can also devise the procedure so as to allow for over-subtracting from the partial remainder at each iteration, thereby leading to alternative methods which are less systematic, but more flexible as a result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|title=The Definitive Higher Math Guide to Long Division and Its Variants \u2014 for Integers|date=2019-02-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\n===Square root===\nThe process of taking a binary square root digit by digit is the same as for a decimal square root and is explained [[Methods of computing square roots#Binary numeral system (base 2)|here]].

When a string of binary symbols is manipulated in this way, it is called a [[bitwise operation]]; the logical operators [[Logical conjunction|AND]], [[Logical disjunction|OR]], and [[Exclusive disjunction|XOR]] may be performed on corresponding bits in two binary numerals provided as input. The logical [[Negation|NOT]] operation may be performed on individual bits in a single binary numeral provided as input. Sometimes, such operations may be used as arithmetic short-cuts, and may have other computational benefits as well.  For example, an [[arithmetic shift]] left of a binary number is the equivalent of multiplication by a (positive, integral) power of 2.\n\n==Conversion to and from other numeral systems==\n\n===Decimal===\n[[File:Decimal to Binary Conversion.gif|alt=|frame|Conversion of (357)<sub>10</sub> to binary notation results in (101100101)]]\nTo convert from a base-10 [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] to its base-2 (binary) equivalent, the number is [[division by two|divided by two]]. The remainder is the [[least-significant bit]]. The quotient is again divided by two; its remainder becomes the next least significant bit. This process repeats until a quotient of one is reached. The sequence of remainders (including the final quotient of one) forms the binary value, as each remainder must be either zero or one when dividing by two. For example, (357)<sub>10</sub> is expressed as (101100101)<sub>2.</sub><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chalkstreet.com/aptipedia/knowledgebase/base-system/|title=Base System|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nConversion from base-2 to base-10 simply inverts the preceding algorithm. The bits of the binary number are used one by one, starting with the most significant (leftmost) bit. Beginning with the value 0, the prior value is doubled, and the next bit is then added to produce the next value. This can be organized in a multi-column table. For example, to convert 10010101101<sub>2</sub> to decimal:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Prior value\n!\u00d7 2 +\n!Next bit\n!Next value\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|0 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 1\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 2\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|2 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 4\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|4 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 9\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|9 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 18\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|18 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 37\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|37 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 74\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|74 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 149\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|149 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 299\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|299 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 598\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|598 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = '''1197'''\n|}\n\nThe result is 1197<sub>10</sub>. The first Prior Value of 0 is simply an initial decimal value. This method is an application of the [[Horner scheme]].\n\n{|\n!

Decimal&nbsp;\n| 1\u00d72<sup>10</sup> + || 0\u00d72<sup>9</sup> + || 0\u00d72<sup>8</sup> + || 1\u00d72<sup>7</sup> + || 0\u00d72<sup>6</sup> + || 1\u00d72<sup>5</sup> + || 0\u00d72<sup>4</sup> + || 1\u00d72<sup>3</sup> + || 1\u00d72<sup>2</sup> + || 0\u00d72<sup>1</sup> + || 1\u00d72<sup>0</sup> = || 1197\n|}\n\nThe fractional parts of a number are converted with similar methods. They are again based on the equivalence of shifting with doubling or halving.\n\nIn a fractional binary number such as 0.11010110101<sub>2</sub>, the first digit is <math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\end{matrix}</math>, the second <math>\\begin{matrix} (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\end{matrix}</math>, etc. So if there is a 1 in the first place after the decimal, then the number is at least <math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\end{matrix}</math>, and vice versa. Double that number is at least 1. This suggests the algorithm: Repeatedly double the number to be converted, record if the result is at least 1, and then throw away the integer part.\n\nFor example, <math>\\begin{matrix} (\\frac{1}{3}) \\end{matrix}</math><sub>10</sub>, in binary, is:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Converting!!Result\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{3} \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{3} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{3} < 1 \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.0\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{2}{3} \\times 2 = 1\\frac{1}{3} \\ge 1 \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.01\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{3} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{3} < 1 \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.010\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{2}{3} \\times 2 = 1\\frac{1}{3} \\ge 1 \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.0101\n|}\n\nThus the repeating decimal fraction 0.{{overline|3}}... is equivalent to the repeating binary fraction 0.{{overline|01}}... .\n\nOr for example, 0.1<sub>10</sub>, in binary, is:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Converting                !! Result\n|-\n|          '''0.1'''        || 0.\n|-\n|0.1 \u00d7 2 = '''0.2''' < 1    || 0.0\n|-\n|0.2 \u00d7 2 = '''0.4''' < 1    || 0.00\n|-\n|0.4 \u00d7 2 = '''0.8''' < 1    || 0.000\n|-\n|0.8 \u00d7 2 = '''1.6''' \u2265 1 || 0.0001\n|-\n|0.6 \u00d7 2 = '''1.2''' \u2265 1 || 0.00011\n|-\n|0.2 \u00d7 2 = '''0.4''' < 1    || 0.000110\n|-\n|0.4 \u00d7 2 = '''0.8''' < 1    || 0.0001100\n|-\n|0.8 \u00d7 2 = '''1.6''' \u2265 1 || 0.00011001\n|-\n|0.6 \u00d7 2 = '''1.2''' \u2265 1 || 0.000110011\n|-\n|0.2 \u00d7 2 = '''0.4''' < 1    || 0.0001100110\n|}\n\nThis is also a repeating binary fraction 0.0{{overline|0011}}... .  It may come as a surprise that terminating decimal fractions can have repeating expansions in binary. It is for this reason that many are surprised to discover that 0.1 + ... + 0.1, (10 additions) differs from 1 in [[floating point arithmetic]]. In fact, the only binary fractions with terminating expansions are of the form of an integer divided by a power of 2, which 1/10 is not.\n\nThe final conversion is from binary to decimal fractions. The only difficulty arises with repeating fractions, but otherwise the method is to shift the fraction to an integer, convert it as above, and then divide by the appropriate power of two in the decimal base. For example:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nx & = & 1100&.1\\overline{01110}\\ldots \\\\\nx\\times 2^6 & = & 1100101110&.\\overline{01110}\\ldots \\\\\nx\\times 2 & = & 11001&.\\overline{01110}\\ldots \\\\\nx\\times(2^6-2) & = & 1100010101 \\\\\nx & = & 1100010101/111110 \\\\\nx & = & (789/62)_{10}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAnother way of converting from binary to decimal, often quicker for a person familiar with [[hexadecimal]], is to do so indirectly\u2014first converting (<math>x</math> in binary) into (<math>x</math> in hexadecimal) and then converting (<math>x</math> in hexadecimal) into (<math>x</math> in decimal).\n\nFor very large numbers, these simple methods are inefficient because they perform a large number of multiplications or divisions where one operand is very large. A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm is more effective asymptotically: given a binary number, it is divided by 10<sup>''k''</sup>, where ''k'' is chosen so that the quotient roughly equals the remainder; then each of these pieces is converted to decimal and the two are [[Concatenation|concatenated]]. Given a decimal number, it can be split into two pieces of about the same size, each of which is converted to binary, whereupon the first converted piece is multiplied by 10<sup>''k''</sup> and added to the second converted piece, where ''k'' is the number of decimal digits in the second, least-significant piece before conversion.\n\n===Hexadecimal===\n{{Main|Hexadecimal}}\n{{Hexadecimal table}}\nBinary may be converted to and from hexadecimal more easily. This is because the [[radix]] of the hexadecimal system (16) is a power of the radix of the binary system (2). More specifically, 16 = 2<sup>4</sup>, so it takes four digits of binary to represent one digit of hexadecimal, as shown in the adjacent table.\n\nTo convert a hexadecimal number into its binary equivalent, simply substitute the corresponding binary digits:\n\n:3A<sub>16</sub> = 0011 1010<sub>2</sub>\n:E7<sub>16</sub> = 1110 0111<sub>2</sub>\n\nTo convert a binary number into its hexadecimal equivalent, divide it into groups of four bits. If the number of bits isn't a multiple of four, simply insert extra '''0''' bits at the left (called [[Padding (cryptography)#Bit padding|padding]]). For example:\n\n:1010010<sub>2</sub> = 0101 0010 grouped with padding = 52<sub>16</sub>\n:11011101<sub>2</sub> = 1101 1101 grouped = DD<sub>16</sub>\n\nTo convert a hexadecimal number into its decimal equivalent, multiply the decimal equivalent of each hexadecimal digit by the corresponding power of 16 and add the resulting values:\n\n:C0E7<sub>16</sub> = (12 \u00d7 16<sup>3</sup>) + (0 \u00d7 16<sup>2</sup>) + (14 \u00d7 16<sup>1</sup>) + (7 \u00d7 16<sup>0</sup>) = (12 \u00d7 4096) + (0 \u00d7 256) + (14 \u00d7 16) + (7 \u00d7 1) = 49,383<sub>10</sub>\n\n===Octal===\n{{Main|Octal}}\nBinary is also easily converted to the [[octal]] numeral system, since octal uses a radix of 8, which is a [[power of two]] (namely, 2<sup>3</sup>, so it takes exactly three binary digits to represent an octal digit). The correspondence between octal and binary numerals is the same as for the first eight digits of [[hexadecimal]] in the table above. Binary 000 is equivalent to the octal digit 0, binary 111 is equivalent to octal 7, and so forth.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Octal!!Binary\n|-\n| 0 || 000\n|-\n| 1 || 001\n|-\n| 2 || 010\n|-\n| 3 || 011\n|-\n| 4 || 100\n|-\n| 5 || 101\n|-\n| 6 || 110\n|-\n| 7 || 111\n|}\n\nConverting from octal to binary proceeds in the same fashion as it does for [[hexadecimal]]:\n\n:65<sub>8</sub> = 110 101<sub>2</sub>\n:17<sub>8</sub> = 001 111<sub>2</sub>\n\nAnd from binary to octal:\n\n:101100<sub>2</sub> = 101 100<sub>2</sub> grouped = 54<sub>8</sub>\n:10011<sub>2</sub> = 010 011<sub>2</sub> grouped with padding = 23<sub>8</sub>\n\nAnd from octal to decimal:\n\n:65<sub>8</sub> = (6 \u00d7 8<sup>1</sup>) + (5 \u00d7 8<sup>0</sup>) = (6 \u00d7 8) + (5 \u00d7 1) = 53<sub>10</sub>\n:127<sub>8</sub> = (1 \u00d7 8<sup>2</sup>) + (2 \u00d7 8<sup>1</sup>) + (7 \u00d7 8<sup>0</sup>) = (1 \u00d7 64) + (2 \u00d7 8) + (7 \u00d7 1) = 87<sub>10</sub>\n\n==Representing real numbers==<!-- This section is linked from [[Chaitin's constant]] -->\nNon-integers can be represented by using negative powers, which are set off from the other digits by means of a [[radix point]] (called a [[decimal point]] in the decimal system). For example, the binary number 11.01<sub>2</sub> means:\n\n:{|\n|'''1''' \u00d7 2<sup>1</sup>  || (1 \u00d7 2 = '''2''')           || plus\n|-\n|'''1''' \u00d7 2<sup>0</sup>  || (1 \u00d7 1 = '''1''')           || plus\n|-\n|'''0''' \u00d7 2<sup>\u22121</sup> || (0 \u00d7 {{frac|2}} = '''0''')    || plus\n|-\n|'''1''' \u00d7 2<sup>\u22122</sup> || (1 \u00d7 {{frac|4}} = '''0.25''')\n|}\n\nFor a total of 3.25 decimal.\n\nAll [[dyadic fraction|dyadic rational numbers]] <math>\\frac{p}{2^a}</math> have a ''terminating'' binary numeral\u2014the binary representation has a finite number of terms after the radix point.  Other [[rational numbers]] have binary representation, but instead of terminating, they ''recur'', with a finite sequence of digits repeating indefinitely. For instance\n\n:<math>\\frac{1_{10}}{3_{10}} = \\frac{1_2}{11_2} = 0.01010101\\overline{01}\\ldots\\,_2 </math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{12_{10}}{17_{10}} = \\frac{1100_2}{10001_2} = 0.10110100 10110100\\overline{10110100}\\ldots\\,_2 </math>\n\nThe phenomenon that the binary representation of any rational is either terminating or recurring also occurs in other radix-based numeral systems.  See, for instance, the explanation in [[decimal]].  Another similarity is the existence of alternative representations for any terminating representation, relying on the fact that [[0.111... = 1 (binary)|0.111111...]] is the sum of the [[geometric series]] 2<sup>\u22121</sup> + 2<sup>\u22122</sup> + 2<sup>\u22123</sup> + ... which is 1.\n\nBinary numerals which neither terminate nor recur represent [[irrational number]]s.  For instance,\n* 0.10100100010000100000100... does have a pattern, but it is not a fixed-length recurring pattern, so the number is irrational\n* 1.0110101000001001111001100110011111110... is the binary representation of <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, the [[square root of 2]], another irrational. It has no discernible pattern.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Binary-coded decimal]]\n* [[Finger binary]]\n* [[IEEE 754]]\n* [[Binary code]]\n* [[Linear feedback shift register]]\n* [[Offset binary]]\n* [[Gray code]]\n* [[Reduction of summands]]\n* [[Redundant binary representation]]\n* [[Quibinary]]\n* [[Repeating decimal]]\n* [[Two's complement]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last1=Sanchez |first1=Julio |last2=Canton |first2=Maria P. |year=2007 |title=Microcontroller programming: the microchip PIC |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=CRC Press |page=37 |isbn=978-0-8493-7189-9}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Redmond|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Hon|first2=Tze-Ki|title=Teaching the I Ching|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976681-9}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--=========================================================\n\n  There are MANY web pages devoted to binary numbers.

Each digit is referred to as a [[bit]]. Because of its straightforward implementation in [[Digital electronics|digital electronic circuitry]] using [[logic gate]]s, the binary system is used by almost all modern [[computer|computers and computer-based devices]].\n\n==History==\nThe modern binary number system was studied in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries by [[Thomas Harriot]], [[Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. However, systems related to binary numbers have appeared earlier in multiple cultures including ancient Egypt, China, and India. Leibniz was specifically inspired by the Chinese [[I Ching]].\n\n===Egypt===\n{{See also|Ancient Egyptian mathematics}}\n[[File:Oudjat.SVG|thumb|240px|left|Arithmetic values thought to have been represented by parts of the Eye of Horus]]\nThe scribes of ancient Egypt used two different systems for their fractions, [[Egyptian fraction]]s (not related to the binary number system) and [[Eye of Horus|Horus-Eye]] fractions (so called because many historians of mathematics believe that the symbols used for this system could be arranged to form the eye of [[Horus]], although this has been disputed).<ref>{{citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Mathematics|editor1-first=Eleanor|editor1-last=Robson|editor1-link=Eleanor Robson|editor2-first=Jacqueline|editor2-last=Stedall|editor2-link=Jackie Stedall|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199213122|page=790|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZMSDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA790|contribution=Myth No. 2: the Horus eye fractions}}</ref> Horus-Eye fractions are a binary numbering system for fractional quantities of grain, liquids, or other measures, in which a fraction of a [[hekat]] is expressed as a sum of the binary fractions 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, and 1/64. Early forms of this system can be found in documents from the [[Fifth Dynasty of Egypt]], approximately 2400 BC, and its fully developed hieroglyphic form dates to the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]], approximately 1200 BC.<ref>{{citation|title=Numerical Notation: A Comparative History|first=Stephen|last=Chrisomalis|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521878180|pages=42\u201343|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ux--OWgWvBQC&pg=PA42}}.</ref>\n\nThe method used for [[ancient Egyptian multiplication]] is also closely related to binary numbers. In this method, multiplying one number by a second is performed by a sequence of steps in which a value (initially the first of the two numbers) is either doubled or has the first number added back into it; the order in which these steps are to be performed is given by the binary representation of the second number. This method can be seen in use, for instance, in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]], which dates to around 1650 BC.<ref>{{citation|title=How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years|first=Peter Strom|last=Rudman|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2007|isbn=9781615921768|pages=135\u2013136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtcQq4RUfkUC&pg=PA135}}.</ref>\n\n===China===\n[[File:Bagua-name-earlier.svg|thumb|160px|Daoist Bagua]]\nThe [[I Ching]] dates from the 9th century BC in China.<ref name=\"HackerMoore2002\">{{cite book|author1=Edward Hacker|author2=Steve Moore|author3=Lorraine Patsco|title=I Ching: An Annotated Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S5hLpfFiMCQC&pg=PR13|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93969-0|page=13}}</ref> The binary notation in the ''I Ching'' is used to interpret its [[quaternary numeral system|quaternary]]  [[I Ching divination|divination]] technique.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|p=227}}\n\nIt is based on taoistic duality of [[yin and yang]].<ref name=\"scientific\">{{cite book|author1=Jonathan Shectman|title=Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries of the 18th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsbChdIiflsC&pg=PA29|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|isbn=978-0-313-32015-6|page=29}}</ref>\n[[Ba gua|eight trigrams (Bagua)]] and a set of [[Hexagram (I Ching)|64 hexagrams (\"sixty-four\" gua)]], analogous to the three-bit and six-bit binary numerals, were in use at least as early as the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou Dynasty of ancient China]].<ref name=\"HackerMoore2002\"/>\n\nThe [[Song Dynasty]] scholar [[Shao Yong]] (1011\u20131077) rearranged the hexagrams in a format that resembles modern binary numbers, although he did not intend his arrangement to be used mathematically.{{sfnp|Redmond|Hon|2014|p=227}} Viewing the [[least significant bit]] on top of single hexagrams in [http://www.biroco.com/yijing/sequence.htm Shao Yong's square] and reading along rows either from bottom right to top left with solid lines as 0 and broken lines as 1 or from top left to bottom right with solid lines as 1 and broken lines as 0 hexagrams can be interpreted as sequence from 0 to 63.\n<ref name=\"Shao Yong\u2019s \u201dXiantian Tu\u2018\u2018\">{{cite book|last1=Zhonglian|first1=Shi|last2=Wenzhao|first2=Li|last3=Poser|first3=Hans|title=Leibniz' Binary System and Shao Yong's \"Xiantian Tu'' in :Das Neueste \u00fcber China: G.W.

When written, binary numerals are often subscripted, prefixed or suffixed in order to indicate their base, or radix.

For example, the binary numeral 100 is pronounced ''one zero zero'', rather than ''one hundred'', to make its binary nature explicit, and for purposes of correctness. Since the binary numeral 100 represents the value four, it would be confusing to refer to the numeral as ''one hundred'' (a word that represents a completely different value, or amount). Alternatively, the binary numeral 100 can be read out as \"four\" (the correct ''value''), but this does not make its binary nature explicit.\n\n==Counting in binary==\n{{Aligned table |class=wikitable |cols=2\n|style=float:right; |rowstyle=text-align:right;\n|row1header=y\n| Decimal<br>number | Binary<br>number\n|  0 |    0\n|  1 |    1\n|  2 |   10\n|  3 |   11\n|  4 |  100\n|  5 |  101\n|  6 |  110\n|  7 |  111\n|  8 | 1000\n|  9 | 1001\n| 10 | 1010\n| 11 | 1011\n| 12 | 1100\n| 13 | 1101\n| 14 | 1110\n| 15 | 1111\n}}\nCounting in binary is similar to counting in any other number system. Beginning with a single digit, counting proceeds through each symbol, in increasing order. Before examining binary counting, it is useful to briefly discuss the more familiar [[decimal]] counting system as a frame of reference.\n\n===Decimal counting===\n[[Decimal]] counting uses the ten symbols ''0'' through ''9''.  Counting begins with the incremental substitution of the least significant digit (rightmost digit) which is often called the ''first digit''. When the available symbols for this position are exhausted, the least significant digit is reset to ''0'', and the next digit of higher significance (one position to the left) is incremented (''overflow''), and incremental substitution of the low-order digit resumes. This method of reset and overflow is repeated for each digit of significance. Counting progresses as follows:\n\n:000, 001, 002, ... 007, 008, 009, (rightmost digit is reset to zero, and the digit to its left is incremented)\n:0'''1'''0, 011, 012, ...\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...\n:090, 091, 092, ... 097, 098, 099, (rightmost two digits are reset to zeroes, and next digit is incremented)\n:'''1'''00, 101, 102, ...\n\n===Binary counting===\n[[File:Binary counter.gif|thumb|This counter shows how to count in binary from numbers zero through thirty-one.]]\nBinary counting follows the same procedure, except that only the two symbols ''0'' and ''1'' are available. Thus, after a digit reaches 1 in binary, an increment resets it to 0 but also causes an increment of the next digit to the left:\n\n:0000,\n:000'''1''', (rightmost digit starts over, and next digit is incremented)\n:00'''1'''0, 0011, (rightmost two digits start over, and next digit is incremented)\n:0'''1'''00, 0101, 0110, 0111, (rightmost three digits start over, and the next digit is incremented)\n:'''1'''000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111 ...\n\nIn the binary system, each digit represents an increasing power of 2, with the rightmost digit representing 2<sup>0</sup>, the next representing 2<sup>1</sup>, then 2<sup>2</sup>, and so on. The value of a binary number is the sum of the powers of 2 represented by each \"1\"\u202fdigit. For example, the binary number 100101 is converted to decimal form as follows:\n\n:100101<sub>2</sub> = [ ( '''1''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>5</sup> ] + [ ( '''0''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>4</sup> ] + [ ( '''0''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>3</sup> ] + [ ( '''1''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>2</sup> ] + [ ( '''0''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>1</sup> ] + [ ( '''1''' ) \u00d7 2<sup>0</sup> ]\n\n:100101<sub>2</sub> = [ '''1''' \u00d7 32 ] + [ '''0''' \u00d7 16 ] + [ '''0''' \u00d7 8 ] + [ '''1''' \u00d7 4 ] + [ '''0''' \u00d7 2 ] + [ '''1''' \u00d7 1 ]\n\n:'''100101<sub>2</sub> = 37<sub>10</sub>'''\n\n==Fractions==\n\nFractions in binary arithmetic terminate only if [[2 (number)|2]]  is the only [[prime factor]] in the [[denominator]]. As a result, 1/10 does not have a finite binary representation ('''10''' has prime factors '''2''' and '''5'''). This causes 10 \u00d7 0.1 not to precisely equal 1 in [[floating-point arithmetic]]. As an example, to interpret the binary expression for 1/3 = .010101..., this means: 1/3 = 0 \u00d7 '''2<sup>\u22121</sup>''' + 1 \u00d7 '''2<sup>\u22122</sup>''' + 0 \u00d7 '''2<sup>\u22123</sup>''' +  1 \u00d7 '''2<sup>\u22124</sup>''' + ... = 0.3125 + ... An exact value cannot be found with a sum of a finite number of inverse powers of two, the zeros and ones in the binary representation of 1/3 alternate forever.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on binary numerals.\n\n===Addition===\n{{main | Adder (electronics)}}\n[[Image:Half Adder.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|The [[circuit diagram]] for a binary [[Adder (electronics)|half adder]], which adds two bits together, producing sum and carry bits]]\n\nThe simplest arithmetic operation in binary is addition. Adding two single-digit binary numbers is relatively simple, using a form of carrying:\n\n:0 + 0 \u2192 0\n:0 + 1 \u2192 1\n:1 + 0 \u2192 1\n:1 + 1 \u2192 0, carry 1 (since 1 + 1 = 2 = 0 + (1 \u00d7 2<sup>1</sup>)  )\nAdding two \"1\" digits produces a digit \"0\", while 1 will have to be added to the next column. This is similar to what happens in decimal when certain single-digit numbers are added together; if the result equals or exceeds the value of the radix (10), the digit to the left is incremented:\n\n:5 + 5 \u2192 0, carry 1 (since 5 + 5 = 10 = 0 + (1 \u00d7 10<sup>1</sup>)  )\n:7 + 9 \u2192 6, carry 1 (since 7 + 9 = 16 = 6 + (1 \u00d7 10<sup>1</sup>)  )\n\nThis is known as ''carrying''. When the result of an addition exceeds the value of a digit, the procedure is to \"carry\" the excess amount divided by the radix (that is, 10/10) to the left, adding it to the next positional value. This is correct since the next position has a weight that is higher by a factor equal to the radix. Carrying works the same way in binary:\n\n   {{brown|1 1 1 1 1    (carried digits)}}\n     0 1 1 0 1\n +   1 0 1 1 1\n -------------\n = 1 0 0 1 0 0 = 36\n\nIn this example, two numerals are being added together: 01101<sub>2</sub> (13<sub>10</sub>) and 10111<sub>2</sub> (23<sub>10</sub>). The top row shows the carry bits used. Starting in the rightmost column, 1 + 1 = 10<sub>2</sub>. The 1 is carried to the left, and the 0 is written at the bottom of the rightmost column. The second column from the right is added: 1 + 0 + 1 = 10<sub>2</sub> again; the 1 is carried, and 0 is written at the bottom. The third column: 1 + 1 + 1 = 11<sub>2</sub>. This time, a 1 is carried, and a 1 is written in the bottom row. Proceeding like this gives the final answer 100100<sub>2</sub> (36 decimal).\n\nWhen computers must add two numbers, the rule that:\nx [[Exclusive or|xor]] y = (x + y) [[Modulo operation|mod]] 2\nfor any two bits x and y allows for very fast calculation, as well.\n\n====Long carry method====\nA simplification for many binary addition problems is the [[Long Carry Method]] or [[Brookhouse Method of Binary Addition]]. This method is generally useful in any binary addition in which one of the numbers contains a long \"string\" of ones. It is based on the simple premise that under the binary system, when given a \"string\" of digits composed entirely of {{varserif|n}} ones (''where:'' {{varserif|n}} is any integer length), adding 1 will result in the number 1 followed by a string of {{var|n}} zeros. That concept follows, logically, just as in the decimal system, where adding 1 to a string of {{varserif|n}} 9s will result in the number 1 followed by a string of {{var|n}} 0s:\n\n      Binary                        Decimal\n     1 1 1 1 1     likewise        9 9 9 9 9\n  +          1                  +          1\n   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014                   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n   1 0 0 0 0 0                   1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSuch long strings are quite common in the binary system.  From that one finds that large binary numbers can be added using two simple steps, without excessive carry operations. In the following example, two numerals are being added together: 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0<sub>2</sub> (958<sub>10</sub>) and 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1<sub>2</sub> (691<sub>10</sub>), using the traditional carry method on the left, and the long carry method on the right:\n\n Traditional Carry Method                       Long Carry Method\n                                 vs.\n   {{brown|1 1 1   1 1 1 1 1      (carried digits)   1 \u2190     1 \u2190}}            carry the 1 until it is one digit past the \"string\" below\n     1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0                       <s>1 1 1</s> 0 <s>1 1 1 1 1</s> 0  cross out the \"string\",\n +   1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1                   +   1 0 <s>1</s> 0 1 1 0 0 <s>1</s> 1  and cross out the digit that was added to it\n \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014                    \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n = 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1                     1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1\n\nThe top row shows the carry bits used. Instead of the standard carry from one column to the next, the lowest-ordered \"1\" with a \"1\" in the corresponding place value beneath it may be added and a \"1\" may be carried to one digit past the end of the series.  The \"used\" numbers must be crossed off, since they are already added. Other long strings may likewise be cancelled using the same technique. Then, simply add together any remaining digits normally. Proceeding in this manner gives the final answer of 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1<sub>2</sub> (1649<sub>10</sub>).  In our simple example using small numbers, the traditional carry method required eight carry operations, yet the long carry method required only two, representing a substantial reduction of effort.\n\n====Addition table====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" |\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" | 0\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" | 1\n|-\n! 0\n| 0\n| 1\n|-\n! 1\n| 1\n| 10\n|}\n\nThe binary addition table is similar, but not the same, as the [[Logical disjunction#Truth table|truth table]] of the [[logical disjunction]] operation <math>\\lor</math>. The difference is that <math>1</math><math>\\lor </math><math>1=1</math>, while <math>1+1=10</math>.\n\n=== Subtraction ===\n{{further|signed number representations|two's complement}}\n\n[[Subtraction]] works in much the same way:\n\n:0 \u2212 0 \u2192 0\n:0 \u2212 1 \u2192 1, borrow 1\n:1 \u2212 0 \u2192 1\n:1 \u2212 1 \u2192 0\nSubtracting a \"1\" digit from a \"0\" digit produces the digit \"1\", while 1 will have to be subtracted from the next column. This is known as ''borrowing''. The principle is the same as for carrying. When the result of a subtraction is less than 0, the least possible value of a digit, the procedure is to \"borrow\" the deficit divided by the radix (that is, 10/10) from the left, subtracting it from the next positional value.\n\n     *   * * *   (starred columns are borrowed from)\n   1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n \u2212     1 0 1 1 1\n ----------------\n = 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\n\n   *             (starred columns are borrowed from)\n   1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n -   1 0 1 0 1 1\n ----------------\n = 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nSubtracting a positive number is equivalent to ''adding'' a [[negative number]] of equal [[absolute value]]. Computers use [[signed number representations]] to handle negative numbers\u2014most commonly the [[two's complement]] notation. Such representations eliminate the need for a separate \"subtract\" operation. Using two's complement notation subtraction can be summarized by the following formula:\n\n'''A \u2212 B = A + not B + 1'''\n\n===Multiplication===<!-- This section is linked from [[Binary-coded decimal]] -->\n[[Multiplication]] in binary is similar to its decimal counterpart. Two numbers {{varserif|A}} and {{varserif|B}} can be multiplied by partial products: for each digit in {{varserif|B}}, the product of that digit in {{varserif|A}} is calculated and written on a new line, shifted leftward so that its rightmost digit lines up with the digit in {{varserif|B}} that was used. The sum of all these partial products gives the final result.\n\nSince there are only two digits in binary, there are only two possible outcomes of each partial multiplication:\n* If the digit in {{varserif|B}} is 0, the partial product is also 0\n* If the digit in {{varserif|B}} is 1, the partial product is equal to {{varserif|A}}\n\nFor example, the binary numbers 1011 and 1010 are multiplied as follows:\n\n            1 0 1 1   ({{varserif|A}})\n          \u00d7 1 0 1 0   ({{varserif|B}})\n          ---------\n            0 0 0 0   \u2190 Corresponds to the rightmost 'zero' in {{varserif|B}}\n    +     1 0 1 1     \u2190 Corresponds to the next 'one' in {{varserif|B}}\n    +   0 0 0 0\n    + 1 0 1 1\n    ---------------\n    = 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nBinary numbers can also be multiplied with bits after a [[binary point]]:\n\n                1 0 1 . 1 0 1     {{varserif|A}} (5.625 in decimal)\n              \u00d7 1 1 0 . 0 1       {{varserif|B}} (6.25  in decimal)\n              -------------------\n                    1 . 0 1 1 0 1   \u2190 Corresponds to a 'one' in {{varserif|B}}\n      +           0 0 . 0 0 0 0     \u2190 Corresponds to a 'zero' in {{varserif|B}}\n      +         0 0 0 . 0 0 0\n      +       1 0 1 1 . 0 1\n      +     1 0 1 1 0 . 1\n      ---------------------------\n      =   1 0 0 0 1 1 . 0 0 1 0 1  (35.15625 in decimal)\n\nSee also [[Booth's multiplication algorithm]].\n\n====Multiplication table====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" |\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" | 0\n! style=\"width:1.5em\" | 1\n|-\n! 0\n| 0\n| 0\n|-\n! 1\n| 0\n| 1\n|}\n\nThe binary multiplication table is the same as the [[Logical conjunction#Truth table|truth table]] of the [[logical conjunction]] operation <math>\\land</math>.\n\n===Division===\n{{Main|Long division#Binary division}}\n{{See also|Division algorithm#Integer division (unsigned) with remainder}}\n\n[[Long division]] in binary is again similar to its decimal counterpart.\n\nIn the example below, the [[divisor]] is 101<sub>2</sub>, or 5 in decimal, while the [[Division (mathematics)|dividend]] is 11011<sub>2</sub>, or 27 in decimal. The procedure is the same as that of decimal [[long division]]; here, the divisor 101<sub>2</sub> goes into the first three digits 110<sub>2</sub> of the dividend one time, so a \"1\" is written on the top line. This result is multiplied by the divisor, and subtracted from the first three digits of the dividend; the next digit (a \"1\") is included to obtain a new three-digit sequence:\n\n               1\n         ___________\n 1 0 1   ) 1 1 0 1 1\n         \u2212 1 0 1\n           -----\n           0 0 1\n\nThe procedure is then repeated with the new sequence, continuing until the digits in the dividend have been exhausted:\n\n              1 0 1\n        ___________\n 1 0 1  ) 1 1 0 1 1\n        \u2212 1 0 1\n          -----\n              1 1 1\n          \u2212   1 0 1\n              -----\n                1 0\n\nThus, the [[quotient]] of 11011<sub>2</sub> divided by 101<sub>2</sub> is 101<sub>2</sub>, as shown on the top line, while the remainder, shown on the bottom line, is 10<sub>2</sub>. In decimal, this corresponds to the fact that 27 divided by 5 is 5, with a remainder of 2.\n\nAside from long division, one can also devise the procedure so as to allow for over-subtracting from the partial remainder at each iteration, thereby leading to alternative methods which are less systematic, but more flexible as a result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|title=The Definitive Higher Math Guide to Long Division and Its Variants \u2014 for Integers|date=2019-02-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref>\n\n===Square root===\nThe process of taking a binary square root digit by digit is the same as for a decimal square root and is explained [[Methods of computing square roots#Binary numeral system (base 2)|here]].

When a string of binary symbols is manipulated in this way, it is called a [[bitwise operation]]; the logical operators [[Logical conjunction|AND]], [[Logical disjunction|OR]], and [[Exclusive disjunction|XOR]] may be performed on corresponding bits in two binary numerals provided as input. The logical [[Negation|NOT]] operation may be performed on individual bits in a single binary numeral provided as input. Sometimes, such operations may be used as arithmetic short-cuts, and may have other computational benefits as well.  For example, an [[arithmetic shift]] left of a binary number is the equivalent of multiplication by a (positive, integral) power of 2.\n\n==Conversion to and from other numeral systems==\n\n===Decimal===\n[[File:Decimal to Binary Conversion.gif|alt=|frame|Conversion of (357)<sub>10</sub> to binary notation results in (101100101)]]\nTo convert from a base-10 [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] to its base-2 (binary) equivalent, the number is [[division by two|divided by two]]. The remainder is the [[least-significant bit]]. The quotient is again divided by two; its remainder becomes the next least significant bit. This process repeats until a quotient of one is reached. The sequence of remainders (including the final quotient of one) forms the binary value, as each remainder must be either zero or one when dividing by two. For example, (357)<sub>10</sub> is expressed as (101100101)<sub>2.</sub><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chalkstreet.com/aptipedia/knowledgebase/base-system/|title=Base System|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nConversion from base-2 to base-10 simply inverts the preceding algorithm. The bits of the binary number are used one by one, starting with the most significant (leftmost) bit. Beginning with the value 0, the prior value is doubled, and the next bit is then added to produce the next value. This can be organized in a multi-column table. For example, to convert 10010101101<sub>2</sub> to decimal:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Prior value\n!\u00d7 2 +\n!Next bit\n!Next value\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|0 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 1\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|1 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 2\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|2 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 4\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|4 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 9\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|9 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 18\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|18 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 37\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|37 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 74\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|74 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 149\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|149 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = 299\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|299 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''0''' || = 598\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|598 ||\u00d7 2 +|| '''1''' || = '''1197'''\n|}\n\nThe result is 1197<sub>10</sub>. The first Prior Value of 0 is simply an initial decimal value. This method is an application of the [[Horner scheme]].\n\n{|\n! Binary&nbsp;\n| 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 1 ||\n|-\n!

They are again based on the equivalence of shifting with doubling or halving.\n\nIn a fractional binary number such as 0.11010110101<sub>2</sub>, the first digit is <math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\end{matrix}</math>, the second <math>\\begin{matrix} (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\end{matrix}</math>, etc. So if there is a 1 in the first place after the decimal, then the number is at least <math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\end{matrix}</math>, and vice versa. Double that number is at least 1. This suggests the algorithm: Repeatedly double the number to be converted, record if the result is at least 1, and then throw away the integer part.\n\nFor example, <math>\\begin{matrix} (\\frac{1}{3}) \\end{matrix}</math><sub>10</sub>, in binary, is:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Converting!!Result\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{3} \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{3} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{3} < 1 \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.0\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{2}{3} \\times 2 = 1\\frac{1}{3} \\ge 1 \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.01\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{3} \\times 2 = \\frac{2}{3} < 1 \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.010\n|-\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{2}{3} \\times 2 = 1\\frac{1}{3} \\ge 1 \\end{matrix}</math> || 0.0101\n|}\n\nThus the repeating decimal fraction 0.{{overline|3}}... is equivalent to the repeating binary fraction 0.{{overline|01}}... .\n\nOr for example, 0.1<sub>10</sub>, in binary, is:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Converting                !! Result\n|-\n|          '''0.1'''        || 0.\n|-\n|0.1 \u00d7 2 = '''0.2''' < 1    || 0.0\n|-\n|0.2 \u00d7 2 = '''0.4''' < 1    || 0.00\n|-\n|0.4 \u00d7 2 = '''0.8''' < 1    || 0.000\n|-\n|0.8 \u00d7 2 = '''1.6''' \u2265 1 || 0.0001\n|-\n|0.6 \u00d7 2 = '''1.2''' \u2265 1 || 0.00011\n|-\n|0.2 \u00d7 2 = '''0.4''' < 1    || 0.000110\n|-\n|0.4 \u00d7 2 = '''0.8''' < 1    || 0.0001100\n|-\n|0.8 \u00d7 2 = '''1.6''' \u2265 1 || 0.00011001\n|-\n|0.6 \u00d7 2 = '''1.2''' \u2265 1 || 0.000110011\n|-\n|0.2 \u00d7 2 = '''0.4''' < 1    || 0.0001100110\n|}\n\nThis is also a repeating binary fraction 0.0{{overline|0011}}... .  It may come as a surprise that terminating decimal fractions can have repeating expansions in binary. It is for this reason that many are surprised to discover that 0.1 + ... + 0.1, (10 additions) differs from 1 in [[floating point arithmetic]]. In fact, the only binary fractions with terminating expansions are of the form of an integer divided by a power of 2, which 1/10 is not.\n\nThe final conversion is from binary to decimal fractions. The only difficulty arises with repeating fractions, but otherwise the method is to shift the fraction to an integer, convert it as above, and then divide by the appropriate power of two in the decimal base. For example:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nx & = & 1100&.1\\overline{01110}\\ldots \\\\\nx\\times 2^6 & = & 1100101110&.\\overline{01110}\\ldots \\\\\nx\\times 2 & = & 11001&.\\overline{01110}\\ldots \\\\\nx\\times(2^6-2) & = & 1100010101 \\\\\nx & = & 1100010101/111110 \\\\\nx & = & (789/62)_{10}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAnother way of converting from binary to decimal, often quicker for a person familiar with [[hexadecimal]], is to do so indirectly\u2014first converting (<math>x</math> in binary) into (<math>x</math> in hexadecimal) and then converting (<math>x</math> in hexadecimal) into (<math>x</math> in decimal).\n\nFor very large numbers, these simple methods are inefficient because they perform a large number of multiplications or divisions where one operand is very large. A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm is more effective asymptotically: given a binary number, it is divided by 10<sup>''k''</sup>, where ''k'' is chosen so that the quotient roughly equals the remainder; then each of these pieces is converted to decimal and the two are [[Concatenation|concatenated]]. Given a decimal number, it can be split into two pieces of about the same size, each of which is converted to binary, whereupon the first converted piece is multiplied by 10<sup>''k''</sup> and added to the second converted piece, where ''k'' is the number of decimal digits in the second, least-significant piece before conversion.\n\n===Hexadecimal===\n{{Main|Hexadecimal}}\n{{Hexadecimal table}}\nBinary may be converted to and from hexadecimal more easily. This is because the [[radix]] of the hexadecimal system (16) is a power of the radix of the binary system (2). More specifically, 16 = 2<sup>4</sup>, so it takes four digits of binary to represent one digit of hexadecimal, as shown in the adjacent table.\n\nTo convert a hexadecimal number into its binary equivalent, simply substitute the corresponding binary digits:\n\n:3A<sub>16</sub> = 0011 1010<sub>2</sub>\n:E7<sub>16</sub> = 1110 0111<sub>2</sub>\n\nTo convert a binary number into its hexadecimal equivalent, divide it into groups of four bits. If the number of bits isn't a multiple of four, simply insert extra '''0''' bits at the left (called [[Padding (cryptography)#Bit padding|padding]]). For example:\n\n:1010010<sub>2</sub> = 0101 0010 grouped with padding = 52<sub>16</sub>\n:11011101<sub>2</sub> = 1101 1101 grouped = DD<sub>16</sub>\n\nTo convert a hexadecimal number into its decimal equivalent, multiply the decimal equivalent of each hexadecimal digit by the corresponding power of 16 and add the resulting values:\n\n:C0E7<sub>16</sub> = (12 \u00d7 16<sup>3</sup>) + (0 \u00d7 16<sup>2</sup>) + (14 \u00d7 16<sup>1</sup>) + (7 \u00d7 16<sup>0</sup>) = (12 \u00d7 4096) + (0 \u00d7 256) + (14 \u00d7 16) + (7 \u00d7 1) = 49,383<sub>10</sub>\n\n===Octal===\n{{Main|Octal}}\nBinary is also easily converted to the [[octal]] numeral system, since octal uses a radix of 8, which is a [[power of two]] (namely, 2<sup>3</sup>, so it takes exactly three binary digits to represent an octal digit). The correspondence between octal and binary numerals is the same as for the first eight digits of [[hexadecimal]] in the table above. Binary 000 is equivalent to the octal digit 0, binary 111 is equivalent to octal 7, and so forth.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Octal!!Binary\n|-\n| 0 || 000\n|-\n| 1 || 001\n|-\n| 2 || 010\n|-\n| 3 || 011\n|-\n| 4 || 100\n|-\n| 5 || 101\n|-\n| 6 || 110\n|-\n| 7 || 111\n|}\n\nConverting from octal to binary proceeds in the same fashion as it does for [[hexadecimal]]:\n\n:65<sub>8</sub> = 110 101<sub>2</sub>\n:17<sub>8</sub> = 001 111<sub>2</sub>\n\nAnd from binary to octal:\n\n:101100<sub>2</sub> = 101 100<sub>2</sub> grouped = 54<sub>8</sub>\n:10011<sub>2</sub> = 010 011<sub>2</sub> grouped with padding = 23<sub>8</sub>\n\nAnd from octal to decimal:\n\n:65<sub>8</sub> = (6 \u00d7 8<sup>1</sup>) + (5 \u00d7 8<sup>0</sup>) = (6 \u00d7 8) + (5 \u00d7 1) = 53<sub>10</sub>\n:127<sub>8</sub> = (1 \u00d7 8<sup>2</sup>) + (2 \u00d7 8<sup>1</sup>) + (7 \u00d7 8<sup>0</sup>) = (1 \u00d7 64) + (2 \u00d7 8) + (7 \u00d7 1) = 87<sub>10</sub>\n\n==Representing real numbers==<!-- This section is linked from [[Chaitin's constant]] -->\nNon-integers can be represented by using negative powers, which are set off from the other digits by means of a [[radix point]] (called a [[decimal point]] in the decimal system). For example, the binary number 11.01<sub>2</sub> means:\n\n:{|\n|'''1''' \u00d7 2<sup>1</sup>  || (1 \u00d7 2 = '''2''')           || plus\n|-\n|'''1''' \u00d7 2<sup>0</sup>  || (1 \u00d7 1 = '''1''')           || plus\n|-\n|'''0''' \u00d7 2<sup>\u22121</sup> || (0 \u00d7 {{frac|2}} = '''0''')    || plus\n|-\n|'''1''' \u00d7 2<sup>\u22122</sup> || (1 \u00d7 {{frac|4}} = '''0.25''')\n|}\n\nFor a total of 3.25 decimal.\n\nAll [[dyadic fraction|dyadic rational numbers]] <math>\\frac{p}{2^a}</math> have a ''terminating'' binary numeral\u2014the binary representation has a finite number of terms after the radix point.  Other [[rational numbers]] have binary representation, but instead of terminating, they ''recur'', with a finite sequence of digits repeating indefinitely. For instance\n\n:<math>\\frac{1_{10}}{3_{10}} = \\frac{1_2}{11_2} = 0.01010101\\overline{01}\\ldots\\,_2 </math>\n\n:<math>\\frac{12_{10}}{17_{10}} = \\frac{1100_2}{10001_2} = 0.10110100 10110100\\overline{10110100}\\ldots\\,_2 </math>\n\nThe phenomenon that the binary representation of any rational is either terminating or recurring also occurs in other radix-based numeral systems.  See, for instance, the explanation in [[decimal]].  Another similarity is the existence of alternative representations for any terminating representation, relying on the fact that [[0.111... = 1 (binary)|0.111111...]] is the sum of the [[geometric series]] 2<sup>\u22121</sup> + 2<sup>\u22122</sup> + 2<sup>\u22123</sup> + ... which is 1.\n\nBinary numerals which neither terminate nor recur represent [[irrational number]]s.  For instance,\n* 0.10100100010000100000100... does have a pattern, but it is not a fixed-length recurring pattern, so the number is irrational\n* 1.0110101000001001111001100110011111110... is the binary representation of <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, the [[square root of 2]], another irrational. It has no discernible pattern.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Binary-coded decimal]]\n* [[Finger binary]]\n* [[IEEE 754]]\n* [[Binary code]]\n* [[Linear feedback shift register]]\n* [[Offset binary]]\n* [[Gray code]]\n* [[Reduction of summands]]\n* [[Redundant binary representation]]\n* [[Quibinary]]\n* [[Repeating decimal]]\n* [[Two's complement]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last1=Sanchez |first1=Julio |last2=Canton |first2=Maria P. |year=2007 |title=Microcontroller programming: the microchip PIC |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=CRC Press |page=37 |isbn=978-0-8493-7189-9}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Redmond|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Hon|first2=Tze-Ki|title=Teaching the I Ching|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-976681-9}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--=========================================================\n\n  There are MANY web pages devoted to binary numbers.

{"title_page": "Libertarian National Convention", "text_new": "The '''Libertarian National Convention''' is held every two years by the [[Libertarian Party (United States)]] to choose members of the [[Libertarian National Committee]] (LNC), and to conduct other party business.  In presidential election years, the convention delegates enact a platform and nominate the Libertarian presidential and vice-presidential candidates who then face the nominees of other parties in the November general election.\n\nWhile most delegates to the [[Republican National Convention]] and the [[Democratic National Convention]] are tied to particular candidates, delegates to the Libertarian National Convention are free to choose, as was previously the case for the larger parties.  Accordingly, Libertarian National Conventions place less emphasis on festivities and spinning the press, though some of each may be found.

Julian's 1942 mural works are at also at the Upland Elementary School in Upland, California at the side of the school auditorium. Though faded, the murals are in decent shape.

Namely, they will have to have lived in Russia for the last 25 years (according to the old norm of 10 years), and the President can not become a person who has or ever had a foreign citizenship or residence permit in another country, while people who previously had citizenship of a country that or part of which became part of Russia will be able to run for president (this means that former Ukrainian citizens who lived in Crimea in 2014 and received Russian citizenship after the annexation of the peninsula will be able to run for president in the future, however, if under the old rule they could run already in these elections. Now they will not be able to do this until 2039).\n*Also, after the amendments, all former presidents will receive the status of senators for life, at the same time, they will have the right to refuse this status.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2020/02/11/822786-bivshie-prezidenti-status-senatorov|title=\u0411\u044b\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435

Columbia University Press</ref> The pagoda has varied forms that also include bell-shaped and pyramidal styles. In the Western context, there is no clear distinction between a stupa and a pagoda. In general, however, \"stupa\" is the term used for a Buddhist structure in India or [[Southeast Asia]] while \"pagoda\" refers to a building in East Asia which can be entered and which may be used for secular purposes. However, use of the term varies by region. For example, stupas in Burma tend to be referred to as \"pagodas.\"\n\nStupas were built in [[Sri Lanka]] soon after [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]] converted to Buddhism. The first stupa to be built was the [[Thuparamaya]]. Later, many more were built over the years, some like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], being one of the tallest ancient structures in the world.\n\n====Development of the Pagoda====\nThe Asian words for [[pagoda]] (''t\u0101'' in Chinese, ''t'ap'' in Korean, ''th\u00e1p'' in Vietnamese, ''t\u014d'' in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the [[Pali]] word for stupa, '''''thupa''''', the [[Sanskrit]] pronunciation being ''stupa''.<ref>Buddhist architecture, p.183</ref> In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second [[Kanishka stupa]] (4th century), is thought to be the precussor of the tower stupas in [[Turkestan]] and the Chinese pagodas such as [[Songyue Pagoda]] (523 CE).<ref name=\"Buddhist architecture, p.180\">Buddhist architecture, p.180</ref>\n\n==Notable stupas==\n[[File:Borobudur temple panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borobudur]] bell-shaped stupas.]]\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE.

The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment.

These surviving relics are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar.]]\n\n===Treasury===\nAll stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called ''tsatsa''s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\nThe number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the [[Kalachakra stupa]] in southern [[Spain]] contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n[[Jewellery]] and other \"precious\" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Tree of Life===\nAn important element in every stupa is the \"Tree of Life\". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way the stupa is charged, and starts to function.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Benefits===\nBuilding a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled.<ref name=\"SBEN\">{{cite web | title=Benefits Resulting from the Building of Stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/benefit.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the goal of Buddhism.<ref name=\"SBEN\"/>\n\nDestroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing.<ref name=\"LTR4\">Article: Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche: ''The Four Thoughts which Turn the Mind from Samsara.''

In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the [[brahmavihara|brahmavih\u0101ras]]: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Enlightenment Stupa===\n[[File:Ogoy Stupa 1 1600x1200.JPG|thumb|left|Enlightenment Stupa at [[Ogoy Island]], [[Russia]]]]\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of the Conquest of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]\", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in [[Bodh Gaya]], where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Many Doors===\nThis stupa is also known as the \"Stupa of Many Gates\". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near [[Sarnath]]. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the [[Four Noble Truths]], the Six [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas]].<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===\nAt 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the [[Tushita|Tu\u1e63ita Heaven]] where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in [[Sankassa]] in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Great Miracles===\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of Conquest of the [[Tirthika]]s\", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered ''maras'' and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichavi]] kingdom to commemorate the event.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Reconciliation===\nThis stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Complete Victory===\nThis stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months.

The first stupa to be built was the [[Thuparamaya]]. Later, many more were built over the years, some like the [[Jetavanaramaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], being one of the tallest ancient structures in the world.\n\n====Development of the Pagoda====\nThe Asian words for [[pagoda]] (''t\u0101'' in Chinese, ''t'ap'' in Korean, ''th\u00e1p'' in Vietnamese, ''t\u014d'' in Japanese) are all thought to derive from the [[Pali]] word for stupa, '''''thupa''''', the [[Sanskrit]] pronunciation being ''stupa''.<ref>Buddhist architecture, p.183</ref> In particular the type of the tower-like stupa, the last stage of Gandharan stupa development, visible in the second [[Kanishka stupa]] (4th century), is thought to be the precussor of the tower stupas in [[Turkestan]] and the Chinese pagodas such as [[Songyue Pagoda]] (523 CE).<ref name=\"Buddhist architecture, p.180\">Buddhist architecture, p.180</ref>\n\n==Notable stupas==\n[[File:Borobudur temple panorama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Borobudur]] bell-shaped stupas.]]\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the presence of Buddhist stupas dates to the late 4th century BCE. In India, [[Sanchi]], [[Sarnath]], [[Amaravathi Mahachaitya|Amaravati]] and [[Bharhut]] are among the oldest known stupas. The tallest is the [[Jetavanaramaya]] Stupa located in the ancient city of [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]] with a height of {{cvt|400|ft|order=flip||}}.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tallest-stupa|title=Tallest stupa|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-GB}}</ref> The [[Swat River|Swat Valley]] hosts a well-preserved stupa at Shingardar near [[Ghalegay]]; another stupa is located near [[Barikot]] and Dharmarajika-Taxila in [[Pakistan]]. In [[Sri Lanka]], the ancient city of [[Anuradhapura]] includes some of the tallest, most ancient and best preserved stupas in the world, such as [[Ruwanwelisaya]].\n\nThe most elaborate stupa is the 8th century [[Borobudur]] monument in [[Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The upper rounded terrace with rows of bell-shaped stupas contained Buddha images symbolizing [[Ar\u016bpajh\u0101na]], the sphere of formlessness. The main stupa itself is empty, symbolizing complete perfection of enlightenment. The main stupa is the crown part of the monument, while the base is a pyramidal structure elaborated with galleries adorned with bas relief scenes derived from Buddhist texts and depicting the life of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Borobudur's unique and significant architecture has been acknowledged by UNESCO as the largest Buddhist monument in the world.

Sometimes the type is chosen directly connected with events that have taken place in the area.<ref name=\"KUC\">{{cite web | title=Miracle Stupa - Stupa | url=http://www.stupa.pl/en_stupa.html | publisher=stupa.pl | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:EndAscetism.JPG|thumb|The sharing of the relics of the Buddha.

These surviving relics are now housed in [[Mandalay]], Myanmar.]]\n\n===Treasury===\nAll stupas contain a treasury filled with various objects. Small clay votive offerings called ''tsatsa''s in Tibetan fill most of the treasury. Creation of various types of tsatsas is a ceremony itself. Mantras written on paper are rolled into thin rolls and put into small clay stupas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> One layer of tsatsas is placed in the treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\nThe number of tsatsas required to completely fill the treasury depends on its size and the size of the tsatsa. For example, the [[Kalachakra stupa]] in southern [[Spain]] contains approximately 14,000 tsatsas.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n[[Jewellery]] and other \"precious\" objects are also placed in the treasury. It is not necessary that they be expensive, since it is the symbolic value that is important, not the market price.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is believed that the more objects placed into the stupa, the stronger the energy of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Tree of Life===\nAn important element in every stupa is the \"Tree of Life\". This is a wooden pole covered with gems and thousands of mantras; it is placed in the central channel of the stupa.<ref name=\"KUC\"/> It is positioned during a ceremony or initiation, where the participants hold colorful ribbons connected to the Tree of Life. Together, the participants make their most positive and powerful wishes, which are stored in the Tree of Life. In this way the stupa is charged, and starts to function.<ref name=\"KUC\"/>\n\n===Benefits===\nBuilding a stupa is considered extremely beneficial, leaving very positive [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] imprints in the mind. Future benefits from this action result in fortunate rebirths. Fortunate worldly benefits will be the result, such as being born into a rich family, having a beautiful body, a nice voice, being attractive, bringing joy to others, and having a long and happy life in which one's wishes are quickly fulfilled.<ref name=\"SBEN\">{{cite web | title=Benefits Resulting from the Building of Stupas | url=http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/benefit.htm | publisher=stupa.org | accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> On the absolute level, one will also be able quickly to reach [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]], the goal of Buddhism.<ref name=\"SBEN\"/>\n\nDestroying a stupa, on the other hand, is considered an extremely negative deed, similar to killing.<ref name=\"LTR4\">Article: Lopon Tsechu Rinpoche: ''The Four Thoughts which Turn the Mind from Samsara.''

There are eight different kinds of stupas in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], each referring to major events in the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s life.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Lotus Blossom Stupa===\nAlso known as \"Stupa of Heaped Lotuses\" or \"Birth of the Sugata Stupa,\" this stupa refers to the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]]. \"At birth Buddha took seven steps in each of the four directions\"<ref name=\"Beer\">Beer, Robert: The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs (2004) Serindia Publications Inc. {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}}</ref> (East, South, West and North). In each direction lotuses sprang up, symbolizing the [[brahmavihara|brahmavih\u0101ras]]: love, compassion, joy and equanimity. The base of this stupa is circular and has four steps, and it is decorated with lotus-petal designs. Occasionally, seven heaped lotus steps are constructed. These refer to the seven first steps of the Buddha.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Enlightenment Stupa===\n[[File:Ogoy Stupa 1 1600x1200.JPG|thumb|left|Enlightenment Stupa at [[Ogoy Island]], [[Russia]]]]\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of the Conquest of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]\", this stupa symbolizes the 35-year-old [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s attainment of enlightenment under the bodhi tree in [[Bodh Gaya]], where he conquered worldly temptations and attacks, manifesting in the form of Mara.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Many Doors===\nThis stupa is also known as the \"Stupa of Many Gates\". After reaching enlightenment, the Buddha taught his first students in a deer park near [[Sarnath]]. The series of doors on each side of the steps represents the first teachings: the [[Four Noble Truths]], the Six [[P\u0101ramit\u0101]]s, the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas]].<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Descent from the God Realm===\nAt 42 years of age, Buddha spent a summer retreat in the [[Tushita|Tu\u1e63ita Heaven]] where his mother had taken rebirth. In order to repay her kindness he taught the dharma to her rebirth. Local inhabitants built a stupa in [[Sankassa]] in order to commemorate this event. This type of stupa is characterized by having a central projection at each side containing a triple ladder or steps.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Great Miracles===\nAlso known as the \"Stupa of Conquest of the [[Tirthika]]s\", this stupa refers to various miracles performed by the Buddha when he was 50 years old. Legend claims that he overpowered ''maras'' and heretics by engaging them in intellectual arguments and also by performing miracles. This stupa was raised by the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichavi]] kingdom to commemorate the event.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Reconciliation===\nThis stupa commemorates the Buddha's resolution of a dispute among the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]. A stupa in this design was built in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], where the reconciliation occurred. It has four octagonal steps with equal sides.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Complete Victory===\nThis stupa commemorates Buddha's successful prolonging of his life by three months. It has only three steps, which are circular and unadorned.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n===Stupa of Nirvana===\nThis stupa refers to the death of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] when he was 80 years old. It symbolizes his complete absorption into the highest state of mind. It is bell-shaped and usually unornamented.<ref name=\"Beer\"/>\n\n==Kalachakra stupa==\n{{Main|Kalachakra stupa}}\n\nA ninth kind of stupa exists, the [[Kalachakra stupa]]. Its symbolism is not connected to events in the Buddha's life, but instead to the symbolism of the [[Kalachakra Tantra]], created to protect against negative energies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kalachakra Stupa |url=http://www.karmaguen.org/stupa_kalachakra_en.html |publisher=karmaguen.org |accessdate=2009-04-18 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205055317/http://www.karmaguen.org/stupa_kalachakra_en.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Swat District==\n[[Swat District]], Pakistan, is a small place with a large number of ancient stupas.

Its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products, and it directed the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors. It required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug's packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the United States Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary.  ''[[The Jungle]]'' by [[Upton Sinclair]], with its graphic and revolting descriptions of unsanitary conditions and unscrupulous practices rampant in the meatpacking industry,  was an inspirational piece that kept the public's attention on the important issue of unhygienic meat processing plants that later led to food inspection legislation.  Sinclair quipped, \"I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach,\" as outraged readers demanded and got the pure food law.<ref>Arlene F. Kantor, \"Upton Sinclair and the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906: 'I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach,'\" ''American Journal of Public Health'' 66.12 (1976): 1202-1205.</ref>\n\n==Historical significance==\nThe '''Pure Food and Drug Act''' of 1906 was a key piece of Progressive Era legislation, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt on the same day as the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]]. Enforcement of the Pure Food and Drug Act was assigned to the Bureau of Chemistry in the U.S. Department of Agriculture which was renamed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930. The [[Meat Inspection Act]] was assigned to what is now known as the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]], which remains in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first federal law regulating foods and drugs, the 1906 Act's reach was limited to foods and drugs moving in [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]]. Although the law drew upon many precedents, provisions, and legal experiments pioneered in individual states, the federal law defined \"misbranding\" and \"adulteration\" for the first time and prescribed penalties for each. The law recognized the U.S. Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary as standards authorities for drugs, but made no similar provision for federal food standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Origin/ucm054819.htm |title=The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement |author=Swann, Ph.D., John P |series=FDA History - Part I |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> The law was principally a \"truth in labeling\" law designed to raise standards in the food and drug industries and protect the reputations and pocketbooks of honest businessmen.\n\n==Particular drugs deemed addictive==\nUnder the law, drug labels, for example, had to list any of 10 ingredients that were deemed \"addictive\" and/or \"dangerous\" on the product label if they were present, and could not list them if they were not present. [[Alcohol]], [[morphine]], [[opium]], and [[cannabis]] were all included on the list of these \"addictive\" and/or \"dangerous\" drugs. The law also established a federal cadre of food and drug inspectors that one Southern opponent of the legislation criticized as \"a Trojan horse with a bellyful of inspectors and other employees.\"<ref>Young, James H.

The Chief Chemist of the Bureau of Chemistry, Dr. [[Harvey Washington Wiley]], captured the country's attention with his hygienic table studies, which began with a modest Congressional appropriation in 1902. The goal of the table trial was to study the human effects of common preservatives used in foods during a period of rapid changes in the food supply brought about by the need to feed cities and support an industrializing nation increasingly dependent on immigrant labor.  Wiley recruited young men to eat all their meals at a common table as he added increased \"doses\" of preservatives including borax, benzoate, formaldehyde, sulfites, and salicylates. The table trials captured the nation's fancy and were soon dubbed \"The Poison Squad\" by newspapers covering the story. The men soon adopted the motto \"Only the Brave dare eat the fare\" and at times the publicity given to the trials became a burden. Though many results of the trial came to be in dispute, there was no doubt that formaldehyde was dangerous and it disappeared quickly as a preservative. Wiley himself felt that he had found adverse effects from large doses of each of the preservatives and the public seemed to agree with Wiley. In many cases, most particularly with ketchup and other condiments, the use of preservatives was often used to disguise insanitary production practices. Although the law itself did not proscribe the use of some of these preservatives, consumers increasingly turned away from many products with known preservatives.\n\nThe 1906 statute regulated food and drugs moving in interstate commerce and forbade the manufacture, sale, or transportation of poisonous patent medicines.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ayers |first=Edward A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=August 1907 |title=What The Food Law Saves Us From: Adulterations, Substitutions, Chemical Dyes, and Other Evils |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XIV |issue= |pages=9316\u20139322 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sojNAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA9316|accessdate=2009-07-10 |quote= }}</ref> The Act arose due to public education and expos\u00e9s from public interest guardians such as Upton Sinclair and Samuel Hopkins Adams, social activist [[Florence Kelley]], researcher [[Harvey W.

Its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products, and it directed the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors. It required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drug's packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the United States Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary.  ''[[The Jungle]]'' by [[Upton Sinclair]], with its graphic and revolting descriptions of unsanitary conditions and unscrupulous practices rampant in the meatpacking industry,  was an inspirational piece that kept the public's attention on the important issue of unhygienic meat processing plants that later led to food inspection legislation.  Sinclair quipped, \"I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach,\" as outraged readers demanded and got the pure food law.<ref>Arlene F. Kantor, \"Upton Sinclair and the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906: 'I aimed at the public's heart and by accident I hit it in the stomach,'\" ''American Journal of Public Health'' 66.12 (1976): 1202-1205.</ref>\n\n==Historical significance==\nThe '''Pure Food and Drug Act''' of 1906 was a key piece of Progressive Era legislation, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt on the same day as the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]]. Enforcement of the Pure Food and Drug Act was assigned to the Bureau of Chemistry in the U.S. Department of Agriculture which was renamed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930. The [[Meat Inspection Act]] was assigned to what is now known as the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]], which remains in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first federal law regulating foods and drugs, the 1906 Act's reach was limited to foods and drugs moving in [[Commerce Clause|interstate commerce]]. Although the law drew upon many precedents, provisions, and legal experiments pioneered in individual states, the federal law defined \"misbranding\" and \"adulteration\" for the first time and prescribed penalties for each. The law recognized the U.S. Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary as standards authorities for drugs, but made no similar provision for federal food standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Origin/ucm054819.htm |title=The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement |author=Swann, Ph.D., John P |series=FDA History - Part I |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> The law was principally a \"truth in labeling\" law designed to raise standards in the food and drug industries and protect the reputations and pocketbooks of honest businessmen.\n\n==Particular drugs deemed addictive==\nUnder the law, drug labels, for example, had to list any of 10 ingredients that were deemed \"addictive\" and/or \"dangerous\" on the product label if they were present, and could not list them if they were not present. [[Alcohol]], [[morphine]], [[opium]], and [[cannabis]] were all included on the list of these \"addictive\" and/or \"dangerous\" drugs. The law also established a federal cadre of food and drug inspectors that one Southern opponent of the legislation criticized as \"a Trojan horse with a bellyful of inspectors and other employees.\"<ref>Young, James H.

The Johnstones won a decisive victory over the Maxwells.\n\n==Background==\n\nIn 1585, [[John Maxwell, 8th Lord Maxwell]], was declared a rebel for having quarreled with the [[Earl of Arran (Scotland)|Earl of Arran]] who was a favorite of [[James VI of Scotland]]. A [[Commission (document)|commission]] was therefore given to Johnstone, Lord of Annandale, who was then the [[Warden of the West Marches]]. Maxwell, having numerous [[vassal]]s and friends, it was thought necessary to send two bands of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to support Johnstone. However, these two companies, that were commanded by captains Cranston and Lammie, were attacked at Crawfordmoor and cut to pieces by a party of Maxwells who were under the command of Robert Maxwell, natural brother to the chief. He followed up this advantage by burning Johnstone's [[Lochwood Tower|Lochwood Castle]]. In a subsequent conflict Johnstone himself was defeated and taken prisoner, and is said to have died of the grief at the disgrace which he had sustained.<ref name=\"M'Vitie\">{{cite book |last=M'Vitie |first=William |year=1858 |title=The Battle of Dryfe Sands |url=https://archive.org/details/battleofdryfesan00mvit |location=[[Lockerbie]] |publisher=Printed by D.

He subscribed a bond of alliance with Lord James Johnstone, son of the slain Lord Johnstone, and for some time the two clans lived in peace. However, the feud was revived in 1593 when Johnstone of Wamphray who was a relation of Lord Johnstone, along with some friends, went to [[Nithsdale]] and took away a horse which belonged to Crichton of [[Sanquhar Castle|Sanquhar]]. They were pursued by Crichton and some of his friends who took Johnstone prisoner and hanged him from a tree. A nephew of Johnstone of Wamphrey, William Johnstone, managed to escape from the Crichtons and raised a powerful band of Johnstones, again going over to Nithsdale, and swept the country of cattle. Crichton of Sanquhar and Douglas of Drumlanrig raising what forces they could muster attacked the Johnstones at a place called Biddes-burn, but were completely defeated and the Johnstones carried off the spoil.<ref name=\"M'Vitie\"/> In this encounter several Johnstones and fifteen Crichtons were killed.<ref name=\"Graham\">{{cite book |last=Graham |first=F.R |year=1909 |title=History of the Johnstones, 1191-1909, with descriptions of border life |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjohnsto00grah |location=[[Edinburgh]] |publisher=[[W. & A.K.

However, Maxwell would not easily embrace their cause because of his recent reconciliation with Johnstone. They overcame this by entering into a bond of [[manrent]] with Maxwell and therefore became his followers and [[Homage (feudal)|liege-men]]. In return he granted to them a bond of maintenance or protection in which he bound himself to maintain them in their feuds. Some of the most powerful families in Dumfriesshire therefore became vassals of the house of Maxwell, including: [[Clan Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick of Closeburn]], Douglas of Drumlanrig (ancestor of the [[Duke of Queensberry]]), [[Clan Crichton|Crichton of Sanquhar]] (ancestor of the [[Earl of Dumfries]]), Stuart of [[Castlemilk]], Stuart of Garlies (ancestor of the [[Earl of Galloway]]), the Murrays, Lord Annandale, [[Clan Grierson|Grierson of Lag]], Gordon of Lochmaben, and many others in the south-west of Scotland, all binding themselves as vassals of Maxwell.<ref name=\"M'Vitie\"/>\n\nJohnstone was subsequently informed that Crichton, Douglas and a number of others had put themselves under the protection of Maxwell and the warfare between the rival clans was instantly renewed. [[Duke of Buccleuch#Feudal barons of Buccleuch (1488)|Buccleuch]], chief of the Scotts, who was a near relation of Johnstone, came to his assistance with his clan, which not only included the [[Clan Scott]] but also the [[Clan Eliott]], [[Clan Armstrong]] and [[Clan Graham]]. Johnstone having been reinforced, he surprised and cut to pieces a party of Maxwells who were stationed at [[Lochmaben]]. Among the slain was Robert Maxwell, brother of the chief, who had burnt Johnstone's castle at Lochwood. The Maxwells had taken refuge in Lochmaben Church, which they defended for some time, until the Johnstones burnt the church and everyone inside it.<ref name=\"M'Vitie\"/>\n \n==Battle==\n[[File:CaerlaverockCastle01.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Caerlaverock Castle]], historic seat of the chiefs of Clan Maxwell]]\nLord Maxwell, highly incensed by this outrage, entered into [[Annandale]] with 2,000 men, including all of the barons of Nithsdale and also some Royal troops.<ref name=\"M'Vitie\"/> He apparently offered a reward of a \u00a310 land to anyone who could bring him Johnstone's head or hand.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> The Scotts were a fierce and war-like clan and Dame Margaret Johnstone, being a daughter of Buccleuch, three hundred Scotts came to join Johnstone of Lochwood. As Buccleuch was away, they were led by the [[Gideon Murray|Laird of Elibank]]. They were joined by two of Johnstone's retainers near Lockerbie, Johnstone of Kirktoun, who had a large following and Johnstone of Lockerbie, who had fifty men. They were also joined by the Grahams from the [[Debatable Lands]], who were apparently always ready to fight the Maxwells. Johnstone took the high ground above where the [[Dryfe Water|Dryfe]] joines the [[River Annan|Annan]]. Upon Maxwell's approach a small body of the Johnstones came forward from the rest and taunted the Maxwells who were then tempted up the slope. The Johnstones, Scotts and Grahams then left the heights and rushed down on their enemies.<ref name=\"Marchbank\">{{cite book |last=Marchbank |first=Angus |year=1901 |title=Upper Annandale; its history and traditions |url=https://archive.org/details/upperannandaleit00marciala |location=[[Paisley, Renfrewshire]] |publisher=Parlane |pages=[https://archive.org/details/upperannandaleit00marciala/page/76 76]\u201377}}</ref> A desperate conflict took place in which Johnstone gained the victory. Lord Maxwell apparently performed \"prodigies\" of valor but was among the slain. Many of his followers were also slain.

He ignored the respite and tried to capture Johnstone's followers. In doing so he kept the country in a state of confusion and as a result the King superseded him as the Warden with Johnstone himself.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> Douglas of Drumlanrig could not forgive the defeat at Dryfe Sands, and on 13 July 1597 attacked Johnstone with his \"assisters\" but failed to capture two rebel Armstrongs. As a result of this fight, Johnstone was deprived of the Wardenship, but it was given to his ally, [[Sir John Carmichael]].<ref name=\"Graham\"/> In 1608, Sir James Johnstone, now the Warden of the Marches, met up with [[John Maxwell, 9th Lord Maxwell]] who was son of the slain Warden, at [[Tinwald, Dumfries and Galloway|Tinwald]] for the purpose of ending the feud peaceably. However, Maxwell shot Johnstone and then fled to the [[Continental Europe|Continent]]. When he returned he was executed in [[Edinburgh]], in 1613, for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]] and for the slaying of the Warden of the Marches.<ref name=\"Hewinson\"/>\n\nBetween 1591 and 1594 the peace in Scotland had been disturbed on several occasions caused by the activities of [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]] who was a nephew of the third husband of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]]. This had resulted in a serious revolt of the Catholic dissidents in the north-east. However, with the death of Lord Maxwell, who was a staunch Catholic, at the Battle of Dryfe Sands in 1593 and the fall of the northern Earls after the [[Battle of Glenlivet]] in 1594, the Catholic cause was destroyed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mackay |first=Dr James |authorlink=James A.

However, Maxwell would not easily embrace their cause because of his recent reconciliation with Johnstone. They overcame this by entering into a bond of [[manrent]] with Maxwell and therefore became his followers and [[Homage (feudal)|liege-men]]. In return he granted to them a bond of maintenance or protection in which he bound himself to maintain them in their feuds. Some of the most powerful families in Dumfriesshire therefore became vassals of the house of Maxwell, including: [[Clan Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick of Closeburn]], Douglas of Drumlanrig (ancestor of the [[Duke of Queensberry]]), [[Clan Crichton|Crichton of Sanquhar]] (ancestor of the [[Earl of Dumfries]]), Stuart of [[Castlemilk]], Stuart of Garlies (ancestor of the [[Earl of Galloway]]), the Murrays, Lord Annandale, [[Clan Grierson|Grierson of Lag]], Gordon of Lochmaben, and many others in the south-west of Scotland, all binding themselves as vassals of Maxwell.<ref name=\"M'Vitie\"/>\n\nJohnstone was subsequently informed that Crichton, Douglas and a number of others had put themselves under the protection of Maxwell and the warfare between the rival clans was instantly renewed. [[Duke of Buccleuch#Feudal barons of Buccleuch (1488)|Buccleuch]], chief of the Scotts, who was a near relation of Johnstone, came to his assistance with his clan, which not only included the [[Clan Scott]] but also the [[Clan Eliott]], [[Clan Armstrong]] and [[Clan Graham]]. Johnstone having been reinforced, he surprised and cut to pieces a party of Maxwells who were stationed at [[Lochmaben]]. Among the slain was Robert Maxwell, brother of the chief, who had burnt Johnstone's castle at Lochwood. The Maxwells had taken refuge in Lochmaben Church, which they defended for some time, until the Johnstones burnt the church and everyone inside it.<ref name=\"M'Vitie\"/>\n \n==Battle==\n[[File:CaerlaverockCastle01.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Caerlaverock Castle]], historic seat of the chiefs of Clan Maxwell]]\nLord Maxwell, highly incensed by this outrage, entered into [[Annandale]] with 2,000 men, including all of the barons of Nithsdale and also some Royal troops.<ref name=\"M'Vitie\"/> He apparently offered a reward of a \u00a310 land to anyone who could bring him Johnstone's head or hand.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> The Scotts were a fierce and war-like clan and Dame Margaret Johnstone, being a daughter of Buccleuch, three hundred Scotts came to join Johnstone of Lochwood. As Buccleuch was away, they were led by the [[Lord Elibank|Laird of Elibank]]. They were joined by two of Johnstone's retainers near Lockerbie, Johnstone of Kirktoun, who had a large following and Johnstone of Lockerbie, who had fifty men. They were also joined by the Grahams from the [[Debatable Lands]], who were apparently always ready to fight the Maxwells. Johnstone took the high ground above where the [[Dryfe Water|Dryfe]] joines the [[River Annan|Annan]]. Upon Maxwell's approach a small body of the Johnstones came forward from the rest and taunted the Maxwells who were then tempted up the slope. The Johnstones, Scotts and Grahams then left the heights and rushed down on their enemies.<ref name=\"Marchbank\">{{cite book |last=Marchbank |first=Angus |year=1901 |title=Upper Annandale; its history and traditions |url=https://archive.org/details/upperannandaleit00marciala |location=[[Paisley, Renfrewshire]] |publisher=Parlane |pages=[https://archive.org/details/upperannandaleit00marciala/page/76 76]\u201377}}</ref> A desperate conflict took place in which Johnstone gained the victory. Lord Maxwell apparently performed \"prodigies\" of valor but was among the slain. Many of his followers were also slain. The barons of Lag, Closeburn and Drumlanrig escaped thanks to their horses.<ref name=\"M'Vitie\"/>\n\nAccording to Marchbank, 700 Maxwells were killed in the battle.<ref name=\"Marchbank\"/> John Pollock, son of the chief of [[Clan Pollock]], was killed supporting the Maxwells.<ref name=\"Pollock\"/>  Some who escaped are said to have had \"Lockerbie licks\" on their faces, caused by being slashed by the swords of pursuing horsemen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dryfesdalelodge.org.uk/resources/thebattleofdryfesands.pdf|title=Battle of Dryfe Sands|accessdate=8 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623154146/http://www.dryfesdalelodge.org.uk/resources/thebattleofdryfesands.pdf|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, it is likely that Johnstone's losses were also heavy as in 1594 he obtained a [[respite (law)|respite]] from the King for himself and just eight [[20 (number)|score]] (160) surviving followers.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> Among those killed on Johnstone's side was Bell of Albie who was killed whilst in pursuit of the Maxwells.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Samuel |year=1989 |title=A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland: Comprising the Several Counties, Islands, Cities, Burgh and Market Towns, Parishes, and Principal Villages with Historical and Statistical Descriptions |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WaHrCqQIjt8C&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=Bell+of+Albie+Dryfe+Sands&source=bl&ots=u8Sk_1cHmJ&sig=ACfU3U1ysm_JtQe9LevleywGXsO2lXPI1A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiglKW7-OnmAhU9SRUIHVM2CPQQ6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Bell%20of%20Albie%20Dryfe%20Sands&f=false |publisher=Genealogical Publishing Company |page=59}}</ref> According to the ''[[Statistical Accounts of Scotland|New Statistical Account of Scotland]]'', \"the Albie Thorn\" was planted on the spot where Bell of Albie fell, which was within 500 yards of the church.<ref>{{cite book |year=1834 |title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Msg9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA183&lpg=PA183&dq=Bell+of+Albie+Dryfe+Sands&source=bl&ots=-Tn6qQJJ5e&sig=ACfU3U03A8KE-XvOz13Fp51fIlR4PlzoFg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiglKW7-OnmAhU9SRUIHVM2CPQQ6AEwBXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=Bell%20of%20Albie%20Dryfe%20Sands&f=false |volume=Volume 2 |publisher=[[Blackwood (publishing house)|Blackwood]] |page=183}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nLord Maxwell's cousin, William Maxwell, 5th [[Lord Herries of Terregles]], became the next Warden of the West Marches. He ignored the respite and tried to capture Johnstone's followers. In doing so he kept the country in a state of confusion and as a result the King superseded him as the Warden with Johnstone himself.<ref name=\"Graham\"/> Douglas of Drumlanrig could not forgive the defeat at Dryfe Sands, and on 13 July 1597 attacked Johnstone with his \"assisters\" but failed to capture two rebel Armstrongs. As a result of this fight, Johnstone was deprived of the Wardenship, but it was given to his ally, [[Sir John Carmichael]].<ref name=\"Graham\"/> In 1608, Sir James Johnstone, now the Warden of the Marches, met up with [[John Maxwell, 9th Lord Maxwell]] who was son of the slain Warden, at [[Tinwald, Dumfries and Galloway|Tinwald]] for the purpose of ending the feud peaceably. However, Maxwell shot Johnstone and then fled to the [[Continental Europe|Continent]]. When he returned he was executed in [[Edinburgh]], in 1613, for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]] and for the slaying of the Warden of the Marches.<ref name=\"Hewinson\"/>\n\nBetween 1591 and 1594 the peace in Scotland had been disturbed on several occasions caused by the activities of [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]] who was a nephew of the third husband of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]]. This had resulted in a serious revolt of the Catholic dissidents in the north-east. However, with the death of Lord Maxwell, who was a staunch Catholic, at the Battle of Dryfe Sands in 1593 and the fall of the northern Earls after the [[Battle of Glenlivet]] in 1594, the Catholic cause was destroyed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mackay |first=Dr James |authorlink=James A.
