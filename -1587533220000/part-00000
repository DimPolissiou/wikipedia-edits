Her father Wiley Kennedy was a [[Pullman porter]], and later had a taxi business. The second of her parents' five daughters, she had a happy childhood, full of support from her parents, despite experiencing poverty in the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and racism in her mostly white neighborhood.<ref name=obit/> Kennedy remembered a time when her father had to be armed with a shotgun in order to ward off the strong neighborhood [[Ku Klux Klan]] presence that was trying to drive her family out.<ref name=\":0\">\"Florynce R.

After the death of her mother Zella in 1942, Kennedy left Missouri for [[New York City]], moving to an apartment in [[Harlem]] with her sister Grayce.<ref name=obit /> Of the move to New York she commented, \"I really didn't come here to go to school, but the schools were here, so I went.\" In 1944 she began classes at [[Columbia University School of General Studies]], majoring in [[pre-law]] and graduated in 1949. However, when she applied to the university's law school, she was refused admission. In her autobiography Kennedy wrote, <blockquote>The Associate Dean, Willis Reese, told me I had been rejected not because I was a Black but because I was a woman. So I wrote him a letter saying that whatever the reason was, it felt the same to me, and some of my more cynical friends thought I had been discriminated against because I was Black.<ref>Kennedy, Florynce R. ''Color Me Flo: My Hard Life and Good Times'', Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1976.</ref></blockquote> Kennedy met with the dean and threatened to sue the school. They admitted her. She was the only black person among eight women in her class.<ref name=\"obit\" /> In a 1946 sociology class at Columbia University Kennedy wrote a paper that analogized the discourses of race and sex. \"Kennedy hoped that comparing 'women' and 'Negroes' would hasten the formation of alliances\".<ref>Mayeri, Serena (2011), ''Reasoning from Race: Feminism, Law, and the Civil Rights Revolution'', Harvard University Press, p. 9.</ref>\n\n== Career and Acting ==\nKennedy graduated from [[Columbia Law School]] in 1951.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nBy 1954 she had opened her own office, doing matrimonial work, and some assigned criminal cases. She was a member of the [[Young Democrats of America|Young Democrats]]. In 1956, she formed a legal partnership with the lawyer who had represented [[Billie Holiday]] in regards to drug charges. Kennedy then came to represent Holiday's estate, and also that of [[Charlie Parker]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nKennedy acted in the films ''[[The Landlord]]'' (1970, adapted from [[Kristin Hunter]]'s 1966 novel), in which she played \"Enid\", and the independent political drama ''[[Born In Flames]]'' (1983, directed by [[Lizzie Borden (director)|Lizzie Borden]]), in which she played \"Zella\".<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065963/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4 \"Florynce Kennedy (1916\u20132000)\"], IMDb.</ref>\n\nKennedy also acted in ''Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow'' alongside [[Morgan Freeman]] (1971, directed by Edward Mann)<ref>[[imdbtitle:0067982|\"Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow\"]], IMDb.</ref> and was seen on the TV series ''[[Some of My Best Friends are Men]]'' (1973).<ref>[[imdbtitle:0294191|\"Some of my Best Friends Are Men\"]], IMDb.</ref>\n\nKennedy was one of many narrators in the second volume of a film entitled ''[[Come Back, Africa|Come Back, Africa: The Films of Lionel Rogosin]]'', which discussed African-American history as well as [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].

In 1999 the [[City University of New York]] awarded her the Century Award.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Activism ==\n\nKennedy used [[Intersectionality]] as her approach to activism. Sherie Randolph, in her book ''Florynce \"Flo\" Kennedy: The Life of a Radical Black Feminist'', quotes Flo saying: \"My main message is that we have a pathologically, institutionally racist, sexist, classist society. And that niggerizing techniques that are used don't only damage black people, but they also damage women, gay people, ex-prison inmates, prostitutes, children, old people, handicapped people, native Americans. And that if we can begin to analyze the pathology of oppression\u2026 we would learn a lot about how to deal with it.\"<ref name=\":2\">Randolph, Sherie (2015). ''Florynce \"Flo\" Kennedy: The Life of a Black Feminist Radical'', USA: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 1, 157, 158.</ref> Kennedy kept revisiting the same aim: \"urging women to examine the sources of their oppression.

Kennedy had a summer home on [[Fire Island]], and was a popular fixture on the social scene there, entertaining many activists whom she invited to visit her.\n\nKennedy held regular salons in her apartment on East 48th Street, off Fifth Avenue, in New York City. She would preside over networking and facilitate people meeting each other, sharing ideas, and was always coming up with projects. She would give tours of her apartment, directing guests to the \"filthy room\" and the \"dirty room\".\n\n=== Early activism ===\nHer activism began early. According to Jason Chambers in his book ''Madison Avenue and the Color Line: African Americans in the Advertising Industry'', \"After graduating high school, [Kennedy] organized a successful boycott against a Coca-Cola bottler who refused to hire black truck drivers.\"<ref>Chambers, Jason (2008). ''Madison Avenue and the Color Line: African Americans in the Advertising Industry''. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Press, p. 151.</ref>\n\n\u201cKennedy recalled being arrested for the first time in 1965 when she attempted to reach her home on East 48th Street and police refused to believe she lived in the neighborhood.

She stated that she would lead boycotts of major advertisers if they did not feature black people in their ads. She attended all three [[Black Power]] conferences and represented [[H.

Her father Wiley Kennedy was a [[Pullman porter]], and later had a taxi business. The second of her parents' five daughters, she had a happy childhood, full of support from her parents, despite experiencing poverty in the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and racism in her mostly white neighborhood.<ref name=obit/> Kennedy remembered a time when her father had to be armed with a shotgun in order to ward off the strong neighborhood [[Ku Klux Klan]] presence that was trying to drive her family out.<ref name=\":0\">\"Florynce R.

After the death of her mother Zella in 1942, Kennedy left Missouri for [[New York City]], moving to an apartment in [[Harlem]] with her sister Grayce.<ref name=obit /> Of the move to New York she commented, \"I really didn't come here to go to school, but the schools were here, so I went.\" In 1944 she began classes at [[Columbia University School of General Studies]], majoring in [[pre-law]] and graduated in 1949. However, when she applied to the university's law school, she was refused admission. In her autobiography Kennedy wrote, <blockquote>The Associate Dean, Willis Reese, told me I had been rejected not because I was a Black but because I was a woman. So I wrote him a letter saying that whatever the reason was, it felt the same to me, and some of my more cynical friends thought I had been discriminated against because I was Black.<ref>Kennedy, Florynce R. ''Color Me Flo: My Hard Life and Good Times'', Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1976.</ref></blockquote> Kennedy met with the dean and threatened to sue the school. They admitted her. She was the only black person among eight women in her class.<ref name=\"obit\" /> In a 1946 sociology class at Columbia University Kennedy wrote a paper that analogized the discourses of race and sex. \"Kennedy hoped that comparing 'women' and 'Negroes' would hasten the formation of alliances\".<ref>Mayeri, Serena (2011), ''Reasoning from Race: Feminism, Law, and the Civil Rights Revolution'', Harvard University Press, p. 9.</ref>\n\n== Career and Acting ==\nKennedy graduated from [[Columbia Law School]] in 1951.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nBy 1954 she had opened her own office, doing matrimonial work, and some assigned criminal cases. She was a member of the [[Young Democrats of America|Young Democrats]]. In 1956, she formed a legal partnership with the lawyer who had represented [[Billie Holiday]] in regards to drug charges. Kennedy then came to represent Holiday's estate, and also that of [[Charlie Parker]].<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nKennedy acted in the films ''[[The Landlord]]'' (1970, adapted from [[Kristin Hunter]]'s 1966 novel), in which she played \"Enid\", and the independent political drama ''[[Born In Flames]]'' (1983, directed by [[Lizzie Borden (director)|Lizzie Borden]]), in which she played \"Zella\".<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065963/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4 \"Florynce Kennedy (1916\u20132000)\"], IMDb.</ref>\n\nKennedy also acted in ''Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow'' alongside [[Morgan Freeman]] (1971, directed by Edward Mann)<ref>[[imdbtitle:0067982|\"Who Says I Can't Ride a Rainbow\"]], IMDb.</ref> and was seen on the TV series ''[[Some of My Best Friends are Men]]'' (1973).<ref>[[imdbtitle:0294191|\"Some of my Best Friends Are Men\"]], IMDb.</ref>\n\nKennedy was one of many narrators in the second volume of a film entitled ''[[Come Back, Africa|Come Back, Africa: The Films of Lionel Rogosin]]'', which discussed African-American history as well as [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]. This film was created to \"serve as a unique piece of African American oral history\".<ref>McClune, Caitlin (January 1, 2014). \"Come Back, Africa: The Films of Lionel Rogosin, Volume II (review)\".

In 1999 the [[City University of New York]] awarded her the Century Award.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Activism ==\n\nKennedy used [[Intersectionality]] as her approach to activism. Sherie Randolph, in her book ''Florynce \"Flo\" Kennedy: The Life of a Radical Black Feminist'', quotes Flo saying: \"My main message is that we have a pathologically, institutionally racist, sexist, classist society. And that niggerizing techniques that are used don't only damage black people, but they also damage women, gay people, ex-prison inmates, prostitutes, children, old people, handicapped people, native Americans. And that if we can begin to analyze the pathology of oppression\u2026 we would learn a lot about how to deal with it.\"<ref name=\":2\">Randolph, Sherie (2015). ''Florynce \"Flo\" Kennedy: The Life of a Black Feminist Radical'', USA: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 1, 157, 158.</ref> Kennedy kept revisiting the same aim: \"urging women to examine the sources of their oppression.

Kennedy had a summer home on [[Fire Island]], and was a popular fixture on the social scene there, entertaining many activists whom she invited to visit her.\n\nKennedy held regular salons in her apartment on East 48th Street, off Fifth Avenue, in New York City. She would preside over networking and facilitate people meeting each other, sharing ideas, and was always coming up with projects. She would give tours of her apartment, directing guests to the \"filthy room\" and the \"dirty room\".\n\n=== Early activism ===\nHer activism began early. According to Jason Chambers in his book ''Madison Avenue and the Color Line: African Americans in the Advertising Industry'', \"After graduating high school, [Kennedy] organized a successful boycott against a Coca-Cola bottler who refused to hire black truck drivers.\"<ref>Chambers, Jason (2008). ''Madison Avenue and the Color Line: African Americans in the Advertising Industry''. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Press, p. 151.</ref>\n\n\u201cKennedy recalled being arrested for the first time in 1965 when she attempted to reach her home on East 48th Street and police refused to believe she lived in the neighborhood. From that point on, she focused her attention on combatting racism and discrimination.\"<ref name=\":1\">Kennedy, Florynce.

She stated that she would lead boycotts of major advertisers if they did not feature black people in their ads. She attended all three [[Black Power]] conferences and represented [[H.

Kennedy also represented prominent radical feminist [[Valerie Solanas]], who was on trial for the 1968 attempted murder of [[Andy Warhol]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\nKennedy played a significant role in formulating the [[Miss America protest]] of 1968.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Miss America protest was used as a tool to demonstrate the \"exploitation of women\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Randolph noted in her book, ''Florynce \"Flo\" Kennedy: The Life of a Black Feminist Radical'', that the responsibility lay with Kennedy to recruit other black feminists to this protest.<ref name=\":2\" /> During the protest multiple women were arrested and Kennedy took on their cases as their attorney.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the 1970s Kennedy traveled the lecture circuit with writer [[Gloria Steinem]].

In 1971 she founded the Feminist Party, which nominated [[Shirley Chisholm]] for president. She also helped found the [[National Women's Political Caucus]]. Beginning in 1972 she served on the Advisory Board of the [[Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective]], a New York City theatre group that produced plays on feminist issues.
