{"title_page": "Nickel compounds", "text_new": "'''Compounds of nickel''' are chemical compounds containing the element [[nickel]] which is a member of the [[group 10 element|group 10]] of the [[periodic table]]. Most compounds in the group have an [[oxidation state]] of +2. Nickel is classified as a [[transition metal]] with nickel(II) having much chemical behaviour in common with iron(II) and cobalt(II). Many salts of nickel(II) are [[isomorphous]] with salts of [[magnesium]] due to the [[ionic radii]] of the cations being almost the same. Nickel forms many [[coordination complex]]es. [[Nickel tetracarbonyl]] was the first pure metal carbonyl produced, and is unusual in its volatility. [[Metalloprotein]]s containing nickel are found in biological systems.\n\nNickel forms simple binary compounds with non metals including [[halogens]], [[chalcogenides]], and [[pnictides]]. Nickel ions can act as a cation in salts with many acids, including common [[oxoacid]]s Salts of the hexaaqua ion (Ni{{hydrate|6}}<sup>2+</sup>) are especially well known. Many double salts containing nickel with another cation are known. There are organic acid salts. Nickel can be part of a negatively charged ion (anion) making what is called a nickellate. Numerous quaternary compounds (with four elements) of nickel have been studied for [superconductivity]] properties, as nickel is adjacent to copper and iron in the periodic table can can form compounds with the same structure as the [[high-temperature superconductor]]s that are known.\n\n==Colour==\nMost of the common [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] of nickel are green due to the presence of hexaaquanickel(II) ion, Ni(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>2+</sup>.\n\n==Geometry==\nNickel atoms can connect to surrounding atoms or ligands in a variety of ways. Six coordinated nickel is the most common and is [[octahedral]], but this can be distorted if ligands are not equivalent. For four coordinate nickel arrangements can be square planar, or [[tetrahedral]]. Five coordinated nickel is rarer.\n\n==Magnetism==\nSome nickel compounds are [[ferromagnetic]] at sufficiently low temperatures. In order to show magnetic properties the nickel atoms have to be close enough together in the solid structure.\n\n==Binary compounds==\nA binary compound of nickel contains one other element. Substances that contain only nickel atoms are not actually compounds.\n\nIn a [[noble gas matrix]], nickel can form [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]], a molecule with two nickel atoms: Ni<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=barrett/> Ni<sub>2</sub> has a bonding energy of 2.07\u00b10.01&nbsp;eV. For Ni<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> the bond energy is around 3.3&nbsp;eV. Nickel dimers and other clusters can also be formed in a gas and plasma phase by shooting a powerful laser at a nickel rod in cold helium gas.<ref name=lian91>{{cite journal |last1=Lian |first1=Li |last2=Su |first2=C.-X. |last3=Armentrout |first3=P.B. \n|title=The bond energy of <math chem>\\ce{Ni^{+2}}</math>\n|journal=Chemical Physics Letters \n|date=May 1991 |volume=180 |issue=3 |pages=168\u2013172 |doi=10.1016/0009-2614(91)87135-X|bibcode=1991CPL...180..168L }}</ref>\n\n===Oxides===\nNickel oxides include [[Nickel(II) oxide]] and [[Nickel(III) oxide]].\n\n===Hydroxides===\nNickel hydroxides are used in [[nickel\u2013cadmium battery|nickel\u2013cadmium]] and [[Nickel\u2013metal hydride battery|Nickel\u2013metal hydride]] batteries.\nNickel(II) hydroxide Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, the main hydroxide of nickel is coloured apple green. It is known as the mineral [[theophrastite]].\n[[Nickel oxide hydroxide|\u03b2-NiO(OH)]] is a black powder with nickel in the +3 oxidation state. It can be made by oxidising [[nickel nitrate]] in a cold alkaline solution with [[bromine]]. A [[Mixed valency|mixed oxidation state]] hydroxide Ni<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub> is made if oxidation happens in a hot alkaline solution. A Ni<sup>4+</sup> hydroxide: nickel peroxide hydrate NiO<sub>2</sub>{{hydrate}}, can be made by oxidising with alkaline peroxide.

Most compounds in the group have an [[oxidation state]] of +2. Nickel is classified as a [[transition metal]] with nickel(II) having much chemical behaviour in common with iron(II) and cobalt(II). Many salts of nickel(II) are [[isomorphous]] with salts of [[magnesium]] due to the [[ionic radii]] of the cations being almost the same. Nickel forms many [[coordination complex]]es. [[Nickel tetracarbonyl]] was the first pure metal carbonyl produced, and is unusual in its volatility. [[Metalloprotein]]s containing nickel are found in biological systems.\n\nNickel forms simple binary compounds with non metals including [[halogens]], [[chalcogenides]], and [[pnictides]]. Nickel ions can act as a cation in salts with many acids, including common [[oxoacid]]s Salts of the hexaaqua ion (Ni{{hydrate|6}}<sup>2+</sup>) are especially well known. Many double salts containing nickel with another cation are known. There are organic acid salts. Nickel can be part of a negatively charged ion (anion) making what is called a nickellate. Numerous quaternary compounds (with four elements) of nickel have been studied for [superconductivity]] properties, as nickel is adjacent to copper and iron in the periodic table can can form compounds with the same structure as the [[high-temperature superconductor]]s that are known.\n\n==Colour==\nMost of the common [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] of nickel are green due to the presence of hexaaquanickel(II) ion, Ni(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub><sup>2+</sup>.\n\n==Geometry==\nNickel atoms can connect to surrounding atoms or ligands in a variety of ways. Six coordinated nickel is the most common and is [[octahedral]], but this can be distorted if ligands are not equivalent. For four coordinate nickel arrangements can be square planar, or [[tetrahedral]]. Five coordinated nickel is rarer.\n\n==Magnetism==\nSome nickel compounds are [[ferromagnetic]] at sufficiently low temperatures. In order to show magnetic properties the nickel atoms have to be close enough together in the solid structure.\n\n==Binary compounds==\nA binary compound of nickel contains one other element.

The race served as the 12th round of the [[2017 IndyCar Series]] season. Frenchman [[Simon Pagenaud]] qualified on pole position, while American [[Josef Newgarden]] took victory in the race.\n\n==Pre-Race==\nPrior to the race, [[Schmidt Peterson Motorsports]] elected to replace [[Mikhail Aleshin]] in the No. 7 car, instead opting for veteran driver [[Sebasti\u00e1n Saavedra]]. The reasons for the change were undisclosed by the team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aleshin replaced by Saavedra for Toronto|url=https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/aleshin-replaced-by-saavedra-for-toronto-930157/|first=David|last=Malsher|date=July 13, 2017|accessdate=July 26, 2017|website=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifying==\nQualifying was held on Saturday, July 15. [[Simon Pagenaud]] secured pole position, setting a new track record time of 58.9124 at an average speed of 109.14&nbsp;mph (175.64&nbsp;km/h). Alongside him on the front row was [[Graham Rahal]]. The remained of the top six was rounded out by [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]], [[Will Power]], [[Scott Dixon]], and [[James Hinchcliffe]].\n\nQualifying saw two incidents during the course of its several sessions. During the second group of round 1 qualifying, [[Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez]] suffered a heavy crash in turn 11 that placed doubt on his participation in the race, both due to damage to the car and due to Guti\u00e9rrez displaying concussion-like symptoms. However, the car was repaired, and Guit\u00e9rrez was cleared by IndyCar's doctors, allowing him to participate in the race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gutierrez cleared to race at Toronto|url=https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/gutierrez-cleared-to-race-at-toronto-931712/|first=David|last=Malsher|date=July 16, 2017|accessdate=July 26, 2017|website=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]}}</ref> A second, more minor incident occurred in round 2 qualifying, when [[J.

At the start, [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] managed to pass both [[Simon Pagenaud]] and [[Graham Rahal]] going into turn 1, giving him the lead of the race. Behind them, [[Scott Dixon]] managed to get to the inside of [[Will Power]] to move to third. However, as cars approached turn 3, Dixon moved wide to avoid hitting the back of Rahal, in the process making contact with Power and forcing him into the outside wall. Power's car suffered terminal suspension damage, relegating him to a last place finish. Dixon limped around the track with a flat tire, which, after repairs, dropped him to the tail-end of the field. He would then be assessed a drive-through penalty for entering a closed pit-lane. The incident brought out the race's first caution period.\n\nRacing resumed on lap 6, with Castroneves leading Pagenaud, Rahal, [[Josef Newgarden]], and [[James Hinchcliffe]]. The top five remained unchanged until lap 20, when [[Spencer Pigot]], who had charged through the field, managed to move around Hinchcliffe. Shortly thereafter, drivers began making their first pit stops, including Hinchcliffe, [[Alexander Rossi]], and [[Josef Newgarden]]. Just as Newgarden entered the pits, [[Tony Kanaan]] nosed into the wall in turn 1, bringing out the race's second caution, forcing the leaders and anyone else who had not pitted to make their first stop under caution and secede track position. Newgarden proved the biggest beneficiary of the caution, moving into the lead once the leaders came into pit lane. Behind him were [[Ed Jones (racing driver)|Ed Jones]], who had not yet pitted, [[Charlie Kimball]], Rossi, and Hinchcliffe.\n\nRacing resumed on lap 27 with the top five remaining intact. Further back, [[Takuma Sato]] suffered front wing damage and a punctured tire, forcing him to pit again. On lap 29, Jones began to fall back in the field due to his worn tires, losing position first to Kimball, then to Rossi, Hinchcliffe, and [[Marco Andretti]] before finally coming in to pit on lap 33. Several drivers began to make their second pit stops shortly thereafter, including [[Carlos Mu\u00f1oz (racing driver)|Carlos Mu\u00f1oz]], [[Scott Dixon]], and second-place running Kimball. This promoted Rossi to second, but Newgarden continued to extend his lead.\n\nThe running order remained the same until the leaders made their pit-stops at lap 54, when Newgarden led the entire top five into the pits. [[Max Chilton]] briefly inherited the lead before handing the lead over to Pagenaud with his stop on lap later. Pagenaud led until lap 57 when he pitted, allowing Newgarden to return to the lead of the race. The order now ran Newgarden, Rossi, Hinchcliffe, Dixon, Andretti, though Dixon would pit for the final time on lap 61, promoting [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]] into the top 5, though with heavy pressure from Pagenaud behind. The top five remained the same until lap 81, when Hunter-Reay ran wide at turn 7, allowing Pagenaud to move ahead for position. Up front, despite dealing with traffic from a dueling [[Takuma Sato]] and [[Conor Daly]], [[Josef Newgarden]] held on to take his second victory of the 2017 season by a comfortable margin of 1.87 seconds over [[Alexander Rossi]], while [[James Hinchcliffe]] came across the line third.<ref>{{cite news|title=Newgarden races to second Toronto IndyCar win in 3 years|url=http://racing.ap.org/article/newgarden-races-second-toronto-indycar-win-3-years|accessdate=July 27, 2017|work=Associated Press|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=AP Sports|date=July 16, 2017|location=[[Toronto]]}}</ref> [[Marco Andretti]] secured his first top 5 finish in IndyCar since the [[2015 MAVTV 500]] with his fourth-place finish.\n\nIn the point standings, [[Scott Dixon]] remained in the lead of the championship, but his lead dropped to only three points over [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]].

The race served as the 12th round of the [[2017 IndyCar Series]] season. Frenchman [[Simon Pagenaud]] qualified on pole position, while American [[Josef Newgarden]] took victory in the race.\n\n==Pre-Race==\nPrior to the race, [[Schmidt Peterson Motorsports]] elected to replace [[Mikhail Aleshin]] in the No. 7 car, instead opting for veteran driver [[Sebasti\u00e1n Saavedra]]. The reasons for the change were undisclosed by the team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aleshin replaced by Saavedra for Toronto|url=https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/aleshin-replaced-by-saavedra-for-toronto-930157/|first=David|last=Malsher|date=July 13, 2017|accessdate=July 26, 2017|website=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]}}</ref>\n\n==Qualifying==\nQualifying was held on Saturday, July 15. [[Simon Pagenaud]] secured pole position, setting a new track record time of 58.9124 at an average speed of 109.14&nbsp;mph (175.64&nbsp;km/h). Alongside him on the front row was [[Graham Rahal]]. The remained of the top six was rounded out by [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]], [[Will Power]], [[Scott Dixon]], and [[James Hinchcliffe]].\n\nQualifying saw two incidents during the course of its several sessions. During the second group of round 1 qualifying, [[Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez]] suffered a heavy crash in turn 11 that placed doubt on his participation in the race, both due to damage to the car and due to Guti\u00e9rrez displaying concussion-like symptoms. However, the car was repaired, and Guit\u00e9rrez was cleared by IndyCar's doctors, allowing him to participate in the race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gutierrez cleared to race at Toronto|url=https://www.motorsport.com/indycar/news/gutierrez-cleared-to-race-at-toronto-931712/|first=David|last=Malsher|date=July 16, 2017|accessdate=July 26, 2017|website=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=[[Motorsport Network]]}}</ref> A second, more minor incident occurred in round 2 qualifying, when [[J.

At the start, [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] managed to pass both [[Simon Pagenaud]] and [[Graham Rahal]] going into turn 1, giving him the lead of the race. Behind them, [[Scott Dixon]] managed to get to the inside of [[Will Power]] to move to third. However, as cars approached turn 3, Dixon moved wide to avoid hitting the back of Rahal, in the process making contact with Power and forcing him into the outside wall. Power's car suffered terminal suspension damage, relegating him to a last place finish. Dixon limped around the track with a flat tire, which, after repairs, dropped him to the tail-end of the field. He would then be assessed a drive-through penalty for entering a closed pit-lane. The incident brought out the race's first caution period.\n\nRacing resumed on lap 6, with Castroneves leading Pagenaud, Rahal, [[Josef Newgarden]], and [[James Hinchcliffe]]. The top five remained unchanged until lap 20, when [[Spencer Pigot]], who had charged through the field, managed to move around Hinchcliffe. Shortly thereafter, drivers began making their first pit stops, including Hinchcliffe, [[Alexander Rossi]], and [[Josef Newgarden]]. Just as Newgarden entered the pits, [[Tony Kanaan]] nosed into the wall in turn 1, bringing out the race's second caution, forcing the leaders and anyone else who had not pitted to make their first stop under caution and secede track position. Newgarden proved the biggest beneficiary of the caution, moving into the lead once the leaders came into pit lane. Behind him were [[Ed Jones (racing driver)|Ed Jones]], who had not yet pitted, [[Charlie Kimball]], Rossi, and Hinchcliffe.\n\nRacing resumed on lap 27 with the top five remaining intact. Further back, [[Takuma Sato]] suffered front wing damage and a punctured tire, forcing him to pit again. On lap 29, Jones began to fall back in the field due to his worn tires, losing position first to Kimball, then to Rossi, Hinchcliffe, and [[Marco Andretti]] before finally coming in to pit on lap 33. Several drivers began to make their second pit stops shortly thereafter, including [[Carlos Mu\u00f1oz (racing driver)|Carlos Mu\u00f1oz]], [[Scott Dixon]], and second-place running Kimball. This promoted Rossi to second, but Newgarden continued to extend his lead.\n\nThe running order remained the same until the leaders made their pit-stops at lap 54, when Newgarden led the entire top five into the pits. [[Max Chilton]] briefly inherited the lead before handing the lead over to Pagenaud with his stop on lap later. Pagenaud led until lap 57 when he pitted, allowing Newgarden to return to the lead of the race. The order now ran Newgarden, Rossi, Hinchcliffe, Dixon, Andretti, though Dixon would pit for the final time on lap 61, promoting [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]] into the top 5, though with heavy pressure from Pagenaud behind. The top five remained the same until lap 81, when Hunter-Reay ran wide at turn 7, allowing Pagenaud to move ahead for position. Up front, despite dealing with traffic from a dueling [[Takuma Sato]] and [[Conor Daly]], [[Josef Newgarden]] held on to take his second victory of the 2017 season by a comfortable margin of 1.87 seconds over [[Alexander Rossi]], while [[James Hinchcliffe]] came across the line third.<ref>{{cite news|title=Newgarden races to second Toronto IndyCar win in 3 years|url=http://racing.ap.org/article/newgarden-races-second-toronto-indycar-win-3-years|accessdate=July 27, 2017|work=Associated Press|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=AP Sports|date=July 16, 2017|location=[[Toronto]]}}</ref> [[Marco Andretti]] secured his first top 5 finish in IndyCar since the [[2015 MAVTV 500]] with his fourth-place finish.\n\nIn the point standings, [[Scott Dixon]] remained in the lead of the championship, but his lead dropped to only three points over [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]].

Genocides take a lot of planning, resources, and involved parties to carry out, they do not just happen instantaneously.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgpreventgenocide.shtml|title=Background Information on Preventing Genocide|website=Outreach Programme on the Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations|publisher=UN|accessdate=5 April 2016}}</ref> Scholars in the field of [[Genocide studies]] have identified a set of widely agreed upon risk factors that make a country or social group more at risk of carrying out a genocide, which include a wide range of political and cultural factors that create a context in which genocide is more likely, as well as psychological phenomenon that can be manipulated in large groups of people and taken advantage of. Genocide prevention depends heavily on the knowledge and surveillance of these risk factors, as well as the identification of early warning signs of genocide or even of the actual first stages of genocide beginning to occur. \n\nOne of the main goals of the [[United Nations]] with the passage of the [[Genocide Convention]] after the [[World War II|Second World War]] and [[Holocaust]] is to prevent future [[genocide]] from taking place.<ref name=\"un.org\" /> The Genocide Convention and the [[Responsibility to protect]] provide the basis for the responsibility of every UN member state to actively prevent genocide and act to stop it when it occurs. However, the United Nations has been heavily criticized for its widespread failure to prevent genocide, especially in the latter half of the twentieth century.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== The psychological basis of genocide ==\nGenocide is not something that only trained, sadistic killers take part in, but rather it is something that ordinary people can do with the proper \u201ctraining\u201d via cognitive restructuring and social conditioning.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Hinton|first=Alexander Laban|date=1996|title=Agents of Death: Explaining the Cambodian Genocide in Terms of Psychosocial Dissonance|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=98|issue=4|pages=818\u2013831|issn=0002-7294|jstor=681888|doi=10.1525/aa.1996.98.4.02a00110}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sound-science-sound-policy/201803/the-psychology-genocide-beware-the-beginnings.|title=The Psychology of Genocide: Beware the Beginnings|last=Vollhardt|first=Johanna|date=March 15, 2018|website=Psychology Today|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The act of killing for genocidal purposes is not a distinct category of human behavior, but instead demonstrates the potential of ordinary psychological and social psychological processes to be manipulated and escalated into violence in certain environments and conditions.<ref name=\":1\" /> One of the major puzzles in studying both the occurrence of and prevention of genocide, therefore, is understanding what makes those \"normal\" cognitive processes, both on the individual and collective levels, vulnerable to manipulation by outsiders and which social and political conditions provide a breeding ground for violence.\n\nOn the individual level, the psychological concept of [[Cognitive dissonance]] plays a large role in a person's transformation from peaceful citizen to violent genocidal killer.<ref name=\":1\" /> Even more specifically, Alexander Hinton, in his 1996 study on the psycho-social factors that contributed to the [[Cambodian genocide]], coined the term \"psychosocial dissonance\" to add to this well-known psychological concept other anthropological concepts like cultural models and notions of the self.<ref name=\":2\" /> These forms of dissonance, both cognitive and psychosocial, arise when a person is confronted with behavioral expectations that conflict with their own identity or concept of self, and subsequently work subconsciously to resolve those inconsistencies.<ref name=\":2\" /> Hinton claims that there are a number of cognitive \"moves\" that must occur in order for a person to reduce psychosocial dissonance felt at the onset of genocide, and these moves transform people into their \"genocidal selves.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> These moves include the dehumanization of victims, the employment of euphemisms to mask violent deeds, the undergoing of moral restructuring, becoming acclimated to the act of killing, and/or denying responsibility for violent actions.<ref name=\":2\" /> The first move, dehumanization, is one of the biggest \"steps,\" as it has been central to every genocide. In [[The Holocaust]], the [[Cambodian genocide]], and the [[Rwandan genocide]], as particularly notable examples, victims were labeled as vermin, cockroaches, rats, or snakes, to separate them entirely from the category of human in this process of dehumanization.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Social psychological factors ===\nIn addition to individual-level cognitive \"moves,\" there are also many social psychological factors that influence an \"ordinary\" group's transformation into killers. First, the concept of social cognition explains the ways in which people think about themselves and those around them, divided into thinking about people as belonging to in-groups and out-groups, defined by collective identity and social bonds.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Woolf|first=Linda M.|last2=Hulsizer|first2=Michael R.|date=2005-03-01|title=Psychosocial roots of genocide: risk, prevention, and intervention|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|volume=7|issue=1|pages=101\u2013128|doi=10.1080/14623520500045088|issn=1462-3528}}</ref> Everyone has a bias for their own group called an [[In-group bias]], but this bias does not usually have negative consequences unless people simultaneously hold both extremely positive views of themselves and their in-group and extremely negative views of out-groups.<ref name=\":3\" /> People are also generally socialized to avoid conflict and aggression with other members of their own in-group, so one way of overcoming that barrier to violence is to redefine who belongs to each group so that victims become excluded from the in-group and are no longer protected by in-group bias.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSocial influence and social relations also constitute factors vulnerable to manipulation. Many cultures actively encourage conformity, compliance, and obedience in social relations and can have sever social penalties for not adhering to those norms, so that group members feel intense pressure to engage in violence if other members are also engaging in it.<ref name=\":3\" /> This tendency for people to conform can be manipulated to induce \"thoughtless behavior\" in large groups of people at once.<ref name=\":4\" /> Research also shows that this pressure to conform, also known as the \"conformity effect,\" increases when there is an authority figure present in the group,<ref name=\":3\" /> and when certain social and institutional contexts increase people's tendency to conform, including the loss of stability, as people tend to adapt to what is expected of them when stability disappears.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Roth|first=Paul A.|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199232116.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199232116-e-11|title=Social Psychology and Genocide|date=2012-09-18|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor-last=Bloxham|editor-first=Donald|volume=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199232116.013.0011|editor-last2=Moses|editor-first2=A. Dirk}}</ref> Other tendencies of human social relationships can similarly push people towards violence, such as prejudice, altruism, and aggression. It is particularly relevant to understand the link between prejudice and violence, as prejudice is often a starting point in the formation of genocidal behavior. The scapegoat theory (or practice of [[Scapegoating]]) helps to explain the relationship, as it posits that people have a tendency to lash out on out-groups when they are frustrated, for example in times of political or economic crisis.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Risk factors for genocide ==\nThere are a variety of political and cultural factors that make states more at risk for movement down a path of mass violence, and an understanding and recognition of the existence of those factors can be crucial in genocide prevention efforts. While studies in this area find varying degrees of risk for each particular factor, there is widespread consensus on which kinds of environments present the greatest risk for the occurrence of genocide. First, certain situational factors like destabilizing crises and political upheaval make countries more vulnerable to genocide.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Brehm|first=Hollie Nyseth|date=2017-01-02|title=Re-examining risk factors of genocide|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|volume=19|issue=1|pages=61\u201387|doi=10.1080/14623528.2016.1213485|issn=1462-3528}}</ref> Forms of political upheaval include civil wars, assassinations, revolutions, coups, defeat in international war, anticolonial rebellions, or any sort of upheaval that results in unconventional regime change or in elites with extremist ideologies coming to power.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> Almost all genocides of the past half-century have occurred either during or in the immediate aftermath of one of these types of political upheaval.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Harff|first=Barbara|date=February 2003|title=No Lessons Learned from the Holocaust? Assessing Risks of Genocide and Political Mass Murder since 1955|journal=American Political Science Review|language=en|volume=97|issue=1|pages=57\u201373|doi=10.1017/S0003055403000522|issn=1537-5943}}</ref> Additionally, the potential for genocidal violence increases when multiple forms of crisis, upheaval, or destabilization occur simultaneously, or when the effect of past instances of crisis remain unresolved.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nPolitical upheaval is particularly dangerous when a repressive leader is able to come to power. Authoritarian leaders can propel entire societies into \"monolithic cultures\" at risk for genocide by incentivizing a strong obedience to the state, a lack of tolerance for diversity, and creating an environment that facilitates [[Groupthink]] and conformity.<ref name=\":3\" /> The most dangerous authoritarian leaders often have extremist views about a new society \"purified\" or unwanted or threatening groups of people,<ref name=\":6\" /> and they promote these ideologies as moral and for the \"greater good\" of the nation, as they classify certain threatening groups as antithetical to national success.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Many such leaders in past genocides, like [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Pol Pot]], and [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], have also shared similar personal characteristics, as charismatic, self-confident, intelligent individuals with a fierce desire for power.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn addition to situational political factors like upheaval and authoritarian leaders and government structures, certain cultural factors also contribute to the likelihood that a state will commit genocide. Cultures that promote the use of aggressive as a normative problem-solving skill, and cultures that glorify violence through things like military parades, for example, have a greater risk of perpetrating mass violence.<ref name=\":3\" /> Similarly, societies with a strong history of supremacy ideologies, including the long-term institutionalization of bias towards outsiders, a lack of acceptance of cultural diversity, and the exclusion of certain groups, are also at greater risk.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Specifically, Barbara Harff's 2003 model on the antecedents to genocide found that in countries with an elite ideology, in which the ruling elite hold an exclusionary vision for the society, are two and half times more likely to commit genocide in the aftermath of a state failure, and also more than two times as likely in states where the political elite constitutes an ethnic minority.<ref name=\":6\" /> Many versions of these types of extreme ideologies are present in historical examples of genocide, including the \"purification\" efforts of the [[Khmer Rouge]] in Cambodia, and [[Nazi Germany]]'s pursuit of an exclusively [[Aryan race]] in their nation.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Early warning signs of genocide ==\n''See also: [[Eight stages of genocide]]''\n\nGregory Stanton, the founding president of [[Genocide Watch]], formulated a well-known list of ten (originally eight) stages of genocide in 1996. These stages do not necessarily occur linearly or exclusively one at a time, but they provide a guiding model to analyze the processes leading to genocide that can be recognized as warning signs and acted upon, as each stage presents an opportunity for certain prevention measures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://observer.com/2017/08/warning-signs-of-mass-violence-in-the-us-charlottesville-syria-burma-rwanda-genocide/|title=Warning Signs of Mass Violence\u2014in the US?|date=2017-08-22|website=Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> Stanton's ten stages include: classification, symbolization, discrimination, dehumanization, organization, polarization, preparation, persecution, extermination, and denial.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Stanton|first=Gregory|date=December 2018|title=What is Genocide?|url=|journal=Genocide Watch|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The first few of these stages happen early in the process of inciting genocide, and thus offer the most opportunity for preventative measures before genocide is already in full force. During the classification stage, where people begin distinguishing within a culture between \"us and them\" designated by race, ethnicity, or nationality, the most important prevention measure is to promote tolerance and understanding, and to promote the widespread use of classifications and common ground that transcend these harmful divisions.<ref name=\":7\" /> In the symbolization stage, in which \"other\" groups are given names or physical symbols to demonstrate their classification, hate symbols, hate speech, and group marking should be outlawed.<ref name=\":7\" /> Once a society progresses to the discrimination stage, where the dominant group, acting on an exclusionary ideology, uses law and political power to deny the rights of the targeted group, the most crucial preventative measure is to ensure full rights and political empowerment for all groups in a society.<ref name=\":7\" /> And the final \"early\" step, before a society actually begins to organize to commit the genocide, is dehumanization, in which one group denies the humanity of the other group. Prevention at this stage should be aimed at ensuring that the incitement to genocide is not confused with protected speech, that hate propaganda is banned, and that any sort of hate crimes or atrocities are promptly punished.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nWhile dehumanization is widely recognized by Stanton and other scholars as a key stage in the process, Rhiannon Neilsen, in a 2015 article in the [[Genocide Studies and Prevention]] journal, argues that \"toxification\" serves as a more precise early warning sign of genocide than dehumanization.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Neilsen|first=Rhiannon|date=2015-05-01|title='Toxification' as a more precise early warning sign for genocide than dehumanization?

She defines toxification as \"the cognitive perception of victims as malignant and carcinogenic pests that must be purged for the survival of the perpetrator, and/or the perpetrators' ideal society,\" so that victims are not only perceived as inhuman targets, but also as a toxic presence that must be destroyed.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThese early warning signs are common across genocidal societies, but their identification is only useful in prevention efforts when actual actions are taken to combat them. One salient example of a failure to act on early warning signs is the [[Rwandan genocide]].

First, the fact that individual member states compose both the general body and the Security Council means that humanitarian goals are effectively secondary to political forces and pressures, as member states pursue their own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /> For example, the United States and the Soviet Union virtually prevented the United Nations from taking action in any areas which they deemed to be of strategic significance during the Cold War.<ref name=\":10\" /> Additionally, many states still argue in favor of the protection of state sovereignty over intervention, even in the face of potential mass killing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Another significant barrier to action on genocidal violence is the reticence to officially invoke the term \"genocide,\" as it appears to be applied selectively and much too slowly to cases of mass violence.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> <br />\n\n== Types of prevention ==\n\n=== Upstream prevention ===\nUpstream prevention, is taking preemptive measures before a genocide occurs to prevent one from occurring. The focus in upstream prevention is determining which countries are at most risk. This is mainly done using risk assessments which are quite accurate predictors. These assessments are used by both NGO's and Governments around the world. Scholars in the field have developed numerous models, each looking at different factors. Arguably one of the most accurate model comes from Barbara Harff. Her model uses factors such as political upheaval, prior genocides, type of government, and infant mortality, among others.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Harff|first=Barbara|date=2003|title=No Lessons Learned from the Holocaust?

Scholars generally agree that prevention before the genocide is the cheapest and most effective.\n\n=== Mid-Stream prevention ===\nMid-stream prevention takes place when a genocide is already taking place. The main focus of Mid-stream prevention, is to end the genocide before it progress's further, taking more lives. This type of prevention often involves military intervention of some sort. Intervention, often is very expensive, and has [[unintended consequences]]. Scholars tend to disagree on the effectiveness of military intervention.

Its focus is on preventing another genocide in the future, thus re-building and restoring the community is the goal. Justice for the victims also plays a major role in repairing communities to prevent a future genocide from occurring. This justice can take various forms with trials being a common form, like [[Nuremberg trials]].  Justice and healing of the community is imperfect and some scholars criticize the imperfections, especially those of trials. Some common criticisms of trials are the retro-activity, selectivity, highly politicized nature trials often have.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Between Vengeance and Forgiveness|last=Minow|first=Martha|publisher=Beacon Press Books|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8070-4507-7|location=|pages=25\u201350}}</ref> Due to the imperfections of trials, healing, and the lifting of taboos when a genocide has been committed in a community, there is an increased risk of atrocity reoccurring.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Genocide prevention and public health ==\nWhile the prevention of genocide is typically approached from a political or national defense angle, the field of public health can also make significant contributions to this effort.

In [[The Holocaust]], the [[Cambodian genocide]], and the [[Rwandan genocide]], as particularly notable examples, victims were labeled as vermin, cockroaches, rats, or snakes, to separate them entirely from the category of human in this process of dehumanization.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Social psychological factors ===\nIn addition to individual-level cognitive \"moves,\" there are also many social psychological factors that influence an \"ordinary\" group's transformation into killers.

Many cultures actively encourage conformity, compliance, and obedience in social relations and can have sever social penalties for not adhering to those norms, so that group members feel intense pressure to engage in violence if other members are also engaging in it.<ref name=\":3\" /> This tendency for people to conform can be manipulated to induce \"thoughtless behavior\" in large groups of people at once.<ref name=\":4\" /> Research also shows that this pressure to conform, also known as the \"conformity effect,\" increases when there is an authority figure present in the group,<ref name=\":3\" /> and when certain social and institutional contexts increase people's tendency to conform, including the loss of stability, as people tend to adapt to what is expected of them when stability disappears.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Roth|first=Paul A.|url=http://oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199232116.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199232116-e-11|title=Social Psychology and Genocide|date=2012-09-18|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor-last=Bloxham|editor-first=Donald|volume=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199232116.013.0011|editor-last2=Moses|editor-first2=A.

It is particularly relevant to understand the link between prejudice and violence, as prejudice is often a starting point in the formation of genocidal behavior.

While studies in this area find varying degrees of risk for each particular factor, there is widespread consensus on which kinds of environments present the greatest risk for the occurrence of genocide.

Authoritarian leaders can propel entire societies into \"monolithic cultures\" at risk for genocide by incentivizing a strong obedience to the state, a lack of tolerance for diversity, and creating an environment that facilitates [[Groupthink]] and conformity.<ref name=\":3\" /> The most dangerous authoritarian leaders often have extremist views about a new society \"purified\" or unwanted or threatening groups of people,<ref name=\":6\" /> and they promote these ideologies as moral and for the \"greater good\" of the nation, as they classify certain threatening groups as antithetical to national success.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Many such leaders in past genocides, like [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Pol Pot]], and [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], have also shared similar personal characteristics, as charismatic, self-confident, intelligent individuals with a fierce desire for power.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn addition to situational political factors like upheaval and authoritarian leaders and government structures, certain cultural factors also contribute to the likelihood that a state will commit genocide. Cultures that promote the use of aggressive as a normative problem-solving skill, and cultures that glorify violence through things like military parades, for example, have a greater risk of perpetrating mass violence.<ref name=\":3\" /> Similarly, societies with a strong history of supremacy ideologies, including the long-term institutionalization of bias towards outsiders, a lack of acceptance of cultural diversity, and the exclusion of certain groups, are also at greater risk.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> Specifically, Barbara Harff's 2003 model on the antecedents to genocide found that in countries with an elite ideology, in which the ruling elite hold an exclusionary vision for the society, are two and half times more likely to commit genocide in the aftermath of a state failure, and also more than two times as likely in states where the political elite constitutes an ethnic minority.<ref name=\":6\" /> Many versions of these types of extreme ideologies are present in historical examples of genocide, including the \"purification\" efforts of the [[Khmer Rouge]] in Cambodia, and [[Nazi Germany]]'s pursuit of an exclusively [[Aryan race]] in their nation.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Early warning signs of genocide ==\n''See also: [[Eight stages of genocide]]''\n\nGregory Stanton, the founding president of [[Genocide Watch]], formulated a well-known list of ten (originally eight) stages of genocide in 1996.

During the classification stage, where people begin distinguishing within a culture between \"us and them\" designated by race, ethnicity, or nationality, the most important prevention measure is to promote tolerance and understanding, and to promote the widespread use of classifications and common ground that transcend these harmful divisions.<ref name=\":7\" /> In the symbolization stage, in which \"other\" groups are given names or physical symbols to demonstrate their classification, hate symbols, hate speech, and group marking should be outlawed.<ref name=\":7\" /> Once a society progresses to the discrimination stage, where the dominant group, acting on an exclusionary ideology, uses law and political power to deny the rights of the targeted group, the most crucial preventative measure is to ensure full rights and political empowerment for all groups in a society.<ref name=\":7\" /> And the final \"early\" step, before a society actually begins to organize to commit the genocide, is dehumanization, in which one group denies the humanity of the other group. Prevention at this stage should be aimed at ensuring that the incitement to genocide is not confused with protected speech, that hate propaganda is banned, and that any sort of hate crimes or atrocities are promptly punished.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nWhile dehumanization is widely recognized by Stanton and other scholars as a key stage in the process, Rhiannon Neilsen, in a 2015 article in the [[Genocide Studies and Prevention]] journal, argues that \"toxification\" serves as a more precise early warning sign of genocide than dehumanization.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Neilsen|first=Rhiannon|date=2015-05-01|title='Toxification' as a more precise early warning sign for genocide than dehumanization? An emerging research agenda|journal=Genocide Studies and Prevention: An International Journal|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83\u201395|doi=10.5038/1911-9933.9.1.1277|issn=1911-0359|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to Neilsen, dehumanization is understood as \"the denial of an individual's essential humanness and identity,\" which situates those individuals \"outside the boundary in which moral values, rules, and considerations of fairness apply.\"<ref name=\":8\" /> In the consensus of genocide literature, this step is considered to be an alarming early warning sign because it overcomes the universal human abhorrence of murder for the perpetrating group, and according to Stanton, is the \"phase where the death spiral of genocide begins.\"<ref name=\":8\" /> However, Nielsen's view is that while dehumanization signals that killing members of a particular group is ''persmissible,'' a better early warning sign is one that alerts when extermination of a group is considered ''necessary.'' She defines toxification as \"the cognitive perception of victims as malignant and carcinogenic pests that must be purged for the survival of the perpetrator, and/or the perpetrators' ideal society,\" so that victims are not only perceived as inhuman targets, but also as a toxic presence that must be destroyed.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThese early warning signs are common across genocidal societies, but their identification is only useful in prevention efforts when actual actions are taken to combat them. One salient example of a failure to act on early warning signs is the [[Rwandan genocide]]. Despite numerous warnings, both indirect and explicit, there was widespread failure on the part of individual nations like the United States and international organizations like the United Nations to take the necessary preventative steps before the genocide was already well underway.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Stanton|first=Gregory|date=2012-11-28|title=The Rwandan Genocide: Why Early Warning Failed|journal=Journal of African Conflicts and Peace Studies|volume=1|issue=2|pages=6\u201325|doi=10.5038/2325-484X.1.2.1|issn=2325-484X|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to Stanton, the facts of the situation were heavily resisted, and governments refused to invoke the term \"genocide\" in order to avoid their duty to act, instead naming it a civil war.<ref name=\":9\" /> The US Secretary of State did not call the mass killings a genocide until June 10, 1994, after most of the killing was already over, and the press and human rights groups also failed to name the crime for what it was until two weeks into the genocide.<ref name=\":9\" />\n== The role of the United Nations ==\n\n=== The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ===\n''Main article: [[Genocide Convention]]''\n\nThe 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (also known as the \"Genocide Convention\") is the principal guiding international legal document for genocide prevention efforts, along with [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide-convention.shtml|title=United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect|website=www.un.org|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> In the aftermath of World War II and the atrocities of the Holocaust, the ratification of the Genocide Convention signaled the international community's commitment to the principle of \"never again\" in terms of its prioritization of genocide prevention.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/un-genocide-convention-fail-70-years-stop-rwanda-bosnia-pol-pot-yazidi-rohingya-a8690131.html|title=Why the UN convention on genocide is still failing, 70 years on|date=2018-12-21|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> \n\n=== International criminal tribunals ===\nIn 1993 and 1994, the United Nations Security Council established two ad-hoc international courts, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] in order to try those indicted for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in the Bosnian and Rwandan genocides.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal|last=Totten|first=Samuel|last2=Bartrop|first2=Paul R.|date=2004-07-01|title=The United Nations and genocide: Prevention, intervention, and prosecution|journal=Human Rights Review|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=8\u201331|doi=10.1007/s12142-004-1025-1|issn=1874-6306}}</ref> Then, in 1998, the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] was adopted, giving the International Criminal Court (ICC) jurisdiction for the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.<ref name=\":10\" />  \n\n=== The Responsibility to Protect ===\nWith the introduction of [[Responsibility to protect]] in 2001 nations have been given more leeway in the prevention of genocide or other mass atrocities. This international norm was signed by all member states of the UN. It gives any other nations the right to step in any way necessary if the state in question fails to protect its citizens from genocide or other crimes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/responsibility.shtml|title=Office of The Special Adviser on The Prevention of Genocide|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> This means that state sovereignty can be violated for the protection of a population if the state is unable or willing to.

First, the fact that individual member states compose both the general body and the Security Council means that humanitarian goals are effectively secondary to political forces and pressures, as member states pursue their own interests.<ref name=\":10\" /> For example, the United States and the Soviet Union virtually prevented the United Nations from taking action in any areas which they deemed to be of strategic significance during the Cold War.<ref name=\":10\" /> Additionally, many states still argue in favor of the protection of the protection of state sovereignty over intervention, even in the face of potential mass killing.<ref name=\":10\" /> Another significant barrier to action on genocidal violence is the reticence to officially invoke the term \"genocide,\" as it appears to be applied selectively and much too slowly to cases of mass violence.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":11\" /> <br />\n\n== Types of prevention ==\n\n=== Upstream prevention ===\nUpstream prevention, is taking preemptive measures before a genocide occurs to prevent one from occurring. The focus in upstream prevention is determining which countries are at most risk. This is mainly done using risk assessments which are quite accurate predictors. These assessments are used by both NGO's and Governments around the world. Scholars in the field have developed numerous models, each looking at different factors. Arguably one of the most accurate model comes from Barbara Harff. Her model uses factors such as political upheaval, prior genocides, type of government, and infant mortality, among others.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Harff|first=Barbara|date=2003|title=No Lessons Learned from the Holocaust? Assessing Risks of Genocide and Political Mass Murder Since 1955|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=97|pages=57\u201373|doi=10.1017/S0003055403000522|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> These assessments of risk are then used to aid nations and take action to stop a mass atrocity from happening. Scholars generally agree that prevention before the genocide is the cheapest and most effective.\n\n=== Mid-Stream prevention ===\nMid-stream prevention takes place when a genocide is already taking place. The main focus of Mid-stream prevention, is to end the genocide before it progress's further, taking more lives. This type of prevention often involves military intervention of some sort. Intervention, often is very expensive, and has [[unintended consequences]]. Scholars tend to disagree on the effectiveness of military intervention. Some claim that military intervention promotes rebel groups or that it is too expensive for the lives it saves.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kuperman|first=Alan|date=2008|title=The Moral Hazard of Humanitarian Intervention: Lessons from the Balkans|url=|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=52|pages=49\u201380|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2478.2007.00491.x|pmid=|access-date=|citeseerx=10.1.1.322.1966}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valentino|first=Benjamin|date=2011|title=The True Costs of Humanitarian Intervention|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Scholars tend to  prefer upstream prevention because it saves lives and doesn't require costly intervention.\n\n=== Downstream prevention ===\nDownstream prevention takes place after a genocide has ended. Its focus is on preventing another genocide in the future, thus re-building and restoring the community is the goal. Justice for the victims also plays a major role in repairing communities to prevent a future genocide from occurring. This justice can take various forms with trials being a common form, like [[Nuremberg trials]].  Justice and healing of the community is imperfect and some scholars criticize the imperfections, especially those of trials. Some common criticisms of trials are the retro-activity, selectivity, highly politicized nature trials often have.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Between Vengeance and Forgiveness|last=Minow|first=Martha|publisher=Beacon Press Books|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8070-4507-7|location=|pages=25\u201350}}</ref> Due to the imperfections of trials, healing, and the lifting of taboos when a genocide has been committed in a community, there is an increased risk of atrocity reoccurring.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== Genocide prevention and public health ==\nWhile the prevention of genocide is typically approached from a political or national defense angle, the field of public health can also make significant contributions to this effort. Genocide, along with other forms of mass atrocity, is inherently an issue of public health, as it has a significant and detrimental impact on population health, both immediately after the violence and in the long term.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Adler|first=Reva N.|last2=Smith|first2=James|last3=Fishman|first3=Paul|last4=Larson|first4=Eric B.|date=2004-12|title=To Prevent, React, and Rebuild: Health Research and the Prevention of Genocide|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1475-6773.2004.00331.x|journal=Health Services Research|language=en|volume=39|issue=6p2|pages=2027\u20132051|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6773.2004.00331.x|issn=0017-9124|pmc=PMC1361111|pmid=15544643}}</ref><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Willis|first=Brian M.|date=2000-08-02|title=Recognizing the Public Health Impact of Genocide|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jama.284.5.612|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=284|issue=5|pages=612|doi=10.1001/jama.284.5.612|issn=0098-7484}}</ref> With regards to the mortality numbers alone, genocide has killed more people than war-related mortality in every historical period.<ref name=\":13\" /> And it also far surpasses the mortality rates of some of the most pressing epidemiological threats.

During genocide, healthcare facilities are often destroyed, doctors and nurses are killed in the violence, and the usual disease prevention efforts of the nation are disrupted, for example, immunization programs, which normally save thousands of lives.<ref name=\":14\" /> Additionally, post-genocidal societies have an increased rate of chronic and acute disease, low birth rates, increased perinatal mortality, and increased malnutrition.<ref name=\":13\" /> The health of genocide survivors also suffers in the long-term, given that significant trauma has both long-lasting psychological and physical effects.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) recognizes this critical link between health and human rights in the area of genocide and its prevention, and urges physicians to approach genocide using public health strategies.<ref name=\":14\" /> Such strategies include documentation of genocide and pre-genocidal conditions through case reports and surveillance, epidemiological studies to assess the impact of genocide on public health, education and spreading awareness about the understanding of genocide and its psychological precursors to the public, to other health professionals, and to policymakers, and advocacy for policies and programs aimed at the prevention of genocide.<ref name=\":14\" /><br />\n== Ongoing prevention efforts ==\n\n=== Early warning project ===\nThe Early Warning Project is an early warning tool developed by [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] and [[Dartmouth College]].

There is no indigenous term for the language; however linguists have adopted the term ''Paamese'' to refer to it. Both a grammar and a dictionary of Paamese have been produced by [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]].\n\n==Classification==\nPaamese is an [[Austronesian language]] of Vanuatu. It is most closely related to [[Southeast Ambrym language|the language]] of Southeastern [[Ambrym]]. The two languages, while sharing 60-70% of the lexical cognate, are not [[mutually intelligible]].\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Paamamap.png|thumb|250px|Paama, neighbouring islands and main centres]]\nPaama itself is a small island in the [[Malampa Province]]. The island is no more than 5&nbsp;km wide and 8&nbsp;km long. There is no running water on the island except after heavy storms.\n\nIn the 1999 census in Vanuatu, 7000 people identified as Paamese. 2000 on the island itself and others through the urban hubs of Vanuatu, particularly [[Port Vila]].\n\n===Dialects/Varieties===\n\nPaamese spoken in different parts of the island (and then those on other islands) does differ slightly phonologically and morphologically but not enough to determine definite \u2018dialects splits\u2019. Even in the extreme north and extreme south, places with the biggest difference, both groups can still communicate fully. There is no question of mutual intelligibility being impaired.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n! Labial\n! Alveolar\n! Velar/Glottal\n|-\n| Prenasalised stop\n| b\n| d\n| g\n|-\n| Oral stop\n| p\n| t\n| k\n|-\n| Nasal\n| m\n| n\n| \u014b\n|-\n| Fricative\n| f\n| s\n| h\n|-\n| Lateral\n|\n| l\n|\n|-\n|Trill\n|\n| r\n|\n|-\n| Glide\n| \n| j\n| w\n|}\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n! front\n! central\n! back\n|-\n| high\n| i i\u02d0\n| \n| u u\u02d0\n|-\n| mid\n| e e\u02d0\n| \n| o o\u02d0\n|-\n| low\n| \n| a a\u02d0\n| \n|}\n\nStress is phonologically distinctive in Paamese.\n\n===Writing system===\n\nThere is a Paamese orthography which has been in use for over 75 years which accurately represents almost all of the consonant phonemes. The only point of difference is the labial fricative, which, although voiceless in most environments, is written {{angle bracket|v}}. The [[velar nasal]] is written with the diagraph {{angle bracket|ng}}. A long vowel is written with a macron over the vowel: {{angle bracket|\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b}}.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Nominal phrases===\n\nIn Paamese nominals can occur in four environments:\n* as verbal subjects with cross-reference on the verb for person and number\n* as verbal objects with cross-reference on the verb for properness.\n* as prepositional objects\n* as heads of nominal phrases with associated adjuncts\n\nThere are four major classes of nominals:\n* Pronouns\n* Indefinites\n* Possessives\n* Nouns\n\n====Pronouns====\nFree pronouns in paamese:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n! SG\n! \n! DL\n! PCL\n! PL\n|-\n| 1\n| inau\n| incl.\n| ialue\n| iatelu\n| iire\n|-\n| \n|\n| excl.\n| komalu\n| komaitelu\n| komai\n|-\n|2\n| kaiko\n| \n| kamilu\n| kamiitelu\n| kamii\n|-\n|3\n| kaie\n| \n| kailue\n| kaitelu\n| kaile\n|}\n\nThe [[paucal]] is generally used for numbers in the range of about 3 to 6, and the plural is generally used for numbers greater than 12. In the range 6 to 12, whether a speaker of Paamese uses paucal or plural is dependent on what the thing being spoken about is contrasted with. For example one\u2019s patrilineage will be referred to paucally when it is contrasted with that of the whole village but plurally when it is contrasted with just the nuclear family. The paucal is also sometimes used even when it is referring to a really big number if it is contrasted with an even bigger number. For example comparing the population of Paama with that of Vanuatu as a whole. However using the paucal with numbers above a dozen is rare.\n\n====Indefinites====\nUnlike other nominals, indefinites can occur not only as nominal phrase heads, but also as adjuncts to other heads. There are two types of indefinites. The first are numerals. When Crowley was writing in 1982 he said that the numeral system of Paamese was not used by anyone under the age of 30 and only rarely by those older than 30. It is unlikely, therefore, that many people use it today.\n\nThe following is a list of the seven non-numeral indefinites in Paamese:\n* sav - another (sg)\n* savosav - other (non-sg)\n* tet\u0101i - any; koa(n), some\n* tei - some of it/them\n* haulu - many/much\n* musav - many/much (archaic)\n\n====Possessives====\n\nAll nouns fall into one of two subclasses using different constructions for [[possession (linguistics)|possession]]. Categories can roughly be defined semantically into [[inalienable possession|alienable and inalienable possession]]. Inalienability, semantically can be described as the relationship held between an animate possessor and an aspect of this possessor which can\u2019t exist independently of that being.\n\nBody parts are the most common inalienable possession but not all body parts are treated as inalienable; internal body parts are largely seen as alienable unless they are perceived to be central to emotions, individuality or maintenance of life itself. This can be explained through the experience of butchering or cooking of animals in which the internal organs are removed and thus alienated from the body. Exusions that are expelled in normal bodily functions are regarded as inalienable while those that are periodically expelled or as a result of sickness are regarded as alienable so bodily fluids such as urine, saliva, blood and excrement are treated as inalienable while sweat, blood clots and ear wax are alienable. An exception to this rule is vomit, however, which is treated as inalienable. Inalienability also extends to relations between people with blood relations being expressed in the alienable possessive construction\n\nInalienable and alienable possessions are marked using different possessive constructions. Inalienable possessions are marked with a possessive suffix attaching directly onto the noun\n\n    NOUN-SUFFIX \n    vatu-k \n    head-1SG \n    \u2018my head\u2019\n\nWhile alienable possessions are marked with a possessive constituent to which the possessive suffix attaches\n\n    NOUN POSS-SUFFIX \n    vakili ona-k \n    canoe POSS-1SG \n    \u2018my canoe\u2019\n\nThe possessive suffix in both subclasses, however, is the same.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n! SG\n! \n! DL\n! PCL\n! PL\n|-\n| 1\n| -k\n| INCL\n| -ralu\n| -ratel\n| -r\n|-\n|\n|\n|EXCL\n| -mal\n| -maitel\n| -mai\n|-\n|2\n| -m\n|\n| -mil\n| -mitel\n| -mi\n|-\n| 3\n| -n\n| After -e\n| -alu\n| -atel\n| -\u00f8\n|-\n|\n|\n| After -a/-o\n| -ialu\n| -iatel\n| -i\n|-\n|\n|\n| After -i/-u\n| -ialu\n| -latel\n| -l\n|}\n\nThese classes are quite rigid and if an inalienable noun, semantically, can be alienated it would still have to be expressed using the inalienable construction.\n\nAlienable possessions can be split into further subclasses represented by the different possessive constituent that the noun takes, again these have a semantic correspondence indicating the relationship between the possessed noun and the possessor\n\n*A-n \u2018his/her/its (to eat); \u2018intended specially for him/her/it\u2019; \u2018specially characteristic of him/her/it\u2019\n*Emo-n \u2018his/her/its (to drink, to wear, to use domestically) \u2019\n*Ese-n \u2018his/her (owned as something that one has planted, as an animal one has reared, or as something kept on one\u2019s own land) \u2019\n*One-n \u2018his/her/its (in all other kinds of possession) \u2019\n\nThese subclasses are not so rigid and a noun can be used with different possessive constituent according to its use.\n\nWhen the possessed noun isn\u2019t a pronoun, the third person singular possessive suffix is attached to the possessed noun, which is then followed by the possessor noun\n\n     Ani emo-n ehon  \n     coconut POSS:POT-3SG child \n     \u2018child\u2019s drinking coconut\u2019\n\nIf the possessed noun is inalienable, the third person singular suffix attaches directly to the noun with the possessor noun following\n\n    Vati-n ehon\n    head-3SG child \n    \u2018child\u2019s head\u2019\n\nNo morpheme of any kind can intervene between a possessive suffix and the possessed noun in this construction.\n\n====Nouns====\n\nThere are five subtypes of nouns in Paamese. The first are individual names of people or animals, that is of some particular person or animal. So Schnookims or Fido rather than cat or dog. Individual names are cross-referenced on the verb in object position with the same suffix used for pronouns (-e/-ie), rather than the suffix used for non-proper objects (-nV).\n\n=====Location nouns=====\nThere are two kinds of location nouns, relative and absolute. The relative nouns are a closed class of 10 words with meanings like above or nearby. The absolute nouns are an open class and refer to some specific location. Location nouns generally occur in the spatial case. Unlike all other nouns, in this case they take a zero marking rather than the preposition \u2018eni\u2019. Relative location nouns are distinguished grammatically from the absolute location nouns on the basis that they can freely enter into prepositionally linked complex nominal phrases while the absolute nouns cannot.\n\n=====Time nouns=====\nTime nouns are distinguished from other nouns grammatically on the basis that they can only be in the oblique or relative case. Like location nouns they come in two delicious flavours. The first can only receive a zero marking in the oblique case while the second can marked with either a zero marking or with the prepositions eni or teni.\n\n=====Descriptive nouns=====\nAre marginal members of the noun category. Semantically the describe some property or quality attributed to something and grammatically they usually behave like adjectives, that is they occur as adjuncts in a copular verb phrase. However unlike adjectives they do occasionally appear in distinctly nominal slots such as in the subject or object position to a verb. Further, unlike an adjective, they cannot simply follow a head noun as an adjunct.\n\n=====Common nouns=====\nCommon nouns are essentially the dumping ground for everything that I haven\u2019t mentioned yet. They are characterised grammatically as not having any of the special grammatical restrictions that apply to the other nouns and also by the verb taking the non-proper suffix (-nV) when a common noun is in the object position. Semantically they include anything that can be considered alienable or inalienable.\n\n===Verb phrases===\n\nPaamese demonstrates extensive [[inflectional morphology]] on verbs, distinguishing between a number of different [[linguistic modality|modal categories]] that are expressed as prefixes. Verb phrases in Paamese are distinguishable as they have as their head a member of the class of verbs followed by its associated verbal adjuncts and modifiers.\n\n====Verb roots====\n\nThe verb root form is bounded on the left by subject-mood prefixes and on the right by inflectional suffixes and the root itself differs in form according to the nature of the environment it occurs in. Verb roots fall into one of six different classes according to the ways that the initial segment inflects. This inflection is demonstrated in the following table.\n\t\t\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Class\n! A\n! B\n! C\n! D\n|-\n| I\n| t-\n| t-\n| r-\n| d-\n|-\n| II\n| k-\n| k-\n| k-\n| g-\n|-\n| III\n| k-\n| \u00d8-\n| k-\n| g-\n|-\n| IV\n| h-\n| h-\n| v-\n| v-\n|-\n|V\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| mu-\n|-\n| VI\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n| \u00d8-\n|}\n\nEach of the four root forms denotes a specific set of morpho-syntactic environments;\n*A\n**as the second part of a compound noun\n*B\n**in all affirmative irrealis moods of the verb\n**when there is some preceding derivational morpheme\n**when there is no preceding morpheme and the verb carries the nominaliser \u2013ene\n*C\n**as an adjunct to a verb phrase head\n*D\n**in the realis mood of the verb\n**in the negative form of the verb\n\nA verb is entered into the lexicon in its A-form.\n\nTransitive verbs can be further subdivided into classes according to the variation of the final segment of the root\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because of this, the negative in Paamese is incompatible with [[imperative mood|imperative]], prohibitive and potential moods. This is due to the fact that these moods, despite being irrealis, do not express any form of expectation that the event will become real from the speaker. \nThere are two distinct constructions of negation: the [[partitive]] and the non-partitive. These constructions differ in that the partitive takes the partitive suffix -tei obligatorily, while non-partitive constructions only take this suffix optionally.\n====== Partitive Negative ======\nThe partitive negative is the most common form of negation in everyday speech. It is used as the negative forms of:\n\n'''Transitive verbs with non-generic objects'''\n\n    Kai rongadei veta \n    3SG 3SG.real.neg.eat.part breadfruit\n    'He didn't eat the breadfruit\n\nThe use of the partitive in these examples expresses that a non-generic object is entirely unaffected by an event, rather than being only partially unaffected (the example above describes the breadfruit being entirely uneaten, as opposed to only some remaining uneaten).\n\n'''Any Intransitive verb'''\n    Inau naromesaitei\n    1SG 1SG.real.neg.sick.part\n    \u2018I am not sick\u2019\n\nUsing the partitive to express intransitive verbs acts to express that the state or event is completely unachieved rather than being partially instead of only being partially achieved.\n\n====== Non-Partitive Negative ======\nThe non-partitive negative is used to as a negator of transitive verbs with generic objects such as:\n\n    Letau kail aropipile pi\n    woman PL 3PL.real.neg.REdup.play marbles\n    \u2018Women never play marbles\u2019\n\n    Lohon kail naromumuas kail\n    child PL 1SG.real.neg.REdup.hit 3PL\n    \u2018I never hit children\u2019\n\nThe above examples are also able to be expressed using the partitive negative construction as seen in the below example:\n\n    Lohon kail naromumuastei kail\n    child PL 1SG.real.neg.REdup.hit.part 3PL\n    \u2018I never hit children\u2019\n\nHowever, this construction has no apparent change in meaning to non-partitive constructions.\n\nAll examples are taken from Crowley, 1982, pp. 140-141.\n\n====Inflectional Suffixes====\n\nThere are three sets of inflectional suffixes; those expressing bound pronominal objects, those expressing the common-proper marking of a free form object, and that which marks the verb as being partitive.\n\n=====Bound Pronominal Objects=====\n\nA singular pronominal object can be expressed as a suffix. There are two sets of bound object markers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Person\n! I\n! II\n|-\n| 1\n| -nau\n| -inau\n|-\n| 2\n| -ko\n| -iko\n|-\n|3\n| -e\n| -ie\n|}\n\nThe first set is used with the greatest number of verbs, the second set is used only with roots ending in \u2013e and those belonging to Class IV (see above). Class I verbs cannot take the first person singular bound object, although they can take the second and third person objects.\n\n=====Common-proper Objects=====\n\nWhen a transitive verb is followed by a free form object, this is cross-referenced on the verb according to whether it is common or proper with certain phonological categories of verb stems. When the object is a name or a pronoun this is marked on certain verbs by the suffix \u2013i/-ie. When the verb has a common object, this is cross-referenced with the suffix \u2013nV\n\n====Reduplication====\n\n[[Reduplication]] has a fairly wide range of semantic functions in Paamese and can in some cases even change the class which a form belongs. When a verb is reduplicated, the new verb can differ semantically from its corresponding unreduplicated form in that it describes an event that is not seen as having a spatial or temporal setting or a single specific patient. When a numeral verb is reduplicated, the meaning is that of distribution. Reduplication can occur in a number of ways, it can reduplicate just the initial syllable, the initial two syllables or the final two syllables with no consistent semantic difference between these three types.\n\n====Adjuncts====\n\nA verb phrase can contain one or more adjuncts always following the head of the verb phrase. All of the inflectional suffixes above attach onto the last filler of the adjunct slot and if there is no adjunct, onto the verb phrase head. There are two different types of adjuncts, tightly bound and loosely bound. A tightly bound adjunct must always be followed by the inflectional suffixes as no constituent can intervene between it and the verb phrase head. Tightly bound adjuncts include prepositional and verbal adjuncts and adjectival adjuncts to a non-copula verb phrase head. A loosely bound adjunct can have inflectional suffixes attached to either the final adjunct or the verb phrase head. All adjuncts to the copula verb, nominal adjuncts in the \u2018cognate object\u2019 construction and modifiers are loosely bound. The \u2018cognate object\u2019 construction is one in which there is an intransitive verb in the position of the head and a loosely bound nominal phrase adjunct following the head. The transitivity of the final adjunct determines the transitivity of the entire verb phrase.\n\n=====The Serial Verb Construction=====\n\nBy far the most common adjunct is a verb stem itself; this construction is called a [[serial verb construction]]. In this construction, prefixes attach to the head and suffixes to the final constituent of the adjunct slot, thus marking this a tightly bound adjunct. It is not often possible to predict the meanings of serial verbs in Paamese and there are a large number of verbal adjuncts which do not occur as heads themselves.\n\n===Clauses===\n\n====Declarative clauses====\nThere are three types of morphosyntactic relationship between phrase-level constituents:\n* '''(NP)(VP)''' A clause may contain one or more NP. The NPs may be subjects, objects, prepositional objects, or a bound complement.\n* '''(NP)(NP)''' NPs may relate to each other as part of a prepositional construction or the bond complement construction.\n* There is also a third type that holds between modifiers and other constituents.\n\n====Yes/no Questions====\nThere are four types of yes/no questions.\n\n=====Intonation Questions=====\nThis takes the syntactic form of a declarative however while a declarative typically ends in falling intonation whereas a rise-fall turns the clause into a question.\n\n=====Opposite Polarity Questions=====\nThis takes the form of a semantically negative declarative clause. This is used as a polite way of asking permission for something.\n\n=====Tag Questions=====\nThis takes the form of a declarative clause with the tag \"aa\" placed at the end. This takes a sharply rising intonation.\n\n=====Opposite Polarity Tag Questions=====\nThere are two different types of opposite polarity tag, \"vuoli\" and \"mukavee\". There is no appreciable difference in meaning between these two forms.\n\n====content questions====\nThese take the form of a declarative clause but insert one of the following words into the syntactic slot that information is being requested about:\n*'''asaa''' asking about nouns with non-human reference\n*'''isei''' asking about nouns with human reference\n*'''kavee''' asking about location nouns, or which of a number on non-human nouns\n*'''nengaise''' asking about time nouns\n\n==Vocabulary/Lexis==\nKinship Terms:\n\n*Tamen- father\n*Latin- mother\n*Auve- grandparent\n*Natin- son/daughter\n*Tuak- brother of a man, sister of a woman\n*Monali- brother of a woman\n*Ahinali- sister of a man\n*Uan- brother/sister in law\n\n[[Bislama]] is contributing to the vocabulary  of Paamese especially for new kinds of technology, items foreign to local paamese and for the slang of the younger generation.

There is no indigenous term for the language; however linguists have adopted the term ''Paamese'' to refer to it. Both a grammar and a dictionary of Paamese have been produced by [[Terry Crowley (linguist)|Terry Crowley]].\n\n==Classification==\nPaamese is an [[Austronesian language]] of Vanuatu. It is most closely related to [[Southeast Ambrym language|the language]] of Southeastern [[Ambrym]]. The two languages, while sharing 60-70% of the lexical cognate, are not [[mutually intelligible]].\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Paamamap.png|thumb|250px|Paama, neighbouring islands and main centres]]\nPaama itself is a small island in the [[Malampa Province]]. The island is no more than 5&nbsp;km wide and 8&nbsp;km long. There is no running water on the island except after heavy storms.\n\nIn the 1999 census in Vanuatu, 7000 people identified as Paamese. 2000 on the island itself and others through the urban hubs of Vanuatu, particularly [[Port Vila]].\n\n===Dialects/Varieties===\n\nPaamese spoken in different parts of the island (and then those on other islands) does differ slightly phonologically and morphologically but not enough to determine definite \u2018dialects splits\u2019. Even in the extreme north and extreme south, places with the biggest difference, both groups can still communicate fully. There is no question of mutual intelligibility being impaired.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n! Labial\n! Alveolar\n!

The only point of difference is the labial fricative, which, although voiceless in most environments, is written {{angle bracket|v}}. The [[velar nasal]] is written with the diagraph {{angle bracket|ng}}. A long vowel is written with a macron over the vowel: {{angle bracket|\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b}}.\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Nominal phrases===\n\nIn Paamese nominals can occur in four environments:\n* as verbal subjects with cross-reference on the verb for person and number\n* as verbal objects with cross-reference on the verb for properness.\n* as prepositional objects\n* as heads of nominal phrases with associated adjuncts\n\nThere are four major classes of nominals:\n* Pronouns\n* Indefinites\n* Possessives\n* Nouns\n\n====Pronouns====\nFree pronouns in paamese:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n!

In the range 6 to 12, whether a speaker of Paamese uses paucal or plural is dependent on what the thing being spoken about is contrasted with. For example one\u2019s patrilineage will be referred to paucally when it is contrasted with that of the whole village but plurally when it is contrasted with just the nuclear family. The paucal is also sometimes used even when it is referring to a really big number if it is contrasted with an even bigger number. For example comparing the population of Paama with that of Vanuatu as a whole. However using the paucal with numbers above a dozen is rare.\n\n====Indefinites====\nUnlike other nominals, indefinites can occur not only as nominal phrase heads, but also as adjuncts to other heads. There are two types of indefinites. The first are numerals. When Crowley was writing in 1982 he said that the numeral system of Paamese was not used by anyone under the age of 30 and only rarely by those older than 30. It is unlikely, therefore, that many people use it today.\n\nThe following is a list of the seven non-numeral indefinites in Paamese:\n* sav - another (sg)\n* savosav - other (non-sg)\n* tet\u0101i - any; koa(n), some\n* tei - some of it/them\n* haulu - many/much\n* musav - many/much (archaic)\n\n====Possessives====\n\nAll nouns fall into one of two subclasses using different constructions for [[possession (linguistics)|possession]]. Categories can roughly be defined semantically into [[inalienable possession|alienable and inalienable possession]]. Inalienability, semantically can be described as the relationship held between an animate possessor and an aspect of this possessor which can\u2019t exist independently of that being.\n\nBody parts are the most common inalienable possession but not all body parts are treated as inalienable; internal body parts are largely seen as alienable unless they are perceived to be central to emotions, individuality or maintenance of life itself. This can be explained through the experience of butchering or cooking of animals in which the internal organs are removed and thus alienated from the body. Exusions that are expelled in normal bodily functions are regarded as inalienable while those that are periodically expelled or as a result of sickness are regarded as alienable so bodily fluids such as urine, saliva, blood and excrement are treated as inalienable while sweat, blood clots and ear wax are alienable. An exception to this rule is vomit, however, which is treated as inalienable. Inalienability also extends to relations between people with blood relations being expressed in the alienable possessive construction\n\nInalienable and alienable possessions are marked using different possessive constructions. Inalienable possessions are marked with a possessive suffix attaching directly onto the noun\n\n    NOUN-SUFFIX \n    vatu-k \n    head-1SG \n    \u2018my head\u2019\n\nWhile alienable possessions are marked with a possessive constituent to which the possessive suffix attaches\n\n    NOUN POSS-SUFFIX \n    vakili ona-k \n    canoe POSS-1SG \n    \u2018my canoe\u2019\n\nThe possessive suffix in both subclasses, however, is the same.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! person\n! SG\n! \n! DL\n! PCL\n! PL\n|-\n| 1\n| -k\n| INCL\n| -ralu\n| -ratel\n| -r\n|-\n|\n|\n|EXCL\n| -mal\n| -maitel\n| -mai\n|-\n|2\n| -m\n|\n| -mil\n| -mitel\n| -mi\n|-\n| 3\n| -n\n| After -e\n| -alu\n| -atel\n| -\u00f8\n|-\n|\n|\n| After -a/-o\n| -ialu\n| -iatel\n| -i\n|-\n|\n|\n| After -i/-u\n| -ialu\n| -latel\n| -l\n|}\n\nThese classes are quite rigid and if an inalienable noun, semantically, can be alienated it would still have to be expressed using the inalienable construction.\n\nAlienable possessions can be split into further subclasses represented by the different possessive constituent that the noun takes, again these have a semantic correspondence indicating the relationship between the possessed noun and the possessor\n\n*A-n \u2018his/her/its (to eat); \u2018intended specially for him/her/it\u2019; \u2018specially characteristic of him/her/it\u2019\n*Emo-n \u2018his/her/its (to drink, to wear, to use domestically) \u2019\n*Ese-n \u2018his/her (owned as something that one has planted, as an animal one has reared, or as something kept on one\u2019s own land) \u2019\n*One-n \u2018his/her/its (in all other kinds of possession) \u2019\n\nThese subclasses are not so rigid and a noun can be used with different possessive constituent according to its use.\n\nWhen the possessed noun isn\u2019t a pronoun, the third person singular possessive suffix is attached to the possessed noun, which is then followed by the possessor noun\n\n     Ani emo-n ehon  \n     coconut POSS:POT-3SG child \n     \u2018child\u2019s drinking coconut\u2019\n\nIf the possessed noun is inalienable, the third person singular suffix attaches directly to the noun with the possessor noun following\n\n    Vati-n ehon\n    head-3SG child \n    \u2018child\u2019s head\u2019\n\nNo morpheme of any kind can intervene between a possessive suffix and the possessed noun in this construction.\n\n====Nouns====\n\nThere are five subtypes of nouns in Paamese. The first are individual names of people or animals, that is of some particular person or animal. So Schnookims or Fido rather than cat or dog. Individual names are cross-referenced on the verb in object position with the same suffix used for pronouns (-e/-ie), rather than the suffix used for non-proper objects (-nV).\n\n=====Location nouns=====\nThere are two kinds of location nouns, relative and absolute. The relative nouns are a closed class of 10 words with meanings like above or nearby. The absolute nouns are an open class and refer to some specific location. Location nouns generally occur in the spatial case. Unlike all other nouns, in this case they take a zero marking rather than the preposition \u2018eni\u2019. Relative location nouns are distinguished grammatically from the absolute location nouns on the basis that they can freely enter into prepositionally linked complex nominal phrases while the absolute nouns cannot.\n\n=====Time nouns=====\nTime nouns are distinguished from other nouns grammatically on the basis that they can only be in the oblique or relative case. Like location nouns they come in two delicious flavours. The first can only receive a zero marking in the oblique case while the second can marked with either a zero marking or with the prepositions eni or teni.\n\n=====Descriptive nouns=====\nAre marginal members of the noun category. Semantically the describe some property or quality attributed to something and grammatically they usually behave like adjectives, that is they occur as adjuncts in a copular verb phrase. However unlike adjectives they do occasionally appear in distinctly nominal slots such as in the subject or object position to a verb. Further, unlike an adjective, they cannot simply follow a head noun as an adjunct.\n\n=====Common nouns=====\nCommon nouns are essentially the dumping ground for everything that I haven\u2019t mentioned yet. They are characterised grammatically as not having any of the special grammatical restrictions that apply to the other nouns and also by the verb taking the non-proper suffix (-nV) when a common noun is in the object position. Semantically they include anything that can be considered alienable or inalienable.\n\n===Verb phrases===\n\nPaamese demonstrates extensive [[inflectional morphology]] on verbs, distinguishing between a number of different [[linguistic modality|modal categories]] that are expressed as prefixes. Verb phrases in Paamese are distinguishable as they have as their head a member of the class of verbs followed by its associated verbal adjuncts and modifiers.\n\n====Verb roots====\n\nThe verb root form is bounded on the left by subject-mood prefixes and on the right by inflectional suffixes and the root itself differs in form according to the nature of the environment it occurs in. Verb roots fall into one of six different classes according to the ways that the initial segment inflects. This inflection is demonstrated in the following table.\n\t\t\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Class\n! A\n! B\n! C\n!

Because of this, the negative in Paamese is incompatible with [[imperative mood|imperative]], prohibitive and potential moods. This is due to the fact that these moods, despite being irrealis, do not express any form of expectation that the event will become real from the speaker. \nThere are two distinct constructions of negation: the [[partitive]] and the non-partitive. These constructions differ in that the partitive takes the partitive suffix -tei obligatorily, while non-partitive constructions only take this suffix optionally.\n====== Partitive Negative ======\nThe partitive negative is the most common form of negation in everyday speech. It is used as the negative forms of:\n\n'''Transitive verbs with non-generic objects'''\n\n    Kai rongadei veta \n    3SG 3SG.real.neg.eat.part breadfruit\n    'He didn't eat the breadfruit\n\nThe use of the partitive in these examples expresses that a non-generic object is entirely unaffected by an event, rather than being only partially unaffected (the example above describes the breadfruit being entirely uneaten, as opposed to only some remaining uneaten).\n\n'''Any Intransitive verb'''\n    Inau naromesaitei\n    1SG 1SG.real.neg.sick.part\n    \u2018I am not sick\u2019\n\nUsing the partitive to express intransitive verbs acts to express that the state or event is completely unachieved rather than being partially instead of only being partially achieved.\n\n====== Non-Partitive Negative ======\nThe non-partitive negative is used to as a negator of transitive verbs with generic objects such as:\n\n    Letau kail aropipile pi\n    woman PL 3PL.real.neg.REdup.play marbles\n    \u2018Women never play marbles\u2019\n\n    Lohon kail naromumuas kail\n    child PL 1SG.real.neg.REdup.hit 3PL\n    \u2018I never hit children\u2019\n\nThe above examples are also able to be expressed using the partitive negative construction as seen in the below example:\n\n    Lohon kail naromumuastei kail\n    child PL 1SG.real.neg.REdup.hit.part 3PL\n    \u2018I never hit children\u2019\n\nHowever, this construction has no apparent change in meaning to non-partitive constructions.\n\nAll examples are taken from Crowley, 1982, pp. 140-141.\n\n====Inflectional Suffixes====\n\nThere are three sets of inflectional suffixes; those expressing bound pronominal objects, those expressing the common-proper marking of a free form object, and that which marks the verb as being partitive.\n\n=====Bound Pronominal Objects=====\n\nA singular pronominal object can be expressed as a suffix. There are two sets of bound object markers.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Person\n! I\n! II\n|-\n| 1\n| -nau\n| -inau\n|-\n| 2\n| -ko\n| -iko\n|-\n|3\n| -e\n| -ie\n|}\n\nThe first set is used with the greatest number of verbs, the second set is used only with roots ending in \u2013e and those belonging to Class IV (see above). Class I verbs cannot take the first person singular bound object, although they can take the second and third person objects.\n\n=====Common-proper Objects=====\n\nWhen a transitive verb is followed by a free form object, this is cross-referenced on the verb according to whether it is common or proper with certain phonological categories of verb stems. When the object is a name or a pronoun this is marked on certain verbs by the suffix \u2013i/-ie. When the verb has a common object, this is cross-referenced with the suffix \u2013nV\n\n====Reduplication====\n\n[[Reduplication]] has a fairly wide range of semantic functions in Paamese and can in some cases even change the class which a form belongs. When a verb is reduplicated, the new verb can differ semantically from its corresponding unreduplicated form in that it describes an event that is not seen as having a spatial or temporal setting or a single specific patient. When a numeral verb is reduplicated, the meaning is that of distribution. Reduplication can occur in a number of ways, it can reduplicate just the initial syllable, the initial two syllables or the final two syllables with no consistent semantic difference between these three types.\n\n====Adjuncts====\n\nA verb phrase can contain one or more adjuncts always following the head of the verb phrase. All of the inflectional suffixes above attach onto the last filler of the adjunct slot and if there is no adjunct, onto the verb phrase head. There are two different types of adjuncts, tightly bound and loosely bound. A tightly bound adjunct must always be followed by the inflectional suffixes as no constituent can intervene between it and the verb phrase head. Tightly bound adjuncts include prepositional and verbal adjuncts and adjectival adjuncts to a non-copula verb phrase head. A loosely bound adjunct can have inflectional suffixes attached to either the final adjunct or the verb phrase head. All adjuncts to the copula verb, nominal adjuncts in the \u2018cognate object\u2019 construction and modifiers are loosely bound. The \u2018cognate object\u2019 construction is one in which there is an intransitive verb in the position of the head and a loosely bound nominal phrase adjunct following the head. The transitivity of the final adjunct determines the transitivity of the entire verb phrase.\n\n=====The Serial Verb Construction=====\n\nBy far the most common adjunct is a verb stem itself; this construction is called a [[serial verb construction]]. In this construction, prefixes attach to the head and suffixes to the final constituent of the adjunct slot, thus marking this a tightly bound adjunct. It is not often possible to predict the meanings of serial verbs in Paamese and there are a large number of verbal adjuncts which do not occur as heads themselves.\n\n===Clauses===\n\n====Declarative clauses====\nThere are three types of morphosyntactic relationship between phrase-level constituents:\n* '''(NP)(VP)''' A clause may contain one or more NP. The NPs may be subjects, objects, prepositional objects, or a bound complement.\n* '''(NP)(NP)''' NPs may relate to each other as part of a prepositional construction or the bond complement construction.\n* There is also a third type that holds between modifiers and other constituents.\n\n====Yes/no Questions====\nThere are four types of yes/no questions.\n\n=====Intonation Questions=====\nThis takes the syntactic form of a declarative however while a declarative typically ends in falling intonation whereas a rise-fall turns the clause into a question.\n\n=====Opposite Polarity Questions=====\nThis takes the form of a semantically negative declarative clause. This is used as a polite way of asking permission for something.\n\n=====Tag Questions=====\nThis takes the form of a declarative clause with the tag \"aa\" placed at the end. This takes a sharply rising intonation.\n\n=====Opposite Polarity Tag Questions=====\nThere are two different types of opposite polarity tag, \"vuoli\" and \"mukavee\". There is no appreciable difference in meaning between these two forms.\n\n====content questions====\nThese take the form of a declarative clause but insert one of the following words into the syntactic slot that information is being requested about:\n*'''asaa''' asking about nouns with non-human reference\n*'''isei''' asking about nouns with human reference\n*'''kavee''' asking about location nouns, or which of a number on non-human nouns\n*'''nengaise''' asking about time nouns\n\n==Vocabulary/Lexis==\nKinship Terms:\n\n*Tamen- father\n*Latin- mother\n*Auve- grandparent\n*Natin- son/daughter\n*Tuak- brother of a man, sister of a woman\n*Monali- brother of a woman\n*Ahinali- sister of a man\n*Uan- brother/sister in law\n\n[[Bislama]] is contributing to the vocabulary  of Paamese especially for new kinds of technology, items foreign to local paamese and for the slang of the younger generation.

His Superboy outfit consists of red sneakers, blue jeans, zippered jacket with the \"S-shield\" and cape attached to the back. \n\nOn designing Jon's Superboy costume, artist Jorge Jimenez said: \"I started trying out some of the more classic designs as a mini homage to the classic Superman, but the guys at DC wanted to experiment with something more casual, as those are the designs that have been working better recently. We are also looking at an incomplete \"Superboy;\" he's not super yet, so it's reasonable to say that if he's only half super, that he should have clothing that's half super. So we started to play around with clothing that I see as popular right now with teenagers. For example, tight ripped jeans, at least in Spain, are very popular right now and I think they give a lot of mobility to the character when I draw him on the page. I've also used a popular shoe design. I must mention that I like putting effort into what I wear personally, so this way I was able to add a bit of myself to the character. The short length of the cape gives it a younger look, and the zipped hoodie\u2026 I did that thinking they might make a real version for people to wear.

However, Jon's power instability was, in fact, the result of [[Manchester Black]]'s manipulation.

After his last battle, Superman removed his powers using gold kryptonite, he settled down and married Lois and lived an anonymous normal life under the alias, Jordan Elliot. He and Lois had a son named Jonathan, who inherited his father's super power.\n*In the [[Elseworlds]] graphic novel ''[[Son of Superman]]'', Jon Kent is a 15-year-old teenage boy who never knew his father Clark Kent or that he was the superhero, Superman, as his father disappeared before he was born.

Jon dons a costume inspired by his father's, and later successfully rescues his father from a secret facility where he is being held as a prisoner. Superman reunites with his family. When it's revealed that [[Lex Luthor]] was responsible for Superman's capture, Jon teams up with his father to stop Lex. After a prolonged battle, Lex is defeated. Superman decides to temporarily retire from being a superhero and focus more on his family. This leaves Jon to be the first of a new generation of superheroes.\n*In the New 52 ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' book, Jon is the Superman of the future, who was put into captivity for study by Brother Eye with the rest of the future Justice League.

When Lois was pregnant with her son, Joel, Lex Luthor and [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] exposed her to Gold Kryptonite radiation, causing Joel to be born without any of his father's powers. Their daughter Kara, began developing superpowers at age 6 and eventually took on the superhero identity of [[Supergirl]]. Joel gains powers from a formula created by Luthor, and is manipulated into killing his sister before dying from the formula's side effects, leaving his own son to be raised by Batman's son Bruce Wayne Jr.\n*In the Elseworlds series ''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', Adam Kent, the son of Lois and Superman, born shortly after a mysterious plague which nearly kills the entire male population.

His Superboy outfit consists of red sneakers, blue jeans, zippered jacket with the \"S-shield\" and cape attached to the back. \n\nOn designing Jon's Superboy costume, artist Jorge Jimenez said: \"I started trying out some of the more classic designs as a mini homage to the classic Superman, but the guys at DC wanted to experiment with something more casual, as those are the designs that have been working better recently. We are also looking at an incomplete \"Superboy;\" he's not super yet, so it's reasonable to say that if he's only half super, that he should have clothing that's half super. So we started to play around with clothing that I see as popular right now with teenagers. For example, tight ripped jeans, at least in Spain, are very popular right now and I think they give a lot of mobility to the character when I draw him on the page. I've also used a popular shoe design. I must mention that I like putting effort into what I wear personally, so this way I was able to add a bit of myself to the character. The short length of the cape gives it a younger look, and the zipped hoodie\u2026 I did that thinking they might make a real version for people to wear.

However, Jon's power instability was, in fact, the result of [[Manchester Black]]'s manipulation. After Black is defeated, Jon's powers are restored to normal.\n\nAccording to Batman, Jon's mixed biology could have the potential of him becoming more powerful than his father, Superman.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer=Tomasi, Peter J; Gleason, Patrick|penciller=Gleason, Patrick|Story=Black Dawn: Part 1|Title=Superman|volume=4|Issue=20|date=June 2017}}</ref> Due to Jon's young age, his powers and control often fluctuate with his emotions.

After his last battle, Superman removed his powers using gold kryptonite, he settled down and married Lois and lived an anonymous normal life under the alias, Jordan Elliot. He and Lois had a son named Jonathan, who inherited his father's super power.\n*In the [[Elseworlds]] graphic novel ''[[Son of Superman]]'', Jon Kent is a 15-year-old teenage boy who never knew his father Clark Kent or that he was the superhero, Superman, as his father disappeared before he was born. When a solar storm's radiation triggers his Kryptonian powers, he learns the truth about his father from his mother Lois Lane. Jon dons a costume inspired by his father's, and later successfully rescues his father from a secret facility where he is being held as a prisoner. Superman reunites with his family. When it's revealed that [[Lex Luthor]] was responsible for Superman's capture, Jon teams up with his father to stop Lex. After a prolonged battle, Lex is defeated. Superman decides to temporarily retire from being a superhero and focus more on his family. This leaves Jon to be the first of a new generation of superheroes.\n*In the New 52 ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' book, Jon is the Superman of the future, who was put into captivity for study by Brother Eye with the rest of the future Justice League. It's unknown what happened to his father. Jon's costume and role are the same as his father's from his appearance in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' animated series, though Jon is younger than his father was in the cartoon.\n*In the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]'', after Superman returns to Earth after five years, he learns that Lois is engaged to Richard White (the nephew of editor-in-chief Perry White) and the two share a young son, '''Jason White'''. When the boy begins to exhibit superpowers, he is revealed to be the son of Superman.\n*In [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s Elseworlds comic book series ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', Superman and Lois have two children, '''Joel''' and '''Kara Kent'''. When Lois was pregnant with her son, Joel, Lex Luthor and [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] exposed her to Gold Kryptonite radiation, causing Joel to be born without any of his father's powers. Their daughter Kara, began developing superpowers at age 6 and eventually took on the superhero identity of [[Supergirl]]. Joel gains powers from a formula created by Luthor, and is manipulated into killing his sister before dying from the formula's side effects, leaving his own son to be raised by Batman's son Bruce Wayne Jr.\n*In the Elseworlds series ''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', '''Adam Kent''', the son of Lois and Superman, born shortly after a mysterious plague which nearly kills the entire male population. Adam possesses the same superpowers as his father Superman.\n*'''Clark Kent Jr.''' first appeared in ''[[World's Finest Comics|World's Finest]]'' #154 (Dec. 1965).<ref>{{Cite comic| writer=Edmond Hamilton|penciller=Curt Swan|Story=The Sons of Superman and Batman|Title=World's Finest|Issue=154|date=December 1965}}</ref> The character has appeared in various stories in DC comics as the son of Superman and Lois Lane.

Scholars generally believe the earliest indigenous populations of Anatolia were the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]].

The city's history dates to before 2000 BC.]]\nUnlike the Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Hittites]] were centred at [[Hattusa]] (modern Bo\u011fazkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the [[Hittite language]], or ''nesili'' (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. The Hittites originated of local ancient cultures that grew in Anatolia, in addition to the arrival of Indo-European languages. Attested for the first time in the Assyrian tablets of [[K\u00fcltepe|Nesa]] around 2000BC, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted [[Kurgan theory]] on the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]], however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European [[ancient Anatolians]]) were themselves relatively recent [[Indo-European migrations|immigrants]] to Anatolia from the north. However, they did not necessarily displace the population genetically, they would rather assimilate into the former peoples' culture, preserving the Hittite language.\n\n[[File:14 century BC Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East during the 14th century BC]]\nThe Hittites adopted the [[cuneiform script]], invented in Mesopotamia. During the Late Bronze Age circa 1650 BC, they created a kingdom, the [[Hittites#New Kingdom|Hittite New Kingdom]], which became an empire in the 14th century BC after the conquest of [[Kizzuwatna]] in the south-east and the defeat of the [[Assuwa league]] in western Anatolia. The empire reached its height in the 13th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor, northwestern [[Syria]] and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as a non-Indo-European people, the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal [[Kaskians]], had established themselves there, displacing earlier [[Palaic language|Palaic-speaking]] Indo-Europeans.<ref>Carruba, O.

[[Luwian language|Their language]] belonged to the same linguistic branch as [[Hittite language|Hittite]].<ref>Melchert 2003</ref> The general consensus amongst scholars is that Luwian was spoken across a large area of western Anatolia, including (possibly) [[Wilusa]] ([[Troy]]), the Seha River Land (to be identified with the [[Gediz River|Hermos]] and/or [[Bak\u0131r\u00e7ay|Kaikos]] valley), and the kingdom of Mira-Kuwaliya with its core territory of the Maeander valley.<ref>Watkins 1994; id. 1995:144\u201351; Starke 1997; Melchert 2003; for the geography Hawkins 1998</ref> From the 9th century BC, Luwian regions coalesced into a number of states such as [[Lydia]], [[Caria]] and [[Lycia]], all of which had [[Greece|Hellenic]] influence.\n\n====Neo-Assyrian Empire (10th\u20137th centuries BC)====\nFrom the 10th to late 7th centuries BC, much of Anatolia (particularly the southeastern regions) fell to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], including all of the [[Syro-Hittite states]], [[Tabal]], [[Kingdom of Commagene]], the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and swathes of [[Cappadocia]].\n\nThe Neo-Assyrian empire collapsed due to a bitter series of civil wars followed by a combined attack by [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], Scythians and their own [[Babylonia]]n relations. The last Assyrian city to fall was [[Harran]] in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of [[Babylon]], the Assyrian [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]]. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based [[Medes|Median Empire]], with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.\n\n====Cimmerian and Scythian invasions (8th\u20137th centuries BC)====\nFrom the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]].

Scholars continue to debate the cause of urban decline in the 6th and 7th centuries variously attributing it to the [[Plague of Justinian]] (541), and the 7th century [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628|Persian incursion]] and [[Arab conquest of the Levant]].<ref name=thonemann>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-866277-8| last = Thonemann| first = Peter ThonemannPeter| title = The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity| volume = 1| chapter = Anatolia| accessdate = 6 December 2018| date = 22 March 2018| chapterurl = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001/acref-9780198662778-e-241| doi = 10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001}}</ref>\n\nIn the ninth and tenth century a resurgent Byzantine Empire regained its lost territories, including even long lost territory such as [[Armenia]] and [[Syria]] (ancient [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Medieval Period===\n[[File:Asia Minor ca 842 AD.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[Byzantine Anatolia]] and the Byzantine-Arab frontier zone in the mid-9th century]]\n[[File:Anatolia1300.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Beyliks and other states around Anatolia, c. 1300.]]\n\nIn the 10 years following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the [[Seljuk Turks]] from Central Asia migrated over large areas of Anatolia, with particular concentrations around the northwestern rim.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Byzantine Empire 1025\u20131204 |last=Angold |first=Michael |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-582-29468-4 |page=117}}</ref> The Turkish language and the Islamic religion were gradually introduced as a result of the Seljuk conquest, and this period marks the start of Anatolia's slow transition from predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking, to predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking (although ethnic groups such as Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians remained numerous and retained Christianity and their native languages). In the following century, the Byzantines managed to reassert their control in western and northern Anatolia.

As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the [[Balkan]] regions and then fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims (Bosnian Muslims, [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pomaks|Muslim Bulgarians]] and [[Greek Muslims]] such as the [[Vallahades]] from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.\n\nA continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, [[Constantinople]] and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe.\n\nFollowing the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire, another migration involved the large Armenian population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from Western Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) toward the Russian Empire, especially toward its newly established Armenian provinces.\n\nAnatolia remained [[multi-ethnic]] until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). During World War I, the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Greek genocide]] (especially in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]), and the [[Assyrian genocide]] almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populations in Anatolia and surrounding regions. Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]], most remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Of the remainder, most have left Turkey since then, leaving fewer than 5,000 Greeks in Anatolia today. Since the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Anatolia has been within Turkey, its inhabitants being mainly Turks and Kurds (see [[demographics of Turkey]] and [[history of Turkey]]).\n\n==Geology==\n{{Main|Geology of Turkey}}\nAnatolia's terrain is structurally complex. A central [[massif]] composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded [[Trough (geology)|troughs]], covered by recent [[Deposit (geology)|deposits]] and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the [[K\u0131z\u0131l River]], the coastal plains of [[\u00c7ukurova]] and the valley floors of the [[Gediz River]] and the [[B\u00fcy\u00fck Menderes River]] as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around [[Lake Tuz]] (Salt Lake) and the [[Konya]] Basin (''Konya Ovasi'').\n\nThere are two mountain ranges in southern Anatolia: the [[Taurus mountains|Taurus]] and the [[Zagros]] mountains.<ref name=wiley>{{Cite book| publisher = John Wiley & Sons| isbn = 978-1-118-94501-8| last1 = Cemen| first1 = Ibrahim| last2 = Yilmaz| first2 = Yucel| title = Active Global Seismology: Neotectonics and Earthquake Potential of the Eastern Mediterranean Region| date = 3 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Turkey}}\n<gallery caption=\"Temperatures of Anatolia\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Klima_ankara.png|[[Ankara]] (central Anatolia)\nFile:Klima_antalya.png|[[Antalya]] (southern Anatolia)\nFile:Klima_van.png|[[Van, Turkey|Van]] (eastern Anatolia)\n</gallery>\n\nAnatolia has a varied range of climates.

The city's history dates to before 2000 BC.]]\nUnlike the Akkadians and their descendants, the Assyrians, whose Anatolian possessions were peripheral to their core lands in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Hittites]] were centred at [[Hattusa]] (modern Bo\u011fazkale) in north-central Anatolia by the 17th century BC. They were speakers of an Indo-European language, the [[Hittite language]], or ''nesili'' (the language of Nesa) in Hittite. The Hittites originated of local ancient cultures that grew in Anatolia, in addition to the arrival of Indo-European languages. Attested for the first time in the Assyrian tablets of [[K\u00fcltepe|Nesa]] around 2000BC, they conquered Hattusa in the 18th century BC, imposing themselves over Hattian- and Hurrian-speaking populations. According to the widely accepted [[Kurgan theory]] on the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]], however, the Hittites (along with the other Indo-European [[ancient Anatolians]]) were themselves relatively recent [[Indo-European migrations|immigrants]] to Anatolia from the north. However, they did not necessarily displace the population genetically, they would rather assimilate into the former peoples' culture, preserving the Hittite language.\n\n[[File:14 century BC Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East during the 14th century BC]]\nThe Hittites adopted the [[cuneiform script]], invented in Mesopotamia.

The empire reached its height in the 13th century BC, controlling much of Asia Minor, northwestern [[Syria]] and northwest upper Mesopotamia. They failed to reach the Anatolian coasts of the Black Sea, however, as a non-Indo-European people, the semi-nomadic pastoralist and tribal [[Kaskians]], had established themselves there, displacing earlier [[Palaic language|Palaic-speaking]] Indo-Europeans.<ref>Carruba, O.

The last Assyrian city to fall was [[Harran]] in southeast Anatolia. This city was the birthplace of the last king of [[Babylon]], the Assyrian [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]]. Much of the region then fell to the short-lived Iran-based [[Medes|Median Empire]], with the Babylonians and Scythians briefly appropriating some territory.\n\n====Cimmerian and Scythian invasions (8th\u20137th centuries BC)====\nFrom the late 8th century BC, a new wave of Indo-European-speaking raiders entered northern and northeast Anatolia: the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]].

As the Ottoman Empire further shrank in the [[Balkan]] regions and then fragmented during the [[Balkan Wars]], much of the non-Christian populations of its former possessions, mainly Balkan Muslims (Bosnian Muslims, [[Albanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Pomaks|Muslim Bulgarians]] and [[Greek Muslims]] such as the [[Vallahades]] from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Greek Macedonia]]), were resettled in various parts of Anatolia, mostly in formerly Christian villages throughout Anatolia.\n\nA continuous reverse migration occurred since the early 19th century, when Greeks from Anatolia, [[Constantinople]] and Pontus area migrated toward the newly independent Kingdom of Greece, and also towards the United States, southern part of the Russian Empire, Latin America and rest of Europe.\n\nFollowing the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) and the incorporation of the Eastern Armenia into the Russian Empire, another migration involved the large Armenian population of Anatolia, which recorded significant migration rates from Western Armenia (Eastern Anatolia) toward the Russian Empire, especially toward its newly established Armenian provinces.\n\nAnatolia remained [[multi-ethnic]] until the early 20th century (see the [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]]). During World War I, the [[Armenian Genocide]], the [[Greek genocide]] (especially in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]), and the [[Assyrian genocide]] almost entirely removed the ancient indigenous communities of [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] populations in Anatolia and surrounding regions. Following the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]], most remaining ethnic Anatolian Greeks were forced out during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Of the remainder, most have left Turkey since then, leaving fewer than 5,000 Greeks in Anatolia today.

Purposeful speaking therefore involves a trade-off of costs and benefits.\n** The [[principle of least effort]] tends to result in phonetic reduction of speech forms. See [[vowel reduction]], [[cluster reduction]], [[lenition]], and [[elision]]. After some time a change may become widely accepted (it becomes a regular [[sound change]]) and may end up treated as [[standard language|standard]]. For instance: ''going to'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261o\u028a.\u026a\u014b.t\u028a]}} \u2192 ''gonna'' {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u0254n\u0259]}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u028cn\u0259]}}, with examples of both vowel reduction {{IPA|[\u028a] \u2192 [\u0259]}} and elision {{IPA|[nt] \u2192 [n]}}, {{IPA|[o\u028a.\u026a] \u2192 [\u028c]}}.\n* Expressiveness: Common or overused language tends to lose its emotional or rhetorical intensity over time; therefore, new words and constructions are continuously employed to revive that intensity<ref name=\"Deutscher\"/>\n* [[Analogy#Linguistics|Analogy]]: Over time, speech communities unconsciously apply patterns of rules in certain words, sounds, etc. to unrelated other words, sounds, etc.\n* [[Language contact]]: Words and constructions are borrowed from one language into another.<ref name=\"llas.ac.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.llas.ac.uk/resources/gpg/2784|title=The teaching of pidgin and Creole studies - LLAS Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>\n* Geographic separation: When people with one language move away from each other, the language will gradually diverge into separate dialects, due to different experiences.<ref name=Cambridge>''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' (1997, p. 335)</ref>\n* [[Culture|Cultural environment]]: As a culture evolves, new places, situations, and objects inevitably enter its language, whether or not the culture encounters different people.\n* Migration/Movement: Speech communities, moving into a region with a new or more complex linguistic situation, will influence, and be influenced by, language change; they sometimes even end up with entirely new languages, such as pidgins and creoles.<ref name=\"llas.ac.uk\"/>\n* Imperfect learning: According to one view, children regularly learn the adult forms imperfectly, and the changed forms then turn into a new standard. Alternatively, imperfect learning occurs regularly in one part of society, such as an immigrant group, where the minority language forms a [[substratum]], and the changed forms can ultimately influence majority usage.<ref name=Cambridge/>\n* Social prestige: Language may not only change towards features that have more [[social prestige]], but also away from ones with negative prestige,<ref name=Cambridge/> as in the case of the [[Rhoticity in English|loss of rhoticity]] in the British [[Received Pronunciation]] accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialectblog.com/2012/10/07/was-received-pronunciation-ever-rhotic/|title=Was Received Pronunciation Ever Rhotic?|last=Ben|date=7 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Such movements can go back and forth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/the-fall-of-the-r-less-class|title=The fall of the r-less class - Macmillan|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Guy Deutscher (linguist)|Guy Deutscher]], the tricky question is \"Why are changes not brought up short and stopped in their tracks? At first sight, there seem to be all the reasons in the world why society should never let the changes through.\" He sees the reason for tolerating change in the fact that we already are used to \"[[Variety (linguistics)|synchronic variation]]\", to the extent that we are hardly aware of it. For example, when we hear the word \"wicked\", we automatically interpret it as either \"evil\" or \"wonderful\", depending on whether it is uttered by an elderly lady or a teenager. Deutscher speculates that \"[i]n a hundred years' time, when the original meaning of 'wicked' has all but been forgotten, people may wonder how it was ever possible for a word meaning 'evil' to change its sense to 'wonderful' so quickly.\"<ref name=\"Deutscher\">The Unfolding of Language, 2005, chapter 2, esp. pp. 63, 69 and 71</ref>\n\n==Types==\nAll languages change continually,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Agrippa\n| first1                = Heinrich Cornelius\n| author-link1          = Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa\n| year              = 1510\n| chapter               = 23: Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst themselves, and with us\n| title                 = De Occulta Philosophia\n|trans-title=Occult Philosophy\n| publication-date      = 1651\n| quote                 = [...] all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions [...].\n}}\n</ref>\nand do so in many and varied ways.\n\nMarcel Cohen details various types of language change under the overall headings of the '''external evolution'''<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 74\u201398\n|quote= [...] the shifting movements of languages in light of whatever knowledge is available of the history of humanity.\n}}\n</ref>\nand '''internal evolution''' of languages.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 98\u2013141\n|quote= Internal evolution [...] is the passing from one system to another.

Throughout [[History of the English language|its history]] English has not only [[loanword|borrowed words]] from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst [[Changes to Old English vocabulary|losing some old words]].\n\n[[lexicographer|Dictionary-writers]] try to keep track of the changes in languages by recording (and, ideally, dating) the appearance in a language of new words, or of new usages for existing words. By the same token, they may tag some words eventually as \"archaic\" or \"obsolete\".\n\nIn the English language, there occurred a shift from common words (e.g. house) towards the use of rarer words (e.g. building), but on a marginal level. Within over 300 years, the relative frequency of words in samples of English and American newspapers decreased only about three units within a possible theoretical range of 208 units that is 1-2%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230}}</ref>{{clarify|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Phonetic and phonological changes===\n{{Main|Sound change|Phonological change}}\n\nThe concept of [[sound change]] covers both phonetic and [[phonology|phonological]] developments.\n\nThe sociolinguist [[William Labov]] recorded the change in [[pronunciation]] in a relatively short period in the American resort of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and showed how this resulted from social tensions and processes.<ref>\n{{cite journal | last1 = Labov | first1 = William \n| year = 1963 | title = The social motivation of a sound change | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/988800917eda494963e28b62f6821d0f51000b84\n| journal = Word | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 273\u2013309 \n| doi = 10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799 \n}}\n</ref>\nEven in the relatively short time that broadcast media have recorded their work, one can observe the difference between the [[Received pronunciation|pronunciation]] of the newsreaders of the 1940s and the 1950s and the pronunciation of today. The greater acceptance and fashionability of [[regional accents]] in  media may{{Original research inline|date=September 2009}} also reflect a more democratic, less formal society \u2014 compare the widespread adoption of [[language policy|language policies]].\n\nThe mapping and recording of small-scale phonological changes poses difficulties, especially as the practical technology of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] dates only from the 19th century. Written texts provide the main (indirect) evidence of how language sounds have changed over the centuries. But note [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s work on postulating the existence and disappearance of [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] as an example of other methods of detecting/reconstructing sound-changes within historical linguistics. Poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm may provide clues to previous phonological habits.\n\n===Spelling changes===\n\nStandardisation of [[spelling]] originated centuries ago.{{Vague|date=October 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Differences in spelling often catch the eye of a reader of a text from a previous century.  The pre-print era had fewer [[literacy|literate]] people: languages lacked fixed systems of orthography, and the handwritten manuscripts that survive often show words spelled according to regional pronunciation and to personal preference.\n<!--- These paragraphs might belong in the entry on [[English orthography]], but it's not clear at all what they have to do with spelling changes over time in languages in general\n\nThe development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century, however, presented printers with dilemmas of standardisation: texts from the fifteenth through to the seventeenth centuries show many internal inconsistencies, with the same word often spelled differently within the same text.  Writers contributed to the variety: famously, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] spelled his own name in many different ways.  Additionally, typesetters sometimes selected various spellings based on [[typographical]] criteria, such as aiming for uniform line-lengths when assembling type pieces on a composing stick.  As typesetters found it easier to make one of the lines of type longer than to make the other lines shorter, word lengths tended to standardize on the longer spellings.\n\nModern English spellings do not result from a single consistent system; rather, they show evidence of previous pronunciations which changed over time. For example, the spelling of words such as \"night\" hints at an older pronunciation, the \"gh\" representing a sound similar to that conveyed by \"ch\" in the Scottish pronunciation of ''loch''. Other examples include the \"k\"-sound once pronounced in words like \"knee\" or \"knight\", and the \"ch\" in \"chicken\" or \"cheese\", which English-speakers once pronounced as 'k'. Note too the use of hard [[yer]]s in older Russian orthography, and phasing out of 'th' in favour of 't' in many German words in the [[{{ill|de|Orthographische Konferenz von 1876}} | spelling reforms of 1876]].\n\nOne could regard many of the conventions of English spelling as stuck in the 15th century: [[William Caxton]] (died ca. 1492) chose the [[East Midlands English|East Midland dialect]] (specifically the [[London]] variety) of English as the basis for his first printed English-language work in 1476. He had to discriminate against many synonyms used in other areas of England (such as [[East Anglia]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Mercia]]). For example, Caxton's public found the Southern word \"eyren\" mutually unintelligible with the Northern equivalent, \"egges\" (modern English: \"eggs\").\n-->\n\n===Semantic changes===\n{{Main|Semantic change}}\n\nSemantic changes  concept given by sajjad haider of uos are shifts in the meanings of existing words. Basic types of semantic change include:\n* [[pejoration]], in which a term's connotations become more negative\n* amelioration, in which a term's connotations become more positive\n* broadening, in which a term acquires additional potential uses\n* narrowing, in which a term's potential uses are restricted\n\nAfter a word enters a language, its meaning can change as through a shift in the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of its connotations. As an example, when \"villain\" entered English it meant 'peasant' or 'farmhand', but acquired the connotation 'low-born' or 'scoundrel', and today only the negative use survives. Thus 'villain' has undergone [[pejoration]]. Conversely, the word \"wicked\" is undergoing amelioration in colloquial contexts, shifting from its original sense of 'evil', to the much more positive one {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} of 'brilliant'.\n\nWords' meanings may also change in terms of the breadth of their semantic domain. Narrowing a word limits its alternative meanings, whereas broadening associates new meanings with it. For example, \"hound\" ([[Old English]] ''hund'') once referred to any dog, whereas in modern English it denotes only a particular type of [[canid]]. On the other hand, the word \"dog\" has been broadened from its Old English root 'dogge', the name of a particular breed, to become the general term for all canines.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0195365542|location=New York, NY|pages=200\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n===Syntactic change===\n{{Main|Syntactic change}}\n\n[[Syntactic change]] is the evolution of the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a [[natural language]].\n\nOver time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Massive changes \u2013 attributable either to [[creolization]] or to [[relexification]] \u2013 may occur both in syntax and in vocabulary. Syntactic change can also be purely language-internal, whether independent within the syntactic component or the eventual result of phonological or morphological change.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Sociolinguistics==\n\nThe [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] Jennifer Coates, following William Labov, describes linguistic change as occurring in the context of linguistic [[heterogeneity]]. She explains that \"[l]inguistic change can be said to have taken place when a new linguistic form, used by some sub-group within a speech community, is adopted by other members of that community and accepted as the norm.\"<ref>Coates, 1992: 169</ref>\n\nCan and Patton (2010) provide a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors. Using weighted least squares regression and a sliding window approach, they show that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language \"reform\" of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems (Lewis, 1999).\n\nCan and Patton (2010), based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of ''ama'' over ''fakat'', both borrowed from Arabic and meaning 'but', and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant), also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors.\n\nKadochnikov (2016) analyzes the political and economic logic behind the development of the Russian language. Ever since the emergence of the unified Russian state in XV-XVI centuries the government played key role in standardizing the Russian language and developing its [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive norms]] with the fundamental goal of ensuring that it can be effciently used as a practical tool in all sorts of legal, judicial, adimistrative and economic affairs throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137325044|title=Languages, Regional Conflicts and Economic Development: Russia.

See [[vowel reduction]], [[cluster reduction]], [[lenition]], and [[elision]].

For example, when we hear the word \"wicked\", we automatically interpret it as either \"evil\" or \"wonderful\", depending on whether it is uttered by an elderly lady or a teenager. Deutscher speculates that \"[i]n a hundred years' time, when the original meaning of 'wicked' has all but been forgotten, people may wonder how it was ever possible for a word meaning 'evil' to change its sense to 'wonderful' so quickly.\"<ref name=\"Deutscher\">The Unfolding of Language, 2005, chapter 2, esp. pp. 63, 69 and 71</ref>\n\n==Types==\nAll languages change continually,<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Agrippa\n| first1                = Heinrich Cornelius\n| author-link1          = Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa\n| year              = 1510\n| chapter               = 23: Of the tongue of Angels, and of their speaking amongst themselves, and with us\n| title                 = De Occulta Philosophia\n|trans-title=Occult Philosophy\n| publication-date      = 1651\n| quote                 = [...] all tongues have, and do undergo various mutations, and corruptions [...].\n}}\n</ref>\nand do so in many and varied ways.\n\nMarcel Cohen details various types of language change under the overall headings of the '''external evolution'''<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 74\u201398\n|quote= [...] the shifting movements of languages in light of whatever knowledge is available of the history of humanity.\n}}\n</ref>\nand '''internal evolution''' of languages.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last= Cohen\n|first= Marcel\n|authorlink= Marcel Cohen\n|others= Translated by Leonard Muller\n|title= Language: its structure and evolution\n|origyear= 1970\n|year= 1975\n|publisher= Souvenir Press (Educational & Academic)\n|location= London\n|isbn= 978-0-285-64779-4\n|pages= 98\u2013141\n|quote= Internal evolution [...] is the passing from one system to another.

Throughout [[History of the English language|its history]] English has not only [[loanword|borrowed words]] from other languages but has re-combined and recycled them to create new meanings, whilst [[Changes to Old English vocabulary|losing some old words]].\n\n[[lexicographer|Dictionary-writers]] try to keep track of the changes in languages by recording (and, ideally, dating) the appearance in a language of new words, or of new usages for existing words. By the same token, they may tag some words eventually as \"archaic\" or \"obsolete\".\n\nIn the English language, there occurred a shift from common words (e.g. house) towards the use of rarer words (e.g. building), but on a marginal level. Within over 300 years, the relative frequency of words in samples of English and American newspapers decreased only about three units within a possible theoretical range of 208 units that is 1-2%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Form|first=Sven|date=2018-01-30|title=Reaching Wuthering Heights with Brave New Words: The Influence of Originality of Words on the Success of Outstanding Best-Sellers|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|language=en|doi=10.1002/jocb.230}}</ref>{{clarify|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Phonetic and phonological changes===\n{{Main|Sound change|Phonological change}}\n\nThe concept of [[sound change]] covers both phonetic and [[phonology|phonological]] developments.\n\nThe sociolinguist [[William Labov]] recorded the change in [[pronunciation]] in a relatively short period in the American resort of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and showed how this resulted from social tensions and processes.<ref>\n{{cite journal | last1 = Labov | first1 = William \n| year = 1963 | title = The social motivation of a sound change | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/988800917eda494963e28b62f6821d0f51000b84\n| journal = Word | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 273\u2013309 \n| doi = 10.1080/00437956.1963.11659799 \n}}\n</ref>\nEven in the relatively short time that broadcast media have recorded their work, one can observe the difference between the [[Received pronunciation|pronunciation]] of the newsreaders of the 1940s and the 1950s and the pronunciation of today. The greater acceptance and fashionability of [[regional accents]] in  media may{{Original research inline|date=September 2009}} also reflect a more democratic, less formal society \u2014 compare the widespread adoption of [[language policy|language policies]].\n\nThe mapping and recording of small-scale phonological changes poses difficulties, especially as the practical technology of [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] dates only from the 19th century. Written texts provide the main (indirect) evidence of how language sounds have changed over the centuries. But note [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s work on postulating the existence and disappearance of [[laryngeal theory|laryngeals]] in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] as an example of other methods of detecting/reconstructing sound-changes within historical linguistics. Poetic devices such as rhyme and rhythm may provide clues to previous phonological habits.\n\n===Spelling changes===\n\nStandardisation of [[spelling]] originated centuries ago.{{Vague|date=October 2016}}{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Differences in spelling often catch the eye of a reader of a text from a previous century.  The pre-print era had fewer [[literacy|literate]] people: languages lacked fixed systems of orthography, and the handwritten manuscripts that survive often show words spelled according to regional pronunciation and to personal preference.\n<!--- These paragraphs might belong in the entry on [[English orthography]], but it's not clear at all what they have to do with spelling changes over time in languages in general\n\nThe development of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century, however, presented printers with dilemmas of standardisation: texts from the fifteenth through to the seventeenth centuries show many internal inconsistencies, with the same word often spelled differently within the same text.  Writers contributed to the variety: famously, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] spelled his own name in many different ways.  Additionally, typesetters sometimes selected various spellings based on [[typographical]] criteria, such as aiming for uniform line-lengths when assembling type pieces on a composing stick.  As typesetters found it easier to make one of the lines of type longer than to make the other lines shorter, word lengths tended to standardize on the longer spellings.\n\nModern English spellings do not result from a single consistent system; rather, they show evidence of previous pronunciations which changed over time. For example, the spelling of words such as \"night\" hints at an older pronunciation, the \"gh\" representing a sound similar to that conveyed by \"ch\" in the Scottish pronunciation of ''loch''. Other examples include the \"k\"-sound once pronounced in words like \"knee\" or \"knight\", and the \"ch\" in \"chicken\" or \"cheese\", which English-speakers once pronounced as 'k'. Note too the use of hard [[yer]]s in older Russian orthography, and phasing out of 'th' in favour of 't' in many German words in the [[{{ill|de|Orthographische Konferenz von 1876}} | spelling reforms of 1876]].\n\nOne could regard many of the conventions of English spelling as stuck in the 15th century: [[William Caxton]] (died ca. 1492) chose the [[East Midlands English|East Midland dialect]] (specifically the [[London]] variety) of English as the basis for his first printed English-language work in 1476. He had to discriminate against many synonyms used in other areas of England (such as [[East Anglia]], [[Northumberland]] and [[Mercia]]). For example, Caxton's public found the Southern word \"eyren\" mutually unintelligible with the Northern equivalent, \"egges\" (modern English: \"eggs\").\n-->\n\n===Semantic changes===\n{{Main|Semantic change}}\n\nSemantic changes are shifts in the meanings of existing words. Basic types of semantic change include:\n* [[pejoration]], in which a term's connotations become more negative\n* amelioration, in which a term's connotations become more positive\n* broadening, in which a term acquires additional potential uses\n* narrowing, in which a term's potential uses are restricted\n\nAfter a word enters a language, its meaning can change as through a shift in the [[Valence (psychology)|valence]] of its connotations. As an example, when \"villain\" entered English it meant 'peasant' or 'farmhand', but acquired the connotation 'low-born' or 'scoundrel', and today only the negative use survives. Thus 'villain' has undergone [[pejoration]]. Conversely, the word \"wicked\" is undergoing amelioration in colloquial contexts, shifting from its original sense of 'evil', to the much more positive one {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} of 'brilliant'.\n\nWords' meanings may also change in terms of the breadth of their semantic domain. Narrowing a word limits its alternative meanings, whereas broadening associates new meanings with it. For example, \"hound\" ([[Old English]] ''hund'') once referred to any dog, whereas in modern English it denotes only a particular type of [[canid]]. On the other hand, the word \"dog\" has been broadened from its Old English root 'dogge', the name of a particular breed, to become the general term for all canines.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Historical Linguistics|last=Crowley|first=Terry|last2=Bowern|first2=Claire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0195365542|location=New York, NY|pages=200\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n===Syntactic change===\n{{Main|Syntactic change}}\n\n[[Syntactic change]] is the evolution of the [[syntax|syntactic]] structure of a [[natural language]].\n\nOver time, syntactic change is the greatest modifier of a particular language.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Massive changes \u2013 attributable either to [[creolization]] or to [[relexification]] \u2013 may occur both in syntax and in vocabulary. Syntactic change can also be purely language-internal, whether independent within the syntactic component or the eventual result of phonological or morphological change.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Sociolinguistics==\n\nThe [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] Jennifer Coates, following William Labov, describes linguistic change as occurring in the context of linguistic [[heterogeneity]]. She explains that \"[l]inguistic change can be said to have taken place when a new linguistic form, used by some sub-group within a speech community, is adopted by other members of that community and accepted as the norm.\"<ref>Coates, 1992: 169</ref>\n\nCan and Patton (2010) provide a quantitative analysis of twentieth century Turkish literature using forty novels of forty authors. Using weighted least squares regression and a sliding window approach, they show that, as time passes, words, in terms of both tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. They indicate that the increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the government-initiated language \"reform\" of the 20th century. This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish, especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly coined pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word stems (Lewis, 1999).\n\nCan and Patton (2010), based on their observations of the change of a specific word use (more specifically in newer works the preference of ''ama'' over ''fakat'', both borrowed from Arabic and meaning 'but', and their inverse usage correlation is statistically significant), also speculate that the word length increase can influence the common word choice preferences of authors.\n\nKadochnikov (2016) analyzes the political and economic logic behind the development of the Russian language. Ever since the emergence of the unified Russian state in XV-XVI centuries the government played key role in standardizing the Russian language and developing its [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive norms]] with the fundamental goal of ensuring that it can be effciently used as a practical tool in all sorts of legal, judicial, adimistrative and economic affairs throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137325044|title=Languages, Regional Conflicts and Economic Development: Russia.
