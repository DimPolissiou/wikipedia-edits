The series, featuring the characters of Detective Sergeant [[George Bulman (fictional character)|George Bulman]] ([[Don Henderson]]) and his assistant Detective Constable Derek Willis (Dennis Blanch), was a spin-off from the 1976 TV series ''[[The XYY Man]]'', adapted from the novels of [[Kenneth Royce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishdrama.org.uk/bulman.html|title=..: THE STRANGERS / THE XYY MAN / BULMAN :..|website=www.britishdrama.org.uk}}</ref> The series was first suggested by [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] executives, who in 1977, outlined their plan to devise a new series to feature the regular characters of Bulman and Willis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediagems.de/01filmtv/bulman_engl.html|title=Strangers & Bulman|website=www.mediagems.de}}</ref>\n\nThe series began life as a fairly standard police drama, with Bulman positioned as its eccentric lead. The series' premise centred around a group of police officers, including Bulman and Willis, known as 'Unit 23', who are brought together from different parts of the country to [[Manchester]] to infiltrate areas and investigate crimes that familiar local detectives could not.<ref>https://www.memorabletv.com/tv/strangers-itv-1978-don-henderson/</ref> Five series were broadcast, with the final episode airing on 20 October 1982. Following the series, a further spin-off, simply entitled ''[[Bulman]]'', ran for two series on ITV. The series follows Bulman, again played by Don Henderson, as he continues to dabble in private detective work after retiring from the police force. All five series of ''Strangers'' were released on DVD via [[Network Distributing]] as a complete box set on 19 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Strangers-Complete-DVD-Don-Henderson/dp/B002KAIW3U/|title=Strangers - The Complete Series|date=19 October 2009|publisher=|via=Amazon}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\nInitially, the 'Unit 23' team consisted of Bulman, Willis and WDC Linda Doran ([[Frances Tomelty]]). Their local liaison was provided by Detective Sergeant David Singer ([[John Ronane]]), while their superior officer was Detective Chief Inspector Rainbow ([[David Hargreaves (actor)|David Hargreaves]]). Despite being based around a comparatively small team of detectives, a regular feature of the programme in its early years was that few episodes featured the entire team, with most using just two or three of the regulars in any major role. The second series, shown in early 1979, introduced the character of WDC Vanessa Bennett, played by [[Fiona Mollison]], who replaced the outgoing Frances Tomelty. David Hargreaves would also depart the show following this series.\n\nFor the third series, Bulman, Willis, Bennett and the newly promoted Detective Inspector Singer became members of the 'Inner City Squad', under the command of Detective Chief Superintendent Jack Lambie ([[Mark McManus]]). The basic premise was similar, but rather than covering just the north west of England, the team's remit now extended to the whole country. By the fourth series, Bulman had also gained promotion to Detective Chief Inspector. This series also re-introduced the semi-regular character of William 'Bill' Dugdale ([[Thorley Walters]]), a member of the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Service]]s who would become involved when there was a political or intelligence aspect to the investigation. His role was not necessarily to help the detectives; that would only happen when it was in the government's interest for them to succeed.\n\n==Production==\nThe first series was shot primarily on videotape, with only location footage shot on film. The second series would feature even more film, with the opening episode ''The Wheeler Dealers'' being shot entirely on film, and the final episode, ''Marriages, Deaths And Births'', being shot entirely on film bar the title sequence and a small number of scenes at the police station. From the third series onwards, the entire production moved to 16mm film. \n\nThe first series incorporated a number of writers, with only [[Leslie Duxbury]] writing more than one episode. He would later contribute one further script for the second series. During series two, series creator \n[[Murray Smith (writer)|Murray Smith]] came to the fore as the principal writer, having only previously scripted one episode for the first series. Smith went on to write all but six of the remaining twenty-five episodes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Don Henderson]] as DS/DCI [[George Bulman (fictional character)|George Bulman]]\n* Dennis Blanch as DC/DS Derek Willis\n* [[Frances Tomelty]] as WDC Linda Doran (Series 1\u20142)\n* [[John Ronane]] as DS/DI David Singer (Series 1\u20144)\n* [[David Hargreaves (actor)|David Hargreaves]] as DCI Rainbow (Series 1\u20142)\n* [[Fiona Mollison]] as WDC Vanessa Bennett (Series 2\u20145)\n* [[Mark McManus]] as DCS Jack Lambie (Series 3\u20145)\n* [[Bruce Bould]] as DI Tom Casey (Series 3)\n* [[Thorley Walters]] as William 'Bill' Dugdale (Series 3\u20145)\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series 1 (1978)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#FFFFFF;\"\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 1\n | Title= The Paradise Set\n | Aux1= Murray Smith\n | Aux2= Carole Wilks\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|6|5|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= Arriving in Manchester to work on their new patch as 'strangers' to the local underworld, Bulman and Willis investigate a jewel robbery.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 2\n | Title= Duty Roster\n | Aux1= Ivor Marshall\n | Aux2= Oliver Horsburgh\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|6|12|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= A routine assignment to follow up muggings of a local postman lead Bulman and Willis to a much bigger case, much to Rainbow's annoyance.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 3\n | Title= Silver Lining\n | Aux1= Steve Wakeham\n | Aux2= [[Bill Gilmour (director)|Bill Gilmour]]\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|6|19|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= Bulman becomes a bookie and Doran gets a job in a tipster's office to uncover a case of race fixing. \n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 4\n | Title= Accidental Death\n | Aux1= [[Brian Finch]]\n | Aux2= Nicky Cooney\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|6|26|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= When a prominent local journalist is murdered, Doran goes undercover as a reporter on his old desk, and Willis becomes a coroner's officer.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 5\n | Title= Briscoe\n | Aux1= Leslie Duxbury\n | Aux2= Yvonne Goode\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|7|3|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= Bulman is assigned to establish whether the suspicious practices of a uniform branch sergeant point to him being crooked.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 6\n | Title= Right and Wrong\n | Aux1= [[Cecil Taylor (playwright)|Cecil Taylor]]\n | Aux2= J.

All five series of ''Strangers'' were released on DVD via [[Network Distributing]] as a complete box set on 19 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Strangers-Complete-DVD-Don-Henderson/dp/B002KAIW3U/|title=Strangers - The Complete Series|date=19 October 2009|publisher=|via=Amazon}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\nInitially, the 'Unit 23' team consisted of Bulman, Willis and WDC Linda Doran ([[Frances Tomelty]]). Their local liaison was provided by Detective Sergeant David Singer ([[John Ronane]]), while their superior officer was Detective Chief Inspector Rainbow ([[David Hargreaves (actor)|David Hargreaves]]). Despite being based around a comparatively small team of detectives, a regular feature of the programme in its early years was that few episodes featured the entire team, with most using just two or three of the regulars in any major role. The second series, shown in early 1979, introduced the character of WDC Vanessa Bennett, played by [[Fiona Mollison]], who replaced the outgoing Frances Tomelty. David Hargreaves would also depart the show following this series.\n\nFor the third series, Bulman, Willis, Bennett and the newly promoted Detective Inspector Singer became members of the 'Inner City Squad', under the command of Detective Chief Superintendent Jack Lambie ([[Mark McManus]]). The basic premise was similar, but rather than covering just the north west of England, the team's remit now extended to the whole country. By the fourth series, Bulman had also gained promotion to Detective Chief Inspector. This series also re-introduced the semi-regular character of William 'Bill' Dugdale ([[Thorley Walters]]), a member of the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Service]]s who would become involved when there was a political or intelligence aspect to the investigation. His role was not necessarily to help the detectives; that would only happen when it was in the government's interest for them to succeed.\n\n==Production==\nThe first series was shot primarily on videotape, with only location footage shot on film. The second series would feature even more film, with the opening episode ''The Wheeler Dealers'' being shot entirely on film, and the final episode, ''Marriages, Deaths And Births'', being shot entirely on film bar the title sequence and a small number of scenes at the police station. From the third series onwards, the entire production moved to 16mm film. \n\nThe first series incorporated a number of writers, with only [[Leslie Duxbury]] writing more than one episode. He would later contribute one further script for the second series. During series two, series creator \n[[Murray Smith (writer)|Murray Smith]] came to the fore as the principal writer, having only previously scripted one episode for the first series. Smith went on to write all but six of the remaining twenty-five episodes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Don Henderson]] as DS/DCI [[George Bulman (fictional character)|George Bulman]]\n* Dennis Blanch as DC/DS Derek Willis\n* [[Frances Tomelty]] as WDC Linda Doran (Series 1\u20142)\n* [[John Ronane]] as DS/DI David Singer (Series 1\u20144)\n* [[David Hargreaves (actor)|David Hargreaves]] as DCI Rainbow (Series 1\u20142)\n* [[Fiona Mollison]] as WDC Vanessa Bennett (Series 2\u20145)\n* [[Mark McManus]] as DCS Jack Lambie (Series 3\u20145)\n* [[Bruce Bould]] as DI Tom Casey (Series 3)\n* [[Thorley Walters]] as William 'Bill' Dugdale (Series 3\u20145)\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series 1 (1978)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#FFFFFF;\"\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 1\n | Title= The Paradise Set\n | Aux1= Murray Smith\n | Aux2= Carole Wilks\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|6|5|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= Arriving in Manchester to work on their new patch as 'strangers' to the local underworld, Bulman and Willis investigate a jewel robbery.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 2\n | Title= Duty Roster\n | Aux1= Ivor Marshall\n | Aux2= Oliver Horsburgh\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|6|12|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= A routine assignment to follow up muggings of a local postman lead Bulman and Willis to a much bigger case, much to Rainbow's annoyance.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 3\n | Title= Silver Lining\n | Aux1= Steve Wakeham\n | Aux2= [[Bill Gilmour (director)|Bill Gilmour]]\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|6|19|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= Bulman becomes a bookie and Doran gets a job in a tipster's office to uncover a case of race fixing. \n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 4\n | Title= Accidental Death\n | Aux1= [[Brian Finch]]\n | Aux2= Nicky Cooney\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|6|26|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= When a prominent local journalist is murdered, Doran goes undercover as a reporter on his old desk, and Willis becomes a coroner's officer.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 5\n | Title= Briscoe\n | Aux1= Leslie Duxbury\n | Aux2= Yvonne Goode\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1978|7|3|df=y}}\n | ShortSummary= Bulman is assigned to establish whether the suspicious practices of a uniform branch sergeant point to him being crooked.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 6\n | Title= Right and Wrong\n | Aux1= [[Cecil Taylor (playwright)|Cecil Taylor]]\n | Aux2= J.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>.

Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref><ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W.

Wilder]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Lightning Brigade''', also known as '''Wilder's Brigade''' or the '''Hatchet Brigade''' was a novel, for the US Army formation in the [[American Civil War]], [[mounted infantry]] [[brigade]] in the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Cumberland]] from March 8, 1863 through the November of 1863. Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D. Atkins\n* [[98th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|98th Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col John J. Funkhouser ('''w'''), Ltc Edward Kitchell\n* [[123rd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|123rd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col James Monroe\n* [[17th Indiana Infantry Regiment|17th Indiana Mounted Infantry]]: Maj William T. Jones\n* [[72nd Regiment Indiana Infantry|72nd Indiana Mounted Infantry]]: Col Abram O. Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Fisby</ref>. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref><ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W.

President William Howard Taft made American support a priority.  From the 1920s, the economy focused on exploitation of natural resources. The [[Natural rubber|rubber]] industry, specifically the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone Company]], dominated the economy. Until 1980, Liberia was controlled politically by descendants of the original African-American settlers, known collectively as [[Americo-Liberians]], who were a small minority of the population. From 1980 to 2006, the [[1980 Liberian coup d'\u00e9tat|violent overthrow of the Americo-Liberian regime]] would led to years of civil war that devastated the country and its economy.\n\n==Early history (pre-1821)==\n{{unref|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Map of West Coast of Africa 1830.jpg|thumb|Map of Liberia circa 1830]]\nHistorians believe that many of the [[indigenous peoples]] of Liberia migrated there from the north and east between the 12th and 16th centuries AD.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=hcmv-I-M7kkC&pg=PP2&lpg=PP2&dq=%22Historians+believe+that+many+of+the+indigenous+peoples+of+Liberia+migrated+there+from+the+north+and+east+between+the+12th+and+16th+centuries+AD&source=bl&ots=JjXMthShoE&sig=ACfU3U08ONaoQ9cav4qB_vDx6fpdsBK88w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7xcbQ6v7nAhUhZxUIHcIvCwcQ6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Historians%20believe%20that%20many%20of%20the%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20Liberia%20migrated%20there%20from%20the%20north%20and%20east%20between%20the%2012th%20and%2016th%20centuries%20AD&f=false|title=Background notes, Liberia|date=1982|publisher=U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Public Affairs, Office of Public Communication, Editorial Division|language=en}}</ref> Portuguese explorers established contacts with people of the land later known as \"Liberia\" as early as 1462.  They named the area ''Costa da Pimenta'' ([[Pepper Coast]]), or [[Grain Coast]], because of the abundance of [[Aframomum melegueta|melegueta pepper]], which became desired in European cooking.\n\nIn 1602 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] established a trading post at [[Grand Cape Mount]] but destroyed it a year later. In 1663, the British installed trading posts on the [[Pepper Coast]]. No further known settlements by non-African colonists occurred until the arrival in 1821 of free blacks from the United States.\n\n==Colonization (1821\u20131847)==\n{{main|American Colonization Society}}\nFrom around 1800, in the United States, people opposed to slavery were planning ways to achieve freedom of more slaves and, ultimately, to abolish the institution. At the same time, slaveholders in the South opposed having free blacks in their states, as they believed the free people threatened the stability of their slave societies. While they were gradually freed in the North, the former slaves and other free blacks suffered considerable social and legal discrimination. Some Northern states and territories prohibited or severely restricted entry by [[free people of color]].<ref name=\"pbs._Race\">{{Cite web |title=Race-based legislation |author= |work=pbs.org |date= |access-date=27 February 2019 |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2957.html |language= |quote=In Illinois there were severe restrictions on free blacks entering the state, and Indiana barred them altogether.

Some considered blacks physically and mentally inferior to whites, and others believed that the racism and societal polarization resulting from slavery were insurmountable obstacles for integration of the races. [[Thomas Jefferson]] was among those who proposed colonization in Africa: relocating free blacks outside the new nation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schwarz|first=Benjamin|date=March 1997|title=What (Thomas) Jefferson Helps to Explain|journal=[[The Atlantic|The Atlantic Monthly]]|volume=279}}</ref>\n\n===Colonies in Africa===\n[[File:Paul Cuffee4.jpg|right|thumb|Paul Cuffee in 1812.]]\nIn 1787, Britain had started to resettle the black poor of London in the colony of [[Freetown]] in modern-day [[Sierra Leone]]. Many were [[Black Loyalists]], former American slaves who had been freed in exchange for their services during the American Revolution. The Crown also offered resettlement to former slaves whom they had first resettled in [[Nova Scotia]]. The Black Loyalists there found both the discrimination and climate hard to bear. (See [[Black Nova Scotians]].) Wealthy African-American shipowner [[Paul Cuffe]] thought that colonization was worth supporting. Aided by support from certain members of Congress and British officials, he transported 38 American blacks to Freetown in 1816 at his own expense. He died in 1817, but his private initiative helped arouse public interest in the idea of colonization.<ref>Charles Henry Huberich, ''The political and legislative history of Liberia'' (1947) p 56.</ref>\n\nThe [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) was founded in 1817 by Virginia politician [[Charles F. Mercer]] and Presbyterian minister [[Robert Finley]] of New Jersey. The goal of the ACS was to settle free blacks outside of the United States; its method was to help them relocate to Africa.<ref name=WDL />\n\nStarting in January 1820, the ACS sent ships from New York to West Africa. The first had 88 free black emigrants and three white ACS agents on board. The agents were to find an appropriate area for a settlement. Additional ACS representatives arrived in the [[American Colonization Society#Second ship:the Nautilus|second ACS ship, the ''Nautilus'']]. In December 1821, they acquired [[Cape Mesurado]], a {{convert|36|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} strip of land near present-day [[Monrovia]], from the indigenous ruler [[Zolu Duma|King Peter]] (perhaps with some threat of force).<ref>{{cite book | last=Staudenraus | first=P.

In addition, they suffered from disease, the harsh climate, lack of food and medicine, and poor housing conditions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schick |first=Tom W. |title=Behold the Promised Land: A History of Afro-American Settler Society in Nineteenth-Century Liberia |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1980}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1835, five more colonies were created by the colonization societies of five different states in the U.S. ([[Republic of Maryland]], [[Kentucky-in-Africa]], [[Mississippi in Africa]], [[Louisiana, Liberia]], and that set up by the Pennsylvania state colonization society), and one{{which|date=December 2019}} by the U.S. government in the vicinity of the ACS settlement. The first colony on Cape Mesurado was extended along the coast as well as inland, sometimes by use of force against the native tribes. In 1838 these settlements{{which|date=December 2019}} came together to create the Commonwealth of Liberia. [[Monrovia]] was named the capital.<ref name=WDL /> By 1842, four of the other American settlements{{which|date=December 2019}} were incorporated into Liberia, and the fifth{{what|date=December 2019}} was destroyed by indigenous people. The colonists of African-American descent became known as [[Americo-Liberian]]s. Many were of mixed race, including European ancestry. They remained African Americans in their education, religion, and culture, and they did not identify with the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]], non-Christian peoples.<ref>Teah Wulah, ''Back to Africa: A Liberian Tragedy'' (2009) p 432.</ref>\n\n===High mortality===\nEmigrants to Liberia suffered the highest mortality rate of any country since modern record-keeping began.<ref name=\"McDaniel 1992\" /><ref name=\"McDaniel 1995\" /> Of the 4,571 emigrants who arrived in Liberia from 1820 to 1843, only 1,819 survived until 1843.<ref name=\"Shick 1971\" /><ref name=\"Shick 1980\" /> The ACS knew of the high death rate, but continued to send more people to the colony. Professor Shick writes:<ref name=\"Shick 1971\" />\n\n{{Quote|text=[T]he organization continued to send people to Liberia while very much aware of the chances for survival. The organizers of the A.C.S. considered themselves to be humanitarians performing the work of God. This attitude prevented them from accepting certain realities of their crusade. Any problems, including those of disease and deaths, were viewed as the trials and tribulations that God provides as a means of testing the fortitude of man. After every report of disaster in Liberia the managers simply renewed their efforts. Once the organization was formed and the auxiliaries established, a new force developed which also prevented the Society from admitting the seriousness of the mortality problem. The desire to perpetuate the existence of the corporate body became a factor. To have admitted that the mortality rate made the price of emigration far too high to be continued would have meant the end of the organization. The managers were seemingly unprepared to advise the termination of their project and by extension, their own jobs.}}\n\n===Handing over command to Americo-Liberians===\nThe ACS administrators gradually gave the maturing colony more self-governance. In 1839, it was reorganized into the Commonwealth of Liberia. In 1841, the Commonwealth's first non-white governor, [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], was appointed by ACS's governing board. In early 1847, the ACS directed Liberian leadership to declare independence. On July 26, 1847, eleven signatories to the [[Liberian Declaration of Independence]] established the free and independent Republic of Liberia.\n\n==Americo-Liberian rule (1847\u20131980)==\nBetween 1847 and 1980, the state of Liberia was dominated by the small minority of black colonists and their descendants, known collectively as [[Americo-Liberians]]. The Americo-Liberian minority, many of whom were [[mixed race]] African Americans, tended to marry within their group. They had established plantations and businesses, and were generally richer than the indigenous people of Liberia and exercised overwhelming political power.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=315}}\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:Map of Liberian Republic 1856.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Liberia {{circa}}1856]]\nPolitically, Liberia was dominated by two political parties. The Americo-Liberians had limited the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to prevent indigenous Liberians from voting in elections.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=316}} The [[Republican Party (Liberia)|Liberian Party]] (later the Republican Party), was supported primarily by mixed-race African Americans from poorer backgrounds, while the [[True Whig Party]] received much of its following from richer blacks.{{sfn|Jones|1974|pp=315-6}} From the first presidential election in 1847, the Liberian Party held political dominance. It used its position of power to attempt to cripple its opposition.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=316}}\n\nIn 1869, however, the Whigs won the presidential election under [[Edward James Roye]]. Although Roye was deposed after two years and the Republicans returned to government, the Whigs regained power in 1878. This party maintained power constantly afterward.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=316}}\n\nA series of rebellions among the indigenous Liberian population took place between the 1850s and 1920s. In 1854, a newly independent African-American state in the region, the [[Republic of Maryland]], was forced by an insurgency of the [[Grebo (ethnic group)|Grebo]] and the [[Kru people]] to join Liberia. Liberia's expansion brought the colony into border disputes with French and British colonists in [[French Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]], respectively. The presence and protection of the United States Navy in West Africa until 1916 prevented any military threat to Liberian territory or independence.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=320}}\n\n===Society===\n\n==== Americo-Liberian and indigenous segregation (1847\u20131940) ====\n[[File:LiberiaKing.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Charles D. B.

Although descended from peoples of African origin, the ancestors of Americo-Liberians had been born in the United States for generations before emigrating to Africa; they held American cultural, religious and social values, shaped by their own heritage. Like many Americans and Europeans of the period, the Americo-Liberian held beliefs in the religious superiority of [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]] and the cultural power of systematic oppression over indigenous [[animism]] and culture.\n\nThe Americo-Liberians created communities and social infrastructure closely based on what they knew - American society. They spoke English, and built churches and houses in styles resembling those they were familiar with in the southern United States. Although they never constituted more than five percent of the population of Liberia, they controlled key resources that allowed them to enslave the local native peoples, and control their access to the ocean, modern technical skills, literacy and higher levels of education, and valuable relationships with many United States institutions, including the American government.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Global Impacts of White Racism: Americo-Liberians -|url = http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2009/01/04/global-impacts-of-white-racism-americo-liberians/|website = www.racismreview.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = en-US|date = 2009-01-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190810200411/http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2009/01/04/global-impacts-of-white-racism-americo-liberians/|archive-date = August 10, 2019|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nReflecting the [[Segregation in the United States|system of segregation]] in the United States, the Americo-Liberians created a cultural and racial caste system with themselves at the top and indigenous Liberians at the bottom.

The Liberian Government had long opposed this kind of migration, but was no longer able to restrain it. In the decades after 1945, the Liberian government received hundreds of millions of dollars of unrestricted foreign investment, which destabilized the Liberian economy.

Tubman and his Whig Party continued to repress political opposition, and to rig elections.\n\n===Economics===\n[[File:1862 Liberian One Dollar.jpg|thumb|A one Liberian Dollar banknote from 1862]]\nThe suppression of the slave trade in West Africa by American and British navies after 1808 also produced new settlers, as these two navies would settle liberated slaves in Liberia or Sierra Leone rather than trying to return them to their homelands. In the later 19th century, Liberia had to compete economically with European colonies in Africa. The economy of Liberia was always based on the production of agricultural produce for export. In particular, Liberia's important [[coffee]] industry was destroyed in the 1870s by the emergence of production in [[Brazil]].{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=321}}\n\nNew technology available in Europe increasingly drove Liberian shipping companies out of business.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=321}} Although Roye's government attempted to procure funding for a railway in 1871, the plan never materialized. The first railway was not built until 1945.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=322}} From the late 19th century, European powers such as the United Kingdom and Germany invested in infrastructure in their African colonies, making them more competitive in terms of getting products to market, improving communications, etc.\n\nThe national currency, the [[Liberian dollar]], collapsed in 1907. The country was later forced to adopt the [[United States Dollar]]. The Liberian government was constantly dependent on foreign loans at high rates of exchange, which endangered the country's independence.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=322}}\n\nIn 1926, [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], an American rubber company, started the world's largest rubber plantation in Liberia. This industry created 25,000 jobs, and rubber quickly became the backbone of the Liberian economy; in the 1950s, rubber accounted for 40 percent of the national budget. During the 1930s Liberia signed concession agreements with Dutch, Danish, German and Polish investors in what has been described as an \"open door\" economic policy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fred p.m. van der Kraaij|title=The Open Door Policy of Liberia.

In 1971, Liberia had the world's largest rubber industry, and was the third largest exporter of iron ore. Since 1948, [[Flag of convenience|ship registration]] was another important source of state revenue.\n\nFrom 1962 until 1980, the U.S. donated $280 million in aid to Liberia, in exchange for which Liberia offered its land free of rent for U.S. government facilities. Throughout the 1970s the price of rubber in the world commodities market was depressed, putting pressure on Liberian state finances.\n\n===International relations===\nAfter 1927, the [[League of Nations]] investigated accusations that the Liberian government forcibly recruited and sold indigenous people as contract labor or slaves.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=322}} In its 1930 report the league admonished the Liberian government for \"systematically and for years fostering and encouraging a policy of gross intimidation and suppression\", \"[suppressing] the native, prevent him from realizing his powers and limitations and prevent him from asserting himself in any way whatever, for the benefit of the dominant and colonizing race, although originally the same African stock as themselves.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Report of the International Commission of Inquiry into The Existence of Slavery and Forced Labor in the Republic of Liberia |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington |year=1931}}</ref> (see also [[Charles D.

King]] hastily resigned.\n\n====Relations with the United States====\n{{main|Liberia\u2013United States relations}}\nThe United States had a long history of intervening in Liberia's internal affairs, repeatedly sending naval vessels to help suppress insurrections by indigenous tribes before and after independence (in 1821, 1843, 1876, 1910, and 1915). The United States had lost interest in Liberia after 1876, and the country became closely tied to British capital. Starting in 1909, the U.S. became heavily involved in the country. By 1909, Liberia faced serious external threats to its sovereignty from the British over unpaid foreign loans and annexation of its borderlands.\n\nIn 1912 the U.S. arranged a 40-year international loan of $1.7 million, against which Liberia had to agree to four Western powers (United States, Britain, France and Germany) controlling Liberian Government revenues until 1926. American administration of the border police stabilized the frontier with [[Sierra Leone]] (part of the British Empire) and checked French ambitions to annex more Liberian territory. The American navy established a coaling station in Liberia.<ref name=\"TuckerRoberts2005\">{{cite book|author1=Spencer C.

The major American role was training the Liberian army (known as the  Liberian Frontier Force, using elite black officers from the regular United States Army.  The American presence warned away European imperial powers, defeated a series of local rebellions, and helped bring in American technology to develop the resource-rich interior. Democracy was not a high priority, as the 15,000 Americano-Liberians had full control of 750,000 locals. The Krus and Greboe tribes remained highly reluctant to accept control from Monrovia, but they were not powerful enough to overcome a regime strongly supported by the United States Army and Navy.  The American officers including [[Charles Young (United States Army)|Charles Young]], [[Benjamin O. Davis Sr.|Benjamin Davis]],  and others were skilled at training recruits, helping the government minimize corruption, and advocating loans from American corporations, while monitoring the resulting flow of funds.<ref>Brian G.

It joined the war on the Allied side in 4 August 1917.<ref name=\"TuckerRoberts2005\" />  After its declaration of war, Liberia expelled its resident German merchants. As they constituted the country's largest investors and trading partners,  Liberia suffered economically as a result.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/grebo2.htm | title=Liberian-Grebo War of 1910}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2016}}\n\nIn 1926, the Liberian government gave a concession to the American rubber company [[Charles D. B. King#Firestone Rubber Company|Firestone]] to start the world's largest rubber plantation at [[Harbel]], Liberia. At the same time, Firestone arranged a $5 million private loan to Liberia. In the 1930s Liberia was again virtually bankrupt. After some United States pressure, it agreed to an assistance plan from the [[League of Nations]].  As part of this plan, two key officials of the league were placed in positions to \"advise\" the Liberian government.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Liberia US troops WWII.jpg|thumb|American troops in Liberia during [[World War II]]]]\n{{main|Liberia in World War II}}\nIn 1942, Liberia signed a Defense Pact with the United States. Rubber was a strategically important commodity, and Liberia assured the U.S. and its allies of all the natural rubber they needed. Also, Liberia allowed the U.S. to use its territory as a bridgehead for transports of soldiers and war supplies, to construct military bases, airports, the [[Freeport of Monrovia]], roads to the interior, etc.<ref>{{cite journal |first=William R. |last=Stanley |title=Trans-South Atlantic air link in World War II|journal=GeoJournal|doi=10.1007/BF00806430|volume=33|date=August 1994|accessdate=2007-06-23 |issue=4 |doi-broken-date=2020-01-22 }}</ref> Many of these personnel who passed through Liberia were African-American soldiers (who at the time were in segregated army divisions) being deployed into military service in Europe. The American military presence boosted the Liberian economy; thousands of laborers descended from the interior to the coastal region. The country's huge iron ore deposits were made accessible to commerce.\n\nThe Defense Areas Agreement between the U.S. and Liberia entailed the US-financed construction of Roberts Field airport, the Freeport of Monrovia, and roads into the interior of Liberia.  By the end of World War II, approximately 5,000 American troops had been stationed in Liberia.<ref>Akingbade, Harrison. \u201cU.S Liberian Relations During World War II.\u201d Phylon Vol. 46 (1). 1985.

Liberian president [[William Tubman|Tubman]] was agreeable to this policy.  Between 1946 and 1960 Liberia received some $500 million in unrestricted foreign investment, mainly from the U.S. From 1962 to 1980, the U.S. donated $280 million in aid to Liberia. In the 1970s under president Tolbert, Liberia strove for a more non-aligned and independent posture, and established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and Eastern bloc countries. It also severed ties with Israel during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, but announced it supported American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n===End of Americo-Liberian rule===\nPresident [[William R. Tolbert, Jr.]] pursued a policy of suppressing opposition. Dissatisfaction over governmental plans to raise the price of rice in 1979 led to protest demonstrations in the streets of Monrovia. Tolbert ordered his troops to fire on the demonstrators, and seventy people were killed. Rioting ensued throughout Liberia, finally leading to a military coup d'\u00e9tat in April 1980. Tolbert was killed during the coup, and several of his ministers were executed soon afterwards, marking the end of Americo-Liberian domination of the country.\n\n==Samuel Doe and the People's Redemption Council (1980\u20131989)==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\n{{main|Samuel Doe}}\n\nAfter a bloody overthrow of the Americo-Liberian r\u00e9gime by indigenous Liberians in 1980, a 'Redemption Council' took control of Liberia. Internal unrest, opposition to the new military regime, and governmental repression steadily grew, until in 1989 Liberia sank into outright [[tribalism|tribal]] and civil war.\n\n===Coup d\u2019\u00e9tat; relations with U.S.===\n[[Samuel Doe|Samuel Kanyon Doe]] (1951\u20131990) was a member of the [[Krahn people|Krahn]], a small ethnic group. He was a master sergeant in the Liberian army, and had trained with the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heads of States and Governments Since 1945|last=Harris|first=Lentz|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1884964442|location=New York|pages=516}}</ref> On April 12, 1980, Doe [[1980 Liberian coup d'\u00e9tat|led a bloody coup d'\u00e9tat]] against president [[William R. Tolbert, Jr.|Tolbert]], in which Tolbert and twenty-six of his supporters were murdered. Ten days later, thirteen of Tolbert's Cabinet members were executed publicly. This ended the 133 years of [[Americo-Liberian]] political domination. Doe formed a military regime known as the [[People's Redemption Council]] (PRC). Many welcomed Doe's takeover, since the majority of the population had always been excluded from power. The PRC also for the time being tolerated a relatively free press.\n\nDoe quickly established good relations with the United States, especially after 1981, when U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] took office. Reagan more than tripled Liberia's financial aid, from $20 million in 1979 to $75 million per year. This soon rose to $95 million per annum. Liberia again became an important [[Cold War]] ally of the United States. Liberia protected important U.S. facilities and investments in Africa, and countered the threatened spread of Soviet influence in the continent. Doe closed the [[Libya]]n mission in Monrovia and severed diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. He agreed to modify the mutual defense pact with the U.S., allowing the U.S. staging rights at 24 hours notice to use Liberia's harbors and airports for the [[United States Rapid Deployment Forces|U.S. Rapid Deployment Forces]].\n \nUnder Doe, Liberian ports were opened to American, Canadian, and European merchant ships, which brought in considerable foreign investment from shipping firms and earned Liberia a reputation as a [[tax haven]].\n\n===Fear of counter-coup; repression===\nDoe had to put down seven coup attempts between 1981 and 1985. In August 1981, he had [[Thomas Weh Syen]] and four other PRC members arrested and executed for allegedly conspiring against him. Doe's government then declared amnesty for all political prisoners and exiles, and released sixty political prisoners. \nHowever, there soon were more internal rifts in the PRC. Doe became paranoid about the possibility of a counter-coup, and his government grew increasingly corrupt and repressive, banning all political opposition, shutting down newspapers, and jailing reporters. He began to systematically eliminate PRC members who challenged his authority, and to place people of his own ethnic Krahn background in key positions, which intensified popular anger. Meanwhile, the economy deteriorated precipitously. Popular support for Doe's government evaporated.\n\n===1985 presidential election===\nA draft constitution providing for a multiparty republic had been issued in 1983 and was approved by referendum in 1984. After the referendum, Doe staged a [[Liberia elections, 1985|presidential election]] on October 15, 1985. Nine political parties sought to challenge Doe's National Democratic Party of Liberia (NDPL), but only three were allowed to take part. Prior to the election, more than fifty of Doe's opponents were murdered. Doe was \u2018elected\u2019 with 51% of the vote, but the election was heavily rigged. Foreign observers declared the elections fraudulent, and most of the elected opposition candidates refused to take their seats. \nU.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa [[Chester Crocker]] testified before Congress that the election was imperfect but that at least it was a step toward democracy. He further justified his support for the election results with the claim that, in any case, all African elections were known to be rigged at that time.\n\n===Outbreak of Civil War===\n{{see also|First Liberian Civil War}}\n\nIn November 1985 [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's former second-in-command, with an estimated number 500 to 600 people, failed in an attempt to seize power; all were killed. Doe was sworn in as president on January 6, 1986. Doe then initiated crackdowns against certain tribes, such as the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] (or Dan) and [[Mano people|Mano]], in the north, where most of the coup plotters came from. This government's mistreatment of certain ethnic groups resulted in divisions and violence among indigenous peoples, who until then had coexisted relatively peacefully. \nIn the late 1980s, as fiscal austerity took hold in the United States and the perceived threat of Communism declined with the waning of the Cold War, the U.S. became disenchanted with Doe's government and began cutting off critical foreign aid to Liberia. This, together with the popular opposition, made Doe's position precarious.\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989\u20131996)==\n{{Main|First Liberian Civil War}}\n\nIn the late 1980s opposition from abroad to [[Samuel Doe|Doe]]\u2019s regime led to economic collapse. Doe had already been repressing and crushing internal opposition for some time, when in November 1985 another coup attempt against him failed. Doe retaliated against tribes such as the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] (or Dan) and [[Mano people|Mano]] in the north, where most of the coup plotters had come from. Doe's [[Krahn]] tribe began attacking other tribes, particularly in [[Nimba County]] in the northeast of Liberia, bordering on [[C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire]] (Ivory Coast) and on [[Guinea]]. Some Liberian northerners fled brutal treatment from the Liberian army into the Ivory Coast.\n\n===Charles Taylor and the NPFL (1980\u20131989)===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], born 1948 in Arthington, Liberia, is son of a [[Gola people|Gola]] mother and either an [[Americo-Liberian]] or an [[Afro-Trinidadian]] father.  Taylor was a student at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], U.S.A., from 1972 to 1977, earning a degree in economics. After the 1980 ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' he served some time in Doe's government until he was fired in 1983 on accusation of embezzling government funds. He fled Liberia, was arrested in 1984 in Massachusetts on a Liberian warrant for extradition, and jailed in Massachusetts. He escaped from jail the following year and probably fled to [[Libya]]. In 1989, while in the Ivory Coast, Taylor assembled a group of rebels into the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), mostly from the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and [[Mano people|Mano]] tribes.\n\n===War===\nDecember 1989, the NPFL invaded Nimba County in Liberia. Thousands of Gio and Mano joined them, Liberians of other ethnic background as well. The Liberian army (AFL) counterattacked, and retaliated against the whole population of the region. Mid-1990, a war was raging between Krahn on one side, and Gio and Mano on the other. On both sides, thousands of civilians were massacred.\n\nBy the middle of 1990, Taylor controlled much of the country, and by June laid siege to [[Monrovia]]. In July, [[Yormie Johnson]] split off from NPFL and formed the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL), based around the Gio tribe. Both NPFL and INPFL continued their siege of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1990, the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), an organisation of West African states, created a military intervention force called the [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group]] (ECOMOG) composed of 4,000 troops, to restore order. President Doe and Yormie Johnson (INPFL) agreed to this intervention, Taylor didn't. \nOn September 9, President Doe paid a visit to the barely established headquarters of ECOMOG in the Free Port of Monrovia. While he was at the ECOMOG headquarters, he was attacked by INPFL, taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base, tortured, and killed.\n\nIn November 1990, ECOWAS agreed with some principal Liberian players, but without Charles Taylor, on an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) under President [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]]. Sawyer established his authority over most of Monrovia, with the help of a paramilitary police force, the 'Black Berets', under [[Brownie Samukai]], while the rest of the country was in the hands of the various warring factions.\n\nIn June 1991, former Liberian army fighters formed a rebel group, the [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO). They entered western Liberia in September 1991 and gained territories from the NPFL.\n\n[[File:26th MEU secure Freeport of Monrovia 001.jpg|thumb|American troops secure Freeport of Monrovia, 2003]]\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. On 22 September 1993, the United Nations established the [[United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia]] (UNOMIL) to support ECOMOG in implementing the Cotonou agreement. In March 1994, the Interim Government of [[Amos Sawyer]] was succeeded by a Council of State of six members headed by [[David D. Kpormakpor]]. Renewed armed hostilities broke out in 1994 and persisted. During the course of the year, ULIMO split into two militias: ULIMO-J, a Krahn faction led by [[Roosevelt Johnson]], and ULIMO-K, a Mandigo-based faction under [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]]. Faction leaders agreed to the Akosombo peace agreement in Ghana but with little consequence. In October 1994, the UN reduced its number of UNOMIL observers to about 90 because of the lack of will of combatants to honour peace agreements. In December 1994, the factions and parties signed the Accra agreement, but fighting continued. In August 1995, the factions signed an agreement largely brokered by [[Jerry Rawlings]], Ghanaian President; Charles Taylor agreed. In September 1995, [[David D. Kpormakpor|Kpormakpor]]\u2019s ''Council of State'' was succeeded by one under the civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the factional heads Charles Taylor, Alhaji Kromah, and [[George Boley]] in it. In April 1996, followers of Taylor and Kromah assaulted the headquarters of Roosevelt Johnson in Monrovia, and the peace accord collapsed. In August 1996, a new ceasefire was reached in [[Abuja]], Nigeria. On September 3, 1996, [[Ruth Perry]] followed [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo|Sankawulo]] as chairwoman of the Council of State, with the same three militia leaders in it.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War (1997\u20132003)==\n{{Main|Second Liberian Civil War}}\n\n===Elections 1997===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] won the 1997 presidential elections with 75.33 percent of the vote, while the runner-up, [[Unity Party (Liberia)|Unity Party]] leader [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], received a mere 9.58 percent of the vote. Accordingly, Taylor's [[National Patriotic Party]] gained 21 of a possible 26 seats in the Senate, and 49 of a possible 64 seats in the House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kieh, Jr.|first=George Klay|title=Warlords, Politicians and the Post-First Civil War Election in Liberia|journal=African and Asian Studies|year=2011|volume=10|page=97}}</ref>  The election was judged free and fair by some observers although it was charged that Taylor had employed widespread intimidation to achieve victory at the polls.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n===1997\u20131999===\nBloodshed in Liberia did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violence kept flaring up. During his entire reign, Taylor had to fight insurgencies against his government. Suspicions were rife that Taylor continued to assist rebel forces in neighbouring countries like [[Sierra Leone]], trading weapons for diamonds.\n\n===1999\u20132003===\nSome ULIMO forces reformed themselves as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD), backed by the government of neighbouring [[Guinea]]. In 1999, they emerged in northern Liberia, and in April 2000 they started fighting in [[Lofa County]] in northernmost Liberia. By the spring of 2001, they were posing a major threat to the Taylor government. Liberia was now engaged in a complex three-way conflict with Sierra Leone and the Republic of Guinea.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[United Nations Security Council]] in March 2001 ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1343|Resolution 1343]])<ref name=\"UNSC resolutions 2001\">{{cite web|title=UNSC Resolution 1343|website=UN Security Council|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/scres/2001/sc2001.htm|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>  concluded that Liberia and Charles Taylor played roles in the civil war in Sierra Leone, and therefore: \n* banned all arms sales to, and diamonds sales from Liberia; and\n* banned high Liberian Government members from travel to UN-states.\n\nBy the beginning of 2002, Sierra Leone and Guinea were supporting the LURD, while Taylor was supporting opposition factions in both countries. By supporting Sierra Leonean rebels, Taylor also drew the enmity of the British and Americans.\n\nIn 2003, other elements of the former ULIMO-factions formed another new small rebel group in the Republic of Ivory Coast,  the [[Movement for Democracy in Liberia]] (MODEL), headed by Mr Yayah Nimley, and they emerged in the south of Liberia.\n\n===Women of Liberia===\n{{Main|Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace}}\n[[File:LiberianWomen.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace]].]]\nIn 2002, the women in Liberia were tired of seeing their country torn apart.

August 21, they selected businessman [[Charles Gyude Bryant]] as chair of the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL), effective on October 14. These changes paved the way for the ECOWAS peacekeeping mission to expand into a 3,600-strong force, constituted by [[Benin]], Gambia, [[Ghana]], Guinea-Bissau, [[Mali]], Nigeria, [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]].\n\nOn October 1, 2003, [[UNMIL]] took over the peacekeeping duties from ECOWAS. Some 3,500 West African troops were provisionally \u2018re-hatted\u2019 as United Nations peacekeepers. The UN Secretary-General commended the African Governments who have contributed to UNMIL, as well as the United States for its support to the regional force. October 14, 2003, Blah handed power to Gyude Bryant.\n\nFighting initially continued in parts of the country, and tensions between the factions did not immediately vanish. \nBut fighters were being disarmed; in June 2004, a program to reintegrate the fighters into society began; the economy recovered somewhat in 2004; by year's end, the funds for the re-integration program proved inadequate; also by the end of 2004, more than 100,000 Liberian fighters had been disarmed, and the disarmament program was ended.\n\nIn light of the progress made, President Bryant requested an end to the UN embargo on Liberian diamonds (since March 2001) and timber (since May 2003), but the Security Council postponed such a move until the peace was more secure. Because of a supposed \u2018fundamentally broken system of governance that contributed to 23 years of conflict in Liberia\u2019, and failures of the Transitional Government in curbing corruption, the Liberian government and the [[International Contact Group on Liberia]] signed onto the anti-corruption program [[GEMAP]], starting September 2005.\n\n==Ellen Johnson Sirleaf elected president (2005)==\n{{main|Liberian elections, 2005|Ellen Johnson Sirleaf}} \n[[File:Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf3.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]].]] \nThe transitional government prepared for fair and peaceful democratic elections on October 11, 2005, with UNMIL troops safeguarding the peace. Twenty three candidates stood for the presidential election, with [[George Weah]], international footballer, [[UNICEF]] Goodwill Ambassador and member of the [[Kru people|Kru]] ethnic group, and [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], a former [[World Bank]] economist and finance minister,  Harvard-trained economist and of mixed [[Americo-Liberian]] and indigenous descent. \nIn the first round, no candidate took the required majority, Weah won this round with 28% of the vote. A run-off between the top two vote getters, Weah and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, was necessary.\n\nThe second round of elections took place on November 8, 2005. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf won this runoff decisively. Both the general election and runoff were marked by peace and order, with thousands of Liberians waiting patiently in the Liberian heat to cast their ballots. \nSirleaf claimed victory of this round, winning 59 per cent of the vote. However, Weah alleged electoral fraud, despite international observers declaring the election to be free and fair. Although Weah was still threatening to take his claims to the Supreme Court if no evidence of fraud was found, Johnson-Sirleaf was declared winner on November 23, 2005, and took office on January 16, 2006; becoming the first African woman to do so.\n\n==Recent events (2006\u2013present)==\n\n===Allegations of labor rights abuses by Firestone===\nIn November 2005, the [[International Labor Rights Fund]] filed an Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) case against [[Bridgestone]], the parent company of Firestone, alleging \u201cforced labor\", the modern equivalent of slavery, on the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Plantation in [[Harbel]].<ref name=\"Claim against Firestone\">{{cite web|title=Firestone Claim|website=socialfunds.com|url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1897.html|access-date=July 18, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206205241/http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1897.html|archive-date=February 6, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In May 2006, the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL) released a report: \u201cHuman Rights in Liberia\u2019s Rubber Plantations: Tapping into the Future\u201d which detailed the results of its investigation into the conditions on the Firestone plantation in Liberia.<ref>A redacted copy of the UN report [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/ilrf/liberiarubberUNreport.pdf \u201cHuman Rights in Liberia\u2019s Rubber Plantations: Tapping into the Future\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513125322/https://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/ilrf/liberiarubberUNreport.pdf |date=May 13, 2009 }} can be seen at the Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking website, part of the US Bureau of Labour.</ref> {{Citation not found}}\n\n===Extradition and trial of Charles Taylor, arrest of Bryant===\nUnder international pressure, President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf|Sirleaf]] requested in March 2006 that [[Nigeria]] extradite Charles Taylor, who was then brought before an international tribunal in [[Sierra Leone]] to face charges of [[crimes against humanity]], arising from events during the Sierra Leone civil war (his trial was later transferred to [[The Hague]] for security purposes).

The [[Natural rubber|rubber]] industry, specifically the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone Company]], dominated the economy. Until 1980, Liberia was controlled politically by descendants of the original African-American settlers, known collectively as [[Americo-Liberians]], who were a small minority of the population.

Many were [[Black Loyalists]], former American slaves who had been freed in exchange for their services during the American Revolution. The Crown also offered resettlement to former slaves whom they had first resettled in [[Nova Scotia]]. The Black Loyalists there found both the discrimination and climate hard to bear. (See [[Black Nova Scotians]].) Wealthy African-American shipowner [[Paul Cuffe]] thought that colonization was worth supporting. Aided by support from certain members of Congress and British officials, he transported 38 American blacks to Freetown in 1816 at his own expense. He died in 1817, but his private initiative helped arouse public interest in the idea of colonization.<ref>Charles Henry Huberich, ''The political and legislative history of Liberia'' (1947) p 56.</ref>\n\nThe [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS) was founded in 1817 by Virginia politician [[Charles F. Mercer]] and Presbyterian minister [[Robert Finley]] of New Jersey. The goal of the ACS was to settle free blacks outside of the United States; its method was to help them relocate to Africa.<ref name=WDL />\n\nStarting in January 1820, the ACS sent ships from New York to West Africa. The first had 88 free black emigrants and three white ACS agents on board. The agents were to find an appropriate area for a settlement. Additional ACS representatives arrived in the [[American Colonization Society#Second ship:the Nautilus|second ACS ship, the ''Nautilus'']]. In December 1821, they acquired [[Cape Mesurado]], a {{convert|36|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} strip of land near present-day [[Monrovia]], from the indigenous ruler [[Zolu Duma|King Peter]] (perhaps with some threat of force).<ref>{{cite book | last=Staudenraus | first=P.

In addition, they suffered from disease, the harsh climate, lack of food and medicine, and poor housing conditions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schick |first=Tom W. |title=Behold the Promised Land: A History of Afro-American Settler Society in Nineteenth-Century Liberia |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1980}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1835, five more colonies were created by the colonization societies of five different states in the U.S. ([[Republic of Maryland]], [[Kentucky-in-Africa]], [[Mississippi in Africa]], [[Louisiana, Liberia]], and that set up by the Pennsylvania state colonization society), and one{{which|date=December 2019}} by the U.S. government in the vicinity of the ACS settlement. The first colony on Cape Mesurado was extended along the coast as well as inland, sometimes by use of force against the native tribes. In 1838 these settlements{{which|date=December 2019}} came together to create the Commonwealth of Liberia. [[Monrovia]] was named the capital.<ref name=WDL /> By 1842, four of the other American settlements{{which|date=December 2019}} were incorporated into Liberia, and the fifth{{what|date=December 2019}} was destroyed by indigenous people. The colonists of African-American descent became known as [[Americo-Liberian]]s. Many were of mixed race, including European ancestry. They remained African Americans in their education, religion, and culture, and they did not identify with the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]], non-Christian peoples.<ref>Teah Wulah, ''Back to Africa: A Liberian Tragedy'' (2009) p 432.</ref>\n\n===High mortality===\nEmigrants to Liberia suffered the highest mortality rate of any country since modern record-keeping began.<ref name=\"McDaniel 1992\" /><ref name=\"McDaniel 1995\" /> Of the 4,571 emigrants who arrived in Liberia from 1820 to 1843, only 1,819 survived until 1843.<ref name=\"Shick 1971\" /><ref name=\"Shick 1980\" /> The ACS knew of the high death rate, but continued to send more people to the colony. Professor Shick writes:<ref name=\"Shick 1971\" />\n\n{{Quote|text=[T]he organization continued to send people to Liberia while very much aware of the chances for survival. The organizers of the A.C.S. considered themselves to be humanitarians performing the work of God. This attitude prevented them from accepting certain realities of their crusade. Any problems, including those of disease and deaths, were viewed as the trials and tribulations that God provides as a means of testing the fortitude of man. After every report of disaster in Liberia the managers simply renewed their efforts. Once the organization was formed and the auxiliaries established, a new force developed which also prevented the Society from admitting the seriousness of the mortality problem. The desire to perpetuate the existence of the corporate body became a factor. To have admitted that the mortality rate made the price of emigration far too high to be continued would have meant the end of the organization. The managers were seemingly unprepared to advise the termination of their project and by extension, their own jobs.}}\n\n===Handing over command to Americo-Liberians===\nThe ACS administrators gradually gave the maturing colony more self-governance. In 1839, it was reorganized into the Commonwealth of Liberia. In 1841, the Commonwealth's first non-white governor, [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], was appointed by ACS's governing board. In early 1847, the ACS directed Liberian leadership to declare independence. On July 26, 1847, eleven signatories to the [[Liberian Declaration of Independence]] established the free and independent Republic of Liberia.\n\n==Americo-Liberian rule (1847\u20131980)==\nBetween 1847 and 1980, the state of Liberia was dominated by the small minority of black colonists and their descendants, known collectively as [[Americo-Liberians]]. The Americo-Liberian minority, many of whom were [[mixed race]] African Americans, tended to marry within their group. They had established plantations and businesses, and were generally richer than the indigenous people of Liberia and exercised overwhelming political power.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=315}}\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:Map of Liberian Republic 1856.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Liberia {{circa}}1856]]\nPolitically, Liberia was dominated by two political parties. The Americo-Liberians had limited the [[Suffrage|franchise]] to prevent indigenous Liberians from voting in elections.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=316}} The [[Republican Party (Liberia)|Liberian Party]] (later the Republican Party), was supported primarily by mixed-race African Americans from poorer backgrounds, while the [[True Whig Party]] received much of its following from richer blacks.{{sfn|Jones|1974|pp=315-6}} From the first presidential election in 1847, the Liberian Party held political dominance. It used its position of power to attempt to cripple its opposition.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=316}}\n\nIn 1869, however, the Whigs won the presidential election under [[Edward James Roye]]. Although Roye was deposed after two years and the Republicans returned to government, the Whigs regained power in 1878. This party maintained power constantly afterward.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=316}}\n\nA series of rebellions among the indigenous Liberian population took place between the 1850s and 1920s. In 1854, a newly independent African-American state in the region, the [[Republic of Maryland]], was forced by an insurgency of the [[Grebo (ethnic group)|Grebo]] and the [[Kru people]] to join Liberia. Liberia's expansion brought the colony into border disputes with French and British colonists in [[French Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]], respectively. The presence and protection of the United States Navy in West Africa until 1916 prevented any military threat to Liberian territory or independence.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=320}}\n\n===Society===\n\n==== Americo-Liberian and indigenous segregation (1847\u20131940) ====\n[[File:LiberiaKing.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Charles D. B. King]], 17th President of Liberia (1920\u20131930), with his entourage on the steps of the [[Peace Palace]], The Hague (the Netherlands), 1927.]]\nThe social order in Liberia was dominated by a group of Americo-Liberians. Although descended from peoples of African origin, the ancestors of Americo-Liberians had been born in the United States for generations before emigrating to Africa; they held American cultural, religious and social values, shaped by their own heritage. Like many Americans and Europeans of the period, the Americo-Liberian held beliefs in the religious superiority of [[Protestantism|Protestant Christianity]] and the cultural power of systematic oppression over indigenous [[animism]] and culture.\n\nThe Americo-Liberians created communities and social infrastructure closely based on what they knew - American society. They spoke English, and built churches and houses in styles resembling those they were familiar with in the southern United States. Although they never constituted more than five percent of the population of Liberia, they controlled key resources that allowed them to enslave the local native peoples, and control their access to the ocean, modern technical skills, literacy and higher levels of education, and valuable relationships with many United States institutions, including the American government.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Global Impacts of White Racism: Americo-Liberians -|url = http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2009/01/04/global-impacts-of-white-racism-americo-liberians/|website = www.racismreview.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = en-US|date = 2009-01-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190810200411/http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2009/01/04/global-impacts-of-white-racism-americo-liberians/|archive-date = August 10, 2019|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nReflecting the [[Segregation in the United States|system of segregation]] in the United States, the Americo-Liberians created a cultural and racial caste system with themselves at the top and indigenous Liberians at the bottom.

The Liberian Government had long opposed this kind of migration, but was no longer able to restrain it. In the decades after 1945, the Liberian government received hundreds of millions of dollars of unrestricted foreign investment, which destabilized the Liberian economy. Government revenue rose enormously, but was being grossly embezzled by government officials. Growing economic disparities caused increased hostility between indigenous groups and Americo-Liberians.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Emancipation and Abolition in the Transatlantic World|last=Lansford|first=T.|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Rodriguez|editor-first=J.|location=London, UK|pages=|via=Credo Reference}}</ref>\n\nThe social tensions led President [[William Tubman|Tubman]] to enfranchise the indigenous Liberians either in 1951 or 1963 (accounts differ). Tubman and his Whig Party continued to repress political opposition, and to rig elections.\n\n===Economics===\n[[File:1862 Liberian One Dollar.jpg|thumb|A one Liberian Dollar banknote from 1862]]\nThe suppression of the slave trade in West Africa by American and British navies after 1808 also produced new settlers, as these two navies would settle liberated slaves in Liberia or Sierra Leone rather than trying to return them to their homelands. In the later 19th century, Liberia had to compete economically with European colonies in Africa. The economy of Liberia was always based on the production of agricultural produce for export. In particular, Liberia's important [[coffee]] industry was destroyed in the 1870s by the emergence of production in [[Brazil]].{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=321}}\n\nNew technology available in Europe increasingly drove Liberian shipping companies out of business.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=321}} Although Roye's government attempted to procure funding for a railway in 1871, the plan never materialized. The first railway was not built until 1945.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=322}} From the late 19th century, European powers such as the United Kingdom and Germany invested in infrastructure in their African colonies, making them more competitive in terms of getting products to market, improving communications, etc.\n\nThe national currency, the [[Liberian dollar]], collapsed in 1907. The country was later forced to adopt the [[United States Dollar]]. The Liberian government was constantly dependent on foreign loans at high rates of exchange, which endangered the country's independence.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=322}}\n\nIn 1926, [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], an American rubber company, started the world's largest rubber plantation in Liberia. This industry created 25,000 jobs, and rubber quickly became the backbone of the Liberian economy; in the 1950s, rubber accounted for 40 percent of the national budget. During the 1930s Liberia signed concession agreements with Dutch, Danish, German and Polish investors in what has been described as an \"open door\" economic policy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fred p.m. van der Kraaij|title=The Open Door Policy of Liberia.

In 1971, Liberia had the world's largest rubber industry, and was the third largest exporter of iron ore. Since 1948, [[Flag of convenience|ship registration]] was another important source of state revenue.\n\nFrom 1962 until 1980, the U.S. donated $280 million in aid to Liberia, in exchange for which Liberia offered its land free of rent for U.S. government facilities. Throughout the 1970s the price of rubber in the world commodities market was depressed, putting pressure on Liberian state finances.\n\n===International relations===\nAfter 1927, the [[League of Nations]] investigated accusations that the Liberian government forcibly recruited and sold indigenous people as contract labor or slaves.{{sfn|Jones|1974|p=322}} In its 1930 report the league admonished the Liberian government for \"systematically and for years fostering and encouraging a policy of gross intimidation and suppression\", \"[suppressing] the native, prevent him from realizing his powers and limitations and prevent him from asserting himself in any way whatever, for the benefit of the dominant and colonizing race, although originally the same African stock as themselves.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Report of the International Commission of Inquiry into The Existence of Slavery and Forced Labor in the Republic of Liberia |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |location=Washington |year=1931}}</ref> (see also [[Charles D.

King]] hastily resigned.\n\n====Relations with the United States====\n{{main|Liberia\u2013United States relations}}\nThe United States had a long history of intervening in Liberia's internal affairs, repeatedly sending naval vessels to help suppress insurrections by indigenous tribes before and after independence (in 1821, 1843, 1876, 1910, and 1915). The United States had lost interest in Liberia after 1876, and the country became closely tied to British capital. Starting in 1909, the U.S. became heavily involved in the country. By 1909, Liberia faced serious external threats to its sovereignty from the British over unpaid foreign loans and annexation of its borderlands.\n\nIn 1912 the U.S. arranged a 40-year international loan of $1.7 million, against which Liberia had to agree to four Western powers (United States, Britain, France and Germany) controlling Liberian Government revenues until 1926. American administration of the border police stabilized the frontier with [[Sierra Leone]] (part of the British Empire) and checked French ambitions to annex more Liberian territory. The American navy established a coaling station in Liberia.<ref name=\"TuckerRoberts2005\">{{cite book|author1=Spencer C.

The American presence warned away European imperial powers, defeated a series of local rebellions, and helped bring in American technology to develop the resource-rich interior. Democracy was not a high priority, as the 15,000 Americano-Liberians had full control of 750,000 locals. The Krus and Greboe tribes remained highly reluctant to accept control from Monrovia, but they were not powerful enough to overcome a regime strongly supported by the United States Army and Navy.  The American officers including [[Charles Young (United States Army)|Charles Young]], [[Benjamin O.

B. King#Firestone Rubber Company|Firestone]] to start the world's largest rubber plantation at [[Harbel]], Liberia. At the same time, Firestone arranged a $5 million private loan to Liberia. In the 1930s Liberia was again virtually bankrupt. After some United States pressure, it agreed to an assistance plan from the [[League of Nations]].  As part of this plan, two key officials of the league were placed in positions to \"advise\" the Liberian government.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Liberia US troops WWII.jpg|thumb|American troops in Liberia during [[World War II]]]]\n{{main|Liberia in World War II}}\nIn 1942, Liberia signed a Defense Pact with the United States. Rubber was a strategically important commodity, and Liberia assured the U.S. and its allies of all the natural rubber they needed.

Liberian president [[William Tubman|Tubman]] was agreeable to this policy.  Between 1946 and 1960 Liberia received some $500 million in unrestricted foreign investment, mainly from the U.S. From 1962 to 1980, the U.S. donated $280 million in aid to Liberia. In the 1970s under president Tolbert, Liberia strove for a more non-aligned and independent posture, and established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, China, Cuba and Eastern bloc countries. It also severed ties with Israel during the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, but announced it supported American involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n===End of Americo-Liberian rule===\nPresident [[William R. Tolbert, Jr.]] pursued a policy of suppressing opposition. Dissatisfaction over governmental plans to raise the price of rice in 1979 led to protest demonstrations in the streets of Monrovia. Tolbert ordered his troops to fire on the demonstrators, and seventy people were killed. Rioting ensued throughout Liberia, finally leading to a military coup d'\u00e9tat in April 1980. Tolbert was killed during the coup, and several of his ministers were executed soon afterwards, marking the end of Americo-Liberian domination of the country.\n\n==Samuel Doe and the People's Redemption Council (1980\u20131989)==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\n{{main|Samuel Doe}}\n\nAfter a bloody overthrow of the Americo-Liberian r\u00e9gime by indigenous Liberians in 1980, a 'Redemption Council' took control of Liberia. Internal unrest, opposition to the new military regime, and governmental repression steadily grew, until in 1989 Liberia sank into outright [[tribalism|tribal]] and civil war.\n\n===Coup d\u2019\u00e9tat; relations with U.S.===\n[[Samuel Doe|Samuel Kanyon Doe]] (1951\u20131990) was a member of the [[Krahn people|Krahn]], a small ethnic group. He was a master sergeant in the Liberian army, and had trained with the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heads of States and Governments Since 1945|last=Harris|first=Lentz|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1884964442|location=New York|pages=516}}</ref> On April 12, 1980, Doe [[1980 Liberian coup d'\u00e9tat|led a bloody coup d'\u00e9tat]] against president [[William R. Tolbert, Jr.|Tolbert]], in which Tolbert and twenty-six of his supporters were murdered. Ten days later, thirteen of Tolbert's Cabinet members were executed publicly. This ended the 133 years of [[Americo-Liberian]] political domination. Doe formed a military regime known as the [[People's Redemption Council]] (PRC). Many welcomed Doe's takeover, since the majority of the population had always been excluded from power. The PRC also for the time being tolerated a relatively free press.\n\nDoe quickly established good relations with the United States, especially after 1981, when U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] took office. Reagan more than tripled Liberia's financial aid, from $20 million in 1979 to $75 million per year. This soon rose to $95 million per annum. Liberia again became an important [[Cold War]] ally of the United States. Liberia protected important U.S. facilities and investments in Africa, and countered the threatened spread of Soviet influence in the continent. Doe closed the [[Libya]]n mission in Monrovia and severed diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. He agreed to modify the mutual defense pact with the U.S., allowing the U.S. staging rights at 24 hours notice to use Liberia's harbors and airports for the [[United States Rapid Deployment Forces|U.S. Rapid Deployment Forces]].\n \nUnder Doe, Liberian ports were opened to American, Canadian, and European merchant ships, which brought in considerable foreign investment from shipping firms and earned Liberia a reputation as a [[tax haven]].\n\n===Fear of counter-coup; repression===\nDoe had to put down seven coup attempts between 1981 and 1985. In August 1981, he had [[Thomas Weh Syen]] and four other PRC members arrested and executed for allegedly conspiring against him. Doe's government then declared amnesty for all political prisoners and exiles, and released sixty political prisoners. \nHowever, there soon were more internal rifts in the PRC. Doe became paranoid about the possibility of a counter-coup, and his government grew increasingly corrupt and repressive, banning all political opposition, shutting down newspapers, and jailing reporters. He began to systematically eliminate PRC members who challenged his authority, and to place people of his own ethnic Krahn background in key positions, which intensified popular anger. Meanwhile, the economy deteriorated precipitously. Popular support for Doe's government evaporated.\n\n===1985 presidential election===\nA draft constitution providing for a multiparty republic had been issued in 1983 and was approved by referendum in 1984. After the referendum, Doe staged a [[Liberia elections, 1985|presidential election]] on October 15, 1985. Nine political parties sought to challenge Doe's National Democratic Party of Liberia (NDPL), but only three were allowed to take part. Prior to the election, more than fifty of Doe's opponents were murdered. Doe was \u2018elected\u2019 with 51% of the vote, but the election was heavily rigged. Foreign observers declared the elections fraudulent, and most of the elected opposition candidates refused to take their seats. \nU.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa [[Chester Crocker]] testified before Congress that the election was imperfect but that at least it was a step toward democracy. He further justified his support for the election results with the claim that, in any case, all African elections were known to be rigged at that time.\n\n===Outbreak of Civil War===\n{{see also|First Liberian Civil War}}\n\nIn November 1985 [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's former second-in-command, with an estimated number 500 to 600 people, failed in an attempt to seize power; all were killed. Doe was sworn in as president on January 6, 1986. Doe then initiated crackdowns against certain tribes, such as the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] (or Dan) and [[Mano people|Mano]], in the north, where most of the coup plotters came from. This government's mistreatment of certain ethnic groups resulted in divisions and violence among indigenous peoples, who until then had coexisted relatively peacefully. \nIn the late 1980s, as fiscal austerity took hold in the United States and the perceived threat of Communism declined with the waning of the Cold War, the U.S. became disenchanted with Doe's government and began cutting off critical foreign aid to Liberia. This, together with the popular opposition, made Doe's position precarious.\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989\u20131996)==\n{{Main|First Liberian Civil War}}\n\nIn the late 1980s opposition from abroad to [[Samuel Doe|Doe]]\u2019s regime led to economic collapse. Doe had already been repressing and crushing internal opposition for some time, when in November 1985 another coup attempt against him failed. Doe retaliated against tribes such as the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] (or Dan) and [[Mano people|Mano]] in the north, where most of the coup plotters had come from. Doe's [[Krahn]] tribe began attacking other tribes, particularly in [[Nimba County]] in the northeast of Liberia, bordering on [[C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire]] (Ivory Coast) and on [[Guinea]]. Some Liberian northerners fled brutal treatment from the Liberian army into the Ivory Coast.\n\n===Charles Taylor and the NPFL (1980\u20131989)===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], born 1948 in Arthington, Liberia, is son of a [[Gola people|Gola]] mother and either an [[Americo-Liberian]] or an [[Afro-Trinidadian]] father.  Taylor was a student at [[Bentley University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], U.S.A., from 1972 to 1977, earning a degree in economics. After the 1980 ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' he served some time in Doe's government until he was fired in 1983 on accusation of embezzling government funds. He fled Liberia, was arrested in 1984 in Massachusetts on a Liberian warrant for extradition, and jailed in Massachusetts. He escaped from jail the following year and probably fled to [[Libya]]. In 1989, while in the Ivory Coast, Taylor assembled a group of rebels into the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), mostly from the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and [[Mano people|Mano]] tribes.\n\n===War===\nDecember 1989, the NPFL invaded Nimba County in Liberia. Thousands of Gio and Mano joined them, Liberians of other ethnic background as well. The Liberian army (AFL) counterattacked, and retaliated against the whole population of the region. Mid-1990, a war was raging between Krahn on one side, and Gio and Mano on the other. On both sides, thousands of civilians were massacred.\n\nBy the middle of 1990, Taylor controlled much of the country, and by June laid siege to [[Monrovia]]. In July, [[Yormie Johnson]] split off from NPFL and formed the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL), based around the Gio tribe. Both NPFL and INPFL continued their siege of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1990, the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), an organisation of West African states, created a military intervention force called the [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group]] (ECOMOG) composed of 4,000 troops, to restore order. President Doe and Yormie Johnson (INPFL) agreed to this intervention, Taylor didn't. \nOn September 9, President Doe paid a visit to the barely established headquarters of ECOMOG in the Free Port of Monrovia. While he was at the ECOMOG headquarters, he was attacked by INPFL, taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base, tortured, and killed.\n\nIn November 1990, ECOWAS agreed with some principal Liberian players, but without Charles Taylor, on an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) under President [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]]. Sawyer established his authority over most of Monrovia, with the help of a paramilitary police force, the 'Black Berets', under [[Brownie Samukai]], while the rest of the country was in the hands of the various warring factions.\n\nIn June 1991, former Liberian army fighters formed a rebel group, the [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO). They entered western Liberia in September 1991 and gained territories from the NPFL.\n\n[[File:26th MEU secure Freeport of Monrovia 001.jpg|thumb|American troops secure Freeport of Monrovia, 2003]]\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. On 22 September 1993, the United Nations established the [[United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia]] (UNOMIL) to support ECOMOG in implementing the Cotonou agreement. In March 1994, the Interim Government of [[Amos Sawyer]] was succeeded by a Council of State of six members headed by [[David D. Kpormakpor]]. Renewed armed hostilities broke out in 1994 and persisted. During the course of the year, ULIMO split into two militias: ULIMO-J, a Krahn faction led by [[Roosevelt Johnson]], and ULIMO-K, a Mandigo-based faction under [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]]. Faction leaders agreed to the Akosombo peace agreement in Ghana but with little consequence. In October 1994, the UN reduced its number of UNOMIL observers to about 90 because of the lack of will of combatants to honour peace agreements. In December 1994, the factions and parties signed the Accra agreement, but fighting continued. In August 1995, the factions signed an agreement largely brokered by [[Jerry Rawlings]], Ghanaian President; Charles Taylor agreed. In September 1995, [[David D. Kpormakpor|Kpormakpor]]\u2019s ''Council of State'' was succeeded by one under the civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the factional heads Charles Taylor, Alhaji Kromah, and [[George Boley]] in it. In April 1996, followers of Taylor and Kromah assaulted the headquarters of Roosevelt Johnson in Monrovia, and the peace accord collapsed. In August 1996, a new ceasefire was reached in [[Abuja]], Nigeria. On September 3, 1996, [[Ruth Perry]] followed [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo|Sankawulo]] as chairwoman of the Council of State, with the same three militia leaders in it.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War (1997\u20132003)==\n{{Main|Second Liberian Civil War}}\n\n===Elections 1997===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] won the 1997 presidential elections with 75.33 percent of the vote, while the runner-up, [[Unity Party (Liberia)|Unity Party]] leader [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], received a mere 9.58 percent of the vote. Accordingly, Taylor's [[National Patriotic Party]] gained 21 of a possible 26 seats in the Senate, and 49 of a possible 64 seats in the House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kieh, Jr.|first=George Klay|title=Warlords, Politicians and the Post-First Civil War Election in Liberia|journal=African and Asian Studies|year=2011|volume=10|page=97}}</ref>  The election was judged free and fair by some observers although it was charged that Taylor had employed widespread intimidation to achieve victory at the polls.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\n===1997\u20131999===\nBloodshed in Liberia did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violence kept flaring up. During his entire reign, Taylor had to fight insurgencies against his government. Suspicions were rife that Taylor continued to assist rebel forces in neighbouring countries like [[Sierra Leone]], trading weapons for diamonds.\n\n===1999\u20132003===\nSome ULIMO forces reformed themselves as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD), backed by the government of neighbouring [[Guinea]]. In 1999, they emerged in northern Liberia, and in April 2000 they started fighting in [[Lofa County]] in northernmost Liberia. By the spring of 2001, they were posing a major threat to the Taylor government. Liberia was now engaged in a complex three-way conflict with Sierra Leone and the Republic of Guinea.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[United Nations Security Council]] in March 2001 ([[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1343|Resolution 1343]])<ref name=\"UNSC resolutions 2001\">{{cite web|title=UNSC Resolution 1343|website=UN Security Council|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/scres/2001/sc2001.htm|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>  concluded that Liberia and Charles Taylor played roles in the civil war in Sierra Leone, and therefore: \n* banned all arms sales to, and diamonds sales from Liberia; and\n* banned high Liberian Government members from travel to UN-states.\n\nBy the beginning of 2002, Sierra Leone and Guinea were supporting the LURD, while Taylor was supporting opposition factions in both countries. By supporting Sierra Leonean rebels, Taylor also drew the enmity of the British and Americans.\n\nIn 2003, other elements of the former ULIMO-factions formed another new small rebel group in the Republic of Ivory Coast,  the [[Movement for Democracy in Liberia]] (MODEL), headed by Mr Yayah Nimley, and they emerged in the south of Liberia.\n\n===Women of Liberia===\n{{Main|Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace}}\n[[File:LiberianWomen.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace]].]]\nIn 2002, the women in Liberia were tired of seeing their country torn apart.

They staged a [[sit in]] outside of the Presidential Palace, blocking all the doors and windows and preventing anyone from leaving the peace talks without a resolution.

As a result, the women were able to achieve peace in [[Liberia]] after a 14-year civil war and later helped bring to power the country's first female head of state, [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]].\n\n===UN timber embargo and arrest warrant against Taylor===\n[[File:Buduburam-refugee-camp.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Buduburam]] [[refugee camp]] west of [[Accra]], Ghana, home in 2005 to more than 40,000 refugees from Liberia]]\nOn March 7, 2003, the war tribunal [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL) decided to summon Charles Taylor and charge him with [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]], but they kept this decision and this charge secret until June that year.<ref name=\"NRC 5-6-2003\">{{cite news| newspaper=NRC Handelsblad|language=Dutch|location= Nederlands |date= June 5, 2003}}</ref>\n\nDue to concerns over the lack of social, humanitarian and development use of industry revenue by the Liberian government, the UN Security Council enacted a 10-month embargo on timber imports from Liberia on July 7, 2003 (passed in Resolution 1478).\n<ref name=\"UNSC resolutions 2003\">{{cite web|title=UNSC Resolution 1478|website=UN Security Council|url=https://www.un.org/Docs/sc/unsc_resolutions03.html|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-2003, LURD controlled the northern third of the country and was threatening the capital, MODEL was active in the south, and Taylor's government controlled only a third of the country: Monrovia and central Liberia.\n\nOn June 4, 2003, ECOWAS organized peace talks in [[Accra]], Ghana, among the Government of Liberia, civil society, and the rebel groups LURD and MODEL. On the opening ceremony, in Taylor's presence, the SCSL revealed their charge against Taylor which they had kept secret since March, and also issued an international arrest warrant for Taylor.<ref name=\"NRC 5-6-2003\"/> The SCSL indicted Taylor for \u201cbearing the greatest responsibility\u201d for atrocities in Sierra Leone since November 1996. The Ghanaian authorities did not attempt to arrest Taylor, declaring they could not round up a president they themselves had invited as a guest for peace talks.<ref name=\"NRC 5-6-2003\"/> The same day, Taylor returned to Liberia.\n\n===Pressure of rebels, Presidents, and UN: Taylor resigns===\nJune 2003, LURD began a siege of Monrovia. July 9, the Nigerian President offered Taylor safe [[exile]] in his country, if Taylor stayed out of Liberian politics.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/09/liberia/ | title=Nigeria would shield Taylor from trial|publisher=cnn.com|date=July 10, 2003}}</ref> Also in July, American President [[George W.

Vice-President [[Moses Blah]] replaced Taylor as interim-President. \nAn ECOWAS-ECOMIL force of 1000 Nigerian troops was airlifted into Liberia on August 15, to halt the occupation of [[Monrovia]] by rebel forces. Meanwhile, U.S. stationed a [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] with 2300 Marines offshore Liberia.\n\n==Peace agreement and transitional government (2003\u20132005)==\n[[File:Gyude Bryant.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Gyude Bryant]]]] \nOn August 18, 2003, the Liberian Government, the rebels, political parties, and leaders from civil society signed the [[Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] that laid the framework for a two-year National Transitional Government of Liberia. August 21, they selected businessman [[Charles Gyude Bryant]] as chair of the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL), effective on October 14. These changes paved the way for the ECOWAS peacekeeping mission to expand into a 3,600-strong force, constituted by [[Benin]], Gambia, [[Ghana]], Guinea-Bissau, [[Mali]], Nigeria, [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]].\n\nOn October 1, 2003, [[UNMIL]] took over the peacekeeping duties from ECOWAS. Some 3,500 West African troops were provisionally \u2018re-hatted\u2019 as United Nations peacekeepers. The UN Secretary-General commended the African Governments who have contributed to UNMIL, as well as the United States for its support to the regional force. October 14, 2003, Blah handed power to Gyude Bryant.\n\nFighting initially continued in parts of the country, and tensions between the factions did not immediately vanish. \nBut fighters were being disarmed; in June 2004, a program to reintegrate the fighters into society began; the economy recovered somewhat in 2004; by year's end, the funds for the re-integration program proved inadequate; also by the end of 2004, more than 100,000 Liberian fighters had been disarmed, and the disarmament program was ended.\n\nIn light of the progress made, President Bryant requested an end to the UN embargo on Liberian diamonds (since March 2001) and timber (since May 2003), but the Security Council postponed such a move until the peace was more secure. Because of a supposed \u2018fundamentally broken system of governance that contributed to 23 years of conflict in Liberia\u2019, and failures of the Transitional Government in curbing corruption, the Liberian government and the [[International Contact Group on Liberia]] signed onto the anti-corruption program [[GEMAP]], starting September 2005.\n\n==Ellen Johnson Sirleaf elected president (2005)==\n{{main|Liberian elections, 2005|Ellen Johnson Sirleaf}} \n[[File:Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf3.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]].]] \nThe transitional government prepared for fair and peaceful democratic elections on October 11, 2005, with UNMIL troops safeguarding the peace. Twenty three candidates stood for the presidential election, with [[George Weah]], international footballer, [[UNICEF]] Goodwill Ambassador and member of the [[Kru people|Kru]] ethnic group, and [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], a former [[World Bank]] economist and finance minister,  Harvard-trained economist and of mixed [[Americo-Liberian]] and indigenous descent. \nIn the first round, no candidate took the required majority, Weah won this round with 28% of the vote. A run-off between the top two vote getters, Weah and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, was necessary.\n\nThe second round of elections took place on November 8, 2005. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf won this runoff decisively. Both the general election and runoff were marked by peace and order, with thousands of Liberians waiting patiently in the Liberian heat to cast their ballots. \nSirleaf claimed victory of this round, winning 59 per cent of the vote. However, Weah alleged electoral fraud, despite international observers declaring the election to be free and fair. Although Weah was still threatening to take his claims to the Supreme Court if no evidence of fraud was found, Johnson-Sirleaf was declared winner on November 23, 2005, and took office on January 16, 2006; becoming the first African woman to do so.\n\n==Recent events (2006\u2013present)==\n\n===Allegations of labor rights abuses by Firestone===\nIn November 2005, the [[International Labor Rights Fund]] filed an Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) case against [[Bridgestone]], the parent company of Firestone, alleging \u201cforced labor\", the modern equivalent of slavery, on the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] Plantation in [[Harbel]].<ref name=\"Claim against Firestone\">{{cite web|title=Firestone Claim|website=socialfunds.com|url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1897.html|access-date=July 18, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206205241/http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1897.html|archive-date=February 6, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>  In May 2006, the [[United Nations Mission in Liberia]] (UNMIL) released a report: \u201cHuman Rights in Liberia\u2019s Rubber Plantations: Tapping into the Future\u201d which detailed the results of its investigation into the conditions on the Firestone plantation in Liberia.<ref>A redacted copy of the UN report [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/ilrf/liberiarubberUNreport.pdf \u201cHuman Rights in Liberia\u2019s Rubber Plantations: Tapping into the Future\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513125322/https://www.dol.gov/ilab/programs/ocft/PDF/ilrf/liberiarubberUNreport.pdf |date=May 13, 2009 }} can be seen at the Office of Child Labor, Forced Labor, and Human Trafficking website, part of the US Bureau of Labour.</ref> {{Citation not found}}\n\n===Extradition and trial of Charles Taylor, arrest of Bryant===\nUnder international pressure, President [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf|Sirleaf]] requested in March 2006 that [[Nigeria]] extradite Charles Taylor, who was then brought before an international tribunal in [[Sierra Leone]] to face charges of [[crimes against humanity]], arising from events during the Sierra Leone civil war (his trial was later transferred to [[The Hague]] for security purposes).

Produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Cartoon Network Studios]], the series follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]) and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] ([[John DiMaggio]]){{em dash}}a dog with the magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with [[Princess Bubblegum]] ([[Hynden Walch]]), the [[Ice King]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), [[Marceline the Vampire Queen|Marceline]] ([[Olivia Olson]]), [[BMO (character)|BMO]] ([[Niki Yang]]), and others. The series is based on a 2007 [[Adventure Time (pilot)|short]] produced for [[Nicktoons (American TV channel)|Nicktoons]] and Frederator Studios' animation [[:wikt:incubation|incubator]] series ''[[Random! Cartoons]]''. After the short became a [[viral video|viral hit]] on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show officially premiered on April 5, 2010, and ended on September 3, 2018.\n\nThe series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for [[List of Adventure Time episodes|episodes]] are decided by [[storyboard]]ing artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced on September 29, 2016, that the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season.{{ref|season10|\u00a7}} The [[Come Along with Me (Adventure Time)|series finale]] aired on September 3, 2018. On October 23, 2019, four specials, collectively called ''[[Adventure Time: Distant Lands]]'', were announced, which will air exclusively on [[HBO Max]] starting with two in 2020.\n\n''Adventure Time'' has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network and some episodes have attracted over three million viewers; despite being aimed primarily at children, it has developed a following among teenagers and adults. The show has received positive reviews from critics and won awards including: eight [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Peabody Award]], three [[Annie Award]]s, two [[British Academy Children's Awards]], a [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Motion Picture Sound Editors Award]], and a [[Kerrang! Awards|''Kerrang!'' Award]]. The series has also been nominated for three [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s, two [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival|Annecy Festival Awards]], a [[TCA Awards|TCA Award]], and a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival Award]], among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an [[Eisner Award]] and two [[Harvey Awards]]. The series has also spawned various forms of licensed merchandise, including books, video games and clothing.\n\n== Premise ==\n{{Further|List of Adventure Time characters}}\n\n''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human]]{{efn|name=note13|Also known as Finn Mertens.}} (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog]] ([[John DiMaggio]]), who has magical powers to change shape and size at will. [[Pendleton Ward]], the series' creator, describes Finn as a \"fiery little kid with strong morals\".<ref name=\"awn\"/> Jake, on the other hand, is based on Tripper Harrison, [[Bill Murray]]'s character in ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''.

Inspired by the title sequences of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', Ward developed a new title sequence featuring a panning sweep of the Land of Ooo while a synthesizer note rose slowly until the main theme was played. Ward's draft for this idea was handed to layout animators, who then finalized the timing for the sequence. From there, the sequence evolved; while Ward added \"silly character stuff\", Patrick McHale focused his attention on the Ice King's shot and gave him a \"high school [year]book\" smile. The crew also struggled to get the shadows in the shot featuring Marceline correct.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> After the panning sweep, the sequence cuts to the theme song, which plays while shots of Finn and Jake adventuring are shown. For this part of the sequence, Ward was inspired by the \"simple\" aspects of the introduction to the 2007 comedy film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''. When the theme mentions \"Jake the Dog\" and \"Finn the Human\", the characters' names are displayed next to their heads, with a solid color in the background.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> The sequence was finalized immediately before the series aired.<ref name=aotmusicrev/>\n\nThe show's eponymous theme song is sung by Ward, accompanied by a [[ukulele]]. It is first heard in the pilot episode; in that version Ward is accompanied by an acoustic guitar. For the version used in the series, Ward sung in a higher register to match with the higher range of the ukulele.<ref name=aotmusicrev>{{cite web|last=Ulloa |first=Alexander |title=Adventure Time (2010) |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time/ |website=Art of the Title  |year=2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320084120/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time |archivedate=March 20, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The finalized version of the theme song was originally supposed to be a [[Temp track|temporary version]]. Ward said, \"I recorded the lyrics for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little crummy microphone just so that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the network. Later, we tried re-recording it and I didn't like it&nbsp;... I only liked the temp one!\"<ref name=aotmusicrev/> Because the series' finalized theme song was originally recorded as a temp track, ambient noises can be heard throughout. For instance, the sound of Derek Drymon typing can be heard while Jake is walking through the Ice Kingdom. According to Ward, much of the series' music has similar \"hiss and grit\" because one of the show's original composers, Casey James Basichis, \"lives in a pirate ship he's built inside of an apartment [and] you can hear floorboards squeak and lots of other weird sounds\".<ref name=aotmusicrev/> As the show progressed, Basichis's friend Tim Kiefer joined the show as an additional composer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seibert |first=Fred |title=Manlerette Party Song |url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/09/30/manlerette-party-song/ |publisher=[[Frederator]] |date=September 30, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000204/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/09/30/manlerette-party-song/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The two now work together on its music.<ref name=music>{{cite interview |last=Basichis |first=Casey James |interviewer= |title='''Adventure Time'' Music With Time + Casey' [Featurette] |url= |publisher=[[Cartoon Network]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |date=2012 |work=Adventure Time: The Complete First Season }}</ref>\n\nThe show's title sequence and theme song have stayed mostly consistent throughout its run, with seven exceptions.

Produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Cartoon Network Studios]], the series follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]) and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] ([[John DiMaggio]]){{em dash}}a dog with the magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with [[Princess Bubblegum]] ([[Hynden Walch]]), the [[Ice King]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), [[Marceline the Vampire Queen|Marceline]] ([[Olivia Olson]]), [[BMO (character)|BMO]] ([[Niki Yang]]), and others. The series is based on a 2007 [[Adventure Time (pilot)|short]] produced for [[Nicktoons (American TV channel)|Nicktoons]] and Frederator Studios' animation [[:wikt:incubation|incubator]] series ''[[Random! Cartoons]]''. After the short became a [[viral video|viral hit]] on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show officially premiered on April 5, 2010, and ended on September 3, 2018.\n\nThe series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for [[List of Adventure Time episodes|episodes]] are decided by [[storyboard]]ing artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced on September 29, 2016, that the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season.{{ref|season10|\u00a7}} The [[Come Along with Me (Adventure Time)|series finale]] aired on September 3, 2018. On October 23, 2019, four specials, collectively called ''[[Adventure Time: Distant Lands]]'', were announced, which will air exclusively on [[HBO Max]] starting with two in 2020.\n\n''Adventure Time'' has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network and some episodes have attracted over three million viewers; despite being aimed primarily at children, it has developed a following among teenagers and adults. The show has received positive reviews from critics and won awards including: eight [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Peabody Award]], three [[Annie Award]]s, two [[British Academy Children's Awards]], a [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Motion Picture Sound Editors Award]], and a [[Kerrang! Awards|''Kerrang!'' Award]]. The series has also been nominated for three [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s, two [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival|Annecy Festival Awards]], a [[TCA Awards|TCA Award]], and a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival Award]], among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an [[Eisner Award]] and two [[Harvey Awards]]. The series has also spawned various forms of licensed merchandise, including books, video games and clothing.\n\n== Premise ==\n{{Further|List of Adventure Time characters}}\n\n''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human]]{{efn|name=note13|Also known as Finn Mertens.}} (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog]] ([[John DiMaggio]]), who has magical powers to change shape and size at will.

Inspired by the title sequences of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', Ward developed a new title sequence featuring a panning sweep of the Land of Ooo while a synthesizer note rose slowly until the main theme was played. Ward's draft for this idea was handed to layout animators, who then finalized the timing for the sequence. From there, the sequence evolved; while Ward added \"silly character stuff\", Patrick McHale focused his attention on the Ice King's shot and gave him a \"high school [year]book\" smile. The crew also struggled to get the shadows in the shot featuring Marceline correct.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> After the panning sweep, the sequence cuts to the theme song, which plays while shots of Finn and Jake adventuring are shown. For this part of the sequence, Ward was inspired by the \"simple\" aspects of the introduction to the 2007 comedy film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''. When the theme mentions \"Jake the Dog\" and \"Finn the Human\", the characters' names are displayed next to their heads, with a solid color in the background.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> The sequence was finalized immediately before the series aired.<ref name=aotmusicrev/>\n\nThe show's eponymous theme song is sung by Ward, accompanied by a [[ukulele]]. It is first heard in the pilot episode; in that version Ward is accompanied by an acoustic guitar. For the version used in the series, Ward sung in a higher register to match with the higher range of the ukulele.<ref name=aotmusicrev>{{cite web|last=Ulloa |first=Alexander |title=Adventure Time (2010) |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time/ |website=Art of the Title  |year=2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320084120/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time |archivedate=March 20, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The finalized version of the theme song was originally supposed to be a [[Temp track|temporary version]]. Ward said, \"I recorded the lyrics for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little crummy microphone just so that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the network. Later, we tried re-recording it and I didn't like it&nbsp;...

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

As such it forms a northerly bypass to [[Chester]] and a shorter route between the North West and [[North Wales]] than the [[A55 road|A55]].  The road is dualled west of the M56. There is roundabout with the [[A540 road|A540]] and at [[Dunkirk, Cheshire|Dunkirk]] at the western terminus of the M56.

Some sections were constructed in concrete.  The road was lined for much of its length with poplar trees.  This original tree lined [[boulevard]] layout is still in evidence on the section adjacent to [[Stanlow Refinery]]. In the 1960s it was marked out as a single carriageway 3-lane road.  The middle lane was known as the \"suicide\" lane due to overtaking vehicles from each direction heading towards each other at speed.
