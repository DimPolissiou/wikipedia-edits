Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

{"title_page": "History of the Parramatta Eels", "text_new": "{{Main|Parramatta Eels}}\nThe '''history of the Parramatta Eels''' dates back to their formation as the [[Parramatta District Rugby League Football Club]] in 1947 to the present day.\n\n==Background==\nThe roots of the playing of [[rugby football]] in Parramatta lie in the 19th century with the formation of the '''Parramatta Rugby Club''' (now known as [[Parramatta Two Blues]]) founded in 1879.  With the advent of a Sydney Rugby union District competition in 1900, the Parramatta club merged with the [[West Harbour RFC|Western Suburbs club]], with the club playing some of its matches at [[Parramatta Stadium|Cumberland Oval]].\n\nWhen the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|NSWRL Premiership]] was formed in 1908, a club made up of Western Suburbs Rugby Union \u201cdefectors\u201d formed the [[Cumberland (rugby league team)|Central Cumberland]] club which participated in the first year of competition before the club was absorbed into the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs DRLFC]], also formed in 1908.  Rugby league began to be played in the Parramatta district in 1909 with local teams, such as Iona and Endeavours, forming a district competition.  Many other clubs within the Parramatta district also emerged with clubs being established in suburbs across the district over the ensuing decades and a Western Districts side representing the area in the President's Cup.\n\nAgitation in the area for a local club to participate in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|NSWRL Premiership]] began in the mid-1930s with a formal proposal put to the NSWRL in 1936 by local Rugby League identities such as [[Jack Argent]] and [[Jack Scullin]]. The proposal was rejected by all clubs except [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]].\n\n==1940s==\nThe advent of [[World War II]] put the establishment of the club on hold and a Parramatta district club was not proposed again until 1946 when the club was successfully admitted into the Premiership.\n\nIn the [[1947 NSWRFL season]], Parramatta's first, they finished at the bottom of the table, with one less win than fellow premiership debutants, [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]]. [[1948 NSWRFL season|In 1948]], Parramatta were winless in their first eleven matches but the signing of former [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] five-eighth [[Vic Hey]] as captain-coach helped them to eighth with five wins and a draw. [[1949 NSWRFL season|In 1949]], with popular former [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] winger [[Mitchell Wallace]] setting tryscoring records beaten only during their golden age of the 1980s,<ref>[http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/parramatta/parramatta_sc.html#mts Parramatta: Most Tries in a Season] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145752/http://stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/parramatta/parramatta_sc.html#mts |date=14 July 2014 }}</ref> the \u201cFruitpickers\u201d as the club was popularly known,<ref name=\"History\">Collis, Ian and Whiticker, Alan; ''The History of Rugby League Clubs''; pp. 189-192 {{ISBN|1741100755}}</ref> finished fifth with eight wins and four draws. The club also saw utility back [[Ian Johnston (rugby league)|Ian Johnston]] win its first Australian guernsey.\n\n==1950s==\nThe promise of 1949 was not fulfilled during the 1950s. Hey had been plagued by injury in his first two years at the club and retired as a player after 1949, with the result that Parramatta fell back to ninth [[1950 NSWRFL season|in 1950]] before winning nine matches [[1951 NSWRFL season|in 1951]].\n\nIn their first five seasons Parramatta had won 28 and drawn eight of their ninety matches for a not disrespectful 35.56 percent winning rate, but the period from [[1952 NSWRFL season|1952]] [[1961 NSWRFL season|to 1961]] was to prove the most disastrous of any NSWRFL club since [[Sydney University rugby league team|University]] won only fifteen matches in nine seasons [[1929 NSWRFL season|between 1929]] [[1937 NSWRFL season|and 1937]].<ref name=\"History\"/> In these seasons Parramatta won only 35 and drew two of 180 matches and claimed the wooden spoon on no fewer than eight occasions, including six in succession from [[1956 NSWRFL season|1956]] to 1961. After Hey moved on at the end [[1953 NSWRFL season|of 1953]] Parramatta went on a merry-go-round with coaches: they had five in as many years from 1954 to 1958, and even former [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Rabbitoh]] premiership coach [[Jack Rayner]] could not lift them off the bottom between 1958 and 1960.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/parramatta-eels/coaches.html?ord=years Parramatta Eels coaches]</ref>\n\nApart from the recruitments of international backrower [[Harold Crocker|\u201cMick\u201d Crocker]] for a then-record single-season fee in 1954<ref>\u2018Crocker will play here\u2019; ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 20 January 1954, p. 16</ref> and prized Yass hooker [[Bill Rayner]] in 1956, Parramatta was almost completely reliant upon local juniors<ref>Heads, Ian and Middleton, David; ''A Centenary of Rugby League 1908-2008: the Definitive Story of the Game in Australia'', Pan Macmillan. {{ISBN|9781405038300}}</ref> and not nearly enough quality players could be found for competitiveness; however, there were notable players like hardman prop [[Roy Fisher (rugby league)|Roy Fisher]], who played a record 170 consecutive grade games between 1954 and 1962.<ref>Middleton, David; ''Rugby League 1990-91'', pp. 104, 121 {{ISBN|0949853453}}</ref>\n\n==1960s==\n[[1960 NSWRFL season|1960]] was to prove the most disastrous season in Parramatta's history, with the club, despite the recruitment of Toowoomba centre [[Ron Boden]], finishing last in all three grades.<ref>Haddan, Steve; ''History of the NSW Rugby League Finals''; p. 135 {{ISBN|0646050982}}</ref> 1961 saw the acquisition of international back-rowers [[Ron Lynch (rugby league)|Ron Lynch]] from [[Forbes]] in country NSW and [[Brian Hambly]] from South Sydney,<ref name=\"History\"/> but the blue and golds, despite a promising start under captain-coach Boden with two early victories, won only one more game and returned to their familiar place at the foot of the ladder.\n\nUnder coach [[Ken Kearney]], Parramatta ended their run of six consecutive wooden spoons by finishing the [[1962 NSWRFL season]] in fourth place, making the play-offs for the first time and emulating this feat in the lower grades. With new recruits [[Ken Thornett]] (who became known as \u201cThe Mayor\u201d) from English club [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] and talented half-back [[Bob Bugden]] from [[St George Dragons|St George]], Parramatta had their most successful season since their inception before being eliminated from the finals in the first round by [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]].\n\nDespite the addition of skilful second-row forward [[Dick Thornett]] [[1963 NSWRFL season|for 1963]], ultimate success would continue to elude Parramatta with the side being knocked out of the 1963 finals by [[St George Dragons|St George]]. Finishing second in 1964 Parramatta were thrashed 42\u20130 by the Dragons in the major semi-final, before being knocked out by [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]]; their Third Grade team did however win the club's first premiership. In the 1965 season, with Ken Thornett as coach, the side finished in third position. However, Grand Final qualification would continue to elude them and Parramatta would again bow out of the finals, this time defeated by [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]]. Parramatta completed the rest of the 1960s in the middle of the ladder, without any further play-off appearances, finishing seventh in 1966, ninth in 1967, and sixth in 1968 and 1969.\n\n==1970s==\nParramatta finished with the wooden spoon, the club's tenth, in 1970, but with Ken Thornett returning finished fourth and again qualified for the play-offs in 1971. However, Parramatta again failed to progress in the minor semi, being defeated by [[St George Dragons|St George]], and fell back to last position in 1972 despite possessing class players like [[Bob O'Reilly]], [[Denis Fitzgerald]], and Keith Campbell. The Eels luckily avoided the wooden spoon in 1973 and 1974, but began the 1975 season by winning its first-ever senior trophy when they defeated Manly in their first-ever Pre-Season Cup (Wills Cup) final.\n\nIn the main premiership, Parramatta after a promising start fell off, losing seven and drawing one of nine games mid-season. A rush in the last six weeks saw them easily win five games to finished equal fifth (sixth on percentages) with [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]]{{efn|Wests were actually half a win ahead but were docked one match point for playing a replacement player who had not played the full reserve grade match as was required at the time.}} and were forced into a play-off for fifth position. Parramatta, on a roll, achieved a string of elimination play-off victories, defeating [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] (18\u201313) and then [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] (19\u20138) to qualify for the semi-finals in fifth position. Parramatta played [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]] in the preliminary final, achieving another narrow victory 6\u20135. However, in the minor semi-final Parramatta's courageous run of victories \u2013 achieved despite crippling injury toll<ref>Clarkson, Alan; \u2018Parra 13 Refuse to Be Beaten\u2019; ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 1 September 1975, p. 13</ref> \u2013 ended with a 22\u201312 defeat by Manly.\n\nIn 1976 a new coach, [[Terry Fearnley]], joined the Eels. In the same year several of Parramatta's greatest players joined the club. These included Rugby union recruit and 1975 Wallaby tourist, [[Ray Price (rugby footballer)|Ray Price]] who would go on to represent both [[New South Wales Rugby League team|NSW]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] in [[Rugby league]]. Another new recruit was five-eighth [[John Peard]]. Nicknamed \u201cthe Bomber\u201d, Peard was encouraged by Terry Fearnley to develop his tactical kicking game (the \u201c[[Bomb (kick)|bomb]]\u201d) as an attacking technique. As the 1976 season progressed Parramatta emerged as one of the best performing sides, finishing second in the competition.  In the major preliminary semi-final Parramatta decisively defeated [[St George Dragons|St George]] 31\u20136 and met [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] in the major semi final.  In a close match Parramatta narrowly defeated the Sea-Eagles with a late try to winger Graeme Atkins (who scored from a Peard bomb) and qualified for the club's first Grand Final. In the Grand Final, against the same [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] side they had defeated two weeks before, Parramatta were trailing 13\u201310 after 71 minutes. Receiving a penalty five metres from the goal line, the Eels formed a controversial [[flying wedge]] formation (now a banned movement in both Rugby codes) and pushed towards the goal line. The wedge collapsed before the goal line and Parramatta's [[Ron Hilditch]], who held the ball at the apex of the wedge, was tackled by Manly's [[Graham Eadie]] and the match ended with the scores unaltered.<ref>[http://rl1908.com/articles/Parramatta.htm Sean Fagan, ''Fearnley\u2019s Flying Wedge And The \u201876 Eels''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021080958/http://rl1908.com/articles/Parramatta.htm |date=21 October 2006 }} Retrieved on 5 September 2006; Alan Whiticker, ''Grand Finals of the NSWRL'' (2e), Gary Allen, 1994</ref>\n\nBolstered with the recruitment of goal-kicking [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian representative]] centre [[Mick Cronin (rugby league)|Mick Cronin]] Parramatta finished as minor premiers [[1977 NSWRFL season|in 1977]].

In 1979, Parramatta made it to the major semi-final but were defeated by [[St George Dragons|St George]] 15\u201311 and lost the preliminary to Canterbury 20\u201314.\n\n==1980s==\nIn 1980, despite the recruitment of veteran [[Arthur Beetson]] and the emergence of notable players such as [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]], [[Steve Ella]] and [[Brett Kenny]], Parramatta missed the finals for the first time since 1974.\n\nParramatta, under coach [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]], finished third in the competition and began their finals campaign with a major preliminary semi against [[Newtown Jets]] whom they narrowly defeated 10\u20138. An extra time victory over minor Premiers [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] 12\u20138 followed and Parramatta qualified for the club's third Grand Final. Playing against Newtown, Parramatta led the Grand Final at half time, 7\u20136. A try to Newtown captain [[Tommy Raudonikis]] soon after half-time gave Newtown an 11\u20137 lead.  However, Parramatta responded with a try to winger [[Graeme Atkins (rugby league)|Graeme Atkins]]. Michael Cronin was able to convert the try and in the final five minutes of the match the Eels scored twice more to seal a 20\u201311 victory and their first-ever Premiership. In Parramatta, a large crowd of supporters greeted the team as they arrived back at the Leagues Club (situated adjacent to Cumberland Oval).  The already condemned grandstand and scoreboard at the Oval was set alight during the celebration by supporters and destroyed.<ref>Grantlee Kieza, \u2018Ding dong the witch is dead\u2019, ''Daily Telegraph'' 24 September 2004</ref>\n\nThe following year, with Cumberland Oval unavailable, Parramatta played home matches at [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown's]] [[Belmore Oval]] and finished the season as minor premiers. With a then-record 619 points and 21 victories, 1982 was statistically the club's most successful season. In the major semi-final Parramatta were defeated by [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] 20\u20130, which allowed Manly to qualify for the Grand Final.

This qualification would continue the developing rivalry that the two clubs had developed since the 1970s.<ref>Ray Chesterton, \u2018The Ghosts of Greatness\u2019, ''Daily Telegraph'', 1 May 2006</ref>  On Grand Final day, despite conceding the first try, Parramatta scored four tries before the half-time break. Manly's [[Les Boyd]] scored soon after the break, though it was their last try of the match and with [[Brett Kenny]] scoring in the sixtieth minute Parramatta recorded a 21\u20138 victory and a second consecutive premiership.\n\nParramatta finished second in the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1983|1983 Premiership season]], and opened the finals with a 30\u201322 win over Canterbury before being defeated by Manly-Warringah in the major semi-final, however the Eels defeated Canterbury in the Preliminary Final to qualify for another Grand Final against Manly. In the Grand Final Parramatta built a 12\u20130 half-time lead, which Brett Kenny extended after half-time and, with Cronin's conversion, the Eels lead 18\u20130 and ultimately won 18\u20136. Parramatta's third consecutive premiership was the first treble in the NSWRFL Premiership since St George's domination of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nJack Gibson departed after the 1983 season and was replaced by former [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla]] and Woy Woy Roosters five-eighth [[John Monie]]. Under Monie Parramatta qualified for their fourth Grand Final in a row in 1984 after an 8\u20137 defeat of [[St George Dragons|St George]] in the final. Parramatta faced minor premiers Canterbury-Bankstown who had defeated the Eels the week before, 16\u20138 to qualify for the Grand Final.  The Grand Final was a low-scoring affair, with the Bulldogs defeating Parramatta 6\u20134. The Eels finished fourth in 1985 and, with defeats of Penrith and Balmain in the final series, progressed to the Preliminary Final against Canterbury-Bankstown with a chance to qualify for a fifth straight Grand Final. However, Parramatta were defeated 26\u20130 and Canterbury-Bankstown would go on to win the Grand Final.\n\nParramatta, playing out of the newly opened [[Parramatta Stadium|Stadium]], finished minor premiers and qualified for the Grand Final with a 28\u20136 victory over Canterbury-Bankstown in the Finals.  The Bulldogs defeated [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] to qualify for another Grand Final against Parramatta. The Grand Final would end without either side scoring a try, the first time this had happened in the history of the competition. Two successful goal attempts by Michael Cronin gave the Eels a 4\u20132 victory.  Both Michael Cronin and [[Ray Price (rugby footballer)|Ray Price]] chose to make the Grand Final victory their last game in Rugby league and both retired from the game.\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=30em \n | quote  =There\u2019s no doubt Parramatta have the biggest following in our game.\n | source =[[John Quayle (rugby league)|John Quayle]], NSWRL General Manager at the end of the 1987 season<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Rowland\n  | first = David\n  | coauthors =  \n  | title = It\u2019s a game that belongs to the fans, says Quayle\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | page = 66\n  | publisher = Fairfax\n  | date = 9 September 1987\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19870909&id=HlcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=juQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3084,6072837\n  | accessdate = 5 May 2010}}</ref>\n | align  =right\n}}\nBetween 1987 and 1996 the Eels failed to make the finals. Parramatta finished seventh in 1987, eleventh in 1988, and eighth in 1989. The old stars remained at the club, but injuries plagued all of them, especially Grothe and Geoff Bugden, whilst the cost of retaining Kenny and Sterling under the new [[NRL salary cap|salary cap]] had the effect of forcing the club to discard large numbers of promising juniors. Their only notable recruit, star Queensland backrower [[Bob Lindner]], stayed only two seasons before moving to [[Gold Coast Giants|the Gold Coast]].\n\n==1990s==\nThe first half of the 1990s continued this trend with notable players, such as Brett Kenny and Peter Sterling, retiring from the game. Parramatta were completely unable to replace players of this calibre via recruiting and consequently struggled. Coach [[John Monie]] departed at the end of the 1989 season and was replaced by [[Mick Cronin (rugby league)|Michael Cronin]]. In 1990, Parramatta finished eighth and Sterling in his last full season won his second [[Rothmans Medal]], but in 1991 and 1992 the club descended in the rankings, only narrowly avoiding the \u201cwooden spoon\u201d in the latter season. In 1993, the Eels finished eleventh after a promising start and then in 1994 under new coach [[Ron Hilditch]], twelfth.\n\n1995 proved the Eels worst season since 1960, with the club finishing second last with only three wins in first grade, last in reserve grade and last in the club championship. Players from this era included current [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] coach [[Justin Morgan (rugby league)|Justin Morgan]], injury-plagued [[City vs Country Origin|Country Origin]] representative centre [[David Woods (rugby league, born 1970)|David Woods]], [[Lee Oudenryn]] (who beat [[Martin Offiah]] in a half-time footrace in [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]]\u2019s 1992 tour match with Parramatta<ref>David Middleton (ed.), ''Rugby League 1992-93'', Iron Bark Press, 1993</ref>) and former Australian representative [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]]. Other players of this era who would go on to play with other clubs included utility back [[Chris Lawler (rugby league)|Chris Lawler]] (who went to the Gold Coast Chargers), [[Garen Casey]] (Penrith Panthers) and [[Scott Mahon]] (North Queensland Cowboys).\n\n===Super League===\nThe \u201cSuper League war\u201d that began in 1995 provided an opportunity for Parramatta to recruit notable players from other clubs. As players and clubs aligned with either the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] or the [[Super League war|Super League]] competitions, various players became dislodged from their clubs. Parramatta, aligning with the ARL, were able to recruit ARL-aligned players from Super League-aligned clubs. This led to Parramatta signing star players [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]], [[Jim Dymock]] and [[Jarrod McCracken]], from 1995 premiers [[Canterbury Bulldogs]], alongside [[Aaron Raper]] and [[Adam Ritson]] from [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]]. Parramatta entered [[1996 ARL season|the 1996 season]] with a squad comprising not only these notable Super League defectors, but also [[New Zealand Rugby League|New Zealand]] international half-back [[Gary Freeman (rugby league)|Gary Freeman]]. However, despite these recruits, the Eels again failed to make the semi-finals. Parramatta spent most of the season in the lower reaches of, or just outside, a finals position. The Eels made a late challenge for final qualification, which included a Round 19 defeat of the [[Newcastle Knights]] in front of a home crowd of 21,191 (the largest [[Parramatta Stadium]] attendance since 1986). However, the blue and golds lost three consecutive matches to end the season in thirteenth position.\n\nThe 1997 season saw the recruitment of a new coach, former [[St George Dragons]] coach [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]].  The appointment of Brian Smith saw a reversal in Parramatta's fortunes with the Club finishing in third place and making the [[Australian Rugby League]] semi-finals in [[Australian Rugby League season 1997|1997]] for the first time since 1986.  Parramatta lost both its finals matches to [[Newcastle Knights]] and [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] in the Major Qualifying Final to exit from the series. The same scenario would reoccur in [[National Rugby League season 1998|1998]] (4th), [[National Rugby League season 1999|1999]] (2nd) and [[National Rugby League season 2000|2000]] (7th) with Parramatta failing to qualify for the Grand Final on each occasion. In the 1998 preliminary final Parramatta were leading arch rivals Canterbury 18\u20132 with less than 10 minutes to play and then what can only be described as the greatest choke in Rugby League preliminary finals history occurred.  Canterbury managed to fight their way back into the match and with a minute left on the scoreboard, winger [[Daryl Halligan]] kicked a conversion from out on the far touchline to send the game into extra time. Canterbury won in extra time 32\u201320.  The loss was hard to take for Parramatta as they had beaten eventual premiers Brisbane twice during the regular season.<ref>http://www.nrl.com/top-10-preliminary-final-heartbreaks/tabid/10874/newsid/89986/default.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/canterbury-bulldogs-parramatta-eels-and-more-the-seven-best-finals-runs-of-the-nrl-era/news-story/007a8a9ede205622095a2ede85839a2d</ref> In 1999, Parramatta led Melbourne 16\u20130 at halftime in the preliminary final only to lose 18\u201316 at full time.  Melbourne went on to win the premiership the following week. In the 2000 NRL season, Parramatta finished seventh and won both their sudden death finals matches to take on Brisbane in the preliminary final. In a game that they were not expected to win, Parramatta came close but lost the match against a much stronger Brisbane side. This was their third preliminary final loss in a row.<ref>http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/05/15/so-close-yet-so-far-for-parramatta/</ref>\n\nDuring this period, in the wake of the resolution of the Super League War and the creation of the [[National Rugby League]], the competition underwent a major restructure. It was announced that the new competition would comprise only 14 teams out of the 22 who had competed in the two competitions in 1997. This contraction would necessitate mergers or the culling of teams who did not meet the criteria for inclusion into the new competition. Despite meeting these criteria the Parramatta board explored mergers with both [[Penrith Panthers]] and [[Balmain Tigers]] but opted against the plan.<ref>[http://www.smhnews/league/double-punt-is-finally-paying-off/2005/09/23/1126982232466.html Steve Mascord and Brad Walter, \u2018Double punt is finally paying off\u2019, ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 24 September, 2005]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==2000s==\n\nParramatta, having recruited half-back [[Jason Taylor (rugby league)|Jason Taylor]], finished 2001 as minor premiers and qualified for the Grand Final for the first time since 1986. Parramatta won 20 of their regular season matches with the best offensive and defensive record in the [[National Rugby League season 2001|season]], finishing 5 points clear of the 2nd placed Bulldogs.  Parramatta set a regular-season points scoring record in the premiership by scoring 839 points in 26 matches. Playing [[Newcastle Knights]] in the Grand Final Parramatta trailed 0\u201324 at half-time. Despite a strong second-half performance from the Eels with two tries to both [[Brett Hodgson]] and [[Jamie Lyon]] the Eels were defeated 30\u201324.  There are several stories as to why Parramatta were unable to win the match in the years after the game.  One such story was that The Parramatta players were \"Nervous and Stiff\" and were dressed in Miami Vice suits at the traditional NRL Grand Final Breakfast.  Ex-Newcastle player [[Ben Kennedy (rugby league)|Ben Kennedy]] recalled the week by saying \"They came into the game under a shitload of pressure but for us, it was just a good time and a heap of fun. Parra were shitting themselves and we were having a good time\".<ref>http://www.theherald.com.au/story/476921/newcastle-knights-recall-2001-grand-final-glory/</ref>\n\nThe club qualified for the finals in 2002, finishing sixth, but failed to do so in 2004, finishing ninth. In 2005, the Eels won their second minor premiership but failed to convert the position into another Grand Final appearance losing 29\u20130 to The [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in the preliminary final in a game that Parramatta was expected to win.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/cowboys-stun-eels-to-make-grand-final/2005/09/25/1127586741021.html</ref> It was announced soon after the disastrous 2005 finals series that coach Brian Smith had been asked to stand down after the conclusion of the 2006 season, to be replaced by Newcastle coach [[Michael Hagan]]. After a poor start to [[2006 NRL season|the 2006 season]], Smith resigned on 15 May 2006 and was replaced by former Eels half-back Jason Taylor. Despite the team's low position on the ladder at the time, the team qualified for the finals in eighth position but were eliminated by minor premiers [[Melbourne Storm]] in the first week of the series.\n\nIn the 2007 season, Parramatta finished 5th on the ladder at the end of the regular season and once again made the preliminary final.  This time against The [[Melbourne Storm]].  Parramatta lost the match 26\u201310.  This was their 5th preliminary final loss in 9 years.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-09-02/eels-destroy-broncs-to-take-fifth-spot/657438</ref><ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nrl-2007/prelim-final/melbourne-vs-parramatta/summary.html</ref>\n\n[[Daniel Anderson (rugby league)|Daniel Anderson]] was appointed coach at the end of the [[2008 NRL season]].\n\nMidway through the [[2009 NRL season]] the troubled Parramatta Eels club replaced [[Denis Fitzgerald]], then the longest-serving CEO in the competition's history, with [[Paul Osborne]].<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = AAP\n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = The Midas touch\n  | work = ABC Grandstand Sport\n  | place =\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]\n  | date = 2 October 2009\n  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/sport/stories/2009/10/02/2703054.htm?site=sport&section=all\n  | accessdate = 26 October 2009}}</ref> Parramatta then completed a remarkable turnaround, going on to reach the grand final after sitting in 14th spot on the table after Round 18. They won 10 of their last 12 matches to make the grand final defeating minor premiers The [[St George Dragons]], Gold Coast and Arch-Rivals Canterbury on the way to the final, which they lost to the salary cap rorting [[Melbourne Storm]] who later had the title stripped due to the cheating.<ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nrl-2009/parramatta/summary.html</ref>\n\n==2010s==\n{{update|section|date=July 2016}}\n{{see also|Parramatta Eels salary cap breach}}\n\nFor the 2011 NRL Season, Parramatta was managed by new head coach [[Stephen Kearney]].  Round 1 saw Parramatta get off to the perfect start by beating The [[Auckland Warriors]] 24\u201318 at Eden Park in New Zealand.  But after that Round 1 victory the rest of 2011 was a very bleak one for Parramatta with the team finishing fourteenth on the ladder of sixteen clubs. Along the way Parramatta went on a 7-game losing streak including a 56\u20136 loss to South Sydney.  In the final round of the season, Parramatta played against The Gold Coast with the loser almost certainly receiving the wooden spoon.  Parramatta won the match 32\u201312 and Gold Coast were consigned to the wooden spoon.\n\nIn 2012, things went from bad to worse at the club as Parramatta finished last for the first time since 1972. Towards the back end of the season, Kearney's contract was terminated and [[Brad Arthur]] was installed as caretaker coach.  The last insult came in the final match of the season against The [[St George Dragons]] as retiring legends [[Luke Burt & Nathan Hindmarsh]] both went out as wooden spooners in their final year as players. The only thing memorable to come from the match was a last minute penalty goal kicked by Hindmarsh.<ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/the-lowdown-eels-v-dragons/news-story/61d45b329cdbd429c77eb55985d9a67a</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Parramatta appointed [[Ricky Stuart]] as their new coach on a three-year deal. In the opening round there was a lot of optimism and hope for the future as Parramatta defeated [[Auckland Warriors]] 40\u201310 at Parramatta Stadium.  This result proved to be the highlight of the season as Parramatta finished last again. Along the way Parramatta lost 10 matches in a row including heavy losses to Manly & Canterbury.  Mid season, Stuart also announced that as of the end of the season, there would be a massive cull of the playing roster and twelve players were told that their services were no longer required as of next season. In May 2013 [[Steve Sharp (rugby league)|Steve Sharp]] was elected Chairman of the [[Parramatta Eels]] board, replacing [[Roy Spagnolo]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritchie|first=Dean|title=New Parramatta chairman Steve Sharp vows to again make Eels club for the people|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/new-parramatta-chairman-steve-sharp-vows-to-again-make-eels-club-for-the-people/story-fni3ga7r-1226640640706|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 May 2013}}</ref>\nOn 12 September 2013, Stuart walked out on Parramatta to coach Canberra.

Parramatta then went into their Easter Monday clash at [[Stadium Australia]] sitting 5th on the ladder but lost the match controversially 21\u201318 in front of 50,000 fans. In round 24 Parramatta were sitting 8th on the ladder and looked destined to play in the finals for the first time since 2009 and only needed to win one of their last two remaining games against sides lower than them on the table which were Canberra and Newcastle.  Parramatta lost both matches and missed out on the finals series by two competition points.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/rugby-league-match-centre/parramatta-eels-v-wests-tigers-20140417-36vfv.html</ref><ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/knights/parramatta-eels-finals-hopes-hit-by-a-secondhalf-blitz-from-newcastle-knights/news-story/ef379d470227dd9162766cf13a340f3b</ref>\n\nThe 2015 season was a year to forget for Parramatta as they finished twelfth on the table.

Their first match played after the points deduction was against South Sydney at Parramatta Stadium, Parramatta lost the match 22\u201320 in a close game.  2016 would also prove to be the final year that Parramatta would play at [[Parramatta Stadium]] as it was due to be demolished at seasons end to make way for a new 30,000 seat stadium.  The final home game played at Parramatta Stadium was against The [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] in front of 13,553 spectators. Parramatta went on to beat the Dragons 30\u201318. Parramatta's final game of 2016 saw them travel to New Zealand to play The [[Auckland Warriors]].  Parramatta won the match 40\u201318 with [[Bevan French]] scoring 3 tries.

Some of the highlights throughout the year were the club winning nine out of their final ten matches and defeating Brisbane twice including a 52\u201334 win at [[Suncorp Stadium]] and eventual premiers Melbourne.<ref>http://www.nrl.com/eels-2017-season-review/tabid/10874/newsid/112225/default.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-24/parramatta-eels-brisbane-broncos-nrl/8834608</ref>  Parramatta then went on to play premiership favorites Melbourne in the first qualifying final, going into the second half Parramatta had stunned everyone by leading the match and it took Melbourne the last play of the game to hold on and win 18\u201316.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrlfinals/live-nrl-finals-melbourne-storm-v-parramatta-eels-score-updates-result-blog/news-story/225e83d53f61bd57e9d3a3eebbb11ebf</ref> The following week, Parramatta played against North Queensland in the sudden death elimination final.

Those predictions were matched in the opening round of the season as Parramatta lead Penrith 14-0 early on but after a second half capitulation lost the game 24\u201314. In Round 2, Parramatta were humiliated 54-0 by Manly at [[Brookvale Oval]]. Parramatta went on to lose the opening 6 games of the season before eventually winning their first game of the season defeating Manly 44\u201310 in Round 7. In Round 8, Parramatta defeated Wests 24\u201322 to make it back to back victories for the club. The Eels then went on to lose the next 5 games in a row before eventually winning their third game of the season defeating North Queensland 20\u201314 in Darwin in which Jarryd Hayne returned from injury scoring two tries. The following weeks were filled with disappointment as the club came close to pulling off upset wins against top of the table St George only for the club to concede two tries in 5 minutes to lose 20-18 and South Sydney after leading 20-6 late into the game only for The Rabbitohs to score late tries and win 26\u201320. In Round 18, Parramatta lost 18\u201316 to Newcastle with The Eels being denied a last minute try after it was ruled winger [[Bevan French]] had put his foot over the sideline. The following week, Parramatta defeated arch rivals Canterbury 14\u20138 in what the media dubbed the \"Spoon Bowl\". There were hopes that Parramatta could avoid the wooden spoon as going into the second last game of the season the club sat above North Queensland on the table due to for and against. In what was the retiring Jonathan Thurston's final home game, both clubs needed a win to avoid the wooden spoon. North Queensland won the match 44\u20136. In the final game of the season, Parramatta were defeated 44-10 by Eastern Suburbs ensuring that the club finished last and claimed their 14th wooden spoon and The Roosters claiming the minor premiership. Before the match, Easts needed to defeat Parramatta by 27 points to overtake Melbourne and finish first on the table.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/eels/parramatta-eels-season-2018-review-peter-sterlings-biggest-fear-after-horror-campaign/news-story/14f79c1c637fa8d03bbfa6d6b63b55f1</ref> <ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/03/03/expert-predictions-for-nrl-top-eight-in-2018/</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-28/nrl-st-george-illawarra-edge-out-paramatta/9914596</ref>\n\nBefore the start of the [[2019 NRL season]], Parramatta were predicted by many to finish towards the bottom of the table or claim another wooden spoon.  The club started off the year with back to back victories over [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] and arch rivals [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]].  In Round 6 of the [[2019 NRL season]], Parramatta played their first game at the new [[Western Sydney Stadium]] against the [[Wests Tigers]] and ran out 51-6 winners in front of a sold-out crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-22/parramatta-eels-thrash-west-tigers-nrl/11034182/|title=Parramatta Eels thrash Wests Tigers 51-6 to christen new Parramatta Stadium|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref>  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/11/22/fans-predictions-where-each-club-will-finish-in-2019/|title=Where each club will finish in 2019|website=NRL}}</ref>\n\nIn Round 9 against Melbourne, Parramatta suffered one of their worst ever defeats losing 64\u201310 at [[Suncorp Stadium]].  In the aftermath of the defeat, coach [[Brad Arthur]] and the players were placed under intense scrutiny but just a week after the loss, Arthur was given a two-year contract extension by the Parramatta board.

In the elimination final against Brisbane, Parramatta won the match 58\u20130 at the new [[Western Sydney Stadium]].  The victory was the biggest finals win in history, eclipsing Newtown's 55\u20137 win over St George in 1944.

With the advent of a Sydney Rugby union District competition in 1900, the Parramatta club merged with the [[West Harbour RFC|Western Suburbs club]], with the club playing some of its matches at [[Parramatta Stadium|Cumberland Oval]].\n\nWhen the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|NSWRL Premiership]] was formed in 1908, a club made up of Western Suburbs Rugby Union \u201cdefectors\u201d formed the [[Cumberland (rugby league team)|Central Cumberland]] club which participated in the first year of competition before the club was absorbed into the [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs DRLFC]], also formed in 1908.  Rugby league began to be played in the Parramatta district in 1909 with local teams, such as Iona and Endeavours, forming a district competition.  Many other clubs within the Parramatta district also emerged with clubs being established in suburbs across the district over the ensuing decades and a Western Districts side representing the area in the President's Cup.\n\nAgitation in the area for a local club to participate in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|NSWRL Premiership]] began in the mid-1930s with a formal proposal put to the NSWRL in 1936 by local Rugby League identities such as [[Jack Argent]] and [[Jack Scullin]]. The proposal was rejected by all clubs except [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]].\n\n==1940s==\nThe advent of [[World War II]] put the establishment of the club on hold and a Parramatta district club was not proposed again until 1946 when the club was successfully admitted into the Premiership.\n\nIn the [[1947 NSWRFL season]], Parramatta's first, they finished at the bottom of the table, with one less win than fellow premiership debutants, [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]]. [[1948 NSWRFL season|In 1948]], Parramatta were winless in their first eleven matches but the signing of former [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] five-eighth [[Vic Hey]] as captain-coach helped them to eighth with five wins and a draw.

The club also saw utility back [[Ian Johnston (rugby league)|Ian Johnston]] win its first Australian guernsey.\n\n==1950s==\nThe promise of 1949 was not fulfilled during the 1950s. Hey had been plagued by injury in his first two years at the club and retired as a player after 1949, with the result that Parramatta fell back to ninth [[1950 NSWRFL season|in 1950]] before winning nine matches [[1951 NSWRFL season|in 1951]].\n\nIn their first five seasons Parramatta had won 28 and drawn eight of their ninety matches for a not disrespectful 35.56 percent winning rate, but the period from [[1952 NSWRFL season|1952]] [[1961 NSWRFL season|to 1961]] was to prove the most disastrous of any NSWRFL club since [[Sydney University rugby league team|University]] won only fifteen matches in nine seasons [[1929 NSWRFL season|between 1929]] [[1937 NSWRFL season|and 1937]].<ref name=\"History\"/> In these seasons Parramatta won only 35 and drew two of 180 matches and claimed the wooden spoon on no fewer than eight occasions, including six in succession from [[1956 NSWRFL season|1956]] to 1961. After Hey moved on at the end [[1953 NSWRFL season|of 1953]] Parramatta went on a merry-go-round with coaches: they had five in as many years from 1954 to 1958, and even former [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|Rabbitoh]] premiership coach [[Jack Rayner]] could not lift them off the bottom between 1958 and 1960.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/parramatta-eels/coaches.html?ord=years Parramatta Eels coaches]</ref>\n\nApart from the recruitments of international backrower [[Harold Crocker|\u201cMick\u201d Crocker]] for a then-record single-season fee in 1954<ref>\u2018Crocker will play here\u2019; ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 20 January 1954, p. 16</ref> and prized Yass hooker [[Bill Rayner]] in 1956, Parramatta was almost completely reliant upon local juniors<ref>Heads, Ian and Middleton, David; ''A Centenary of Rugby League 1908-2008: the Definitive Story of the Game in Australia'', Pan Macmillan. {{ISBN|9781405038300}}</ref> and not nearly enough quality players could be found for competitiveness; however, there were notable players like hardman prop [[Roy Fisher (rugby league)|Roy Fisher]], who played a record 170 consecutive grade games between 1954 and 1962.<ref>Middleton, David; ''Rugby League 1990-91'', pp. 104, 121 {{ISBN|0949853453}}</ref>\n\n==1960s==\n[[1960 NSWRFL season|1960]] was to prove the most disastrous season in Parramatta's history, with the club, despite the recruitment of Toowoomba centre [[Ron Boden]], finishing last in all three grades.<ref>Haddan, Steve; ''History of the NSW Rugby League Finals''; p. 135 {{ISBN|0646050982}}</ref> 1961 saw the acquisition of international back-rowers [[Ron Lynch (rugby league)|Ron Lynch]] from [[Forbes]] in country NSW and [[Brian Hambly]] from South Sydney,<ref name=\"History\"/> but the blue and golds, despite a promising start under captain-coach Boden with two early victories, won only one more game and returned to their familiar place at the foot of the ladder.\n\nUnder coach [[Ken Kearney]], Parramatta ended their run of six consecutive wooden spoons by finishing the [[1962 NSWRFL season]] in fourth place, making the play-offs for the first time and emulating this feat in the lower grades. With new recruits [[Ken Thornett]] (who became known as \u201cThe Mayor\u201d) from English club [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] and talented half-back [[Bob Bugden]] from [[St George Dragons|St George]], Parramatta had their most successful season since their inception before being eliminated from the finals in the first round by [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]].\n\nDespite the addition of skilful second-row forward [[Dick Thornett]] [[1963 NSWRFL season|for 1963]], ultimate success would continue to elude Parramatta with the side being knocked out of the 1963 finals by [[St George Dragons|St George]]. Finishing second in 1964 Parramatta were thrashed 42\u20130 by the Dragons in the major semi-final, before being knocked out by [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]]; their Third Grade team did however win the club's first premiership. In the 1965 season, with Ken Thornett as coach, the side finished in third position. However, Grand Final qualification would continue to elude them and Parramatta would again bow out of the finals, this time defeated by [[South Sydney Rabbitohs|South Sydney]]. Parramatta completed the rest of the 1960s in the middle of the ladder, without any further play-off appearances, finishing seventh in 1966, ninth in 1967, and sixth in 1968 and 1969.\n\n==1970s==\nParramatta finished with the wooden spoon, the club's tenth, in 1970, but with Ken Thornett returning finished fourth and again qualified for the play-offs in 1971. However, Parramatta again failed to progress in the minor semi, being defeated by [[St George Dragons|St George]], and fell back to last position in 1972 despite possessing class players like [[Bob O'Reilly]], [[Denis Fitzgerald]], and Keith Campbell. The Eels luckily avoided the wooden spoon in 1973 and 1974, but began the 1975 season by winning its first-ever senior trophy when they defeated Manly in their first-ever Pre-Season Cup (Wills Cup) final.\n\nIn the main premiership, Parramatta after a promising start fell off, losing seven and drawing one of nine games mid-season. A rush in the last six weeks saw them easily win five games to finished equal fifth (sixth on percentages) with [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]]{{efn|Wests were actually half a win ahead but were docked one match point for playing a replacement player who had not played the full reserve grade match as was required at the time.}} and were forced into a play-off for fifth position. Parramatta, on a roll, achieved a string of elimination play-off victories, defeating [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Western Suburbs]] (18\u201313) and then [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] (19\u20138) to qualify for the semi-finals in fifth position. Parramatta played [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]] in the preliminary final, achieving another narrow victory 6\u20135. However, in the minor semi-final Parramatta's courageous run of victories \u2013 achieved despite crippling injury toll<ref>Clarkson, Alan; \u2018Parra 13 Refuse to Be Beaten\u2019; ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 1 September 1975, p. 13</ref> \u2013 ended with a 22\u201312 defeat by Manly.\n\nIn 1976 a new coach, [[Terry Fearnley]], joined the Eels. In the same year several of Parramatta's greatest players joined the club. These included Rugby union recruit and 1975 Wallaby tourist, [[Ray Price (rugby footballer)|Ray Price]] who would go on to represent both [[New South Wales Rugby League team|NSW]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] in [[Rugby league]]. Another new recruit was five-eighth [[John Peard]]. Nicknamed \u201cthe Bomber\u201d, Peard was encouraged by Terry Fearnley to develop his tactical kicking game (the \u201c[[Bomb (kick)|bomb]]\u201d) as an attacking technique. As the 1976 season progressed Parramatta emerged as one of the best performing sides, finishing second in the competition.  In the major preliminary semi-final Parramatta decisively defeated [[St George Dragons|St George]] 31\u20136 and met [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] in the major semi final.  In a close match Parramatta narrowly defeated the Sea-Eagles with a late try to winger Graeme Atkins (who scored from a Peard bomb) and qualified for the club's first Grand Final. In the Grand Final, against the same [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] side they had defeated two weeks before, Parramatta were trailing 13\u201310 after 71 minutes. Receiving a penalty five metres from the goal line, the Eels formed a controversial [[flying wedge]] formation (now a banned movement in both Rugby codes) and pushed towards the goal line. The wedge collapsed before the goal line and Parramatta's [[Ron Hilditch]], who held the ball at the apex of the wedge, was tackled by Manly's [[Graham Eadie]] and the match ended with the scores unaltered.<ref>[http://rl1908.com/articles/Parramatta.htm Sean Fagan, ''Fearnley\u2019s Flying Wedge And The \u201876 Eels''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021080958/http://rl1908.com/articles/Parramatta.htm |date=21 October 2006 }} Retrieved on 5 September 2006; Alan Whiticker, ''Grand Finals of the NSWRL'' (2e), Gary Allen, 1994</ref>\n\nBolstered with the recruitment of goal-kicking [[Australia national rugby league team|Australian representative]] centre [[Mick Cronin (rugby league)|Mick Cronin]] Parramatta finished as minor premiers [[1977 NSWRFL season|in 1977]].

After the first minor semi-final final ended in a 13\u201313 draw a replay was required and Parramatta were defeated 17\u201311, but Manly appeared to have scored the winning try on the seventh tackle. In 1979, Parramatta made it to the major semi-final but were defeated by [[St George Dragons|St George]] 15\u201311 and lost the preliminary to Canterbury 20\u201314.\n\n==1980s==\nIn 1980, despite the recruitment of veteran [[Arthur Beetson]] and the emergence of notable players such as [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]], [[Steve Ella]] and [[Brett Kenny]], Parramatta missed the finals for the first time since 1974.\n\nParramatta, under coach [[Jack Gibson (rugby league)|Jack Gibson]], finished third in the competition and began their finals campaign with a major preliminary semi against [[Newtown Jets]] whom they narrowly defeated 10\u20138. An extra time victory over minor Premiers [[Sydney Roosters|Eastern Suburbs]] 12\u20138 followed and Parramatta qualified for the club's third Grand Final. Playing against Newtown, Parramatta led the Grand Final at half time, 7\u20136. A try to Newtown captain [[Tommy Raudonikis]] soon after half-time gave Newtown an 11\u20137 lead.  However, Parramatta responded with a try to winger [[Graeme Atkins (rugby league)|Graeme Atkins]]. Michael Cronin was able to convert the try and in the final five minutes of the match the Eels scored twice more to seal a 20\u201311 victory and their first-ever Premiership. In Parramatta, a large crowd of supporters greeted the team as they arrived back at the Leagues Club (situated adjacent to Cumberland Oval).  The already condemned grandstand and scoreboard at the Oval was set alight during the celebration by supporters and destroyed.<ref>Grantlee Kieza, \u2018Ding dong the witch is dead\u2019, ''Daily Telegraph'' 24 September 2004</ref>\n\nThe following year, with Cumberland Oval unavailable, Parramatta played home matches at [[Canterbury Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown's]] [[Belmore Oval]] and finished the season as minor premiers. With a then-record 619 points and 21 victories, 1982 was statistically the club's most successful season. In the major semi-final Parramatta were defeated by [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] 20\u20130, which allowed Manly to qualify for the Grand Final.

Manly's [[Les Boyd]] scored soon after the break, though it was their last try of the match and with [[Brett Kenny]] scoring in the sixtieth minute Parramatta recorded a 21\u20138 victory and a second consecutive premiership.\n\nParramatta finished second in the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League season 1983|1983 Premiership season]], and opened the finals with a 30\u201322 win over Canterbury before being defeated by Manly-Warringah in the major semi-final, however the Eels defeated Canterbury in the Preliminary Final to qualify for another Grand Final against Manly. In the Grand Final Parramatta built a 12\u20130 half-time lead, which Brett Kenny extended after half-time and, with Cronin's conversion, the Eels lead 18\u20130 and ultimately won 18\u20136. Parramatta's third consecutive premiership was the first treble in the NSWRFL Premiership since St George's domination of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nJack Gibson departed after the 1983 season and was replaced by former [[Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks|Cronulla]] and Woy Woy Roosters five-eighth [[John Monie]]. Under Monie Parramatta qualified for their fourth Grand Final in a row in 1984 after an 8\u20137 defeat of [[St George Dragons|St George]] in the final. Parramatta faced minor premiers Canterbury-Bankstown who had defeated the Eels the week before, 16\u20138 to qualify for the Grand Final.  The Grand Final was a low-scoring affair, with the Bulldogs defeating Parramatta 6\u20134. The Eels finished fourth in 1985 and, with defeats of Penrith and Balmain in the final series, progressed to the Preliminary Final against Canterbury-Bankstown with a chance to qualify for a fifth straight Grand Final. However, Parramatta were defeated 26\u20130 and Canterbury-Bankstown would go on to win the Grand Final.\n\nParramatta, playing out of the newly opened [[Parramatta Stadium|Stadium]], finished minor premiers and qualified for the Grand Final with a 28\u20136 victory over Canterbury-Bankstown in the Finals.  The Bulldogs defeated [[Balmain Tigers|Balmain]] to qualify for another Grand Final against Parramatta. The Grand Final would end without either side scoring a try, the first time this had happened in the history of the competition. Two successful goal attempts by Michael Cronin gave the Eels a 4\u20132 victory.  Both Michael Cronin and [[Ray Price (rugby footballer)|Ray Price]] chose to make the Grand Final victory their last game in Rugby league and both retired from the game.\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width=30em \n | quote  =There\u2019s no doubt Parramatta have the biggest following in our game.\n | source =[[John Quayle (rugby league)|John Quayle]], NSWRL General Manager at the end of the 1987 season<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Rowland\n  | first = David\n  | coauthors =  \n  | title = It\u2019s a game that belongs to the fans, says Quayle\n  | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]\n  | place =Australia\n  | page = 66\n  | publisher = Fairfax\n  | date = 9 September 1987\n  | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat=19870909&id=HlcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=juQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3084,6072837\n  | accessdate = 5 May 2010}}</ref>\n | align  =right\n}}\nBetween 1987 and 1996 the Eels failed to make the finals. Parramatta finished seventh in 1987, eleventh in 1988, and eighth in 1989. The old stars remained at the club, but injuries plagued all of them, especially Grothe and Geoff Bugden, whilst the cost of retaining Kenny and Sterling under the new [[NRL salary cap|salary cap]] had the effect of forcing the club to discard large numbers of promising juniors. Their only notable recruit, star Queensland backrower [[Bob Lindner]], stayed only two seasons before moving to [[Gold Coast Giants|the Gold Coast]].\n\n==1990s==\nThe first half of the 1990s continued this trend with notable players, such as Brett Kenny and Peter Sterling, retiring from the game. Parramatta were completely unable to replace players of this calibre via recruiting and consequently struggled. Coach [[John Monie]] departed at the end of the 1989 season and was replaced by [[Mick Cronin (rugby league)|Michael Cronin]]. In 1990, Parramatta finished eighth and Sterling in his last full season won his second [[Rothmans Medal]], but in 1991 and 1992 the club descended in the rankings, only narrowly avoiding the \u201cwooden spoon\u201d in the latter season. In 1993, the Eels finished eleventh after a promising start and then in 1994 under new coach [[Ron Hilditch]], twelfth.\n\n1995 proved the Eels worst season since 1960, with the club finishing second last with only three wins in first grade, last in reserve grade and last in the club championship. Players from this era included current [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] coach [[Justin Morgan (rugby league)|Justin Morgan]], injury-plagued [[City vs Country Origin|Country Origin]] representative centre [[David Woods (rugby league, born 1970)|David Woods]], [[Lee Oudenryn]] (who beat [[Martin Offiah]] in a half-time footrace in [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]]\u2019s 1992 tour match with Parramatta<ref>David Middleton (ed.), ''Rugby League 1992-93'', Iron Bark Press, 1993</ref>) and former Australian representative [[Paul Dunn (rugby league)|Paul Dunn]]. Other players of this era who would go on to play with other clubs included utility back [[Chris Lawler (rugby league)|Chris Lawler]] (who went to the Gold Coast Chargers), [[Garen Casey]] (Penrith Panthers) and [[Scott Mahon]] (North Queensland Cowboys).\n\n===Super League===\nThe \u201cSuper League war\u201d that began in 1995 provided an opportunity for Parramatta to recruit notable players from other clubs. As players and clubs aligned with either the [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] or the [[Super League war|Super League]] competitions, various players became dislodged from their clubs. Parramatta, aligning with the ARL, were able to recruit ARL-aligned players from Super League-aligned clubs. This led to Parramatta signing star players [[Dean Pay]], [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]], [[Jim Dymock]] and [[Jarrod McCracken]], from 1995 premiers [[Canterbury Bulldogs]], alongside [[Aaron Raper]] and [[Adam Ritson]] from [[Cronulla Sharks|Cronulla]]. Parramatta entered [[1996 ARL season|the 1996 season]] with a squad comprising not only these notable Super League defectors, but also [[New Zealand Rugby League|New Zealand]] international half-back [[Gary Freeman (rugby league)|Gary Freeman]]. However, despite these recruits, the Eels again failed to make the semi-finals. Parramatta spent most of the season in the lower reaches of, or just outside, a finals position. The Eels made a late challenge for final qualification, which included a Round 19 defeat of the [[Newcastle Knights]] in front of a home crowd of 21,191 (the largest [[Parramatta Stadium]] attendance since 1986). However, the blue and golds lost three consecutive matches to end the season in thirteenth position.\n\nThe 1997 season saw the recruitment of a new coach, former [[St George Dragons]] coach [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]].  The appointment of Brian Smith saw a reversal in Parramatta's fortunes with the Club finishing in third place and making the [[Australian Rugby League]] semi-finals in [[Australian Rugby League season 1997|1997]] for the first time since 1986.  Parramatta lost both its finals matches to [[Newcastle Knights]] and [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] in the Major Qualifying Final to exit from the series. The same scenario would reoccur in [[National Rugby League season 1998|1998]] (4th), [[National Rugby League season 1999|1999]] (2nd) and [[National Rugby League season 2000|2000]] (7th) with Parramatta failing to qualify for the Grand Final on each occasion. In the 1998 preliminary final Parramatta were leading arch rivals Canterbury 18\u20132 with less than 10 minutes to play and then what can only be described as the greatest choke in Rugby League preliminary finals history occurred.  Canterbury managed to fight their way back into the match and with a minute left on the scoreboard, winger [[Daryl Halligan]] kicked a conversion from out on the far touchline to send the game into extra time. Canterbury won in extra time 32\u201320.  The loss was hard to take for Parramatta as they had beaten eventual premiers Brisbane twice during the regular season.<ref>http://www.nrl.com/top-10-preliminary-final-heartbreaks/tabid/10874/newsid/89986/default.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/canterbury-bulldogs-parramatta-eels-and-more-the-seven-best-finals-runs-of-the-nrl-era/news-story/007a8a9ede205622095a2ede85839a2d</ref> In 1999, Parramatta led Melbourne 16-0 at halftime in the preliminary final only to lose 18\u201316 at full time.  Melbourne went on to win the premiership the following week. In the 2000 NRL season, Parramatta finished seventh and won both their sudden death finals matches to take on Brisbane in the preliminary final. In a game that they were not expected to win, Parramatta came close but lost the match against a much stronger Brisbane side. This was their third preliminary final loss in a row.<ref>http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/05/15/so-close-yet-so-far-for-parramatta/</ref>\n\nDuring this period, in the wake of the resolution of the Super League War and the creation of the [[National Rugby League]], the competition underwent a major restructure. It was announced that the new competition would comprise only 14 teams out of the 22 who had competed in the two competitions in 1997. This contraction would necessitate mergers or the culling of teams who did not meet the criteria for inclusion into the new competition. Despite meeting these criteria the Parramatta board explored mergers with both [[Penrith Panthers]] and [[Balmain Tigers]] but opted against the plan.<ref>[http://www.smhnews/league/double-punt-is-finally-paying-off/2005/09/23/1126982232466.html Steve Mascord and Brad Walter, \u2018Double punt is finally paying off\u2019, ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 24 September, 2005]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==2000s==\n\nParramatta, having recruited half-back [[Jason Taylor (rugby league)|Jason Taylor]], finished 2001 as minor premiers and qualified for the Grand Final for the first time since 1986. Parramatta won 20 of their regular season matches with the best offensive and defensive record in the [[National Rugby League season 2001|season]], finishing 5 points clear of the 2nd placed Bulldogs.  Parramatta set a regular-season points scoring record in the premiership by scoring 839 points in 26 matches. Playing [[Newcastle Knights]] in the Grand Final Parramatta trailed 0\u201324 at half-time. Despite a strong second-half performance from the Eels with two tries to both [[Brett Hodgson]] and [[Jamie Lyon]] the Eels were defeated 30\u201324.  There are several stories as to why Parramatta were unable to win the match in the years after the game.  One such story was that The Parramatta players were \"Nervous and Stiff\" and were dressed in Miami Vice suits at the traditional NRL Grand Final Breakfast.  Ex-Newcastle player [[Ben Kennedy (rugby league)|Ben Kennedy]] recalled the week by saying \"They came into the game under a shitload of pressure but for us, it was just a good time and a heap of fun. Parra were shitting themselves and we were having a good time\".<ref>http://www.theherald.com.au/story/476921/newcastle-knights-recall-2001-grand-final-glory/</ref>\n\nThe club qualified for the finals in 2002, finishing sixth, but failed to do so in 2004, finishing ninth. In 2005, the Eels won their second minor premiership but failed to convert the position into another Grand Final appearance losing 29-0 to The [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in the preliminary final in a game that Parramatta was expected to win.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/cowboys-stun-eels-to-make-grand-final/2005/09/25/1127586741021.html</ref> It was announced soon after the disastrous 2005 finals series that coach Brian Smith had been asked to stand down after the conclusion of the 2006 season, to be replaced by Newcastle coach [[Michael Hagan]]. After a poor start to [[2006 NRL season|the 2006 season]], Smith resigned on 15 May 2006 and was replaced by former Eels half-back Jason Taylor. Despite the team's low position on the ladder at the time, the team qualified for the finals in eighth position but were eliminated by minor premiers [[Melbourne Storm]] in the first week of the series.\n\nIn the 2007 season, Parramatta finished 5th on the ladder at the end of the regular season and once again made the preliminary final.  This time against The [[Melbourne Storm]].  Parramatta lost the match 26-10.  This was their 5th preliminary final loss in 9 years.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-09-02/eels-destroy-broncs-to-take-fifth-spot/657438</ref><ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nrl-2007/prelim-final/melbourne-vs-parramatta/summary.html</ref>\n\n[[Daniel Anderson (rugby league)|Daniel Anderson]] was appointed coach at the end of the [[2008 NRL season]].\n\nMidway through the [[2009 NRL season]] the troubled Parramatta Eels club replaced [[Denis Fitzgerald]], then the longest-serving CEO in the competition's history, with [[Paul Osborne]].<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = AAP\n  | first = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = The Midas touch\n  | work = ABC Grandstand Sport\n  | place =\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]\n  | date = 2 October 2009\n  | url = http://www.abc.net.au/sport/stories/2009/10/02/2703054.htm?site=sport&section=all\n  | accessdate = 26 October 2009}}</ref> Parramatta then completed a remarkable turnaround, going on to reach the grand final after sitting in 14th spot on the table after Round 18. They won 10 of their last 12 matches to make the grand final defeating minor premiers The [[St George Dragons]], Gold Coast and Arch-Rivals Canterbury on the way to the final, which they lost to the salary cap rorting [[Melbourne Storm]] who later had the title stripped due to the cheating.<ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/nrl-2009/parramatta/summary.html</ref>\n\n==2010s==\n{{update|section|date=July 2016}}\n{{see also|Parramatta Eels salary cap breach}}\n\nFor the 2011 NRL Season, Parramatta was managed by new head coach [[Stephen Kearney]].  Round 1 saw Parramatta get off to the perfect start by beating The [[Auckland Warriors]] 24-18 at Eden Park in New Zealand.  But after that Round 1 victory the rest of 2011 was a very bleak one for Parramatta with the team finishing fourteenth on the ladder of sixteen clubs. Along the way Parramatta went on a 7-game losing streak including a 56-6 loss to South Sydney.  In the final round of the season, Parramatta played against The Gold Coast with the loser almost certainly receiving the wooden spoon.  Parramatta won the match 32\u201312 and Gold Coast were consigned to the wooden spoon.\n\nIn 2012, things went from bad to worse at the club as Parramatta finished last for the first time since 1972. Towards the back end of the season, Kearney's contract was terminated and [[Brad Arthur]] was installed as caretaker coach.  The last insult came in the final match of the season against The [[St George Dragons]] as retiring legends [[Luke Burt & Nathan Hindmarsh]] both went out as wooden spooners in their final year as players. The only thing memorable to come from the match was a last minute penalty goal kicked by Hindmarsh.<ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/the-lowdown-eels-v-dragons/news-story/61d45b329cdbd429c77eb55985d9a67a</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Parramatta appointed [[Ricky Stuart]] as their new coach on a three-year deal. In the opening round there was a lot of optimism and hope for the future as Parramatta defeated [[Auckland Warriors]] 40-10 at Parramatta Stadium.  This result proved to be the highlight of the season as Parramatta finished last again. Along the way Parramatta lost 10 matches in a row including heavy losses to Manly & Canterbury.  Mid season, Stuart also announced that as of the end of the season, there would be a massive cull of the playing roster and twelve players were told that their services were no longer required as of next season. In May 2013 [[Steve Sharp (rugby league)|Steve Sharp]] was elected Chairman of the [[Parramatta Eels]] board, replacing [[Roy Spagnolo]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritchie|first=Dean|title=New Parramatta chairman Steve Sharp vows to again make Eels club for the people|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/new-parramatta-chairman-steve-sharp-vows-to-again-make-eels-club-for-the-people/story-fni3ga7r-1226640640706|accessdate=16 October 2013|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 May 2013}}</ref>\nOn 12 September 2013, Stuart walked out on Parramatta to coach Canberra. On 16 October 2013, Brad Arthur was announced as the new head coach of Parramatta on a 3-year deal.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-12/ricky-stuart-quits-eels-to-link-with-raiders/4952672</ref><ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/parramatta-eels-nrl-coach-ricky-stuart-punts-at-least-12-players-for-next-season/news-story/a83519fd3ca11dc4d59373c18da64171</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-16/parramatta-eels-appoint-brad-arthur-as-coach-ahead-of-jason-tay/5026086</ref>\n\nThe 2014 season started off in great style as Parramatta won 4 out of their first 6 matches. Parramatta then went into their Easter Monday clash at [[Stadium Australia]] sitting 5th on the ladder but lost the match controversially 21\u201318 in front of 50,000 fans. In round 24 Parramatta were sitting 8th on the ladder and looked destined to play in the finals for the first time since 2009 and only needed to win one of their last two remaining games against sides lower than them on the table which were Canberra and Newcastle.  Parramatta lost both matches and missed out on the finals series by two competition points.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/rugby-league-match-centre/parramatta-eels-v-wests-tigers-20140417-36vfv.html</ref><ref>http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/knights/parramatta-eels-finals-hopes-hit-by-a-secondhalf-blitz-from-newcastle-knights/news-story/ef379d470227dd9162766cf13a340f3b</ref>\n\nThe 2015 season was a year to forget for Parramatta as they finished twelfth on the table. The highlights being in Round 1 when Parramatta defeated Manly 42-12 and Semi Radradra scoring 24 tries in 18 matches.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/semi-radradra-breaks-parramatta-eels-tryscoring-record-with-a-controversial-pair-of-tries-20150906-gjgaxg.html</ref>\n\nThe discovery by the NRL in 2016 of  [[salary cap]] breaches, over a period of four years, resulted in it stripping the Eels of the twelve competition points the club has accrued so far in the [[2016 NRL season]]. In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its [[2016 NRL Auckland Nines]] title revoked.<ref name=\"salary-cap-1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nrl.com/eels-breaches-must-stop-today-greenberg/tabid/10874/newsid/95541/default.aspx |title=Eels breaches must stop today: Greenberg |publisher=NRL.com |first=Martin |last=Gabor |date=3 May 2016 |accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrl.com/greenberg-addressed-shattered-eels-players/tabid/10874/newsid/95548/default.aspx |title=Greenberg addressed \u201cshattered\u201d Eels players |publisher=NRL.com |first=Martin|last=Gabor |date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>  On 19 July 2016 the Parramatta Leagues Club board was sacked by the [[Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority]], and an administrator appointed.

Their first match played after the points deduction was against South Sydney at Parramatta Stadium, Parramatta lost the match 22\u201320 in a close game.  2016 would also prove to be the final year that Parramatta would play at [[Parramatta Stadium]] as it was due to be demolished at seasons end to make way for a new 30,000 seat stadium.  The final home game played at Parramatta Stadium was against The [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] in front of 13,553 spectators. Parramatta went on to beat the Dragons 30-18. Parramatta's final game of 2016 saw them travel to New Zealand to play The [[Auckland Warriors]].  Parramatta won the match 40-18 with [[Bevan French]] scoring 3 tries. At the end of the season, Parramatta finished in 14th place on the ladder but if they had not been stripped of the 12 competition points they would have played in the finals.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-13/souths-break-parramatta-hearts-as-eels-fans-rally-around-club/7414160</ref><ref>http://www.theroar.com.au/2016/09/04/new-zealand-warriors-vs-parramatta-eels-nrl-live-scores-blog-3/</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-29/bevan-french-parramatta-eels-st-george-illawarra-dragons-nrl/7796414</ref>\n\nThe 2017 season saw a major turnaround for the club with Parramatta finishing fourth on the table and making the finals for the first time since 2009.  Some of the highlights throughout the year were the club winning nine out of their final ten matches and defeating Brisbane twice including a 52-34 win at [[Suncorp Stadium]] and eventual premiers Melbourne.<ref>http://www.nrl.com/eels-2017-season-review/tabid/10874/newsid/112225/default.aspx</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-24/parramatta-eels-brisbane-broncos-nrl/8834608</ref>  Parramatta then went on to play premiership favorites Melbourne in the first qualifying final, going into the second half Parramatta had stunned everyone by leading the match and it took Melbourne the last play of the game to hold on and win 18-16.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrlfinals/live-nrl-finals-melbourne-storm-v-parramatta-eels-score-updates-result-blog/news-story/225e83d53f61bd57e9d3a3eebbb11ebf</ref> The following week, Parramatta played against North Queensland in the sudden death elimination final.  Parramatta led 10-6 at halftime but went on to  lose the match 24-16 in what would be one of the biggest upsets of the season.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-16/nrl-north-queensland-cowboys-beat-parramatta-eels/8940644</ref>\n\nFor the 2018 season, Parramatta were predicted by many before the season to finish in the top 8 and challenge for the premiership. Those predictions were matched in the opening round of the season as Parramatta lead Penrith 14-0 early on but after a second half capitulation lost the game 24-14. In Round 2, Parramatta were humiliated 54-0 by Manly at [[Brookvale Oval]]. Parramatta went on to lose the opening 6 games of the season before eventually winning their first game of the season defeating Manly 44-10 in Round 7. In Round 8, Parramatta defeated Wests 24-22 to make it back to back victories for the club. The Eels then went on to lose the next 5 games in a row before eventually winning their third game of the season defeating North Queensland 20-14 in Darwin in which Jarryd Hayne returned from injury scoring two tries. The following weeks were filled with disappointment as the club came close to pulling off upset wins against top of the table St George only for the club to concede two tries in 5 minutes to lose 20-18 and South Sydney after leading 20-6 late into the game only for The Rabbitohs to score late tries and win 26-20. In Round 18, Parramatta lost 18-16 to Newcastle with The Eels being denied a last minute try after it was ruled winger [[Bevan French]] had put his foot over the sideline. The following week, Parramatta defeated arch rivals Canterbury 14-8 in what the media dubbed the \"Spoon Bowl\". There were hopes that Parramatta could avoid the wooden spoon as going into the second last game of the season the club sat above North Queensland on the table due to for and against. In what was the retiring Jonathan Thurston's final home game, both clubs needed a win to avoid the wooden spoon. North Queensland won the match 44-6. In the final game of the season, Parramatta were defeated 44-10 by Eastern Suburbs ensuring that the club finished last and claimed their 14th wooden spoon and The Roosters claiming the minor premiership. Before the match, Easts needed to defeat Parramatta by 27 points to overtake Melbourne and finish first on the table.<ref>https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/eels/parramatta-eels-season-2018-review-peter-sterlings-biggest-fear-after-horror-campaign/news-story/14f79c1c637fa8d03bbfa6d6b63b55f1</ref> <ref>https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/03/03/expert-predictions-for-nrl-top-eight-in-2018/</ref><ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-28/nrl-st-george-illawarra-edge-out-paramatta/9914596</ref>\n\nBefore the start of the [[2019 NRL season]], Parramatta were predicted by many to finish towards the bottom of the table or claim another wooden spoon.  The club started off the year with back to back victories over [[Penrith Panthers|Penrith]] and arch rivals [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]].  In Round 6 of the [[2019 NRL season]], Parramatta played their first game at the new [[Western Sydney Stadium]] against the [[Wests Tigers]] and ran out 51-6 winners in front of a sold out crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-04-22/parramatta-eels-thrash-west-tigers-nrl/11034182/|title=Parramatta Eels thrash Wests Tigers 51-6 to christen new Parramatta Stadium|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref>  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/11/22/fans-predictions-where-each-club-will-finish-in-2019/|title=Where each club will finish in 2019|website=NRL}}</ref>\n\nIn Round 9 against Melbourne, Parramatta suffered one of their worst ever defeats losing 64-10 at [[Suncorp Stadium]].  In the aftermath of the defeat, coach [[Brad Arthur]] and the players were placed under intense scrutiny but just a week after the loss, Arthur was given a two-year contract extension by the Parramatta board.

In the elimination final against Brisbane, Parramatta won the match 58-0 at the new [[Western Sydney Stadium]].  The victory was the biggest finals win in history, eclipsing Newtown's 55-7 win over St George in 1944.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], warning of the supposed dangers of admitting [[Jews]] to the nascent [[United States]].  The speech was purportedly transcribed by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, but was unknown before its appearance in 1934 in the pages of [[William Dudley Pelley|William Dudley Pelley's]] [[Silver Legion]] pro-[[Nazi]] weekly magazine ''Liberation''.  No evidence exists for the document's authenticity, and some of the author's claims have actively been disproven.\n\n==The speech==\nThe setting for the speech is a dinner table discussion purportedly recorded by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] during the convention of the [[Continental Congress]].  Primarily, it is a polemic arguing against admitting Jewish immigration into the newly formed United States. The text is as follows:<ref name=\"facts\" />\n\n{{quote|There is a great danger for the United State of America. This great danger is the Jew. Gentlemen, in every land the Jews have settled, they have depressed the moral level and lowered the degree of commercial honesty. They have remained apart and unassimilated; oppressed, they attempt to strangle the nation financially, as in the case of Portugal and Spain.\n\nFor more than seventeen hundred years they have lamented their sorrowful fate \u2014 namely, that they have been driven out of their mother land; but, gentlemen, if the civilized world today should give them back Palestine and their property, they would immediately find pressing reason for not returning there. Why? Because they are vampires and vampires cannot live on other vampires --they cannot live among themselves. They must live among Christians and others who do not belong to their race.\n\nIf they are not expelled from the United States by the Constitution within less than one hundred years, they will stream into this country in such numbers that they will rule and destroy us and change our form of Government for which we Americans shed our blood and sacrificed our life, property and personal freedom. If the Jews are not excluded within two hundred years, our children will be working in the field to feed Jews while they remain in the counting houses, gleefully rubbing their hands.\n\nI warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jews forever, your children and your children\u2019s children will curse you in their graves.

The speech was purportedly transcribed by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] during the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, but was unknown before its appearance in 1934 in the pages of [[William Dudley Pelley|William Dudley Pelley's]] [[Silver Legion]] pro-[[Nazi]] weekly magazine ''Liberation''.  No evidence exists for the document's authenticity, and some of the author's claims have actively been disproven.\n\n==The speech==\nThe setting for the speech is a dinner table discussion purportedly recorded by [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] during the convention of the [[Continental Congress]].  Primarily, it is a polemic arguing against admitting Jewish immigration into the newly formed United States. The text is as follows:<ref name=\"facts\" />\n\n{{quote|There is a great danger for the United State of America. This great danger is the Jew. Gentlemen, in every land the Jews have settled, they have depressed the moral level and lowered the degree of commercial honesty. They have remained apart and unassimilated; oppressed, they attempt to strangle the nation financially, as in the case of Portugal and Spain.\n\nFor more than seventeen hundred years they have lamented their sorrowful fate \u2014 namely, that they have been driven out of their mother land; but, gentlemen, if the civilized world today should give them back Palestine and their property, they would immediately find pressing reason for not returning there. Why? Because they are vampires and vampires cannot live on other vampires --they cannot live among themselves. They must live among Christians and others who do not belong to their race.\n\nIf they are not expelled from the United States by the Constitution within less than one hundred years, they will stream into this country in such numbers that they will rule and destroy us and change our form of Government for which we Americans shed our blood and sacrificed our life, property and personal freedom. If the Jews are not excluded within two hundred years, our children will be working in the field to feed Jews while they remain in the counting houses, gleefully rubbing their hands.\n\nI warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude the Jews forever, your children and your children\u2019s children will curse you in their graves. Their ideas are not those of Americans, even when they lived among us for ten generations. The leopard cannot change his spots. The Jews are a danger to this land, and if they are allowed to enter, they will imperil our institutions.
