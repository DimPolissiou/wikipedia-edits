The aim is to reduce the harmful effects of all hazards, including [[disaster]]s.\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] defines an emergency as the state in which normal procedures are interrupted, and immediate measures need to be taken to prevent that state from turning into a disaster. Thus, emergency management is crucial to avoid the disruption transforming into a disaster, which is even harder to recover from. Emergency management is a related term but should not be equated to disaster management.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Emergency planning ideals==\nEmergency planning, a discipline of [[urban planning]] and [[urban design|design]], first aims to prevent emergencies from occurring, and failing that, should develop a good action plan to mitigate the results and effects of any emergencies. As time goes on, and more data become available, usually through the study of emergencies as they occur, a plan should evolve. The development of emergency plans is a cyclical process, common to many risk management disciplines, such as business continuity and security risk management, as set out below:\n* Recognition or identification of risks<ref>Zhou, Q., Huang, W., & Zhang, Y.

There are very few emergency management specific standards, and emergency management as a discipline tends to fall under business resilience standards.\n\nIn order to avoid or reduce significant losses to a business, emergency managers should work to identify and anticipate potential risks. In the event that an emergency does occur, managers should have a plan prepared to mitigate the effects of that emergency, as well as to ensure business continuity of critical operations after the incident. It is essential for an organization to include procedures for determining whether an emergency situation has occurred and at what point an emergency management plan should be activated. An emergency plan must be regularly maintained, in a structured and methodical manner, to ensure it is up-to-date in the event of an emergency. Emergency managers generally follow a common process to anticipate, assess, prevent, prepare, respond and recover from an incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/emergency|title=Emergency Response Plan - Ready.gov|website=www.ready.gov}}</ref>\n\n== Health and safety of workers ==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{importance section|date=April 2020}}\n{{duplication|date=April 2020}}\n}}\nCleanup during disaster recovery involves many [[occupational hazard]]s. Often these hazards are exacerbated by the conditions of the local environment as a result of the [[natural disaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/OshDoc/cleanupHazard.html|title=Fact Sheet on Natural Disaster Recovery: Cleanup Hazard|website=www.osha.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref> While individual workers should be aware of these potential hazards, employers are responsible for minimizing exposure to these hazards and protecting workers, when possible. This includes identification and thorough assessment of potential hazards, application of appropriate [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE), and the distribution of other relevant information in order to enable safe performance of the work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3698.pdf|title=OSHA Fact Sheet_Keeping Workers Safe During Disaster Cleanup and Recovery|last=|first=|date=2017-11-27|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Maintaining a safe and healthy environment for these workers ensures that the effectiveness of the disaster recovery is unaffected.\n\n=== Physical exposures ===\n'''Flood-associated injuries''': Flooding disasters often expose workers to trauma from sharp and blunt objects hidden under murky waters causing lacerations, as well as open and closed fractures. These injuries are further exacerbated with exposure to the often contaminated waters, leading to increased risk for infection.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Bandino|first=Justin P.|last2=Hang|first2=Anna|last3=Norton|first3=Scott A.|title=The Infectious and Noninfectious Dermatological Consequences of Flooding: A Field Manual for the Responding Provider|journal=American Journal of Clinical Dermatology|volume=16|issue=5|pages=399\u2013424|doi=10.1007/s40257-015-0138-4|pmid=26159354|year=2015}}</ref> When working around water, there is always the risk of drowning.

After a natural disaster, certain chemicals can be more prominent in the environment. These hazardous materials can be released directly or indirectly. Chemical hazards directly released after a natural disaster often occur concurrent with the event so little to no mitigation actions can take place for mitigation. For example, airborne magnesium, chloride, phosphorus, and ammonia can be generated by droughts. Dioxins can be produced by forest fires, and silica can be emitted by forest fires. Indirect release of hazardous chemicals can be intentionally released or unintentionally released. An example of intentional release is insecticides used after a flood or chlorine treatment of water after a flood. Unintentional release is when a hazardous chemical is not intentionally released. The chemical released is often toxic and serves beneficial purpose when released to the environment. These chemicals can be controlled through engineering to minimize their release when a natural disaster strikes. An example of this is agrochemicals from inundated storehouses or manufacturing facilities poisoning the floodwaters or asbestos fibers released from a building collapse during a hurricane.<ref name=\"Young 3\u201320\">{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Stacy|last2=Balluz|first2=Lina|last3=Malilay|first3=Josephine|date=2004-04-25|title=Natural and technologic hazardous material releases during and after natural disasters: a review|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=publichealthresources|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=322|issue=1|pages=3\u201320|doi=10.1016/S0048-9697(03)00446-7|pmid=15081734|bibcode=2004ScTEn.322....3Y}}</ref> The flowchart to the right has been adopted from research performed by Stacy Young, et al., and can be found here.<ref name=\"Young 3\u201320\"/>\n\n'''Exposure limits'''\n[[File:Hazardous Chemical Release Flowchart.jpg|thumb|Classification of hazardous material releases associated with natural disasters]]\nBelow are TLV-TWA, PEL, and IDLH values for common chemicals workers are exposed to after a natural disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/annotated-pels/|title=OSHA Annotated PELs {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/pgintrod.html|title=CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards (NPG) Introduction|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Chemical'''\n|'''TLV-TWA (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|'''PEL (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|'''IDLH (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|-\n|'''Magnesium'''\n|10\n|15\n|750\n|-\n|'''Phosphorus'''\n|0.1\n|0.1\n|Not established\n|-\n|'''Ammonia'''\n|17\n|35\n|27\n|-\n|'''Silica(R)'''\n|.025\n|10\n|50\n|-\n|'''Chlorine dioxide'''\n|0.28\n|0.3\n|29\n|-\n|'''Asbestos'''\n|10 (fibers/m^3)\n|10 (fibers/m^3)\n|Not established\n|}\n\n'''Direct release'''\n* Magnesium\n* Phosphorus\n* Ammonia\n* Silica\n\n'''Intentional release'''\n* Insecticides\n* Chlorine dioxide\n\n'''Unintentional release'''\n* Crude oil components\n* Benzene, N-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, cumene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, toluene, xylenes, PCBs, agrochemicals\n* Asbestos\n\n'''Exposure routes'''\n\nWhen a toxicant is prominent in an environment after a natural disaster, it is important to determine the route of exposure to worker safety for the disaster management workers. The three components are source of exposure, pathway of the chemical, and receptor. Questions to ask when dealing with chemical source is the material itself, how it's used, how much is used, how often the chemical is used, temperature, vapor pressure, physical processes. The physical state of the chemical is important to identify. If working indoors, room ventilation, and volume of room needs to be noted to help mitigate health defects from the chemical. Lastly, to ensure worker safety, routes of entry for the chemical should be determined as well as relevant personal protective equipment needs to be worn.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exposure Science in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2012-09-07|isbn=9780309264686|language=en|doi=10.17226/13507|pmid = 24901193}}</ref>\n\n'''Respirators'''\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u201cIf you need to collect belongings or do basic clean up in your previously flooded home, you do not usually need to use a respirator (a mask worn to prevent breathing in harmful substances).\u201d A respirator should be worn when performing an operation in an enclosed environment such as a house that creates ample amounts of dust. These activities could include sweeping dust, using power saws and equipment, or cleaning up mold. If you encounter dust, the CDC says to \u201climit your contact with the dust as much as possible. Use wet mops or vacuums with HEPA filters instead of dry sweeping and lastly wear a respirator that protects against dust in the air. A respirator that is approved by the CDC/NIOSH is the [[N95 respirator]] and can be a good personal protective equipment to protect from dust and mold in the air from the associated natural disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/respiratory.html|title=Respiratory Protection for Residents Reentering Previously Flooded Areas{{!}}Health and Safety Concerns|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Biological exposures ===\n\n'''Mold exposures''': Exposure to [[mold]] is commonly seen after a natural disaster such as flooding, hurricane, tornado or tsunami. Mold growth can occur on both the exterior and interior of residential or commercial buildings. Warm and humid condition encourages mold growth; therefore, standing water and excess moisture after a natural disaster would provide an ideal environment for mold growth especially in tropical regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/mold/|title=Mold \u2013 Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|date=8 December 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}</ref> While the exact number of mold species is unknown, some examples of commonly found indoor molds are [[Aspergillus]], [[Cladosporium]], [[Alternaria]] and [[Penicillium]]. Reaction to molds differ between individuals and can range from mild symptoms such as eye irritation, cough to severe life-threatening asthmatic or allergic reactions. People with history of [[chronic lung disease (disambiguation)|chronic lung disease]], asthma, allergy, other breathing problems or those that are [[immunocompromised]] could be more sensitive to molds and may develop [[fungal pneumonia]].\n\nThe most effective approach to control mold growth after a natural disaster is to control moisture level. Some ways to prevent mold growth after a natural disaster include opening all doors and windows, using fans to dry out the building, positioning fans to blow air out of the windows and cleaning up the building within the first 24\u201348 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/mold/ten-things-you-should-know-about-mold|title=Ten Things You Should Know about Mold \u2013 US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED|website=US EPA|date=2014-10-22}}</ref> All wet items that cannot be properly cleaned and dried within the first 48 hours should be promptly removed and discarded from the building. If mold growth is found in the building, it is important to concurrently remove the molds and fix the underlying moisture problem. When removing molds, N-95 masks or respirators with a higher protection level should be used to prevent inhalation of molds into the respiratory system.<ref>https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/moldguide12.pdf</ref> Molds can be removed from hard surfaces by soap and water, a diluted bleach solution<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/psa/moldremoval.html|title=Mold Removal After a Disaster-PSAs for Disasters|website=www.cdc.gov|date=2019-02-28}}</ref> or commercial products.\n\n'''Human remains''': According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]], \"There is no direct risk of contagion or infectious disease from being near human remains for people who are not directly involved in recovery or other efforts that require handling dead bodies.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/handleremains.html|title=Handling Human Remains After a Disaster{{!}}Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> Most viruses and bacteria perish along with the human body after death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/ems/flood_cds/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Flooding and communicable diseases fact sheet|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> Therefore, no excessive measures are necessary when handling human remains indirectly. However, for workers in direct contact with human remains, [[universal precautions]] should be exercised in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to blood-borne viruses and bacteria. Relevant [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] includes eye protection, face mask or shield, and gloves. The predominant health risk are gastrointestinal infections through [[Fecal\u2013oral route|fecal-oral]] contamination, so [[Hand washing|hand hygiene]] is paramount to prevention. Mental health support should also be available to workers who endure [[psychological stress]] during and after recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|title=American Psychological Association_Disasters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229124918/http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|archive-date=2009-12-29|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n'''Flood-associated skin infections''': Flood waters are often contaminated with bacteria and waste as well as chemicals on occasion. Prolonged, direct contact with these waters leads to an increased risk for skin infection, especially with open wounds in the skin or history of a previous skin condition, such as [[atopic dermatitis]] or [[psoriasis]]. These infections are exacerbated with a compromised immune system or an aging population.<ref name=\":0\" /> The most common bacterial skin infections are usually with [[Staphylococcus]] and [[Streptococcus]]. One of the most uncommon, but well-known bacterial infections is from [[Vibrio vulnificus]], which causes a rare, but often fatal infection called [[necrotizing fasciitis]].\n[[File:Necrotizing fasciitis left leg debridement.JPEG|thumb|Surgical debridement of left leg necrotizing fasciitis.]]\n\nOther salt-water Mycobacterium infections include the slow growing [[Mycobacterium marinum|M. marinum]] and fast growing [[Mycobacterium fortuitum|M. fortuitum]], [[Mycobacterium chelonae|M. chelonae]], and [[Mycobacterium abscessus|M. abscessus]]. Fresh-water bacterial infections include [[aeromonas hydrophila]], [[Burkholderia pseudomallei]] causing [[melioidosis]], [[leptospira interrogans]] causing [[leptospirosis]], and chromobacterium violaceum. Fungal infections may lead to [[chromoblastomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]], [[mucormycosis]], and [[dermatophytosis]]. Numerous other [[arthropod]], [[Protozoan infection|protozoal]], and [[Parasitic disease|parasitic]] infections have been described.<ref name=\":0\" /> A worker can reduce the risk of flood-associated skin infections by avoiding the water if an open wound is present, or at minimum, cover the open wound with a waterproof bandage. Should contact with flood water occur, the open wound should be washed thoroughly with soap and clean water.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/vibriovulnificus.html|title=Vibrio vulnificus{{!}}Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|date=2017-10-11|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Psychosocial exposures ===\nProviding disaster recovery assistance is both rewarding and stressful. According to the CDC, \"Sources of stress for emergency responders may include witnessing human suffering, risk of personal harm, intense workloads, life-and-death decisions, and separation from family.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/coping/responders.asp|title=Emergency Responders: Tips for taking care of yourself|date=2017-11-07|website=emergency.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> These stresses need to be prevented or effectively managed in order to optimize assistance without causing danger to oneself. Preparation as an emergency responder is key, in addition to establishing care for responsibilities at home. During the recovery efforts, it is critical to understand and recognize burnout and sources of stress. After the recovery, it is vital to take time away from the disaster scene and slowly re-integrate back to the normal work environment. [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)]] provides stress prevention and management resources for disaster recovery responders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/disaster-preparedness|title=Disaster Preparedness, Response, and Recovery|last=ann.lynsen|date=2014-06-20|website=www.samhsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Volunteer responsibilities ===\nThe [[FEMA|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] advises those who desire to assist go through organized volunteer organizations and not to self-deploy to affected locations. The [[VOAD|National Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD)]] serves as the primary point of contact for volunteer organization coordination. All states have their own state VOAD organization. As a volunteer, since an employer does not have oversight, one must be vigilant and protect against possible physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial exposures. Furthermore, there must be defined roles with relevant training available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalservice.gov/resources/disaster-services/defining-volunteer-roles-preparation-disaster-response|title=Defining Volunteer Roles in Preparation for Disaster Response|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Proper tools and PPE may or may not be available, so safety and liability should always be considered.\n\n=== Employer responsibilities ===\nEvery employer is required to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for its employees. When an emergency situation occurs, employers are expected to protect workers from all harm resulting from any potential hazard, including physical, chemical, and biological exposure. In addition, an employer should provide pre-emergency training and build an emergency action plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hurricane/responsibilities.html|title=OSHA's Hazard Exposure and Risk Assessment Matrix for Hurricane Response and Recovery Work: Employer Responsibilities and Worker Rights|website=www.osha.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==== Emergency action plan (EAP) ====\nA written document about what actions employers and employees should take when responding to an emergency situation. According to OSHA regulations 1910.38,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9726&p_table=standards|title=Emergency action plans. \u2013 1910.38 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> an employer must have an emergency action plan whenever an [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standard in this part requires one. To develop an emergency action plan, an employer should start from workplace evaluation. Typically, most of the occupational emergency management can be divided into worksite evaluation, exposure monitoring, hazard control, work practices, and training.\n\n'''Worksite evaluation''' is about identifying the source and location of the potential hazards such as [[Falling (accident)|fall]], [[noise]], [[cold]], [[heat]], [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], infectious materials, and toxic chemicals that each of the workers may encounter during emergency situations.\n\n===== Exposure monitoring =====\nAfter identifying the source and location of the hazard(s), it is essential to monitor how employees may be exposed to these dangers. Employers should conduct task-specific exposure monitoring when they meet following requirements:\n* When the exposed substance has specific standard required by OSHA\n* When employers anticipate workers will be exposed to more hazards than the action level set by OSHA\n* When there is a worker complaint or concern about the exposure\n* When an employee questions the effectiveness of the existing hazard control methods\nTo effectively acquire the above information, an employer can ask workers how they perform the task or use direct reading instruments to identify the exposure level and exposure route.\n\n===== Hazard control =====\nEmployers can conduct hazard control by:\n* Elimination or substitution: Eliminating the hazard from the workplace.\n* [[Engineering controls]]\n* Work practice or administrative controls: Change the how the task was performed to reduce the probability of exposure.\n* [[Personal protective equipment]]\n\n===== Training =====\nEmployers should train their employees annually before an emergency action plan is implemented. [https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081027/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9726&p_text_version=FALSE#1910.38(f)(1) <nowiki>[29 CFR 1910.38(e)]</nowiki>] The purpose of training is to inform employees of their responsibilities and/or plan of action during emergency situations. The training program should include the types of emergencies that may occur, the appropriate response, evacuation procedure, warning/reporting procedure, and shutdown procedures. Training requirements are different depending on the size of workplace and workforce, processes used, materials handled, available resources and who will be in charge during an emergency.\n\nThe training program should address the following information:\n* Workers' roles and responsibilities.\n* Potential hazards and hazard-preventing actions.\n* Notification alarm system, and communications process<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&p_id=18960|title=08/07/1981 \u2013 Fire detection and employee alarm systems. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n* Communication means between family members in an emergency.\n* [[First aid kit (disambiguation)|First Aid Kit]]\n* Emergency response procedures.\n* Evacuation procedures.\n* A list of emergency equipment including its location and function.\n* Emergency shutdown procedures.\nAfter the emergency action plan is completed, employer and employees should review the plan carefully and post it in a public area that is accessible to everyone. In addition, another responsibility of the employer is to keep a record of any injury or illness of workers according to OSHA/State Plan Record-keeping regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p_id=12783|title=Reporting fatalities, hospitalizations, amputations, and losses of an eye as a result of work-related incidents to OSHA. \u2013 1904.39 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Implementation ideals==\n{{Unreferenced section|date= March 2014}}\n\n===Pre-incident training and testing===\n[[File:Emergency Responders (8743399305).jpg|thumb|right|A team of emergency responders performs a training scenario involving [[anthrax]].]]\nEmergency management plans and procedures should include the identification of appropriately trained staff members responsible for decision-making when an emergency occurs. Training plans should include internal people, contractors and civil protection partners, and should state the nature and frequency of training and testing.\n\nTesting of a plan's effectiveness should occur regularly. In instances where several business or organisations occupy the same space, joint emergency plans, formally agreed to by all parties, should be put into place.\n\nDrills and exercises in preparation for foreseeable hazards are often held, with the participation of the services that will be involved in handling the emergency, and people who will be affected. Drills are held to prepare for the hazards of [[Fire drill|fires]], [[Tornado drill|tornadoes]], [[lockdown]] for protection, [[earthquake]]s, etc.\n\n===Communicating and incident assessment===\nCommunication is one of the key issues during any emergency, pre-planning of communications is critical. Miscommunication can easily result in emergency events escalating unnecessarily.\n\nOnce an emergency has been identified a comprehensive assessment evaluating the level of impact and its financial implications should be undertaken. Following assessment, the appropriate plan or response to be activated will depend on a specific pre-set criteria within the emergency plan. The steps necessary should be prioritized to ensure critical functions are operational as soon as possible. The critical functions are those that makes the plan untenable if not operationalized.\n\nThe communication policy must be well known and rehearsed, and all targeted audiences must be alert. All [[Emergency communication system|communication infrastructure]] must be as prepared as possible, with all information on groupings clearly identified.\n\n==Phases and personal activities==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\nEmergency management consists of five phases: prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. [http://www.fema.gov/mission-areas Mission Areas | FEMA.gov]\n\n===Prevention===\n{{See also|Pandemic prevention}}\nIt focuses on preventing the human hazard, primarily from potential natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Preventive measures are taken on both the domestic and international levels, designed to provide permanent protection from disasters. Also by doing this the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans, environmental planning and design standards. In January 2005, 167 Governments adopted a 10-year global plan for natural disaster risk reduction called the [[World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction|Hyogo Framework]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nPreventing or reducing the impacts of disasters on our communities is a key focus for emergency management efforts today. Prevention and mitigation also help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery. Public Safety Canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and stakeholders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-based and all-hazards approach. In 2009, Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers endorsed a National Disaster Mitigation Strategy.\n\n===Mitigation strategy===\nDisaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs.\n\nPreventive or mitigation measures take different forms for different types of disasters. In earthquake prone areas, these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an [[earthquake valve]] to instantly shut off the natural gas supply, [[seismic retrofit]]s of property, and the securing of items inside a building. The latter may include the mounting of furniture, [[refrigerator]]s, [[water heating|water heaters]] and breakables to the walls, and the addition of cabinet latches. In flood prone areas, houses can be built on poles/stilts. In areas prone to prolonged electricity [[power blackout|black-outs]] installation of a [[electrical generator|generator]] ensures continuation of electrical service. The construction of [[storm cellar]]s and [[fallout shelter]]s are further examples of personal mitigative actions.\n\nOn a national level, governments might implement large scale mitigation measures. After the monsoon floods of 2010, the Punjab government subsequently constructed 22 'disaster-resilient' model villages, comprising 1885 single-storey homes, together with schools and health centres.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/news-pakistans-punjab-builds-model-villages-to-withstand-disasters/?loclang=en_gb ''NEWS: Pakistan's Punjab builds model villages to withstand disasters''], [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 17 December 2013.</ref>\n\nOne of the best known examples of investment in disaster mitigation is the Red River Floodway. The building of the Floodway was a joint provincial/federal undertaking to protect the City of Winnipeg and reduce the impact of flooding in the Red River Basin. It cost $62.7 million to build in the 1960s. Since then, the floodway has been used over 20 times. Its use during the 1997 Red River Flood alone saved an estimated $4.5 billion in costs from potential damage to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|title=Flood Mitigation Efforts in the Red River Basin|last=Simonovic|first=Slobodan|website=www.iclr.org|publisher=The Institute of Catastrophic Loss Reduction|access-date=20 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023195652/https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Floodway was expanded in 2006 as a joint provincial/federal initiative.\n\n===Preparedness===\n[[File:Panther 8x8 action 15x10.jpg|thumb|An airport emergency preparedness exercise]]\nPreparedness focuses on preparing equipment and procedures for use when a [[disaster]] occurs.

Nonetheless, there is basic guidance for preparedness that is common despite an area's specific dangers. FEMA recommends that everyone have a three-day survival kit for their household.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/areyouready/basic_preparedness.pdf |title=Basic Preparedness |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> Because individual household sizes and specific needs might vary, FEMA's recommendations are not item specific, but the list includes:\n* Three-day supply of non-perishable food.\n* Three-day supply of water \u2013 one gallon of water per person, per day.\n* Portable, battery-powered radio or television and extra batteries.\n* Flashlight and extra batteries.\n* First aid kit and manual.\n* [[Sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] items (e.g. [[toilet paper]], [[Feminine hygiene|menstrual hygiene products]]).\n* Matches and waterproof container.\n* Whistle.\n* Extra clothing.\n* Kitchen accessories and cooking utensils, including a can opener.\n* Photocopies of credit and identification cards.\n* Cash and coins.\n* Special needs items, such as prescription medications, eyeglasses, contact lens solutions, and hearing aid batteries.\n* Items for infants, such as formula, diapers, bottles, and pacifiers.\n* Other items to meet unique family needs.\n\nAlong similar lines, but not exactly the same, CDC has its own list for a proper disaster supply kit.<ref name=\"emergency.cdc.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://emergency.cdc.gov/preparedness/kit/disasters/ |title=CDC Emergency preparedness and You &#124; Gather Emergency Supplies &#124; Disaster Supplies Kit |publisher=Emergency.cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317033851/http://emergency.cdc.gov/preparedness/kit/disasters/ |archive-date=2015-03-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Water\u2014one gallon per person, per day\n* Food\u2014nonperishable, easy-to-prepare items\n* Flashlight\n* Battery powered or hand crank radio (NOAA Weather Radio, if possible)\n* Extra batteries\n* First aid kit\n* Medications (7-day supply), other medical supplies, and medical paperwork (e.g., medication list and pertinent medical information)\n* Multipurpose tool (e.g., Swiss army knife)\n* Sanitation and personal hygiene items\n* Copies of personal documents (e.g., proof of address, deed/lease to home, passports, birth certificates, and insurance policies)\n* Cell phone with chargers\n* Family and emergency contact information\n* Extra cash\n* Emergency blanket\n* Map(s) of the area\n* Extra set of car keys and house keys\n* Manual can opener\n\nChildren are a special population when considering Emergency preparedness and many resources are directly focused on supporting them. SAMHSA has list of tips for talking to children during infectious disease outbreaks, to include being a good listener, encouraging children to ask questions and modeling self-care by setting routines, eating healthy meals, getting enough sleep and taking deep breaths to handle stress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content/SMA14-4886/SMA14-4886.pdf |title=Talking With Children |publisher=Store.samhsa.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150322063301/http://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA14-4886/SMA14-4886.pdf |archive-date=2015-03-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> FEMA has similar advice, noting that \"Disasters can leave children feeling frightened, confused, and insecure\" whether a child has experienced it first hand, had it happen to a friend or simply saw it on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/coping-disaster#4 |title=Coping with Disaster |publisher=FEMA.gov |date=2015-01-31 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> In the same publication, FEMA further notes, \"Preparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters do happen, and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources needed to meet basic needs after disaster. Preparation helps; when people feel prepared, they cope better and so do children.\"\n\nTo help people assess what threats might be in order to augment their emergency supplies or improve their disaster response skills, FEMA has published a booklet called the \"Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Guide.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/8ca0a9e54dc8b037a55b402b2a269e94/CPG201_htirag_2nd_edition.pdf |title=Threat and Hazrd Identification and Risk Assessment Guide |date=August 2013 |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> (THIRA) This guide, which outlines the THIRA process, emphasizes \"whole community involvement,\" not just governmental agencies, in preparedness efforts. In this guide, FEMA breaks down hazards into three categories: Natural, technological and human caused and notes that each hazard should be assessed for both its likelihood and its significance. According to FEMA, \"Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that could plausibly occur\" and \"Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that would have a significant effect on them.\" To develop threat and hazard context descriptions, communities should take into account the time, place, and conditions in which threats or hazards might occur.\n\nNot all preparedness efforts and discussions involve the government or established NGOs like the Red Cross. Emergency preparation discussions are active on the internet, with many blogs and websites dedicated to discussing various aspects of preparedness. On-line sales of items such as survival food, medical supplies and heirloom seeds allow people to stock basements with cases of food and drinks with 25 year shelf lives, sophisticated medical kits and seeds that are guaranteed to sprout even after years of storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mypatriotsupply.com/ |title=My Patriot Supply : Homepage |publisher=Mypatriotsupply.com |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref>\n\nOne group of people who put a lot of effort in disaster preparations is called [[Doomsday Preppers]]. This subset of preparedness-minded people often share a belief that the FEMA or Red Cross emergency preparation suggestions and training are not extensive enough. Sometimes called [[survivalists]], Doomsday Preppers are often preparing for The End Of The World As We Know It, abbreviated as TEOTWAWKI. With a motto some have that \"The Future Belongs to those who Prepare,\" this Preparedness subset has its own set of Murphy's Rules,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://survivalcache.com/murphys-laws-of-teotwawki/ |title=Murphy's Laws of TEOTWAWKI |publisher=Survivalcache.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> including \"Rule Number 1: Food, you still don't have enough\" and \"Rule Number 26: People who thought the Government would save them, found out that it didn't.\"\n\nNot all emergency preparation efforts revolve around food, guns and shelters, though these items help address the needs in the bottom two sections of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]. The American Preppers Network<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanpreppersnetwork.com/|title=American Preppers Network \u2013 National family survival and preparedness organization|work=American Preppers Network|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> has an extensive list of items that might be useful in less apparent ways than a first aid kid or help add 'fun' to challenging times. These items include:\n* Books and magazines\n* Arts and crafts [[painting]]\n* Children's entertainment\n* Crayons and coloring books\n* Notebooks and writing supplies\n* Nuts, bolts, screws, nails, etc.\n* Religious material\n* Sporting equipment, card games and board games\n* Posters and banners creating awareness\n\nEmergency preparedness goes beyond immediate family members. For many people, pets are an integral part of their families and emergency preparation advice includes them as well. It is not unknown for pet owners to die while trying to rescue their pets from a fire or from drowning.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20140308/man-dies-trying-to-rescue-pets-from-fire |title=Man dies trying to rescue pets from fire |publisher=Pottsmerc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> CDC's Disaster Supply Checklist for Pets includes:<ref name=\"emergency.cdc.gov\"/>\n* Food and water for at least 3 days for each pet; bowls, and a manual can opener.\n* Depending on the pet you may need a litter box, paper towels, plastic trash bags, grooming items, and/or household bleach.\n* Medications and medical records stored in a waterproof container.\n* First aid kit with a pet first aid book.\n* Sturdy leash, harness, and carrier to transport pet safely. A carrier should be large enough for the animal to stand comfortably, turn around, and lie down. Your pet may have to stay in the carrier for several hours.\n* Pet toys and the pet's bed, if you can easily take it, to reduce stress.\n* Current photos and descriptions of your pets to help others identify them in case you and your pets become separated, and to prove that they are yours.\n* Information on feeding schedules, medical conditions, behavior problems, and the name and telephone number of your veterinarian in case you have to board your pets or place them in foster care.\n\nEmergency preparedness also includes more than physical items and skill-specific training. Psychological preparedness is also a type of emergency preparedness and specific mental health preparedness resources are offered for mental health professionals by organizations such as the Red Cross.<ref name=\"akamai1\"/> These mental health preparedness resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them. CDC has a website devoted to coping with a disaster or traumatic event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.samhsa.gov/MentalHealth/TraumaticEvent.aspx?from=carousel&position=1&date=3112011 |title=Coping with Traumatic Events, SAMHSA.gov |publisher=Media.samhsa.gov |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> After such an event, the CDC, through the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), suggests that people seek psychological help when they exhibit symptoms such as excessive worry, crying frequently, an increase in irritability, anger, and frequent arguing, wanting to be alone most of the time, feeling anxious or fearful, overwhelmed by sadness, confused, having trouble thinking clearly and concentrating, and difficulty making decisions, increased alcohol and/or substance use, increased physical (aches, pains) complaints such as headaches and trouble with \"nerves.\"\n\nSometimes emergency supplies are kept in what is called a [[Bug-out bag]]. While FEMA does not actually use the term \"Bug out bag,\" calling it instead some variation of a \"Go Kit,\" the idea of having emergency items in a quickly accessible place is common to both FEMA and CDC, though on-line discussions of what items a \"bug out bag\" should include sometimes cover items such as firearms and great knives that are not specifically suggested by FEMA or CDC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theprepperproject.com/bug-out-bag-checklist/ |title=Bug Out Bag Checklist |publisher=Theprepperproject.com |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> The theory behind a \"bug out bag\" is that emergency preparations should include the possibility of [[Emergency evacuation]]. Whether fleeing a burning building or hastily packing a car to escape an impending hurricane, flood or dangerous chemical release, rapid departure from a home or workplace environment is always a possibility and FEMA suggests having a Family Emergency Plan for such occasions.<ref name=\"ready.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan |title=Make A Plan |publisher=Ready.gov |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> Because family members may not be together when disaster strikes, this plan should include reliable contact information for friends or relatives who live outside of what would be the disaster area for household members to notify they are safe or otherwise communicate with each other. Along with the contact information, FEMA suggests having well-understood local gathering points if a house must be evacuated quickly to avoid the dangers of re-reentering a burning home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |title=Escape From Fire! |publisher=Usfa.fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210211816/https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-10 }}</ref> Family and emergency contact information should be printed on cards and put in each family member's backpack or wallet. If family members spend a significant amount of time in a specific location, such as at work or school, FEMA suggests learning the emergency preparation plans for those places.<ref name=\"ready.gov\"/> FEMA has a specific form, in English and in Spanish, to help people put together these emergency plans, though it lacks lines for email contact information.<ref name=\"ready.gov\"/>\n\nLike children, people with disabilities and other special needs have special emergency preparation needs.

This assistance may be provided by national or international agencies and organizations. Effective coordination of disaster assistance is often crucial, particularly when many organizations respond and local emergency management agency (LEMA) capacity has been exceeded by the demand or diminished by the disaster itself. The [[National Response Framework]] is a United States government publication that explains responsibilities and expectations of government officials at the local, state, federal, and tribal levels. It provides guidance on Emergency Support Functions that may be integrated in whole or parts to aid in the response and recovery process.\n\nOn a personal level the response can take the shape either of a ''[[shelter in place]]'' or an ''[[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]]''. [[File:Evacuation sign.jpg|thumb|Evacuation sign]]In a shelter-in-place scenario, a family would be prepared to fend for themselves in their home for many days without any form of outside support. In an ''evacuation'', a family leaves the area by [[automobile]] or other mode of [[transportation]], taking with them the maximum amount of supplies they can carry, possibly including a tent for shelter. If mechanical transportation is not available, evacuation on foot would ideally include carrying at least three days of supplies and rain-tight bedding, a [[tarpaulin]] and a bedroll of blankets.\n\n[[Donation]]s are often sought during this period, especially for large disasters that overwhelm local capacity. Due to efficiencies of scale, [[money]] is often the most cost-effective donation if fraud is avoided. Money is also the most flexible, and if goods are sourced locally then transportation is minimized and the local economy is boosted. Some donors prefer to send [[gifts in kind]], however these items can end up creating issues, rather than helping. One innovation by [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers is to use a donation registry, where families and businesses impacted by the disaster can make specific requests, which remote donors can purchase directly via a web site.\n\nMedical considerations will vary greatly based on the type of disaster and secondary effects. Survivors may sustain a multitude of injuries to include [[lacerations]], [[burn]]s, [[near drowning]], or [[crush syndrome]].\n\n===Recovery===\nThe recovery phase starts after the immediate threat to human life has subsided. The immediate goal of the recovery phase is to bring the affected area back to normalcy as quickly as possible. During reconstruction it is recommended to consider the location or construction material of the property.\n\nThe most extreme home confinement scenarios include war, [[famine]] and severe [[epidemic]]s and may last a year or more. Then recovery will take place inside the home. Planners for these events usually buy [[bulk purchasing|bulk]] foods and appropriate storage and preparation equipment, and eat the food as part of normal life. A simple balanced diet can be constructed from [[vitamin]] pills, [[whole-meal]] wheat, beans, [[dried milk]], corn, and [[cooking oil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/ |title=Federal Emergency Management Agency |publisher=FEMA.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref> Vegetables, fruits, spices and meats, both prepared and fresh-gardened, are included when possible.\n\n==As a profession==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\nProfessional emergency managers can focus on government and community preparedness, or private business preparedness. Training is provided by local, state, federal and private organizations and ranges from public information and media relations to high-level incident command and tactical skills.\n\nIn the past, the field of emergency management has been populated mostly by people with a military or first responder background. Currently, the field has become more diverse, with many managers coming from a variety of backgrounds other than the military or first responder fields. Educational opportunities are increasing for those seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees in emergency management or a related field. There are over 180 schools in the US with emergency management-related programs, but only one doctoral program specifically in emergency management.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Jaffin\n |first=Bob\n |date=September 17, 2008\n |url=http://www.emergencymgmt.com/training/Emergency-Management-Training-How.html\n |title=Emergency Management Training: How to Find the Right Program\n |publisher=Emergency Management Magazine\n |accessdate=2008-11-15\n}}</ref>\n\nProfessional certifications such as Certified Emergency Manager (CEM)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/certification/generalinfo/intro.htm |title=Certification-General CEM certification Info |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> and Certified Business Continuity Professional (CBCP)<ref name=\"drii.org\">Disaster Recovery Institute International. https://drii.org/</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Best Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Certifications |publisher=Tom's IT Pro |url=http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/business-continuity-disaster-recovery-certifications,2-766-4.html}}</ref> are becoming more common as professional standards are raised throughout the field, particularly in the United States. There are also professional organizations for emergency managers, such as the National Emergency Management Association and the International Association of Emergency Managers.\n\n===Principles===\nIn 2007, Dr. Wayne Blanchard of FEMA's Emergency Management Higher Education Project, at the direction of Dr. Cortez Lawrence, Superintendent of FEMA's Emergency Management Institute, convened a working group of emergency management practitioners and academics to consider principles of emergency management. This was the first time the principles of the discipline were to be codified. The group agreed on eight principles that will be used to guide the development of a doctrine of emergency management. Below is a summary:\n\n# Comprehensive \u2013 consider and take into account all hazards, all phases, all stakeholders and all impacts relevant to disasters.\n# Progressive \u2013 anticipate future disasters and take preventive and preparatory measures to build disaster-resistant and disaster-resilient communities.\n# Risk-driven \u2013 use sound risk management principles (hazard identification, risk analysis, and impact analysis) in assigning priorities and resources.\n# Integrated \u2013 ensure [[unity of effort]] among all levels of government and all elements of a community.\n# Collaborative \u2013 create and sustain broad and sincere relationships among individuals and organizations to encourage trust, advocate a team atmosphere, build consensus, and facilitate communication.\n# Coordinated \u2013 synchronize the activities of all relevant stakeholders to achieve a common purpose.\n# Flexible \u2013 use creative and innovative approaches in solving disaster challenges.\n# Professional \u2013 value a science and knowledge-based approach; based on education, training, experience, ethical practice, public stewardship and continuous improvement.\n\nA fuller description of these principles can be found at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/emgt/PrinciplesofEmergencyManagement.pdf |title=Principles of Emergency Management Supplement |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Tools===\nIn recent years the continuity feature of emergency management has resulted in a new concept, [[emergency management information system]]s (EMIS). For continuity and inter-operability between emergency management stakeholders, EMIS supports an infrastructure that integrates emergency plans at all levels of government and non-government involvement for all four phases of emergencies. In the healthcare field, hospitals utilize the [[Hospital Incident Command System]] (HICS), which provides structure and organization in a clearly defined chain of command.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Within other professions==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\n[[File:Rockefeller University Disaster Plan.jpg|thumb|A disaster plan book at [[Rockefeller University]] in a biochemistry research laboratory.]]\nPractitioners in emergency management come from an increasing variety of backgrounds. Professionals from [[memory institution]]s (e.g., museums, historical societies, etc.) are dedicated to preserving cultural heritage\u2014objects and records. This has been an increasingly major component within this field as a result of the heightened awareness following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|hurricanes in 2005]], and the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne|collapse of the Cologne Archives]].\n\nTo increase the potential successful recovery of valuable records, a well-established and thoroughly tested plan must be developed. This plan should emphasize simplicity in order to aid in response and recovery: employees should perform similar tasks in the response and recovery phase that they perform under normal conditions. It should also include mitigation strategies such as the installation of sprinklers within the institution.<ref>Buchanan, Sally. \"Emergency preparedness.\" from Paul Banks and Roberta Pilette.

Called Population Explorer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.populationexplorer.com/ |title=FEWS Network&nbsp;\u2014 USAID |publisher=Population Explorer |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> the tool uses land scan population data, developed by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], to distribute population at a resolution 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for all countries in the world. Used by USAID's [[Famine Early Warning System Network|FEWS NET]] Project to estimate populations vulnerable to, or impacted by, food insecurity. Population Explorer is gaining wide use in a range of emergency analysis and response actions, including estimating populations impacted by floods in Central America and the Pacific Ocean tsunami event in 2009.\n\nIn 2007, a checklist for veterinarians was published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, it had two sets of questions for a professional to ask themselves before assisting with an emergency:\n\n'''Absolute requirements for participation:'''\n* Have I chosen to participate?\n* Have I taken ICS training?\n* Have I taken other required background courses?\n* Have I made arrangements with my practice to deploy?\n* Have I made arrangements with my family?\n\n'''Incident participation:'''\n* Have I been invited to participate?\n* Are my skill sets a match for the mission?\n* Can I access just-in-time training to refresh skills or acquire needed new skills?\n* Is this a self-support mission?\n* Do I have supplies needed for three to five days of self-support?\n\nWhile written for veterinarians, this checklist is applicable for any professional to consider before assisting with an emergency.<ref>The Veterinary profession's duty of care in response to disasters and food animal emergencies.

TIEMS is a Global Forum for Education, Training, Certification and Policy in Emergency and Disaster Management. TIEMS' goal is to develop and bring modern emergency management tools, and techniques into practice, through the exchange of information, methodology innovations and new technologies.\n\nTIEMS provides a platform for stakeholders to meet, network and learn about new technical and operational methodologies. TIEMS focuses on cultural differences to be understood and included in the society's events, education and research programs. This is achieved by establishing local chapters worldwide. Today, TIEMS has chapters in Benelux, Romania, Finland, Italy, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Iraq, India, Korea, Japan and China.\n\n===International Association of Emergency Managers===\nThe [[International Association of Emergency Managers]] (IAEM) is a non-profit educational organization aimed at promoting the goals of saving lives and property protection during emergencies.

The country is divided into 25 safety regions ([[w:nl:veiligheidsregio|veiligheidsregio]]). In a safety region, there are four components: the regional fire department, the regional department for medical care (ambulances and psycho-sociological care etc.), the regional dispatch and a section for risk- and crisis management. The regional dispatch operates for police, fire department and the regional medical care. The dispatch has all these three services combined into one dispatch for the best multi-coordinated response to an incident or an emergency. And also facilitates in information management, emergency communication and care of citizens. These services are the main structure for a response to an emergency. It can happen that, for a specific emergency, the co-operation with another service is needed, for instance the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministry of Defence]], [[water board]](s) or [[Rijkswaterstaat]]. The veiligheidsregio can integrate these other services into their structure by adding them to specific conferences on operational or administrative level.\n\nAll regions operate according to the [[Coordinated Regional Incident Management (Netherlands)|Coordinated Regional Incident Management]] system.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nFollowing the 2000 [[UK fuel protests|fuel protests]] and severe flooding that same year, as well as the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|foot-and-mouth]] crisis in 2001, the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] (CCA). The CCA defined some organisations as Category 1 and 2 Responders, setting responsibilities regarding emergency preparedness and response. It is managed by the [[Civil Contingencies Secretariat]] through Regional Resilience Forums and local authorities.\n\nDisaster Management training is generally conducted at the local level, and consolidated through professional courses that can be taken at the [[Emergency Planning College]]. Diplomas, undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications can be gained at universities throughout the country. The Institute of Emergency Management is a charity, established in 1996, providing consulting services for the government, media and commercial sectors.

Processes are then mapped to specific hazards or threats, with the manager looking for gaps, overlaps, and conflicts between processes.\n\nGiven these notions, emergency managers must identify, contemplate, and assess possible man-made threats and natural threats that may affect their respective locales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McElreath|first1=David|last2=Doss|first2=Daniel|last3=Jensen|first3=Carl|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|last5=Nations|first5=Robert|last6=Van Slyke|first6=Jeffrey|last7=Nations|first7=Julie|title=Foundations of Emergency Management|date=2014|publisher=Kendall-Hunt Publishing Company|location=Dubuque, IA|isbn=978-1465234889|page=25|edition=1st}}<!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--></ref> Because of geographical differences throughout the nation, a variety of different threats affect communities among the states.

This type of planning can lead to conflict with non-emergency management regulatory bodies, which require the development of hazard/threat specific plans, such as the development of specific H1N1 flu plans and terrorism-specific plans.\n\nIn the United States, all disasters are initially local, with local authorities, with usually a police, fire, or EMS agency, taking charge. Many local municipalities may also have a separate dedicated [[office of emergency management]] (OEM), along with personnel and equipment. If the event becomes overwhelming to the local government, state emergency management (the primary government structure of the United States) becomes the controlling emergency management agency. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), is the lead federal agency for emergency management. The United States and its territories are broken down into ten regions for FEMA's emergency management purposes. FEMA supports, but does not override, state authority.\n\nThe [[Citizen Corps]] is an organization of volunteer service programs, administered locally and coordinated nationally by DHS, which seek to mitigate disasters and prepare the population for emergency response through public education, training, and outreach. Most [[disaster response]] is carried out by volunteer organizations. In the US, the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] is chartered by Congress to coordinate disaster response services. It is typically the lead agency handling shelter and feeding of evacuees. Religious organizations, with their ability to provide volunteers quickly, are usually integral during the response process.

The aim is to reduce the harmful effects of all hazards, including [[disaster]]s.\n\nThe [[World Health Organization]] defines an emergency as the state in which normal procedures are interrupted, and immediate measures need to be taken to prevent that state turning into a disaster. Thus, emergency management is crucial to avoid the disruption transforming into a disaster, which is even harder to recover from. Emergency management is a related term but should not be equated to disaster management.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Emergency planning ideals==\nEmergency planning, a discipline of [[urban planning]] and [[urban design|design]], first aims to prevent emergencies from occurring, and failing that, should develop a good action plan to mitigate the results and effects of any emergencies. As time goes on, and more data become available, usually through the study of emergencies as they occur, a plan should evolve. The development of emergency plans is a cyclical process, common to many risk management disciplines, such as business continuity and security risk management, as set out below:\n* Recognition or identification of risks<ref>Zhou, Q., Huang, W., & Zhang, Y.

There are very few emergency management specific standards, and emergency management as a discipline tends to fall under business resilience standards.\n\nIn order to avoid or reduce significant losses to a business, emergency managers should work to identify and anticipate potential risks. In the event that an emergency does occur, managers should have a plan prepared to mitigate the effects of that emergency, as well as to ensure business continuity of critical operations after the incident. It is essential for an organization to include procedures for determining whether an emergency situation has occurred and at what point an emergency management plan should be activated. An emergency plan must be regularly maintained, in a structured and methodical manner, to ensure it is up-to-date in the event of an emergency. Emergency managers generally follow a common process to anticipate, assess, prevent, prepare, respond and recover from an incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/emergency|title=Emergency Response Plan - Ready.gov|website=www.ready.gov}}</ref>\n\n== Health and safety of workers ==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{importance section|date=April 2020}}\n{{duplication|date=April 2020}}\n}}\nCleanup during disaster recovery involves many [[occupational hazard]]s.

After a natural disaster, certain chemicals can be more prominent in the environment. These hazardous materials can be released directly or indirectly. Chemical hazards directly released after a natural disaster often occur concurrent with the event so little to no mitigation actions can take place for mitigation. For example, airborne magnesium, chloride, phosphorus, and ammonia can be generated by droughts. Dioxins can be produced by forest fires, and silica can be emitted by forest fires. Indirect release of hazardous chemicals can be intentionally released or unintentionally released. An example of intentional release is insecticides used after a flood or chlorine treatment of water after a flood. Unintentional release is when a hazardous chemical is not intentionally released. The chemical released is often toxic and serves beneficial purpose when released to the environment. These chemicals can be controlled through engineering to minimize their release when a natural disaster strikes. An example of this is agrochemicals from inundated storehouses or manufacturing facilities poisoning the floodwaters or asbestos fibers released from a building collapse during a hurricane.<ref name=\"Young 3\u201320\">{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Stacy|last2=Balluz|first2=Lina|last3=Malilay|first3=Josephine|date=2004-04-25|title=Natural and technologic hazardous material releases during and after natural disasters: a review|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1089&context=publichealthresources|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=322|issue=1|pages=3\u201320|doi=10.1016/S0048-9697(03)00446-7|pmid=15081734|bibcode=2004ScTEn.322....3Y}}</ref> The flowchart to the right has been adopted from research performed by Stacy Young, et al., and can be found here.<ref name=\"Young 3\u201320\"/>\n\n'''Exposure limits'''\n[[File:Hazardous Chemical Release Flowchart.jpg|thumb|Classification of hazardous material releases associated with natural disasters]]\nBelow are TLV-TWA, PEL, and IDLH values for common chemicals workers are exposed to after a natural disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/annotated-pels/|title=OSHA Annotated PELs {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/pgintrod.html|title=CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards (NPG) Introduction|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Chemical'''\n|'''TLV-TWA (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|'''PEL (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|'''IDLH (mg/m<sup>3</sup>)'''\n|-\n|'''Magnesium'''\n|10\n|15\n|750\n|-\n|'''Phosphorus'''\n|0.1\n|0.1\n|Not established\n|-\n|'''Ammonia'''\n|17\n|35\n|27\n|-\n|'''Silica(R)'''\n|.025\n|10\n|50\n|-\n|'''Chlorine dioxide'''\n|0.28\n|0.3\n|29\n|-\n|'''Asbestos'''\n|10 (fibers/m^3)\n|10 (fibers/m^3)\n|Not established\n|}\n\n'''Direct release'''\n* Magnesium\n* Phosphorus\n* Ammonia\n* Silica\n\n'''Intentional release'''\n* Insecticides\n* Chlorine dioxide\n\n'''Unintentional release'''\n* Crude oil components\n* Benzene, N-hexane, hydrogen sulfide, cumene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, toluene, xylenes, PCBs, agrochemicals\n* Asbestos\n\n'''Exposure routes'''\n\nWhen a toxicant is prominent in an environment after a natural disaster, it is important to determine the route of exposure to worker safety for the disaster management workers. The three components are source of exposure, pathway of the chemical, and receptor. Questions to ask when dealing with chemical source is the material itself, how it's used, how much is used, how often the chemical is used, temperature, vapor pressure, physical processes. The physical state of the chemical is important to identify. If working indoors, room ventilation, and volume of room needs to be noted to help mitigate health defects from the chemical. Lastly, to ensure worker safety, routes of entry for the chemical should be determined as well as relevant personal protective equipment needs to be worn.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Exposure Science in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy|last=Council|first=National Research|date=2012-09-07|isbn=9780309264686|language=en|doi=10.17226/13507|pmid = 24901193}}</ref>\n\n'''Respirators'''\n\nAccording to the CDC, \u201cIf you need to collect belongings or do basic clean up in your previously flooded home, you do not usually need to use a respirator (a mask worn to prevent breathing in harmful substances).\u201d A respirator should be worn when performing an operation in an enclosed environment such as a house that creates ample amounts of dust. These activities could include sweeping dust, using power saws and equipment, or cleaning up mold. If you encounter dust, the CDC says to \u201climit your contact with the dust as much as possible. Use wet mops or vacuums with HEPA filters instead of dry sweeping and lastly wear a respirator that protects against dust in the air. A respirator that is approved by the CDC/NIOSH is the [[N95 respirator]] and can be a good personal protective equipment to protect from dust and mold in the air from the associated natural disaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/respiratory.html|title=Respiratory Protection for Residents Reentering Previously Flooded Areas{{!}}Health and Safety Concerns|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Biological exposures ===\n\n'''Mold exposures''': Exposure to [[mold]] is commonly seen after a natural disaster such as flooding, hurricane, tornado or tsunami. Mold growth can occur on both the exterior and interior of residential or commercial buildings. Warm and humid condition encourages mold growth; therefore, standing water and excess moisture after a natural disaster would provide an ideal environment for mold growth especially in tropical regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/mold/|title=Mold \u2013 Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|date=8 December 2017|website=www.cdc.gov}}</ref> While the exact number of mold species is unknown, some examples of commonly found indoor molds are [[Aspergillus]], [[Cladosporium]], [[Alternaria]] and [[Penicillium]]. Reaction to molds differ between individuals and can range from mild symptoms such as eye irritation, cough to severe life-threatening asthmatic or allergic reactions. People with history of [[chronic lung disease (disambiguation)|chronic lung disease]], asthma, allergy, other breathing problems or those that are [[immunocompromised]] could be more sensitive to molds and may develop [[fungal pneumonia]].\n\nThe most effective approach to control mold growth after a natural disaster is to control moisture level. Some ways to prevent mold growth after a natural disaster include opening all doors and windows, using fans to dry out the building, positioning fans to blow air out of the windows and cleaning up the building within the first 24\u201348 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/mold/ten-things-you-should-know-about-mold|title=Ten Things You Should Know about Mold \u2013 US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OAR,ORIA,IED|website=US EPA|date=2014-10-22}}</ref> All wet items that cannot be properly cleaned and dried within the first 48 hours should be promptly removed and discarded from the building. If mold growth is found in the building, it is important to concurrently remove the molds and fix the underlying moisture problem. When removing molds, N-95 masks or respirators with a higher protection level should be used to prevent inhalation of molds into the respiratory system.<ref>https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/moldguide12.pdf</ref> Molds can be removed from hard surfaces by soap and water, a diluted bleach solution<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/psa/moldremoval.html|title=Mold Removal After a Disaster-PSAs for Disasters|website=www.cdc.gov|date=2019-02-28}}</ref> or commercial products.\n\n'''Human remains''': According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]], \"There is no direct risk of contagion or infectious disease from being near human remains for people who are not directly involved in recovery or other efforts that require handling dead bodies.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/handleremains.html|title=Handling Human Remains After a Disaster{{!}}Natural Disasters and Severe Weather|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> Most viruses and bacteria perish along with the human body after death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/ems/flood_cds/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Flooding and communicable diseases fact sheet|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> Therefore, no excessive measures are necessary when handling human remains indirectly. However, for workers in direct contact with human remains, [[universal precautions]] should be exercised in order to prevent unnecessary exposure to blood-borne viruses and bacteria. Relevant [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] includes eye protection, face mask or shield, and gloves. The predominant health risk are gastrointestinal infections through [[Fecal\u2013oral route|fecal-oral]] contamination, so [[Hand washing|hand hygiene]] is paramount to prevention. Mental health support should also be available to workers who endure [[psychological stress]] during and after recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|title=American Psychological Association_Disasters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229124918/http://www.apa.org/topics/disasters/index.aspx|archive-date=2009-12-29|url-status=dead|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n'''Flood-associated skin infections''': Flood waters are often contaminated with bacteria and waste as well as chemicals on occasion. Prolonged, direct contact with these waters leads to an increased risk for skin infection, especially with open wounds in the skin or history of a previous skin condition, such as [[atopic dermatitis]] or [[psoriasis]]. These infections are exacerbated with a compromised immune system or an aging population.<ref name=\":0\" /> The most common bacterial skin infections are usually with [[Staphylococcus]] and [[Streptococcus]]. One of the most uncommon, but well-known bacterial infections is from [[Vibrio vulnificus]], which causes a rare, but often fatal infection called [[necrotizing fasciitis]].\n[[File:Necrotizing fasciitis left leg debridement.JPEG|thumb|Surgical debridement of left leg necrotizing fasciitis.]]\n\nOther salt-water Mycobacterium infections include the slow growing [[Mycobacterium marinum|M. marinum]] and fast growing [[Mycobacterium fortuitum|M. fortuitum]], [[Mycobacterium chelonae|M. chelonae]], and [[Mycobacterium abscessus|M. abscessus]]. Fresh-water bacterial infections include [[aeromonas hydrophila]], [[Burkholderia pseudomallei]] causing [[melioidosis]], [[leptospira interrogans]] causing [[leptospirosis]], and chromobacterium violaceum. Fungal infections may lead to [[chromoblastomycosis]], [[blastomycosis]], [[mucormycosis]], and [[dermatophytosis]].

According to the CDC, \"Sources of stress for emergency responders may include witnessing human suffering, risk of personal harm, intense workloads, life-and-death decisions, and separation from family.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/coping/responders.asp|title=Emergency Responders: Tips for taking care of yourself|date=2017-11-07|website=emergency.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> These stresses need to be prevented or effectively managed in order to optimize assistance without causing danger to oneself. Preparation as an emergency responder is key, in addition to establishing care for responsibilities at home. During the recovery efforts, it is critical to understand and recognize burnout and sources of stress. After the recovery, it is vital to take time away from the disaster scene and slowly re-integrate back to the normal work environment. [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)]] provides stress prevention and management resources for disaster recovery responders.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.samhsa.gov/disaster-preparedness|title=Disaster Preparedness, Response, and Recovery|last=ann.lynsen|date=2014-06-20|website=www.samhsa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Volunteer responsibilities ===\nThe [[FEMA|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] advises those who desire to assist go through organized volunteer organizations and not to self-deploy to affected locations. The [[VOAD|National Volunteer Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD)]] serves as the primary point of contact for volunteer organization coordination. All states have their own state VOAD organization. As a volunteer, since an employer does not have oversight, one must be vigilant and protect against possible physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial exposures. Furthermore, there must be defined roles with relevant training available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalservice.gov/resources/disaster-services/defining-volunteer-roles-preparation-disaster-response|title=Defining Volunteer Roles in Preparation for Disaster Response|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Proper tools and PPE may or may not be available, so safety and liability should always be considered.\n\n=== Employer responsibilities ===\nEvery employer is required to maintain a safe and healthy workplace for its employees. When an emergency situation occurs, employers are expected to protect workers from all harm resulting from any potential hazard, including physical, chemical, and biological exposure. In addition, an employer should provide pre-emergency training and build an emergency action plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hurricane/responsibilities.html|title=OSHA's Hazard Exposure and Risk Assessment Matrix for Hurricane Response and Recovery Work: Employer Responsibilities and Worker Rights|website=www.osha.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==== Emergency action plan (EAP) ====\nA written document about what actions employers and employees should take when responding to an emergency situation. According to OSHA regulations 1910.38,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9726&p_table=standards|title=Emergency action plans. \u2013 1910.38 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> an employer must have an emergency action plan whenever an [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] standard in this part requires one. To develop an emergency action plan, an employer should start from workplace evaluation. Typically, most of the occupational emergency management can be divided into worksite evaluation, exposure monitoring, hazard control, work practices, and training.\n\n'''Worksite evaluation''' is about identifying the source and location of the potential hazards such as [[Falling (accident)|fall]], [[noise]], [[cold]], [[heat]], [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], infectious materials, and toxic chemicals that each of the workers may encounter during emergency situations.\n\n===== Exposure monitoring =====\nAfter identifying the source and location of the hazard(s), it is essential to monitor how employees may be exposed to these dangers. Employers should conduct task-specific exposure monitoring when they meet following requirements:\n* When the exposed substance has specific standard required by OSHA\n* When employers anticipate workers will be exposed to more hazards than the action level set by OSHA\n* When there is a worker complaint or concern about the exposure\n* When an employee questions the effectiveness of the existing hazard control methods\nTo effectively acquire the above information, an employer can ask workers how they perform the task or use direct reading instruments to identify the exposure level and exposure route.\n\n===== Hazard control =====\nEmployers can conduct hazard control by:\n* Elimination or substitution: Eliminating the hazard from the workplace.\n* [[Engineering controls]]\n* Work practice or administrative controls: Change the how the task was performed to reduce the probability of exposure.\n* [[Personal protective equipment]]\n\n===== Training =====\nEmployers should train their employees annually before an emergency action plan is implemented. [https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081027/https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=9726&p_text_version=FALSE#1910.38(f)(1) <nowiki>[29 CFR 1910.38(e)]</nowiki>] The purpose of training is to inform employees of their responsibilities and/or plan of action during emergency situations. The training program should include the types of emergencies that may occur, the appropriate response, evacuation procedure, warning/reporting procedure, and shutdown procedures. Training requirements are different depending on the size of workplace and workforce, processes used, materials handled, available resources and who will be in charge during an emergency.\n\nThe training program should address the following information:\n* Workers' roles and responsibilities.\n* Potential hazards and hazard-preventing actions.\n* Notification alarm system, and communications process<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&p_id=18960|title=08/07/1981 \u2013 Fire detection and employee alarm systems. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n* Communication means between family members in an emergency.\n* [[First aid kit (disambiguation)|First Aid Kit]]\n* Emergency response procedures.\n* Evacuation procedures.\n* A list of emergency equipment including its location and function.\n* Emergency shutdown procedures.\nAfter the emergency action plan is completed, employer and employees should review the plan carefully and post it in a public area that is accessible to everyone. In addition, another responsibility of the employer is to keep a record of any injury or illness of workers according to OSHA/State Plan Record-keeping regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p_id=12783|title=Reporting fatalities, hospitalizations, amputations, and losses of an eye as a result of work-related incidents to OSHA. \u2013 1904.39 {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Implementation ideals==\n{{Unreferenced section|date= March 2014}}\n\n===Pre-incident training and testing===\n[[File:Emergency Responders (8743399305).jpg|thumb|right|A team of emergency responders performs a training scenario involving [[anthrax]].]]\nEmergency management plans and procedures should include the identification of appropriately trained staff members responsible for decision-making when an emergency occurs. Training plans should include internal people, contractors and civil protection partners, and should state the nature and frequency of training and testing.\n\nTesting of a plan's effectiveness should occur regularly. In instances where several business or organisations occupy the same space, joint emergency plans, formally agreed to by all parties, should be put into place.\n\nDrills and exercises in preparation for foreseeable hazards are often held, with the participation of the services that will be involved in handling the emergency, and people who will be affected. Drills are held to prepare for the hazards of [[Fire drill|fires]], [[Tornado drill|tornadoes]], [[lockdown]] for protection, [[earthquake]]s, etc.\n\n===Communicating and incident assessment===\nCommunication is one of the key issues during any emergency, pre-planning of communications is critical. Miscommunication can easily result in emergency events escalating unnecessarily.\n\nOnce an emergency has been identified a comprehensive assessment evaluating the level of impact and its financial implications should be undertaken. Following assessment, the appropriate plan or response to be activated will depend on a specific pre-set criteria within the emergency plan. The steps necessary should be prioritized to ensure critical functions are operational as soon as possible. The critical functions are those that makes the plan untenable if not operationalized.\n\nThe communication policy must be well known and rehearsed, and all targeted audiences must be alert. All [[Emergency communication system|communication infrastructure]] must be as prepared as possible, with all information on groupings clearly identified.\n\n==Phases and personal activities==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\nEmergency management consists of five phases: prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. [http://www.fema.gov/mission-areas Mission Areas | FEMA.gov]\n\n===Prevention===\n{{See also|Pandemic prevention}}\nIt focuses on preventing the human hazard, primarily from potential natural disasters or terrorist attacks. Preventive measures are taken on both the domestic and international levels, designed to provide permanent protection from disasters. Also by doing this the risk of loss of life and injury can be mitigated with good evacuation plans, environmental planning and design standards. In January 2005, 167 Governments adopted a 10-year global plan for natural disaster risk reduction called the [[World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction|Hyogo Framework]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nPreventing or reducing the impacts of disasters on our communities is a key focus for emergency management efforts today. Prevention and mitigation also help reduce the financial costs of disaster response and recovery. Public Safety Canada is working with provincial and territorial governments and stakeholders to promote disaster prevention and mitigation using a risk-based and all-hazards approach. In 2009, Federal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers endorsed a National Disaster Mitigation Strategy.\n\n===Mitigation strategy===\nDisaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through proactive measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs.\n\nPreventive or mitigation measures take different forms for different types of disasters. In earthquake prone areas, these preventive measures might include structural changes such as the installation of an [[earthquake valve]] to instantly shut off the natural gas supply, [[seismic retrofit]]s of property, and the securing of items inside a building. The latter may include the mounting of furniture, [[refrigerator]]s, [[water heating|water heaters]] and breakables to the walls, and the addition of cabinet latches. In flood prone areas, houses can be built on poles/stilts. In areas prone to prolonged electricity [[power blackout|black-outs]] installation of a [[electrical generator|generator]] ensures continuation of electrical service. The construction of [[storm cellar]]s and [[fallout shelter]]s are further examples of personal mitigative actions.\n\nOn a national level, governments might implement large scale mitigation measures. After the monsoon floods of 2010, the Punjab government subsequently constructed 22 'disaster-resilient' model villages, comprising 1885 single-storey homes, together with schools and health centres.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/news-pakistans-punjab-builds-model-villages-to-withstand-disasters/?loclang=en_gb ''NEWS: Pakistan's Punjab builds model villages to withstand disasters''], [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 17 December 2013.</ref>\n\nOne of the best known examples of investment in disaster mitigation is the Red River Floodway. The building of the Floodway was a joint provincial/federal undertaking to protect the City of Winnipeg and reduce the impact of flooding in the Red River Basin. It cost $62.7 million to build in the 1960s. Since then, the floodway has been used over 20 times. Its use during the 1997 Red River Flood alone saved an estimated $4.5 billion in costs from potential damage to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|title=Flood Mitigation Efforts in the Red River Basin|last=Simonovic|first=Slobodan|website=www.iclr.org|publisher=The Institute of Catastrophic Loss Reduction|access-date=20 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023195652/https://www.iclr.org/images/2000_September_FridayForum.pdf|archive-date=2016-10-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Floodway was expanded in 2006 as a joint provincial/federal initiative.\n\n===Preparedness===\n[[File:Panther 8x8 action 15x10.jpg|thumb|An airport emergency preparedness exercise]]\nPreparedness focuses on preparing equipment and procedures for use when a [[disaster]] occurs. This equipment and these procedures can be used to reduce vulnerability to disaster, to mitigate the impacts of a disaster or to respond more efficiently in an [[emergency]]. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has set out a basic four-stage vision of preparedness flowing from mitigation to preparedness to response to recovery and back to mitigation in a circular planning process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/is10_unit3.doc |title=Animals in Disasters |publisher=Training.fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714234229/http://www.training.fema.gov/emiweb/downloads/is10_unit3.doc |archive-date=2015-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This circular, overlapping model has been modified by other agencies, taught in emergency class and discussed in academic papers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memphis.edu/ifti/pdfs/cait_phases_of_emergency_mngt.pdf|author=Baird, Malcolm E.|date=2010|title=The \"Phases\" of Emergency Management|publisher=Vanderbilt Center for Transportation Research|accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>\n\nFEMA also operates a Building Science Branch that develops and produces multi-hazard mitigation guidance that focuses on creating disaster-resilient communities to reduce loss of life and property.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/building-science|title=Building Science|work=fema.gov|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref>\nFEMA advises citizens to prepare their homes with some emergency essentials in the case that the food distribution lines are interrupted.

Preparation helps; when people feel prepared, they cope better and so do children.\"\n\nTo help people assess what threats might be in order to augment their emergency supplies or improve their disaster response skills, FEMA has published a booklet called the \"Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment Guide.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/8ca0a9e54dc8b037a55b402b2a269e94/CPG201_htirag_2nd_edition.pdf |title=Threat and Hazrd Identification and Risk Assessment Guide |date=August 2013 |publisher=Fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> (THIRA) This guide, which outlines the THIRA process, emphasizes \"whole community involvement,\" not just governmental agencies, in preparedness efforts. In this guide, FEMA breaks down hazards into three categories: Natural, technological and human caused and notes that each hazard should be assessed for both its likelihood and its significance. According to FEMA, \"Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that could plausibly occur\" and \"Communities should consider only those threats and hazards that would have a significant effect on them.\" To develop threat and hazard context descriptions, communities should take into account the time, place, and conditions in which threats or hazards might occur.\n\nNot all preparedness efforts and discussions involve the government or established NGOs like the Red Cross. Emergency preparation discussions are active on the internet, with many blogs and websites dedicated to discussing various aspects of preparedness. On-line sales of items such as survival food, medical supplies and heirloom seeds allow people to stock basements with cases of food and drinks with 25 year shelf lives, sophisticated medical kits and seeds that are guaranteed to sprout even after years of storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mypatriotsupply.com/ |title=My Patriot Supply : Homepage |publisher=Mypatriotsupply.com |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref>\n\nOne group of people who put a lot of effort in disaster preparations is called [[Doomsday Preppers]]. This subset of preparedness-minded people often share a belief that the FEMA or Red Cross emergency preparation suggestions and training are not extensive enough. Sometimes called [[survivalists]], Doomsday Preppers are often preparing for The End Of The World As We Know It, abbreviated as TEOTWAWKI. With a motto some have that \"The Future Belongs to those who Prepare,\" this Preparedness subset has its own set of Murphy's Rules,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://survivalcache.com/murphys-laws-of-teotwawki/ |title=Murphy's Laws of TEOTWAWKI |publisher=Survivalcache.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> including \"Rule Number 1: Food, you still don't have enough\" and \"Rule Number 26: People who thought the Government would save them, found out that it didn't.\"\n\nNot all emergency preparation efforts revolve around food, guns and shelters, though these items help address the needs in the bottom two sections of [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]]. The American Preppers Network<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanpreppersnetwork.com/|title=American Preppers Network \u2013 National family survival and preparedness organization|work=American Preppers Network|accessdate=8 March 2015}}</ref> has an extensive list of items that might be useful in less apparent ways than a first aid kid or help add 'fun' to challenging times. These items include:\n* Books and magazines\n* Arts and crafts [[painting]]\n* Children's entertainment\n* Crayons and coloring books\n* Notebooks and writing supplies\n* Nuts, bolts, screws, nails, etc.\n* Religious material\n* Sporting equipment, card games and board games\n* Posters and banners creating awareness\n\nEmergency preparedness goes beyond immediate family members. For many people, pets are an integral part of their families and emergency preparation advice includes them as well. It is not unknown for pet owners to die while trying to rescue their pets from a fire or from drowning.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/general-news/20140308/man-dies-trying-to-rescue-pets-from-fire |title=Man dies trying to rescue pets from fire |publisher=Pottsmerc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> CDC's Disaster Supply Checklist for Pets includes:<ref name=\"emergency.cdc.gov\"/>\n* Food and water for at least 3 days for each pet; bowls, and a manual can opener.\n* Depending on the pet you may need a litter box, paper towels, plastic trash bags, grooming items, and/or household bleach.\n* Medications and medical records stored in a waterproof container.\n* First aid kit with a pet first aid book.\n* Sturdy leash, harness, and carrier to transport pet safely. A carrier should be large enough for the animal to stand comfortably, turn around, and lie down. Your pet may have to stay in the carrier for several hours.\n* Pet toys and the pet's bed, if you can easily take it, to reduce stress.\n* Current photos and descriptions of your pets to help others identify them in case you and your pets become separated, and to prove that they are yours.\n* Information on feeding schedules, medical conditions, behavior problems, and the name and telephone number of your veterinarian in case you have to board your pets or place them in foster care.\n\nEmergency preparedness also includes more than physical items and skill-specific training. Psychological preparedness is also a type of emergency preparedness and specific mental health preparedness resources are offered for mental health professionals by organizations such as the Red Cross.<ref name=\"akamai1\"/> These mental health preparedness resources are designed to support both community members affected by a disaster and the disaster workers serving them. CDC has a website devoted to coping with a disaster or traumatic event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.samhsa.gov/MentalHealth/TraumaticEvent.aspx?from=carousel&position=1&date=3112011 |title=Coping with Traumatic Events, SAMHSA.gov |publisher=Media.samhsa.gov |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> After such an event, the CDC, through the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), suggests that people seek psychological help when they exhibit symptoms such as excessive worry, crying frequently, an increase in irritability, anger, and frequent arguing, wanting to be alone most of the time, feeling anxious or fearful, overwhelmed by sadness, confused, having trouble thinking clearly and concentrating, and difficulty making decisions, increased alcohol and/or substance use, increased physical (aches, pains) complaints such as headaches and trouble with \"nerves.\"\n\nSometimes emergency supplies are kept in what is called a [[Bug-out bag]]. While FEMA does not actually use the term \"Bug out bag,\" calling it instead some variation of a \"Go Kit,\" the idea of having emergency items in a quickly accessible place is common to both FEMA and CDC, though on-line discussions of what items a \"bug out bag\" should include sometimes cover items such as firearms and great knives that are not specifically suggested by FEMA or CDC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theprepperproject.com/bug-out-bag-checklist/ |title=Bug Out Bag Checklist |publisher=Theprepperproject.com |date=2013-04-18 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> The theory behind a \"bug out bag\" is that emergency preparations should include the possibility of [[Emergency evacuation]]. Whether fleeing a burning building or hastily packing a car to escape an impending hurricane, flood or dangerous chemical release, rapid departure from a home or workplace environment is always a possibility and FEMA suggests having a Family Emergency Plan for such occasions.<ref name=\"ready.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan |title=Make A Plan |publisher=Ready.gov |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> Because family members may not be together when disaster strikes, this plan should include reliable contact information for friends or relatives who live outside of what would be the disaster area for household members to notify they are safe or otherwise communicate with each other. Along with the contact information, FEMA suggests having well-understood local gathering points if a house must be evacuated quickly to avoid the dangers of re-reentering a burning home.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |title=Escape From Fire! |publisher=Usfa.fema.gov |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210211816/https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/publications/fa-246f.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-10 }}</ref> Family and emergency contact information should be printed on cards and put in each family member's backpack or wallet. If family members spend a significant amount of time in a specific location, such as at work or school, FEMA suggests learning the emergency preparation plans for those places.<ref name=\"ready.gov\"/> FEMA has a specific form, in English and in Spanish, to help people put together these emergency plans, though it lacks lines for email contact information.<ref name=\"ready.gov\"/>\n\nLike children, people with disabilities and other special needs have special emergency preparation needs. While \"disability\" has a specific meaning for specific organizations such as collecting [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssdrc.com/disabilityquestions3-24.html |title=Who Will Qualify For Disability? \u2013 What Qualifying Is Based On |publisher=Ssdrc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> for the purposes of emergency preparedness, the Red Cross uses the term in a broader sense to include people with physical, medical, sensor or cognitive disabilities or the elderly and other special needs populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redcross.org/images/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m4240199_A4497.pdf |title=Preparing for Disaster for People with Disabilities and other Special Needs |publisher=Redcross.org |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> Depending on the particular disability, specific emergency preparations might be required.

This assistance may be provided by national or international agencies and organizations. Effective coordination of disaster assistance is often crucial, particularly when many organizations respond and local emergency management agency (LEMA) capacity has been exceeded by the demand or diminished by the disaster itself. The [[National Response Framework]] is a United States government publication that explains responsibilities and expectations of government officials at the local, state, federal, and tribal levels. It provides guidance on Emergency Support Functions that may be integrated in whole or parts to aid in the response and recovery process.\n\nOn a personal level the response can take the shape either of a ''[[shelter in place]]'' or an ''[[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]]''. [[File:Evacuation sign.jpg|thumb|Evacuation sign]]In a shelter-in-place scenario, a family would be prepared to fend for themselves in their home for many days without any form of outside support. In an ''evacuation'', a family leaves the area by [[automobile]] or other mode of [[transportation]], taking with them the maximum amount of supplies they can carry, possibly including a tent for shelter. If mechanical transportation is not available, evacuation on foot would ideally include carrying at least three days of supplies and rain-tight bedding, a [[tarpaulin]] and a bedroll of blankets.\n\n[[Donation]]s are often sought during this period, especially for large disasters that overwhelm local capacity. Due to efficiencies of scale, [[money]] is often the most cost-effective donation if fraud is avoided. Money is also the most flexible, and if goods are sourced locally then transportation is minimized and the local economy is boosted. Some donors prefer to send [[gifts in kind]], however these items can end up creating issues, rather than helping. One innovation by [[Occupy Sandy]] volunteers is to use a donation registry, where families and businesses impacted by the disaster can make specific requests, which remote donors can purchase directly via a web site.\n\nMedical considerations will vary greatly based on the type of disaster and secondary effects. Survivors may sustain a multitude of injuries to include [[lacerations]], [[burn]]s, [[near drowning]], or [[crush syndrome]].\n\n===Recovery===\nThe recovery phase starts after the immediate threat to human life has subsided. The immediate goal of the recovery phase is to bring the affected area back to normalcy as quickly as possible. During reconstruction it is recommended to consider the location or construction material of the property.\n\nThe most extreme home confinement scenarios include war, [[famine]] and severe [[epidemic]]s and may last a year or more. Then recovery will take place inside the home. Planners for these events usually buy [[bulk purchasing|bulk]] foods and appropriate storage and preparation equipment, and eat the food as part of normal life. A simple balanced diet can be constructed from [[vitamin]] pills, [[whole-meal]] wheat, beans, [[dried milk]], corn, and [[cooking oil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/ |title=Federal Emergency Management Agency |publisher=FEMA.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}</ref> Vegetables, fruits, spices and meats, both prepared and fresh-gardened, are included when possible.\n\n==As a profession==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\nProfessional emergency managers can focus on government and community preparedness, or private business preparedness. Training is provided by local, state, federal and private organizations and ranges from public information and media relations to high-level incident command and tactical skills.\n\nIn the past, the field of emergency management has been populated mostly by people with a military or first responder background. Currently, the field has become more diverse, with many managers coming from a variety of backgrounds other than the military or first responder fields. Educational opportunities are increasing for those seeking undergraduate and graduate degrees in emergency management or a related field. There are over 180 schools in the US with emergency management-related programs, but only one doctoral program specifically in emergency management.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Jaffin\n |first=Bob\n |date=September 17, 2008\n |url=http://www.emergencymgmt.com/training/Emergency-Management-Training-How.html\n |title=Emergency Management Training: How to Find the Right Program\n |publisher=Emergency Management Magazine\n |accessdate=2008-11-15\n}}</ref>\n\nProfessional certifications such as Certified Emergency Manager (CEM)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaem.com/certification/generalinfo/intro.htm |title=Certification-General CEM certification Info |publisher=Iaem.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> and Certified Business Continuity Professional (CBCP)<ref name=\"drii.org\">Disaster Recovery Institute International. https://drii.org/</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Best Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Certifications |publisher=Tom's IT Pro |url=http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/business-continuity-disaster-recovery-certifications,2-766-4.html}}</ref> are becoming more common as professional standards are raised throughout the field, particularly in the United States. There are also professional organizations for emergency managers, such as the National Emergency Management Association and the International Association of Emergency Managers.\n\n===Principles===\nIn 2007, Dr. Wayne Blanchard of FEMA's Emergency Management Higher Education Project, at the direction of Dr. Cortez Lawrence, Superintendent of FEMA's Emergency Management Institute, convened a working group of emergency management practitioners and academics to consider principles of emergency management. This was the first time the principles of the discipline were to be codified. The group agreed on eight principles that will be used to guide the development of a doctrine of emergency management. Below is a summary:\n\n# Comprehensive \u2013 consider and take into account all hazards, all phases, all stakeholders and all impacts relevant to disasters.\n# Progressive \u2013 anticipate future disasters and take preventive and preparatory measures to build disaster-resistant and disaster-resilient communities.\n# Risk-driven \u2013 use sound risk management principles (hazard identification, risk analysis, and impact analysis) in assigning priorities and resources.\n# Integrated \u2013 ensure [[unity of effort]] among all levels of government and all elements of a community.\n# Collaborative \u2013 create and sustain broad and sincere relationships among individuals and organizations to encourage trust, advocate a team atmosphere, build consensus, and facilitate communication.\n# Coordinated \u2013 synchronize the activities of all relevant stakeholders to achieve a common purpose.\n# Flexible \u2013 use creative and innovative approaches in solving disaster challenges.\n# Professional \u2013 value a science and knowledge-based approach; based on education, training, experience, ethical practice, public stewardship and continuous improvement.\n\nA fuller description of these principles can be found at<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/emgt/PrinciplesofEmergencyManagement.pdf |title=Principles of Emergency Management Supplement |date=2007-09-11 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Tools===\nIn recent years the continuity feature of emergency management has resulted in a new concept, [[emergency management information system]]s (EMIS). For continuity and inter-operability between emergency management stakeholders, EMIS supports an infrastructure that integrates emergency plans at all levels of government and non-government involvement for all four phases of emergencies. In the healthcare field, hospitals utilize the [[Hospital Incident Command System]] (HICS), which provides structure and organization in a clearly defined chain of command.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Within other professions==\n{{Refimprove section|date= March 2014}}\n[[File:Rockefeller University Disaster Plan.jpg|thumb|A disaster plan book at [[Rockefeller University]] in a biochemistry research laboratory.]]\nPractitioners in emergency management come from an increasing variety of backgrounds. Professionals from [[memory institution]]s (e.g., museums, historical societies, etc.) are dedicated to preserving cultural heritage\u2014objects and records. This has been an increasingly major component within this field as a result of the heightened awareness following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|hurricanes in 2005]], and the [[Historical Archive of the City of Cologne|collapse of the Cologne Archives]].\n\nTo increase the potential successful recovery of valuable records, a well-established and thoroughly tested plan must be developed. This plan should emphasize simplicity in order to aid in response and recovery: employees should perform similar tasks in the response and recovery phase that they perform under normal conditions. It should also include mitigation strategies such as the installation of sprinklers within the institution.<ref>Buchanan, Sally. \"Emergency preparedness.\" from Paul Banks and Roberta Pilette.

Called Population Explorer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.populationexplorer.com/ |title=FEWS Network&nbsp;\u2014 USAID |publisher=Population Explorer |date= |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> the tool uses land scan population data, developed by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], to distribute population at a resolution 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for all countries in the world. Used by USAID's [[Famine Early Warning System Network|FEWS NET]] Project to estimate populations vulnerable to, or impacted by, food insecurity. Population Explorer is gaining wide use in a range of emergency analysis and response actions, including estimating populations impacted by floods in Central America and the Pacific Ocean tsunami event in 2009.\n\nIn 2007, a checklist for veterinarians was published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, it had two sets of questions for a professional to ask themselves before assisting with an emergency:\n\n'''Absolute requirements for participation:'''\n* Have I chosen to participate?\n* Have I taken ICS training?\n* Have I taken other required background courses?\n* Have I made arrangements with my practice to deploy?\n* Have I made arrangements with my family?\n\n'''Incident participation:'''\n* Have I been invited to participate?\n* Are my skill sets a match for the mission?\n* Can I access just-in-time training to refresh skills or acquire needed new skills?\n* Is this a self-support mission?\n* Do I have supplies needed for three to five days of self-support?\n\nWhile written for veterinarians, this checklist is applicable for any professional to consider before assisting with an emergency.<ref>The Veterinary profession's duty of care in response to disasters and food animal emergencies.

The principal government agency in achieving this is [[Emergency Management Australia]].\n\n===Canada===\n[[Public Safety Canada]] is Canada's national emergency management agency. Each province is required to have both legislation for dealing with emergencies, and provincial emergency management agencies, typically called \"Emergency Measures Organizations\" (EMO). Public Safety Canada co-ordinates and supports the efforts of federal organizations as well as other levels of government, first responders, community groups, the private sector, and other nations. The Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Act defines the powers, duties and functions of PS are outlined.

It is part of a broader effort by the federal authorities to re-establish national institutions. The [[Federal Parliament of Somalia|Federal Parliament]] is now expected to deliberate on the proposed bill for endorsement after any amendments.<ref name=\"Rsp Mcfp Tel\">{{cite news |last=Prime Minister's Media Office |title=SOMALIA: Prime Minister calls for parliament to enact legislation as Cabinet moves to establish disaster management agency |url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2013/05/somalia-prime-minister-calls-for-parliament-to-enact-legislation-as-cabinet-moves-to-establish-disaster-management-agency/ |accessdate=5 June 2013 |newspaper=Raxanreeb |date=30 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608200154/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2013/05/somalia-prime-minister-calls-for-parliament-to-enact-legislation-as-cabinet-moves-to-establish-disaster-management-agency/ |archivedate=8 June 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===The Netherlands===\nIn the [[Netherlands]] the [[Ministry of Security and Justice (Netherlands)|Ministry of Security and Justice]] is responsible for emergency preparedness and emergency management on a national level and operates a national crisis centre (NCC). The country is divided into 25 safety regions ([[w:nl:veiligheidsregio|veiligheidsregio]]). In a safety region, there are four components: the regional fire department, the regional department for medical care (ambulances and psycho-sociological care etc.), the regional dispatch and a section for risk- and crisis management. The regional dispatch operates for police, fire department and the regional medical care. The dispatch has all these three services combined into one dispatch for the best multi-coordinated response to an incident or an emergency. And also facilitates in information management, emergency communication and care of citizens. These services are the main structure for a response to an emergency. It can happen that, for a specific emergency, the co-operation with another service is needed, for instance the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministry of Defence]], [[water board]](s) or [[Rijkswaterstaat]]. The veiligheidsregio can integrate these other services into their structure by adding them to specific conferences on operational or administrative level.\n\nAll regions operate according to the [[Coordinated Regional Incident Management (Netherlands)|Coordinated Regional Incident Management]] system.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nFollowing the 2000 [[UK fuel protests|fuel protests]] and severe flooding that same year, as well as the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|foot-and-mouth]] crisis in 2001, the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] (CCA). The CCA defined some organisations as Category 1 and 2 Responders, setting responsibilities regarding emergency preparedness and response. It is managed by the [[Civil Contingencies Secretariat]] through Regional Resilience Forums and local authorities.\n\nDisaster Management training is generally conducted at the local level, and consolidated through professional courses that can be taken at the [[Emergency Planning College]]. Diplomas, undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications can be gained at universities throughout the country. The Institute of Emergency Management is a charity, established in 1996, providing consulting services for the government, media and commercial sectors. There are a number of professional societies for Emergency Planners including the Emergency Planning Society<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-eps.org/ |title=Welcome \u2013 The Emergency Planning Society |publisher=The-eps.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> and the Institute of Civil Protection and Emergency Management.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icpem.net/ |title=Institute of Civil Protection & Emergency Management &#124; Welcome |publisher=ICPEM |date=2014-04-03 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>\n\nOne of the largest emergency exercises in the UK was carried out on 20 May 2007 near [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]: a simulated plane crash-landing at [[Belfast International Airport]]. Staff from five hospitals and three airports participated in the drill, and almost 150 international observers assessed its effectiveness.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6673793.stm |title=UK &#124; Northern Ireland &#124; Mock plane crash tests NI crews |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-05-20 |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nDisaster management in the United States has utilized the functional All-Hazards approach for over 20 years, in which managers develop processes (such as communication & warning or sheltering) rather than developing single-hazard or threat focused plans (e.g., a tornado plan). Processes are then mapped to specific hazards or threats, with the manager looking for gaps, overlaps, and conflicts between processes.\n\nGiven these notions, emergency managers must identify, contemplate, and assess possible man-made threats and natural threats that may affect their respective locales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McElreath|first1=David|last2=Doss|first2=Daniel|last3=Jensen|first3=Carl|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|last5=Nations|first5=Robert|last6=Van Slyke|first6=Jeffrey|last7=Nations|first7=Julie|title=Foundations of Emergency Management|date=2014|publisher=Kendall-Hunt Publishing Company|location=Dubuque, IA|isbn=978-1465234889|page=25|edition=1st}}<!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--></ref> Because of geographical differences throughout the nation, a variety of different threats affect communities among the states. Thus, although similarities may exist, no two emergency plans will be completely identical. Additionally, each locale has different resources and capacities (e.g., budgets, personnel, equipment, etc.) for dealing with emergencies.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Glover|first2=William|last3=Goz|first3=Rebecca|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|title=The Foundations of Communication in Criminal Justice Systems|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1482236576|page=301}}<!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--></ref> Each individual community must craft its own unique emergency plan that addresses potential threats that are specific to the locality.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Doss|first1=Daniel|last2=Glover|first2=William|last3=Goza|first3=Rebecca|last4=Wigginton|first4=Michael|title=The Foundations of Communication in Criminal Justice Systems|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, Florida|isbn=978-1482236576|page=301|edition=1}}<!--|accessdate=31 July 2015--></ref>\n\nThis creates a plan more resilient to unique events because all common processes are defined, and it encourages planning done by the stakeholders who are closer to the individual processes, such as a traffic management plan written by a public works director. This type of planning can lead to conflict with non-emergency management regulatory bodies, which require the development of hazard/threat specific plans, such as the development of specific H1N1 flu plans and terrorism-specific plans.\n\nIn the United States, all disasters are initially local, with local authorities, with usually a police, fire, or EMS agency, taking charge. Many local municipalities may also have a separate dedicated [[office of emergency management]] (OEM), along with personnel and equipment. If the event becomes overwhelming to the local government, state emergency management (the primary government structure of the United States) becomes the controlling emergency management agency. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States|Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS), is the lead federal agency for emergency management. The United States and its territories are broken down into ten regions for FEMA's emergency management purposes. FEMA supports, but does not override, state authority.\n\nThe [[Citizen Corps]] is an organization of volunteer service programs, administered locally and coordinated nationally by DHS, which seek to mitigate disasters and prepare the population for emergency response through public education, training, and outreach. Most [[disaster response]] is carried out by volunteer organizations. In the US, the [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]] is chartered by Congress to coordinate disaster response services. It is typically the lead agency handling shelter and feeding of evacuees. Religious organizations, with their ability to provide volunteers quickly, are usually integral during the response process. The largest being the [[Salvation Army]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://disaster.salvationarmyusa.org/ |title=The Salvation Army Emergency Disaster Services |publisher=Disaster.salvationarmyusa.org |date= |accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> with a primary focus on chaplaincy and rebuilding, and [[Southern Baptists]] who focus on food preparation and distribution,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.namb.net/activity-report/ |title=2012 Activity Report |publisher=Namb.net |accessdate=2015-03-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113135407/http://www.namb.net/activity-report/ |archivedate=2015-01-13 }}</ref> as well as cleaning up after floods and fires, chaplaincy, mobile shower units, chainsaw crews and more.

Unaffiliated volunteers show up at most large disasters. To prevent abuse by criminals, and for the safety of the volunteers, procedures have been implemented within most response agencies to manage and effectively use these 'SUVs' ([[Spontaneous Unaffiliated Volunteers]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citizencorps.gov/downloads/pdf/ManagingSpontaneousVolunteers.pdf |title=Citizen Corps &#124; Ready.gov |publisher=Citizencorps.gov |date=2013-07-23 |accessdate=2013-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223174827/https://www.citizencorps.gov/downloads/pdf/ManagingSpontaneousVolunteers.pdf |archive-date=2013-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe US Congress established the [[Center for Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance]] (COE) as the principal agency to promote disaster preparedness in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe National Tribal Emergency Management Council (NEMC) is a non-profit educational organization developed for Tribal organizations to share information and best practices, as well as to discuss issues regarding public health and safety, emergency management and homeland security, affecting those under Indian sovereignty. NTMC is organized into Regions, based on the FEMA 10 region system. NTMC was founded by the {{vanchor|Northwest Tribal Emergency Management Council}} (NWTEMC), a consortium of 29 tribal nations and villages in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, and Alaska.\n\nIf a disaster or emergency is declared to be terror related or an \"Incident of National Significance,\" the Secretary of Homeland Security will initiate the [[National Response Framework]] (NRF). The NRF allows the integration of federal resources with local, county, state, or tribal entities, with management of those resources to be handled at the lowest possible level, utilizing the [[National Incident Management System]] (NIMS).\n\nThe [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] offer [https://www.emergency.cdc.gov/hazards-specific.asp information] for specific types of emergencies, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters and severe weather, chemical and radiation accidents, etc. The [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/ Emergency Preparedness and Response Program] of the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] develops resources to address responder safety and health during responder and recovery operations.\n\n====FEMA's Emergency Management Institute====\n{{see also|Emergency Management Institute}}\n[[File:FEMA - 7740 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 03-10-2003 in Maryland.jpg|right|thumb|[[Emergency Management Institute]]'s Main Campus in [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]]]]\nThe Emergency Management Institute (EMI) serves as the national focal point for the development and delivery of emergency management [[training]] to enhance the capabilities of [[state government|state]], territorial, [[local government|local]], and tribal government officials; volunteer organizations; FEMA's disaster workforce; other Federal agencies; and the public and private sectors to minimize the impact of disasters and [[emergency|emergencies]] on the American public.

Its common name is the Palehead Blenny, and is sometimes referred to as the Goggle-eye Blenny<ref name=\":0\" />. It can be identified by its greenish top, red belly, and multicolored banding. ''L. gobio'' is a benthic organism with a wide range, taking up residence in a number of coastal environments from Florida to Brazil<ref name=\":0\" />. This means the fish can live in equatorial, subtropical, and tropical climatic zones<ref name=\":0\" />. It is endemic to the West Atlantic, but not to the greater Caribbean area<ref name=\":0\" />.

The maximum length of a male palehead blenny is 6.5 cm<ref name=\":1\" />. ''L.gobio'' has an anatomy common in Labrosomids, with a small, elongated body<ref name=\":1\" />. The blenny has cycloid (meaning smooth to the touch) scales on the posterior body<ref name=\":1\" />. Scales in the series 40-69 are in a lateral line, which aids in movement. Some posterior scales in the series don\u2019t have sensory tubes<ref name=\":1\" />. On the posteroventral surface are the gill membranes, which occur continuously<ref name=\":1\" />. The stomach cavity has a lining that is white and dotted with dark spots<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n''L. gobio'' has a broad, grey-brown head and a rounded snout<ref name=\":0\" />. Its mouth is large and protruding, exposing the back of the upper jawbone<ref name=\":0\" />. There are more than 2 pores on the tip of its chin<ref name=\":0\" />. On either side of the head are two or more heavily branched cirri, which are tentacle-like structures lacking features of a traditional tentacle<ref name=\":1\" />. The cirri are directly anterior to the origin of the dorsal fin<ref name=\":1\" />. There may also be flaps in front of the nostrils, eyes, and nape of the fish<ref name=\":1\" />. The palehead blenny lacks an opercular ocellus, which is a colored spot on the head resembling an eye<ref name=\":1\" />. This feature is common of shorefishes in the greater Caribbean area, so this is one of the markers that ''L. gobio'' is a non-endemic species<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nThe blenny\u2019s jaw, or maxillary bone, is exposed posteriorly, and has multiple layers of teeth<ref name=\":1\" />. The outer row consists of large teeth resembling canines or incisors in the upper jaw<ref name=\":1\" />. Behind this row sit smaller teeth in patches, rather than continuously<ref name=\":1\" />. Teeth may also grow on the vomer bone or on the palatine, an area on the roof of the mouth<ref name=\":1\" />. The palatine teeth are significantly larger than the vomer teeth<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n''L. gobio'' has 3 sets of fins: the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins, which each consist of a number of rays. Its long dorsal fin consists of 19 dorsal spines<ref name=\":1\" />. Between the spines and rays of the dorsal fin is a notch<ref name=\":0\" />. The anal fin consists of 2 spines and 19 segmented rays<ref name=\":1\" />. Both the dorsal and anal spines are long, often flexible, and longest anteriorly<ref name=\":1\" />. The pectoral fins commonly have 13 rays<ref name=\":1\" />. Behind the pectoral fin\u2019s base are the pelvic fins, which have one spine and far fewer segmented soft rays (approximately 2 or 3), with a shorter innermost ray that overlaps the middle ray<ref name=\":1\" />. This singular spine is not externally visible<ref name=\":1\" />. The shortest pelvic fin ray is over double the length of the longest ray<ref name=\":1\" />. All of the fin rays of the palehead blenny are unbranched<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nThe blenny has a unique coloration and marbled pattern, with 4-5 brown and light bands on the body, but not on the fins<ref name=\":0\" />. The second band is widest at the top<ref name=\":0\" />. Females may present red spots while males have no coloration<ref name=\":0\" />. The dorsal and anal fins have very faint markings<ref name=\":1\" />. A narrow dark line marks the base of the caudal fin<ref name=\":0\" />. The peritoneum, which is a membrane lining the fish\u2019s body, is white with large pigment cells called melanophores<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nMuch of the internal anatomy of ''L. gobio'' is unknown<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Reproduction ==\n''L. Gobio\u2019s'' eggs are laid in benthic environments<ref name=\":0\" />. The larva are pelagic<ref name=\":0\" />. Little is known about this specie\u2019s reproduction, and more research is required.\n\n== Distribution and Habitat ==\n''L.gobio'' is a marine organism that inhabitants subtropical reefs within depths of 0-15 meters, on rocky shores with heavy vegetation, including algal mats and seagrass beds<ref name=\":1\" />. It prefers reef habitats with coral and limestone formations, and soft substrates such as sand and gravel<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n''L. gobio'' populates the Western Atlantic coast of Latin America and around the West Indies, from Mexico to the islands of the Lesser Antilles<ref name=\":1\" />. The blenny\u2019s distribution likely extends to the Western coast of northern South America, as well as the Antilles island chain<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nThe blenny prefers temperatures of 26.5-28.2 degrees Celsius, with an average of 27.5 degrees Celsius<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Diet ==\n''L. gobio'' is a carnivore known to feed on bony fishes and a number of mobile, benthic organisms including worms, crustaceans such as shrimps and crabs, gastropods, and bivalves<ref name=\":0\" />. It also eats sea stars, sea cucumbers, and sea urchins<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n== Behavior ==\n''L. gobio'' hides in sea anemones as a method of avoiding predators<ref name=\":2\">Hanlon, R.

''L. gobio'' is stung during the acclimation period, which can take several minutes to hours<ref name=\":2\" />. The behavioral mechanism by which ''L. gobio'' acclimates to the anemone is hypothesized to be by a factor of the fish\u2019s ability to alter its mucous coating in order to avoid stinging<ref name=\":2\" />. This negates the need for the fish to acquire mucous from the anemone during acclimation. The mechanism of the physiological adaption is unknown, and more research is required<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\nThere are lateral lines on the front sides of ''L. gobio\u2019s'' body<ref name=\":0\" />.

Its common name is the Palehead Blenny, and is sometimes referred to as the Goggle-eye Blenny<ref name=\":0\" />. It can be identified by its greenish top, red belly, and multicolored banding. ''L. gobio'' is a benthic organism with a wide range, taking up residence in a number of coastal environments from Florida to Brazil<ref name=\":0\" />. This means the fish can live in equatorial, subtropical, and tropical climatic zones<ref name=\":0\" />. It is endemic to the West Atlantic, but not to the greater Caribbean area<ref name=\":0\" />.

The maximum length of a male palehead blenny is 6.5 cm<ref name=\":1\" />. ''L.gobio'' has an anatomy common in Labrosomids, with a small, elongated body<ref name=\":1\" />. The blenny has cycloid (meaning smooth to the touch) scales on the posterior body<ref name=\":1\" />. Scales in the series 40-69 are in a lateral line, which aids in movement. Some posterior scales in the series don\u2019t have sensory tubes<ref name=\":1\" />. On the posteroventral surface are the gill membranes, which occur continuously<ref name=\":1\" />. The stomach cavity has a lining that is white and dotted with dark spots<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n''L. gobio'' has a broad, grey-brown head and a rounded snout<ref name=\":0\" />. Its mouth is large and protruding, exposing the back of the upper jawbone<ref name=\":0\" />. There are more than 2 pores on the tip of its chin<ref name=\":0\" />. On either side of the head are two or more heavily branched cirri, which are tentacle-like structures lacking features of a traditional tentacle<ref name=\":1\" />. The cirri are directly anterior to the origin of the dorsal fin<ref name=\":1\" />. There may also be flaps in front of the nostrils, eyes, and nape of the fish<ref name=\":1\" />. The palehead blenny lacks an opercular ocellus, which is a colored spot on the head resembling an eye<ref name=\":1\" />. This feature is common of shorefishes in the greater Caribbean area, so this is one of the markers that ''L. gobio'' is a non-endemic species<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nThe blenny\u2019s jaw, or maxillary bone, is exposed posteriorly, and has multiple layers of teeth<ref name=\":1\" />. The outer row consists of large teeth resembling canines or incisors in the upper jaw<ref name=\":1\" />. Behind this row sit smaller teeth in patches, rather than continuously<ref name=\":1\" />. Teeth may also grow on the vomer bone or on the palatine, an area on the roof of the mouth<ref name=\":1\" />. The palatine teeth are significantly larger than the vomer teeth<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n''L. gobio'' has 3 sets of fins: the dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins, which each consist of a number of rays. Its long dorsal fin consists of 19 dorsal spines<ref name=\":1\" />. Between the spines and rays of the dorsal fin is a notch<ref name=\":0\" />. The anal fin consists of 2 spines and 19 segmented rays<ref name=\":1\" />. Both the dorsal and anal spines are long, often flexible, and longest anteriorly<ref name=\":1\" />. The pectoral fins commonly have 13 rays<ref name=\":1\" />. Behind the pectoral fin\u2019s base are the pelvic fins, which have one spine and far fewer segmented soft rays (approximately 2 or 3), with a shorter innermost ray that overlaps the middle ray<ref name=\":1\" />. This singular spine is not externally visible<ref name=\":1\" />. The shortest pelvic fin ray is over double the length of the longest ray<ref name=\":1\" />. All of the fin rays of the palehead blenny are unbranched<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nThe blenny has a unique coloration and marbled pattern, with 4-5 brown and light bands on the body, but not on the fins<ref name=\":0\" />. The second band is widest at the top<ref name=\":0\" />. Females may present red spots while males have no coloration<ref name=\":0\" />. The dorsal and anal fins have very faint markings<ref name=\":1\" />. A narrow dark line marks the base of the caudal fin<ref name=\":0\" />. The peritoneum, which is a membrane lining the fish\u2019s body, is white with large pigment cells called melanophores<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nMuch of the internal anatomy of ''L. gobio'' is unknown<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n== Reproduction ==\n''L. Gobio\u2019s'' eggs are laid in benthic environments<ref name=\":0\" />. The larva are pelagic<ref name=\":0\" />.

From 1910\u20131915 he studied at the [[University of Vienna]]. He took courses philosophy, architecture and [[agronomy]]. On his return to Krak\u00f3w he entered the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]], and also worked in his father's studio. In 1915 he began to travel frequently to [[Zakopane]] where he spent extensive periods, to climb, ski and paint, until the [[outbreak of World War II]]. He joined the local [[Mountain rescue]] team, [[Tatrza\u0144skie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe|TOPR]]. However in 1917 on the south face of \"Zamar\u0142a Turnia\" he and his climbing companion, Stanis\u0142aw Bronikowski, were caught in a climbing accident in which his friend died, while Malczewski clung to a hook all night awaiting rescue.\n\nIn October 1917 he married Bronis\u0142awa Dziadosz, an English teacher four years his senior and a [[US citizen]] of Polish descent who had immigrated into Poland. In November of the same year, their son Krzysztof was born. Despite an unhappy partnership, the couple went on to have a second child. Their poor financial situation led to Rafa\u0142's artist father helping them out. In 1923 he bought for them a chalet called \"Marysin\".\n\nRafa\u0142 Malczewski was an associate and friend of a group of artists, musicians and intellectuals who would congregate in the [[Mountain resort]] of Zakopane in the early part of the 20th century. They included [[Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], [[Karol Szymanowski]], [[Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski]], [[Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz|Iwaszkiewicz\u00f3w]]. In 1932 he joined Stowarzyszenie Artyst\u00f3w Polskich \u201eRytm\u201d and was a set designer for the  Formistyczny  Theatre in Zakopane. In 1937 he was awarded the \"Wawrzyn Akademicki\" award from the [[Polska Akademia Literatury]] \"for services to Polish art\".<ref>Rocznik Polskiej Akademii Literatury 1937\u20131938, Warsaw 1939, p. 175.</ref> 1938 he donated part of his artistic output to the newly re-opened [[National Museum of Warsaw]] to which, several years earlier on account of his material difficulties, he had sold the entirety of his father's work left to him by Malczewski Sr.\n\n== Travels ==\nHaving already abandoned his wife and children, in 1939 after the [[outbreak of World War II]] with his partner Zofia Mikucka, he escaped Slovak border over the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] border, and via [[Budapest]] and [[Venice]] made his way to [[Paris]]. Here he fell on the generosity of the Polish embassy to help him out of a financial difficulty. In 1940 he travelled on to [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], where he stayed for four months. At the beginning of 1941 he moved to [[Brazil]]. At first he stayed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where he was able to sell some of his paintings. They consisted of water colour landscapes of Rio, [[Curitiba]] and of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Parana]].\n\nIn 1942 he moved to Curitiba to stay with his cousin, Maria Bochdan-Niedenthal. Shortly after he succeeded in obtaining Canadian visas for himself and his girlfriend, Zofia, for travel to [[Ottawa]]. By December 1942 he held his first Canadian exhibition in the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]. He managed to persuade the [[Canadian railways]] to sponsor him and Zofia to travel across [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] in search of artistic subjects. He spent the winter of 1943 in the [[Rocky Mountains]], which led to a series of canvases that kept him supplied for many exhibitions until 1949. A stay in [[New York]] in 1950 was fruitful enough for further sales of his work. \n\nDespite developing problems with his sight, the following years saw a great flowering of his painting and writing. After his wife, Bronislawa died in Warsaw in 1953, he married Zofia Mikucka. A stroke in 1957 led to a partial paralysis which obliged him to give up painting in oils, but he was able to continue with water colours. He managed to obtain sponsorship from the CIA-controlled [[Radio Free Europe]] and from [[Quebec City]]. In 1959 the daughter of Zofia Malczewska-Kondracka invited him to visit Poland. Despite great nostalgia for the south of the country, he  resolved to remain in Canada, but his journey was described in his memoir, ''Wspomnieniach z Polski'' and serialised in the [[London]] \u00e9migr\u00e9 paper,[[Wiadomo\u015bci (London magazine)|Wiadomo\u015bci]]. From 1961 he was kept by his daughter, Zofia, and three years later, in 1964 his last exhibition took place in [[Montreal]].

He made promises neither his stores nor his cash flows would allow him to keep\". Similar to what he had done at Apple, Johnson did not consider a staged roll-out, instead he \"immediately rejected everything existing customers believed about the chain and stuffed it in their faces\" with the first major TV ad campaign under his watch.

While his rebranding effort was ambitious, he was said to have \"had no idea about allocating and conserving resources and core customers. He made promises neither his stores nor his cash flows would allow him to keep\". Similar to what he had done at Apple, Johnson did not consider a staged roll-out, instead he \"immediately rejected everything existing customers believed about the chain and stuffed it in their faces\" with the first major TV ad campaign under his watch. Johnson defended his strategy, saying that \"testing would have been impossible because the company needed quick results and that if he hadn\u2019t taken a strong stance against discounting, he would not have been able to get new, stylish brands on board.\"<ref name=\"business.time.com\"/><ref name=\"Vancouver\"/>\n\nMany of the initiatives that were successful at the Apple Stores, for instance the \"thought that people would show up in stores because they were fun places to hang out, and that they would buy things listed at full-but-fair price\" did not work for the J.C. Penney brand and ended up alienating its customers who were used to heavy discounting. By eliminating the thrill of pursuing markdowns, the \u201cfair and square every day\u201d pricing strategy disenfranchised JC Penney's traditional customer base.<ref>[http://www.rightattitudes.com/2013/04/11/ron_johnson_debacle_at_jcpenney/ Three Leadership Lessons from Ron Johnson\u2019s Debacle at J.C.

Instead, he offered the assessment that customers needed to be \u201ceducated\u201d as to how the new pricing strategy worked. He also likened the coupons beloved by so many core shoppers as drugs that customers needed to be weaned off.\"<ref name=\"yahoo1\"/><ref name=\"business.time.com\"/><ref name=\"forbes1\"/> While head of [[J.
