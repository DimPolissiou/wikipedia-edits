She is a [[lyric soprano]] and has a [[vocal range]] of three octaves.<ref name=\"Classic Rock Magazine 2009, p. 92\">Classic Rock Magazine, August 2009, p. 92</ref>\n\nTurunen studied singing at [[Sibelius Academy]] and [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Karlsruhe]]. She is a professional classical [[lied]] singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]], which she founded with [[Tuomas Holopainen]] and [[Emppu Vuorinen]] in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen's dramatic, \"operatic\" lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed \"opera metal\", inspired many other metal bands and performers.\n\nTurunen was dismissed from the band on 21 October 2005 (just after the performance of the band's [[End of an Era (album)|End of an Era]] concert) for personal reasons. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a Christmas album called ''[[Henk\u00e4ys ikuisuudesta]]''. In 2007, Turunen released ''[[My Winter Storm]]'', an album featuring various styles including symphonic metal, and started the [[Storm World Tour]]. Turunen released her third album, ''[[What Lies Beneath (Tarja album)|What Lies Beneath]]'', in 2010. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in metal festivals including the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and the [[Wacken Open Air]], before starting the [[What Lies Beneath World Tour]], which lasted until April 2012. Her first live DVD ''[[Act I : Live in Rosario|Act I]]'' was filmed during this tour on 30 and 31 March 2012 in [[Rosario, Argentina]]. ''[[Act I : Live in Rosario|Act I]]'' was released in August 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarja-act1.com/?p=341#more-341 |title=Tarja Turunen \u2013 Live Album 'ACT I\" available August 24th 2012 |website=Tarja-act1.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref> Turunen started the [[Colours in the Dark World Tour]] in October 2013 to promote her new album [[Colours in the Dark (album)|''Colours in the Dark'']]. Her second live DVD was filmed during the events of ''[[Beauty and the Beat (Tarja album)|Beauty and the Beat]]'' and was released in May.\n\nIn September 2015, Tarja Turunen released her first classical studio album, ''[[Ave Maria \u2013 En Plein Air]]''. In August 2016 she released ''[[The Shadow Self (album)|The Shadow Self]]'' with a prequel EP ''[[The Brightest Void (album)|The Brightest Void]]'' released on June 3.

She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Ritva Sisko Marjatta (Hakkarainen) worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song \"Enkeli taivaan\" (the Finnish version of \"[[Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"|From Heaven Above to Earth I Come]]\") in the Kitee church hall at age three.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} She joined the [[church choir]] and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt [[comprehensive school]], Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, \"Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.\"{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} Her music teacher, [[Plamen Dimov (musician)|Plamen Dimov]], later explained that, \"If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times\".{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At school she had a tough time, since some girls [[Bullying|bullied]] her because they envied her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in [[Savonlinna]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=43}}\n\nFor several years Turunen performed various songs including [[soul music]] by [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42, 43}} Later she listened to songs from the [[Crossover (music)#Classical crossover|classical crossover]] singer [[Sarah Brightman]], especially the song \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]\", and decided to focus on that genre of music.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At eighteen, she moved to [[Kuopio]] to study at the [[Sibelius Academy]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=44}}\n\n===1996\u20132005: With Nightwish===\n[[File:NightwishJune2005.jpg|thumb|alt=Five band members taking their bows at the end of a performance|Turunen with Nightwish at the Himos Festival in [[J\u00e4ms\u00e4]], Finland, on June 25, 2005]]\n\nIn December 1996, former classmate [[Tuomas Holopainen]] invited Turunen to join his new acoustic mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, [[Emppu Vuorinen]] used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=45, 46}} Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually came to the conclusion that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a [[Heavy metal music|metal band]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=54}}\n\nNightwish recorded a second demo with \"more bombastic, dramatic\" songs in September 1997.

On the Nightwish album ''[[Oceanborn]]'' (1998), her classical vocal training was much more noticeable. For the song \"[[Passion and the Opera]]\", Turunen performed a [[staccato]] [[coloratura]] reminiscent of the aria \"[[Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen|Hell's vengeance boils in my heart]]\", sung by the soprano role Queen of the Night in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] opera [[The Magic Flute]].{{sfn|Della Ciopa|2010|p=77}} \"Sleeping Sun\" required a well-trained breathing technique.

In an interview with ''Breakout'' magazine, she reported that in the studio, the band members were shaken by a paroxysm of laughter as she tried to warm up for the vocal lines.<ref>''Breakout'' Magazine, 5/2001, p. 6-8</ref> As a side benefit of her efforts, Turunen gradually expanded her vocal range considerably into the lower range, which manifested even more on the following albums.\n\nFor the album ''[[Century Child]]'' (2002), she experimented with a more \"rock\" sounding voice, where she maintained the classical singing technique, but, for example, sang with less vibrato.

She is a [[lyric soprano]] and has a [[vocal range]] of three octaves.<ref name=\"Classic Rock Magazine 2009, p. 92\">Classic Rock Magazine, August 2009, p. 92</ref>\n\nTurunen studied singing at [[Sibelius Academy]] and [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Karlsruhe]]. She is a professional classical [[lied]] singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band [[Nightwish]], which she founded with [[Tuomas Holopainen]] and [[Emppu Vuorinen]] in 1996. Their combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with Turunen's dramatic, \"operatic\" lead vocals quickly achieved critical and commercial popularity. Their symphonic metal style, soon dubbed \"opera metal\", inspired many other metal bands and performers.\n\nTurunen was dismissed from the band on 21 October 2005 (just after the performance of the band's [[End of an Era (album)|End of an Era]] concert) for personal reasons. She started her solo career in 2006 with the release of a Christmas album called ''[[Henk\u00e4ys ikuisuudesta]]''. In 2007, Turunen released ''[[My Winter Storm]]'', an album featuring various styles including symphonic metal, and started the [[Storm World Tour]]. Turunen released her third album, ''[[What Lies Beneath (Tarja album)|What Lies Beneath]]'', in 2010. She performed several concerts in Europe, playing in metal festivals including the [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and the [[Wacken Open Air]], before starting the [[What Lies Beneath World Tour]], which lasted until April 2012. Her first live DVD ''[[Act I : Live in Rosario|Act I]]'' was filmed during this tour on 30 and 31 March 2012 in [[Rosario, Argentina]].

She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Ritva Sisko Marjatta (Hakkarainen) worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song \"Enkeli taivaan\" (the Finnish version of \"[[Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"|From Heaven Above to Earth I Come]]\") in the Kitee church hall at age three.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} She joined the [[church choir]] and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt [[comprehensive school]], Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, \"Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.\"{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} Her music teacher, [[Plamen Dimov (musician)|Plamen Dimov]], later explained that, \"If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times\".{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At school she had a tough time, since some girls [[Bullying|bullied]] her because they envied her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=41}} In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in [[Savonlinna]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=43}}\n\nFor several years Turunen performed various songs including [[soul music]] by [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42, 43}} Later she listened to songs from the [[Crossover (music)#Classical crossover|classical crossover]] singer [[Sarah Brightman]], especially the song \"[[The Phantom of the Opera (Andrew Lloyd Webber song)|The Phantom of the Opera]]\", and decided to focus on that genre of music.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=42}} At eighteen, she moved to [[Kuopio]] to study at the [[Sibelius Academy]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=44}}\n\n===1996\u20132005: With Nightwish===\n[[File:NightwishJune2005.jpg|thumb|alt=Five band members taking their bows at the end of a performance|Turunen with Nightwish at the Himos Festival in [[J\u00e4ms\u00e4]], Finland, on June 25, 2005]]\n\nIn December 1996, former classmate [[Tuomas Holopainen]] invited Turunen to join his new acoustic mood music project, and she immediately agreed. At the recording session for the first demo Holopainen discovered that due to her classical singing lessons, Turunen's voice had become much more powerful than he recalled from their school days. At the following band practices, [[Emppu Vuorinen]] used an electric guitar instead of an acoustic guitar because he felt that it gave a better accompaniment to her voice.{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=45, 46}} Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually came to the conclusion that the music had to be massive too. Hence Holopainen decided to form Nightwish as a [[Heavy metal music|metal band]].{{sfn|Ollila|2007|p=54}}\n\nNightwish recorded a second demo with \"more bombastic, dramatic\" songs in September 1997.

On the Nightwish album ''[[Oceanborn]]'' (1998), her classical vocal training was much more noticeable.
