The Fox Chase Line branches from the [[SEPTA Main Line]] at [[Newtown Junction]], north of the [[Wayne Junction (SEPTA station)|Wayne Junction]] station. It runs entirely within the city of Philadelphia. The line is fully [[Grade separation|grade-separated]], except for one [[Level crossing|grade crossing]] on Oxford Avenue. Under the [[Reading Company]] service continued north to [[Newtown (SEPTA station)|Newtown]], but this ended in January 1983. Various proposals to resume this service have failed, and the line within [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] was converted into a [[rail trail]] in 2008 and 2014, respectively, ending any chance of resumed passenger service for the foreseeable future.\n\n==History==\n[[File:R8 Fox Chase.gif|left]]\nThe Fox Chase Line branches from the [[SEPTA Main Line]] at [[Newtown Junction]], north of the [[Wayne Junction (SEPTA station)|Wayne Junction]] station. It runs entirely within the city of Philadelphia.\n\nThe line beyond Newtown Junction was originally opened February 2, 1878, to [[Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown]] as the [[Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad]]. The line was built by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] to block the building of the parallel [[National Railway]] (later the [[Reading Company]]'s main line to [[New York City]]). After that failed, it was taken over by the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] (which had built the National Railway) on November 22, 1879. By then the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railway]], later the [[Reading Company]], had leased the North Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1976 the Reading was merged into [[Conrail]], and in 1983 SEPTA took over commuter rail operations.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nBetween 1984 and 2010 the route was designated '''R8 Fox Chase''' as part of SEPTA's [[Swampoodle Connection|diametrical reorganization]] of its lines.

In anticipation of a possible resumption, SEPTA performed extensive track upgrades in 1984. [[Level crossing|Street crossings]] in Newtown and Southampton received brand new welded rail, which were secured using sturdy [[Pandrol|Pandrol clips]] vs. traditional [[rail spike]]s. Though not promoted, this work was done in order to comply with a federal grant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwieterman|2001|p=266}}</ref>\n\nBy March 1985, SEPTA gave into political pressure and made a concerted effort to integrate the non-electrified Fox Chase-Newtown line into the rest of its all-electrified commuter system. A $10 million plan to restore service to Newtown and Pottstown using [[British Rail railbuses|British Rail-Leyland diesel railbuses]] was considered, with a test run reaching Newtown on September 3. Though the trial runs were relatively successful, ride quality was lackluster. Burdened with ongoing budgetary problems, SEPTA decided against the purchase of the railbuses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodland|2003|p=26}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1987, SEPTA received several bids from private operators interested in running diesel-hauled trains to Newtown (as well as between Norristown and Pottstown). The operators suggested using non-union workers, which SEPTA was against. In addition, funding for these operations was allegedly questionable, and the SEPTA board rejected all offers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodland|1998}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nBeginning in 2009, portions on the line within Montgomery County have been converted into a [[rail trail]].<ref name=debate /><ref name=trailext>{{cite web|last=Nussbaum|first=Paul|accessdate=April 21, 2014|title=Montco plans to convert more of rail line for recreation|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=March 23, 2014 |url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-03-23/news/48471219_1_rail-line-septa-spokeswoman-jerri-williams-rail-service}}</ref> By 2015, the [[Pennypack Trail]] extended {{convert|5.4|mi|km}} along the former line between [[Rockledge, Pennsylvania|Rockledge]] and Byberry Road near [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania|Bryn Athyn]].

Chase Line''' is a route of the [[SEPTA Regional Rail]] ([[commuter rail]]) system. The Fox Chase Line branches from the [[SEPTA Main Line]] at [[Newtown Junction]], north of the [[Wayne Junction (SEPTA station)|Wayne Junction]] station. It runs entirely within the city of Philadelphia. The line is fully [[Grade separation|grade-separated]], except for one [[Level crossing|grade crossing]] on Oxford Avenue. Under the [[Reading Company]] service continued north to [[Newtown (SEPTA station)|Newtown]], but this ended in January 1983. Various proposals to resume this service have failed, and the line within [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] was converted into a [[rail trail]] in 2008 and 2014, respectively, ending any chance of resumed passenger service for the foreseeable future.\n\n==History==\n[[File:R8 Fox Chase.gif|left]]\nThe Fox Chase Line branches from the [[SEPTA Main Line]] at [[Newtown Junction]], north of the [[Wayne Junction (SEPTA station)|Wayne Junction]] station. It runs entirely within the city of Philadelphia.\n\nThe line beyond Newtown Junction was originally opened February 2, 1878, to [[Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Newtown]] as the [[Philadelphia, Newtown and New York Railroad]]. The line was built by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] to block the building of the parallel [[National Railway]] (later the [[Reading Company]]'s main line to [[New York City]]). After that failed, it was taken over by the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad]] (which had built the National Railway) on November 22, 1879. By then the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railway]], later the [[Reading Company]], had leased the North Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1976 the Reading was merged into [[Conrail]], and in 1983 SEPTA took over commuter rail operations.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nBetween 1984 and 2010 the route was designated '''R8 Fox Chase''' as part of SEPTA's [[Swampoodle Connection|diametrical reorganization]] of its lines.

In anticipation of a possible resumption, SEPTA performed extensive track upgrades in 1984. [[Level crossing|Street crossings]] in Newtown and Southampton received brand new welded rail, which were secured using sturdy [[Pandrol|Pandrol clips]] vs. traditional [[rail spike]]s. Though not promoted, this work was done in order to comply with a federal grant.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwieterman|2001|p=266}}</ref>\n\nBy March 1985, SEPTA gave into political pressure and made a concerted effort to integrate the non-electrified Fox Chase-Newtown line into the rest of its all-electrified commuter system. A $10 million plan to restore service to Newtown and Pottstown using [[British Rail railbuses|British Rail-Leyland diesel railbuses]] was considered, with a test run reaching Newtown on September 3. Though the trial runs were relatively successful, ride quality was lackluster. Burdened with ongoing budgetary problems, SEPTA decided against the purchase of the railbuses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodland|2003|p=26}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1987, SEPTA received several bids from private operators interested in running diesel-hauled trains to Newtown (as well as between Norristown and Pottstown). The operators suggested using non-union workers, which SEPTA was against. In addition, funding for these operations was allegedly questionable, and the SEPTA board rejected all offers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodland|1998}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nBeginning in 2009, portions on the line within Montgomery County have been converted into a [[rail trail]].<ref name=debate /><ref name=trailext>{{cite web|last=Nussbaum|first=Paul|accessdate=April 21, 2014|title=Montco plans to convert more of rail line for recreation|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=March 23, 2014 |url=http://articles.philly.com/2014-03-23/news/48471219_1_rail-line-septa-spokeswoman-jerri-williams-rail-service}}</ref> By 2015, the [[Pennypack Trail]] extended {{convert|5.4|mi|km}} along the former line between [[Rockledge, Pennsylvania|Rockledge]] and Byberry Road near [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania|Bryn Athyn]].
