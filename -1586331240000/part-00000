By the later 1800's, thousands of spiritualist descended on Haslett Park for summer meetings, readings, lectures, and seances.  Mr. Haslett had hoped to establish his camp as the National Headquarters for the spiritualist movement.  His untimely death 1891 and the decline of the spiritualist movement cause his widow to sell the land to the Haslett Park Association in 1898.  The new owners transformed the land into a summer recreational destination, and eventually, a figure-8 wooden roller coaster and other carnival rides were added, thus establishing what became known as Lake Lansing Amusement Park. With the railroad established, the Lansing Trolley line added rails so that people could travel from the state Capital, Lansing, to the new recreation center.  Holding to this tradition, Haslett is host to Lake Lansing Parks North and South as well as a portion of the Inter-Urban Pathway and numerous other small parks and recreation facilities.\n\nThe city of [[Haslet, Texas]], is named after Haslett, Michigan (note that the Texas community is spelled with one 't').

Mr. Haslett had hoped to establish his camp as the National Headquarters for the spiritualist movement.  His untimely death 1891 and the decline of the spiritualist movement cause his widow to sell the land to the Haslett Park Association in 1898.  The new owners transformed the land into a summer recreational destination, and eventually, a figure-8 wooden roller coaster and other carnival rides were added, thus establishing what became known as Lake Lansing Amusement Park. With the railroad established, the Lansing Trolley line added rails so that people could travel from the state Capital, Lansing, to the new recreation center.  Holding to this tradition, Haslett is host to Lake Lansing Parks North and South as well as a portion of the Inter-Urban Pathway and numerous other small parks and recreation facilities.\n\nThe city of [[Haslet, Texas]], is named after Haslett, Michigan (note that the Texas community is spelled with one 't'). The Texas town of Haslet received its name from a railroad worker who relocated to Texas from Michigan in the late 1800s.\n\n==Geography==\nHaslett is in northern Ingham County and is bordered by the city of [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] to the west and the unincorporated community of [[Okemos, Michigan|Okemos]] to the south. Haslett is bordered to the north by [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]] and [[Shiawassee County, Michigan|Shiawassee County]]. [[Business routes of Interstate 69 in Michigan#Lansing|Business Loop I-69]] (East Saginaw Street) runs through the northwest part of Haslett, leading northeast to [[Interstate 69]] in Clinton County and west into [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|42.1|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|39.8|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|2.3|km2|order=flip}}, or 5.50%, are water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nThe largest area lake, [[Lake Lansing]], is located in Haslett and is {{convert|461|acre|km2}} in size. The lake has a popular beach which attracts local [[human swimming|swimmers]], [[sunbathing|sunbathers]], [[boating|boaters]], and [[fishing|fishermen]].\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 11,283 people, 5,132 households, and 2,884 families residing in the CDP.  The [[population density]] was 1,354.8 per square mile (523.0/km\u00b2).  There were 5,355 housing units at an average density of 643.0 per square mile (248.2/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the CDP was 92.37% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 2.39% [[African American (U.S. Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.30% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 2.71% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.03% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.73% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.47% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 2.48% of the population.\n\nThere were 5,132 households out of which 28.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.5% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 43.8% were non-families. 35.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.19 and the average family size was 2.90.\n\nIn the CDP, the population was spread out with 23.3% under the age of 18, 9.5% from 18 to 24, 30.4% from 25 to 44, 25.2% from 45 to 64, and 11.6% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 85.9 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.3 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the CDP was $50,679, and the median income for a family was $69,806. Males had a median income of $51,637 versus $35,786 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the CDP was $28,686.  About 4.8% of families and 7.1% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 7.6% of those under age 18 and 7.8% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://haslett.k12.mi.us/ Haslett Public Schools]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Center = Haslett\n|Northeast = [[Shaftsburg, Michigan|Shaftsburg]] \n|Southeast =  [[Williamston, Michigan|Williamston]]\n|South = [[Okemos, Michigan|Okemos]]\n|West =  [[East Lansing]]\n|Northwest = [[Bath, Michigan|Bath]]\n|North = [[Laingsburg, Michigan|Laingsburg]]\n}}\n{{Cities of Ingham County, Michigan}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Ingham County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Census-designated places in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Lansing\u2013East Lansing metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Michigan]]\n[[Category:Census-designated places in Ingham County, Michigan]]\n", "name_user": "Notorious4life", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haslett,_Michigan"}

This movement shared its roots in the ongoing Tamil [[Bhakti movement]], particularly the Shaiva [[Nayanars]] traditions, over the 7th- to 11th-century. However, Basava championed devotional worship that rejected temple worship and rituals led by Brahmins and replaced it with personalized direct worship of Shiva through practices such as individually worn icons and symbols like a small [[linga]].

[[Rudraksha]] beads (shown above) and ''Vibhuti'' (sacred ash on forehead) are other reminders of one's principles of faith.<ref name=olson244/>]]\nBasava advocated that every human being was equal, irrespective of caste and that all forms of manual labor was equally important.<ref name=mnsrinivas/> Michael states that it wasn't birth but behavior that determined a true saint and Shaiva bhakta in the view of Basava and ''Sharanas'' community.<ref name=blake7/> This, writes Michael, was also the position of south Indian man,  that it was \"behavior, not birth\" that determines the true man.<ref name=\"blake7\">R Blake Michael (1992), The Origins of V\u012bra\u015baiva Sects, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807761}}, pages 7\u20139</ref> One difference between the two was that Sharanas welcomed anyone, whatever occupation he or she might have been born in, to convert and be reborn into the larger family of Shiva devotees and then adopt any occupation he or she wanted.<ref name=blake7/>\n\n===Synthesis of diverse Hindu traditions===\nBasavanna is credited with uniting diverse spiritual trends during his era. Jan Peter Schouten states that ''Virashaivism'', the movement championed by Basava, tends towards monotheism with Shiva as the godhead, but with a strong awareness of the unity of the [[Brahman|Ultimate Reality]].<ref name=\"janviramon\">Jan Peter Schouten (1995), Revolution of the Mystics: On the Social Aspects of V\u012bra\u015baivism, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812383}}, pages 9\u201310</ref> Schouten calls this as a synthesis of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Shankara's Advaita traditions, naming it ''Shakti-Vishishtadvaita'', that is monism fused with Shakti beliefs.<ref name=janviramon/> An individual's spiritual progress is viewed by Basava's tradition as a six-stage ''Satsthalasiddhanta'', which progressively evolves the individual through phase of the devotee, to phase of the master, then phase of the receiver of grace, thereafter Linga in life-breath (god dwells in his or her soul), the phase of surrender (awareness of no distinction in god and soul, self), to the last stage of complete union of soul and god (liberation, [[moksha|mukti]]).<ref name=janviramon/> Basava's approach is different than [[Adi Shankara]], states Schouten, in that Basava emphasizes the path of devotion, compared to Shankara's emphasis on the path of knowledge \u2013 a system of monistic [[Advaita]] philosophy widely discussed in Karnataka in the time of Basava.<ref>Jan Peter Schouten (1995), Revolution of the Mystics: On the Social Aspects of V\u012bra\u015baivism, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812383}}, pages 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nJessica Frazier et al. state that Basava laid the foundations of a movement that united \"Vedic with Tantric practice, and Advaitic [[monism]] with effusive [[Bhakti movement|Bhakti devotionalism]].\"<ref>Jessica Frazier et al (2014), The Bloomsbury Companion to Hindu Studies, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-1472511515}}, page 281</ref>\n\n===Icons and symbols===\n[[File:Bronze bust of Basaveswara on Albert Embankment in London, facing Parliament.JPG|thumb|The bust of Basaveswara, unveiled in [[London]] in 2015, facing the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] ]]\nBasava advocated the wearing of ''Ishtalinga'', a necklace with [[pendant]] that contains a small Shiva linga.<ref name=\"mnsrinivas\">MN Srinivas (1980), The Remembered Village, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520039483}}, pages 307\u2013308</ref> He was driven by his realization; in one of his Vachanas he says ''Arive Guru'', which means one's own awareness is his/her teacher.

It is a coming of age story of a ten-year-old boy sent to the house of his maternal grandparents, which is full of eccentric characters. The boy has to deal with the realization of his sexual identity. The title makes reference to the analogy of a lame pigeon with homosexuality.<ref name=\"Benavent 440\"/> The film is an exploration of class and sexual identity in [[Andalusia]], Spain, in the 1950s.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1958, Felipe, a ten-year-old boy, is sent by his mother to spend the summer with his maternal relatives in [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]] while he recuperates his frail health. His grandparents are wealthy and live in a vast residence that serves as the center that reunites a large family and many visitors. The house is dominated by the frequent howls of the boy's ancient great-grandmother, who is senile and is taken care by Adoraci\u00f3n, a strict nurse, who endures the old woman's endlessly repeated recollection of the four bandoleros who killed each other for her love.\n\nPampered on his arrival by the women in the house, Felipe is ordered to stay in bed by the family's doctor. He is installed in the bedroom of his absent uncle Ram\u00f3n and spends his time reading [[Little Women]]. Felipe quickly strikes a close friendship with Mari, the talkative and meddlesome maid. She keeps four lovers on a string, but refuses to let go of her virginity. An expert on men's matters, Mari shamelessly flirts with the boy even when she has the impression that he might be gay. In secrecy, she shows Felipe some items that she has found in uncle Ram\u00f3n's bedroom: a suggesting photograph of Ram\u00f3n in swimming wear revealing his anatomy and a postcard from 1936 signed by someone named Federico that depicts a dog looking at a dove with what Mari describes a lovesick face. The message in the postcard and its image imply that there was a homoerotic relationship between Ram\u00f3n and Federico. Felipe points out that the picture was taken in the terrace of the bedroom and both Mari and the boy are fascinated by Ram\u00f3n's revealing attire in the photograph.\n\nFelipe also befriends Uncle Ricardo, the eccentric brother of the boy's grandfather, who trains pigeons and dreams of finding a treasure at sea with his boat. Felipe tells him of Mari's believe that lame doves are queers and then inquires his great uncle if he might be queer. Although Ricardo denies it, he does not do so when the boy ask the same question regarding uncle Ram\u00f3n, evasively responding that he does not longer remembers.\n\nPeace in the house is frequently disturbed by many visitors like Reglita, a mature spinster, and there is general commotion with the arrival of Felipe's cosmopolitan Aunt Victoria, a singer who sweeps into town with Luigi, her muscle-bound Italian \"secretary\" in tow.  A liberal free thinker who has travelled Europe extensively, Victoria scandalizes Felipe's conservative grandmother with her recitation of erotic and anti-Franco poetry that makes the neighbors blushed but fascinates Reglita.  With her free way of living and her expertise on men, Victoria draws the attention of Mari who asks her about her lovers and Victoria shows her a valuable ring that one of them gave her.\n\nThe uncertainty of Felipe's blossoming sexuality is subjected to further confusion with the surprising arrival of the charismatic Communist uncle Ram\u00f3n, who takes back possession of his bedroom. Both Felipe and Mari are fascinated by him. Felipe asks Ram\u00f3n which tastes better, a man, a lady, or a young gal? to which the worldly Uncle Ram\u00f3n responds, Ladies and young gal taste great, and I once met a man who tasted like Manchego cheese. Felipe immediately identifies this man as Federico. The boy then compliments his uncle on having gorgeous eyes.\n\nThere is new commotion in the house with the elopement of Luigi with one of Mari's lovers, stealing Victoria's valuable ring, and with the death of Felipe's senile great grandmother. Mari tells Felipe that he can spy from his bedroom uncle Ram\u00f3n naked at night, but instead she shows up dancing naked by his window and with Victoria's ring in her hand. The next day Felipe accuses Mari of having stealing the ring and she is fired by the grandfather after Felipe reveals where she hides the ring. Felipe goes to Mari's room before her departure to reconcile. To Felipe's sadness uncle Ram\u00f3n has left as sudden as he arrived. Victoria, Felipe and Uncle Ricardo set out to sea on a treasure seeking adventure.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Mar\u00eda Barranco]] as Mari\n*[[Francisco Rabal]] as uncle Ricardo\n*[[Carmen Maura]]  as aunt Victoria\n*[[Miguel \u00c1ngel Mu\u00f1oz]] as Felipe\n*Joaquin Kremel as uncle Ram\u00f3n\n*[[Ana Torrent]]  as Adoraci\u00f3n, the nurse\n*[[Maria Galiana]] as the grandmother\n*[[Amparo Bar\u00f3]]  as Reglita\n*Tom\u00e1s Zori as the Great-grand mother\n*Valeriano Andres as the Grandfather\n*Maria Massip as aunt Blanca\n*Asunci\u00f3n Balaguer as  Tata Caridad\n*Ofelia Angelica as Esther\n*Paolo Stella as Luigi\n}}\n\n==Production==\nEl Palomo cojo, [[Jaime de Armi\u00f1\u00e1n]]'s fourteenth feature film, is based on the semiautobiographical novel of the same title written by Eduardo Mendicutti published in 1991.<ref name=\"Benavent 440\"/>  The film was shot in Mendicutti's hometown of [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]] and many of the interiors were filmed in the house that belonged to the author's grandparents.<ref name = \"Deveny 272\">Deveny, ''Contemporary Spanish Film from Fiction'', p. 272</ref>\n\nThe film is a period piece set in the 1950s, portraying the region of Andalucia at that time.<ref name = \"Benavent 441\">Benavent, ''Cine Espa\u00f1ol de los Noventa'', p. 441</ref>  The grandfather asks if President Eisenhower is going to visit Spain.<ref name=\"Deveny 272\"/>  Mendicutti commented that \"Armi\u00f1\u00e1n changed things in the screen version, since my novel is narrated in the first person and is based more on sensations than on actions\".<ref name = \"Deveny 275\">Deveny, ''Contemporary Spanish Film from Fiction'', p. 275</ref> The film is notable for its large cast of some of Spain's best regarded actors.

He also played for [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]] (two spells) and [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in Scotland, and for [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and in England. He finished his career in the [[Highland Football League|Highland League]].\n\nHarper played for the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]] four times, scoring twice. \n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Greenock]], Harper started his professional career with home-town club [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]], and returned to the club after a brief, unhappy spell with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. He had at times a difficult relationship with some Morton supporters, but most fans recognised his ability and enthusiasm. He played for Morton against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|Fairs Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/18003290.ton-legend-joe-harpertakes-place-among-football-greats-scottish-football-hall-fame/ | title=Ex Morton man Joe Harper enters Scottish Football Hall of Fame | publisher=[[Greenock Telegraph]] | date=1 November 2019 | accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref> Harper scored 74 goals in 122 appearances for Morton across both spells.

He rapidly developed a reputation as a prodigious goalscorer and following a record-breaking haul of 33 goals in 34 league games in the [[1971-72 in Scottish football|1971\u201372 season]] was the subject of much interest from English scouts.\n\n[[Everton F.C.|Everton]] paid \u00a3180,000 for his services in December 1972 but his time in English football was not as productive as his Aberdeen spell and he returned to Scotland with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in early 1974, for the second time signed by Eddie Turnbull who had by this stage moved to [[Easter Road]]. Overweight and unfit when he arrived at Hibs, Harper struggled to rediscover his Aberdeen-era form in [[Edinburgh]]. He scored a hat-trick in the [[1974 Scottish League Cup Final]], but [[Dixie Deans]] also scored a hat-trick as Celtic defeated Hibs 6\u20133.<ref name=elite>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/the-elite-players-who-scored-cup-final-hat-tricks-1-3589574|title=The elite players who scored cup final hat-tricks|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref> Harper was never a favourite with the Hibs fans, and his arrival signalled the beginning of the decline of the team's fortunes through the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\nHarper returned to Aberdeen under [[Ally MacLeod]] for the start of the [[1976-77 in Scottish football|1976\u201377 season]] in a \u00a350,000 deal and inspired instant success, the ''Dons'' defeating Celtic 2\u20131 (after [[extra time]]) to win the League Cup in November. Harper made further final appearances in each of the next two seasons, as Aberdeen lost both the [[1977-78 in Scottish football|1977\u201378]] Scottish Cup final and the [[1978-79 in Scottish football|1978\u201379]] League Cup final to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], by a scoreline of 2\u20131 on each occasion. By the [[1979-80 in Scottish football|1979\u201380 season]] he was considered a veteran and no longer a regular in the ''Dons'' first team but his seven goals helped [[Alex Ferguson]] become the second Scottish League-winning Aberdeen manager after [[Dave Halliday]] in [[1954-55 in Scottish football|1954\u201355]].<ref name=dh>[http://qosfc.com/legend-1048 \"Dave Halliday\" qosfc.com]</ref> Harper left Pittodrie after only one appearance the following season.\n\nIn total Harper scored 205 competitive goals for Aberdeen, a club record. Of that total, 122 were scored in league fixtures, 70 in domestic cup games (including 6 in the pre-season [[Drybrough Cup]], not counted in some totals) and 7 in European competition. His iconic status amongst Aberdeen supporters was recognised when he was amongst the first players to be inducted to the club's \"Hall of Fame\". Joe's notoriety with Aberdeen fans also earned him the title 'King of the Beach End' (traditional home end at Pittodrie).\n\n==International career==\nHarper first played for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in October 1972, scoring on his debut in a 4\u20131 win.<ref name = \"ordinary\">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/joe-harper-interview-no-ordinary-joe-1-1301602 |title=Joe Harper interview: No ordinary Joe |work=The Scotsman |publisher= |date=22 November 2008 |accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref> He played in Scotland's next game but then fell out of the international reckoning, only earning a recall in 1975. By coincidence, the occasion was another away match with Denmark, but this was overshadowed by a controversial off-field incident. Harper and several teammates were given lifetime bans by the [[Scottish Football Association]] after it was alleged that they had been involved in a nightclub incident where a light was broken and an altercation followed.<ref name = \"copenhagen\">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/7977173.stm |title=Scotland's hall of shame |work=BBC Sport |publisher= BBC |date=1 April 2009 |accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref> Harper later said that he had been punished because he had returned to the team base in the same taxi as the other players.<ref name = \"copenhagen\"/> The ban on two of the players, Harper and [[Arthur Graham]], was lifted a year later.<ref name = \"copenhagen\"/> Harper was selected in the Scotland squad for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. He appeared in the 1\u20131 draw against [[Iran national football team|Iran]], which was also his last international appearance, as Scotland exited in the first round.<ref name = \"ordinary\"/>\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1981 Harper was appointed manager of then [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] side [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]]. He helped the ''Blue Toon'' to a second place league finish but his reported wages were beyond the club's means and he was replaced for the 1982\u201383 season by former Pittodrie teammate Dave Smith.<ref>[http://www.peterheadfc.org.uk/history/part6.shtml Peterhead Club History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808185804/http://www.peterheadfc.org.uk/history/part6.shtml |date=8 August 2007 }}, Official [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]] website.</ref> Harper later managed [[Huntly F.C.|Huntly]], where he was succeeded by [[Steve Paterson]] in October 1990.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/dec/11/newsstory.sport6 |title=Who is Steve Paterson? |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=11 December 2002 |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nHarper has also been a columnist for the ''[[Evening Express (Scotland)|Aberdeen Evening Express]]''.

He also played for [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]] (two spells) and [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in Scotland, and for [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] and in England. He finished his career in the [[Highland Football League|Highland League]].\n\nHarper played for the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland national team]] four times, scoring twice. \n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Greenock]], Harper started his professional career with home-town club [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Morton]], and returned to the club after a brief, unhappy spell with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. He had at times a difficult relationship with some Morton supporters, but most fans recognised his ability and enthusiasm. He played for Morton against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|Fairs Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/18003290.ton-legend-joe-harpertakes-place-among-football-greats-scottish-football-hall-fame/ | title=Ex Morton man Joe Harper enters Scottish Football Hall of Fame | publisher=[[Greenock Telegraph]] | date=1 November 2019 | accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref> Harper scored 74 goals in 122 appearances for Morton across both spells.

He rapidly developed a reputation as a prodigious goalscorer and following a record-breaking haul of 33 goals in 34 league games in the [[1971-72 in Scottish football|1971\u201372 season]] was the subject of much interest from English scouts.\n\n[[Everton F.C.|Everton]] paid \u00a3180,000 for his services in December 1972 but his time in English football was not as productive as his Aberdeen spell and he returned to Scotland with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in early 1974, for the second time signed by Eddie Turnbull who had by this stage moved to [[Easter Road]]. Overweight and unfit when he arrived at Hibs, Harper struggled to rediscover his Aberdeen-era form in [[Edinburgh]]. He scored a hat-trick in the [[1974 Scottish League Cup Final]], but [[Dixie Deans]] also scored a hat-trick as Celtic defeated Hibs 6\u20133.<ref name=elite>{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/the-elite-players-who-scored-cup-final-hat-tricks-1-3589574|title=The elite players who scored cup final hat-tricks|newspaper=The Scotsman|date=31 October 2014|accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref> Harper was never a favourite with the Hibs fans, and his arrival signalled the beginning of the decline of the team's fortunes through the late 1970s and 1980s.\n\nHarper returned to Aberdeen under [[Ally MacLeod]] for the start of the [[1976-77 in Scottish football|1976\u201377 season]] in a \u00a350,000 deal and inspired instant success, the ''Dons'' defeating Celtic 2\u20131 (after [[extra time]]) to win the League Cup in November. Harper made further final appearances in each of the next two seasons, as Aberdeen lost both the [[1977-78 in Scottish football|1977\u201378]] Scottish Cup final and the [[1978-79 in Scottish football|1978\u201379]] League Cup final to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], by a scoreline of 2\u20131 on each occasion. By the [[1979-80 in Scottish football|1979\u201380 season]] he was considered a veteran and no longer a regular in the ''Dons'' first team but his seven goals helped [[Alex Ferguson]] become the second Scottish League-winning Aberdeen manager after [[Dave Halliday]] in [[1954-55 in Scottish football|1954\u201355]].<ref name=dh>[http://qosfc.com/legend-1048 \"Dave Halliday\" qosfc.com]</ref> Harper left Pittodrie after only one appearance the following season.\n\nIn total Harper scored 205 competitive goals for Aberdeen, a club record. Of that total, 122 were scored in league fixtures, 70 in domestic cup games (including 6 in the pre-season [[Drybrough Cup]], not counted in some totals) and 7 in European competition. His iconic status amongst Aberdeen supporters was recognised when he was amongst the first players to be inducted to the club's \"Hall of Fame\". Joe's notoriety with Aberdeen fans also earned him the title 'King of the Beach End' (traditional home end at Pittodrie).\n\n==International career==\nHarper first played for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in October 1972, scoring on his debut in a 4\u20131 win.<ref name = \"ordinary\">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/joe-harper-interview-no-ordinary-joe-1-1301602 |title=Joe Harper interview: No ordinary Joe |work=The Scotsman |publisher= |date=22 November 2008 |accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref> He played in Scotland's next game but then fell out of the international reckoning, only earning a recall in 1975. By coincidence, the occasion was another away match with Denmark, but this was overshadowed by a controversial off-field incident.

Thanks. --> Canada, at 4:10&nbsp;a.m. on April 29, 1903. Around {{convert|110|e6t|e6ST|abbr=none}} of [[limestone]] rock slid down [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]].<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\" /> Witnesses reported that within 100 seconds the rock reached up the opposing hills, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.

Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.  The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below {{convert|\u221218|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson96\" />\n\nThough the GSC concluded that mining activities contributed to the slide, the facility's owners disagreed. Their engineers claimed that the mine bore no responsibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=38}}</ref>  Later studies suggested that the mountain had been at a point of \"equilibrium\"; even a small deformation such as that caused by the mine's existence would have helped trigger a slide.<ref>{{harvnb|Benko|Stead|1998|p=311}}</ref> The mine was quickly re-opened, even though rock continued to tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" /> Coal production at Frank peaked in 1910,<ref name=\"Kerr36\">{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=36}}</ref> but the mine was permanently closed in 1917 after it became unprofitable.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" />\n\nThe slide created two new peaks on the mountain; the south peak stands {{convert|2200|m|ft}} high and the north peak {{convert|2100|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\">{{citation |url=https://frankslide.ca/sites/frankslide/files/editor_files/Frank_Slide_Facts%20(1).pdf |title=Frank Slide facts |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=2019-04-29}}</ref> Geologists believe that another slide is inevitable, though not imminent.

It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.  The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Anderson56\" /> By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600,<ref name=\"EpochTimes109\">{{citation |last=Reichel |first=Justina |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/frank-slide-remembered-227569.html |title=Frank Slide remembered |work=The Epoch Times |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=57}}</ref>\n\nTurtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank.

Three had been outside the mine and were killed by the slide.<ref name=\"Kerr12\">{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=12}}</ref>  The remaining 17 were underground.

Encouraged by their success, the miners cut a new shaft that broke through under an outcropping of rock that protected them from falling debris.  Thirteen hours after they were buried, all 17 men emerged from the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson86\" />\n\nThe miners found that the row of cottages that served as their homes had been devastated and some of their families killed, seemingly at random.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" /> One found his family alive and safe in a makeshift hospital, but another emerged to discover his wife and four children had died.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=88}}</ref> Fifteen-year-old Lillian Clark, working a late shift that night in the town's boarding house, had been given permission to stay overnight for the first time.<ref name=\"Anderson63\" /> She was the only member of her family to survive.

A. G. Haultain|Frederick Haultain]] arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain.  Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide.  Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=91}}</ref> and the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further.  They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=33}}</ref>  As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned.<ref name=\"Anderson93\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=93}}</ref>  The [[North-West Mounted Police]], reinforced by officers who arrived from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Macleod]] and [[Calgary]], kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of [[looting]] occurred during the evacuation.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=92}}</ref>\n\nClearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=30}}</ref> Approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line.<ref name=\"FSICFAQ\" />  The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks.<ref name=\"CBCArchives\" /> Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30.

A prism connected to cables monitors the mountain for movement.]]\nAn unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, was also a factor. Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.  The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below {{convert|\u221218|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson96\" />\n\nThough the GSC concluded that mining activities contributed to the slide, the facility's owners disagreed. Their engineers claimed that the mine bore no responsibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=38}}</ref>  Later studies suggested that the mountain had been at a point of \"equilibrium\"; even a small deformation such as that caused by the mine's existence would have helped trigger a slide.<ref>{{harvnb|Benko|Stead|1998|p=311}}</ref> The mine was quickly re-opened, even though rock continued to tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" /> Coal production at Frank peaked in 1910,<ref name=\"Kerr36\">{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=36}}</ref> but the mine was permanently closed in 1917 after it became unprofitable.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" />\n\nThe slide created two new peaks on the mountain; the south peak stands {{convert|2200|m|ft}} high and the north peak {{convert|2100|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\">{{citation |url=https://frankslide.ca/sites/frankslide/files/editor_files/Frank_Slide_Facts%20(1).pdf |title=Frank Slide facts |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=2019-04-29}}</ref> Geologists believe that another slide is inevitable, though not imminent.
