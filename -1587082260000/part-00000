It was designed so it could cross churned-up countryside and trenches. A single prototype was built, and followed by an improved model (the [[TOG 2]]), but interest faded with the successful performance of another cross-country design, the [[Churchill tank]], and the mobile war that was being fought.\n\n==History==\nIn July 1939, the Special Vehicle Development Committee was drawn up for future tank designs suitable for [[Great War]] conditions under Sir [[Albert Gerald Stern]]; who had been on the original [[Landship Committee]] and head of the Tank Supply Depot during [[World War I]]. The committee included others who had been instrumental in the development of the tank during the Great War: former [[Director of Naval Construction]], Sir [[Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt]], General (retired) Sir [[Ernest Dunlop Swinton|Ernest Swinton]], engine designer [[Harry Ricardo]], the gearbox and transmission expert Major [[Walter Gordon Wilson]]. Unsurprisingly they got the nickname \"The Old Gang\" and the initials TOG were applied to their designs.\n\nTogether, they proposed the development of a ''heavy tank'' design, which they entrusted to another of the first tank's developers and builder of the first tank, Sir [[William Tritton]] of [[William Foster & Co Ltd|Foster's of Lincoln]].\n\nTheir specification was comprehensive. As well as being able to operate across ground broken up by shelling and waterlogged, it was expected to resist 47-mm anti-tank guns and 105-mm field guns or howitzers at {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Main armament would be a field gun mounted in the front - effective against {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}} thick reinforced concrete - and two 2-pounder guns, the latter in sponsons. For use against infantry, there would be [[Besa machine gun]]s covering \"all arcs\" - one firing forward, one in each [[sponson]], and one firing to the rear. To provide cover four 2-inch smoke mortars were included.<ref name=CandE78/><ref>White, p66</ref>\n\nDesign work by Fosters began in December 1939 producing a wooden mock-up. Designed with trench crossing abilities to the fore and the capability to carry infantry as well, the design as built was a large hull with side doors supported on broad tracks, with a 2-pdr gun armed [[Matilda II]] infantry tank turret. The front plate of the hull carried the 75&nbsp;mm gun and mounting as used on the French [[Char B1]] tank.<ref>Chamberlain and Ellis p78</ref>\n\nIt was realised that running the track drive over the top of the hull was not necessary and work began on a follow-up design in June 1940. The prototype TOG I was delivered in October 1940. Due to the weight, electrical drive was used - the engine driving two generators connected to an electrical motor for each track. The steering wheel was connected to a [[potentiometer]] that varied the voltage to the track motors. This strained the drive and track. Due to these problems, it was converted to a [[hydraulic]] drive designed by Fluidrive Engineering, a process that took until May 1943 after which it was called TOG 1A. The fluid drive was not satisfactory either.<ref name=CandE78/> The prototype was sent to [[Chobham Common|Chobham]] and then seems to have disappeared into history.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*White BT, ''British Tanks 1915-1945'' Ian Allan Publishing, London\n* {{Book-Fletcher-Great Tank Scandal}}\n*Chamberlain, P; Ellis, C ''British and American Tanks of World War II'' 1969.

[[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24\u201336 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy.

The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the [[Endometrium|endometrial lining]] of the uterus.  Both cycles can be divided into three phases.  The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.<ref name=Silverthorn />\n\n=== Ovarian cycle ===\n\n==== Follicular phase ====\n{{main|Follicular phase}}\nThe follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg.<ref name=Silverthorn /> The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.\n\nThrough the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> These follicles, which were present at birth<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n==== Ovulation ====\n{{main|Ovulation}}\n[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg]]\n\nOvulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct.<ref>[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center.

During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>\n\nThe loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.  Most [[pregnancy test]]s look for the presence of hCG.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n=== Uterine cycle ===\nThe uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative, secretory.<ref>{{cite book | title =Textbook of Medical Physiology | chapter = Chapter 81 Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones |pages =  1018ff  | edition = 11th |editor=Guyton AC |editor2=Hall JE |publisher = Elsevier Saunders | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780721602400}}</ref>\n\n==== Menstruation ====\n{{main|Menstruation}}\nMenstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses, catamenia or a period) is the first phase of the uterine cycle.

[[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24\u201336 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation.

The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the [[Endometrium|endometrial lining]] of the uterus.  Both cycles can be divided into three phases.  The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.<ref name=Silverthorn />\n\n=== Ovarian cycle ===\n\n==== Follicular phase ====\n{{main|Follicular phase}}\nThe follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg.<ref name=Silverthorn /> The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.\n\nThrough the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> These follicles, which were present at birth<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n==== Ovulation ====\n{{main|Ovulation}}\n[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg]]\n\nOvulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct.<ref>[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center.

When the egg has nearly matured, levels of [[estradiol]] reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day&nbsp;12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnology.com/ovulate/16/2/10/1/15/2013|title=Ovulation Calendar|publisher=Pregnology}}</ref>\n\nThe exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood.<ref name=Lentz>{{vcite book |last=Lentz | first=Gretchen M |last2=Lobo | first2=Rogerio A. |last3=Gershenson | first3=David M |last4=Katz | first4=Vern L. |title=Comprehensive gynecology.|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-06986-1|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195&isbn=978-0-323-06986-1&sid=1291988935&uniqId=327920693-3#4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195|accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> In animals, a [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) surge has been shown to precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion.<ref name=Lentz /> This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: [[estrogen receptor alpha]], which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and [[estrogen receptor beta]], which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu L, Gustofson RL, Feng H, Leung PK, Mores N, Krsmanovic LZ, Catt KJ | title = Converse regulatory functions of estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta subtypes expressed in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons | journal = Mol.

During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>\n\nThe loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.  Most [[pregnancy test]]s look for the presence of hCG.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n=== Uterine cycle ===\nThe uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative, secretory.<ref>{{cite book | title =Textbook of Medical Physiology | chapter = Chapter 81 Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones |pages =  1018ff  | edition = 11th |editor=Guyton AC |editor2=Hall JE |publisher = Elsevier Saunders | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780721602400}}</ref>\n\n==== Menstruation ====\n{{main|Menstruation}}\nMenstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses, catamenia or a period) is the first phase of the uterine cycle.

The following [[HTML]]-fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in [[RDFa]]-syntax using a [[schema.org]] vocabulary and a [[Wikidata]] ID:\n[[File:RDF example.svg|framed|{{anchor|graph1}}Graph resulting from the RDFa example]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<div vocab=\"http://schema.org/\" typeof=\"Person\">\n  <span property=\"name\">Paul Schuster</span> was born in\n  <span property=\"birthPlace\" typeof=\"Place\" href=\"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\">\n    <span property=\"name\">Dresden</span>.\n  </span>\n</div>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe example defines the following five [[Semantic triple|triples]] (shown in [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] Syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the ''subject'') is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the ''predicate'') the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the ''object'') either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n _:a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Person> .\n _:a <http://schema.org/name> \"Paul Schuster\" .\n _:a <http://schema.org/birthPlace> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731> .\n <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731> <http://schema.org/itemtype> <http://schema.org/Place> .\n <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731> <http://schema.org/name> \"Dresden\" .\n</div>\n\nThe triples result in the graph shown in [[#graph1|the given figure]].\n\n[[File:RDF example extended.svg|framed|Graph resulting from the RDFa example, enriched with further data from the Web]]\n\nOne of the advantages of using [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)]] is that they can be dereferenced using the [[HTTP]] protocol. According to the so-called [[Linked Open Data]] principles, such a dereferenced URI should result in a document that offers further data about the given URI. In this example, all URIs, both for edges and nodes (e.g. <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/Person</nowiki></tt>, <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/birthPlace</nowiki></tt>, <tt><nowiki>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731</nowiki></tt>) can be dereferenced and will result in further RDF graphs, describing the URI, e.g. that Dresden is a city in Germany, or that a person, in the sense of that URI, can be fictional.\n\nThe second graph shows the previous example, but now enriched with a few of the triples from the documents that result from dereferencing <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/Person</nowiki></tt> (green edge) and <tt><nowiki>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731</nowiki></tt> (blue edges).\n\nAdditionally to the edges given in the involved documents explicitly, edges can be automatically [[Inference|inferred]]: the triple\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n _:a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Person> .\n</div>\n\nfrom the original RDFa fragment and the triple\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n <http://schema.org/Person> <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#equivalentClass> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .\n</div>\n\nfrom the document at <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/Person</nowiki></tt> (green edge in the Figure) allow to infer the following triple, given [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] semantics (red dashed line in the second Figure):\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n _:a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .\n</div>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Semantic network#History}}\nThe concept of the [[semantic network]] model was formed in the early 1960s by researchers such as the cognitive scientist [[Allan M. Collins]], linguist M. Ross Quillian and psychologist [[Elizabeth F. Loftus]] as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge. When applied in the context of the modern internet, it extends the network of [[hyperlink]]ed human-readable [[web pages]] by inserting machine-readable [[metadata]] about pages and how they are related to each other.  This enables automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform more tasks on behalf of users. The term \"Semantic Web\" was coined by [[Tim Berners-Lee]],<ref name=\"Berners-Lee\"/> the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (\"[[W3C]]\"), which oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards. He defines the Semantic Web as \"a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines\".\n\nMany of the technologies proposed by the W3C already existed before they were positioned under the W3C umbrella. These are used in various contexts, particularly those dealing with information that encompasses a limited and defined domain, and where sharing data is a common necessity, such as scientific research or data exchange among businesses. In addition, other technologies with similar goals have emerged, such as [[microformat]]s.\n\n=== Limitations of HTML ===\nMany files on a typical computer can also be loosely divided into human-readable [[document]]s and machine-readable [[data]]. Documents like mail messages, reports, and brochures are read by humans. Data, such as calendars, addressbooks, playlists, and spreadsheets are presented using an application program that lets them be viewed, searched and combined.\n\nCurrently, the World Wide Web is based mainly on documents written in [[Hypertext Markup Language]] ([[HTML]]), a markup convention that is used for coding a body of text interspersed with multimedia objects such as images and interactive forms. Metadata tags provide a method by which computers can categorize the content of web pages. In the examples below, the field names \"keywords\", \"description\" and \"author\" are assigned values such as \"computing\", and \"cheap widgets for sale\" and \"John Doe\".\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"computing, computer studies, computer\" />\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Cheap widgets for sale\" />\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"John Doe\" />\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nBecause of this metadata tagging and categorization, other computer systems that want to access and share this data can easily identify the relevant values.\n\nWith HTML and a tool to render it (perhaps [[web browser]] software, perhaps another [[user agent]]), one can create and present a page that lists items for sale. The HTML of this catalog page can make simple, document-level assertions such as \"this document's title is 'Widget Superstore{{'\"}}, but there is no capability within the HTML itself to assert unambiguously that, for example, item number X586172 is an Acme Gizmo with a retail price of \u20ac199, or that it is a consumer product. Rather, HTML can only say that the span of text \"X586172\" is something that should be positioned near \"Acme Gizmo\" and \"\u20ac199\", etc. There is no way to say \"this is a catalog\" or even to establish that \"Acme Gizmo\" is a kind of title or that \"\u20ac199\" is a price. There is also no way to express that these pieces of information are bound together in describing a discrete item, distinct from other items perhaps listed on the page.\n\n[[Semantic HTML]] refers to the traditional HTML practice of markup following intention, rather than specifying layout details directly. For example, the use of {{tag|em|o}} denoting \"emphasis\" rather than {{tag|i|o}}, which specifies [[italics]]. Layout details are left up to the browser, in combination with [[Cascading Style Sheets]]. But this practice falls short of specifying the semantics of objects such as items for sale or prices.\n\n[[Microformat]]s extend HTML syntax to create [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] semantic markup about objects including people, organisations, events and products.<ref>{{cite book |last=Allsopp |first=John |title=Microformats: Empowering Your Markup for Web 2.0 |date=March 2007 |publisher=[[Apress|Friends of ED]] |isbn=978-1-59059-814-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781590598146/page/368 368] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781590598146/page/368 }}</ref> Similar initiatives include [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]] and [[Schema.org]].\n\n=== Semantic Web solutions ===\nThe Semantic Web takes the solution further. It involves publishing in languages specifically designed for data: [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), and Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]). HTML describes documents and the links between them. RDF, OWL, and XML, by contrast, can describe arbitrary things such as people, meetings, or airplane parts.\n\nThese technologies are combined in order to provide descriptions that supplement or replace the content of Web documents. Thus, content may manifest itself as descriptive data stored in Web-accessible [[database]]s,<ref>Artem Chebotko and Shiyong Lu, \"Querying the Semantic Web: An Efficient Approach Using Relational Databases\", [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]], {{ISBN|978-3-8383-0264-5}}, 2009.</ref> or as markup within documents (particularly, in Extensible HTML ([[XHTML]]) interspersed with XML, or, more often, purely in XML, with layout or rendering cues stored separately). The machine-readable descriptions enable content managers to add meaning to the content, i.e., to describe the structure of the knowledge we have about that content. In this way, a machine can process knowledge itself, instead of text, using processes similar to human [[deductive reasoning]] and [[inference]], thereby obtaining more meaningful results and helping computers to perform automated information gathering and research.\n\nAn example of a tag that would be used in a non-semantic web page:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"xml\">\n<item>blog</item>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nEncoding similar information in a semantic web page might look like this:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"xml\">\n<item rdf:about=\"http://example.org/semantic-web/\">Semantic Web</item>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nTim Berners-Lee calls the resulting network of [[Linked Data]] the [[Giant Global Graph]], in contrast to the HTML-based [[World Wide Web]]. Berners-Lee posits that if the past was document sharing, the future is [[data sharing]]. His answer to the question of \"how\" provides three points of instruction.

[[Automated reasoning system]]s will have to deal with all of these issues in order to deliver on the promise of the Semantic Web.\n* Vastness: The World Wide Web contains many billions of pages. The [[SNOMED CT]] medical terminology [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] alone contains 370,000 class names, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms. Any automated reasoning system will have to deal with truly huge inputs.\n* Vagueness: These are imprecise concepts like \"young\" or \"tall\". This arises from the vagueness of user queries, of concepts represented by content providers, of matching query terms to provider terms and of trying to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts. [[Fuzzy logic]] is the most common technique for dealing with vagueness.\n* Uncertainty: These are precise concepts with uncertain values. For example, a patient might present a set of symptoms that correspond to a number of different distinct diagnoses each with a different probability. [[Probabilistic logic|Probabilistic]] reasoning techniques are generally employed to address uncertainty.\n* Inconsistency: These are logical contradictions that will inevitably arise during the development of large ontologies, and when ontologies from separate sources are combined. [[Deductive reasoning]] fails catastrophically when faced with inconsistency, because [[Principle of explosion|\"anything follows from a contradiction\"]]. [[Defeasible reasoning]] and [[Paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent reasoning]] are two techniques that can be employed to deal with inconsistency.\n* Deceit: This is when the producer of the information is intentionally misleading the consumer of the information. [[Cryptography]] techniques are currently utilized to alleviate this threat. By providing a means to determine the information's integrity, including that which relates to the identity of the entity that produced or published the information, however [[credibility]] issues still have to be addressed in cases of potential deceit.\n\nThis list of challenges is illustrative rather than exhaustive, and it focuses on the challenges to the \"unifying logic\" and \"proof\" layers of the Semantic Web. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) Incubator Group for Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web (URW3-XG) final report lumps these problems together under the single heading of \"uncertainty\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/urw3/XGR-urw3-20080331/Overview.html|title=Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web|website=W3.org|accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref> Many of the techniques mentioned here will require extensions to the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for example to annotate conditional probabilities.

These technologies are specified as W3C standards and include:\n* [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a general method for describing information\n* [[RDF Schema]] (RDFS)\n* [[Simple Knowledge Organization System]] (SKOS)\n* [[SPARQL]], an RDF query language\n* [[Notation3]] (N3), designed with human-readability in mind\n* [[N-Triples]], a format for storing and transmitting data\n* [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] (Terse RDF Triple Language)\n* [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), a family of knowledge representation languages\n* [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF), a framework of web rule language dialects supporting rule interchange on the Web\n\n[[File:Semantic_web_stack.svg|frame |right |The [[Semantic Web Stack]].]]\n\nThe [[Semantic Web Stack]] illustrates the architecture of the Semantic Web. The functions and relationships of the components can be summarized as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/ |title=OWL Web Ontology Language Overview |date=February 10, 2004 |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>\n* XML provides an elemental syntax for content structure within documents, yet associates no semantics with the meaning of the content contained within. XML is not at present a necessary component of Semantic Web technologies in most cases, as alternative syntaxes exists, such as [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]]. Turtle is a de facto standard, but has not been through a formal standardization process.\n* [[W3C XML Schema|XML Schema]] is a language for providing and restricting the structure and content of elements contained within XML documents.\n* RDF is a simple language for expressing [[data model]]s, which refer to objects (\"[[web resource]]s\") and their relationships. An RDF-based model can be represented in a variety of syntaxes, e.g., RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, and RDFa. RDF is a fundamental standard of the Semantic Web.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/RDF/ | title=Resource Description Framework (RDF) | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | isbn=978-0-12-385965-5 | doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385965-5.10003-2 | author1=Allemang, D. | author2=Hendler, J.| chapter=RDF \u2013The basis of the Semantic Web | title = Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist | edition= 2nd | publisher=Morgan Kaufmann | year=2011}}</ref>\n* RDF Schema extends RDF and is a vocabulary for describing properties and classes of RDF-based resources, with semantics for generalized-hierarchies of such properties and classes.\n* OWL adds more vocabulary for describing properties and classes: among others, relations between classes (e.g. disjointness), cardinality (e.g. \"exactly one\"), equality, richer typing of properties, characteristics of properties (e.g. symmetry), and enumerated classes.\n* SPARQL is a protocol and query language for semantic web data sources.\n* RIF is the W3C Rule Interchange Format. It's an XML language for expressing Web rules that computers can execute. RIF provides multiple versions, called dialects. It includes a RIF Basic Logic Dialect (RIF-BLD) and RIF Production Rules Dialect (RIF PRD).\n\n=== Current state of standardization ===\nWell-established standards:\n* [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]\n* [[RDFS]]\n* [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF)\n* [[SPARQL]]\n* [[Unicode]]\n* [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]\n* [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL)\n* [[XML]]\n\nNot yet fully realized:\n* Unifying Logic and Proof layers\n* [[Semantic Web Rule Language]] (SWRL)\n\n==Applications==\nThe intent is to enhance the [[usability]] and usefulness of the Web and its interconnected [[resource (computer science)|resources]] by creating [[Semantic Web Services]], such as:\n* Servers that expose existing data systems using the RDF and SPARQL standards. Many converters to RDF exist from different applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/wiki/ConverterToRdf|title=ConverterToRdf - W3C Wiki|website=W3.org|accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref> [[Relational database]]s are an important source. The semantic web server attaches to the existing system without affecting its operation.\n* Documents \"marked up\" with semantic information (an [[Extensibility|extension]] of the HTML <tt>&lt;meta&gt;</tt> [[HTML element|tags]] used in today's Web pages to supply information for [[Web search engine]]s using [[web crawler]]s). This could be [[Artificial intelligence|machine-understandable]] information about the human-understandable content of the document (such as the creator, title, description, etc.) or it could be purely [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] representing a set of facts (such as resources and services elsewhere on the site). Note that ''anything'' that can be identified with a ''Uniform Resource Identifier'' (URI) can be described, so the semantic web can reason about animals, people, places, ideas, etc.  There are four semantic annotation formats that can be used in HTML documents; [[Microformat]], [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]] and [[JSON-LD]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web: From HTML5 Microdata to Linked Open Data|last = Sikos|first = Leslie F.|publisher = Apress|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4842-1049-9|location = |pages = 23}}</ref> Semantic markup is often generated automatically, rather than manually.\n* Common metadata vocabularies ([[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]]) and maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to mark up their documents so that agents can use the information in the supplied metadata (so that ''Author'' in the sense of 'the Author of the page' won't be confused with ''Author'' in the sense of a book that is the subject of a book review).\n* Automated agents to perform tasks for users of the semantic web using this data.\n* Web-based services (often with agents of their own) to supply information specifically to agents, for example, a [[Trust service]] that an agent could ask if some online store has a history of poor service or [[spamming]].\n\nSuch services could be useful to public search engines, or could be used for [[knowledge management]] within an organization.

Compared to the public Semantic Web there are lesser requirements on [[scalability]] and the information circulating within a company can be more trusted in general; privacy is less of an issue outside of handling of customer data.\n\n== Skeptical reactions ==\n=== Practical feasibility ===\nCritics question the basic feasibility of a complete or even partial fulfillment of the Semantic Web, pointing out both difficulties in setting it up and a lack of general-purpose usefulness that prevents the required effort from being invested. In a 2003 paper, Marshall and Shipman point out the cognitive overhead inherent in formalizing knowledge, compared to the authoring of traditional web [[hypertext]]:<ref name=\"which\">{{cite conference |title=Which semantic web? |last1=Marshall |first1=Catherine C. |last2=Shipman |first2=Frank M. |conference=Proc.

For example, understanding the class-instance relationship, or the superclass-subclass relationship, is more than understanding that one concept is a \u201ctype of\u201d another concept. [\u2026] These abstractions are taught to computer scientists generally and knowledge engineers specifically but do not match the similar natural language meaning of being a \"type of\" something. Effective use of such a formal representation requires the author to become a skilled knowledge engineer in addition to any other skills required by the domain. [\u2026] Once one has learned a formal representation language, it is still often much more effort to express ideas in that representation than in a less formal representation [\u2026]. Indeed, this is a form of programming based on the declaration of semantic data and requires an understanding of how reasoning algorithms will interpret the authored structures.}}\n\nAccording to Marshall and Shipman, the [[tacit knowledge|tacit]] and changing nature of much knowledge adds to the [[knowledge engineering]] problem, and limits the Semantic Web's applicability to specific domains. A further issue that they point out are domain- or organisation-specific ways to express knowledge, which must be solved through community agreement rather than only technical means.{{r|which}} As it turns out, specialized communities and organizations for intra-company projects have tended to adopt semantic web technologies greater than peripheral and less-specialized communities.<ref name=\"Herman000\">{{cite conference |url=http://www.w3.org/2007/Talks/0424-Stavanger-IH/Slides.pdf |title=State of the Semantic Web |accessdate=July 26, 2007 |author=Ivan Herman |year=2007 |conference=Semantic Days 2007}}</ref> The practical constraints toward adoption have appeared less challenging where domain and scope is more limited than that of the general public and the World-Wide Web.{{r|Herman000}}\n\nFinally, Marshall and Shipman see pragmatic problems in the idea of ([[Knowledge Navigator]]-style) intelligent agents working in the largely manually curated Semantic Web:{{r|which}}\n\n{{quote|In situations in which user needs are known and distributed information resources are well described, this approach can be highly effective; in situations that are not foreseen and that bring together an unanticipated array of information resources, the Google approach is more robust. Furthermore, the Semantic Web relies on inference chains that are more brittle; a missing element of the chain results in a failure to perform the desired action, while the human can supply missing pieces in a more Google-like approach. [\u2026] cost-benefit tradeoffs can work in favor of specially-created Semantic Web metadata directed at weaving together sensible well-structured domain-specific information resources; close attention to user/customer needs will drive these federations if they are to be successful.}}\n\n[[Cory Doctorow]]'s critique (\"[[metacrap]]\") is from the perspective of human behavior and personal preferences. For example, people may include spurious metadata into Web pages in an attempt to mislead Semantic Web engines that naively assume the metadata's veracity. This phenomenon was well known with metatags that fooled the [[Altavista]] ranking algorithm into elevating the ranking of certain Web pages: the Google indexing engine specifically looks for such attempts at manipulation. [[Peter G\u00e4rdenfors]] and [[Timo Honkela]] point out that logic-based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of the relevant phenomena related to semantics.<ref name=\"Gardenfors04\">{{Cite book\n | title=How to make the Semantic Web more semantic\n | first=Peter\n | last=G\u00e4rdenfors\n | pages=17\u201334\n | publisher=IOS Press\n | year=2004\n | work=Formal Ontology in Information Systems: proceedings of the third international conference (FOIS-2004)}}</ref><ref name=\"Honkela08\">{{cite journal\n | title=Simulating processes of concept formation and communication\n | year=2008\n | first1=Timo\n | last1=Honkela\n | first2=Ville\n | last2=K\u00f6n\u00f6nen\n | first3=Tiina\n | last3=Lindh-Knuutila\n | first4=Mari-Sanna\n | last4=Paukkeri\n | work=Journal of Economic Methodology}}</ref>\n\n=== Censorship and privacy ===\nEnthusiasm about the semantic web could be tempered by concerns regarding [[Internet censorship|censorship]] and [[privacy]]. For instance, [[Intelligent text analysis|text-analyzing]] techniques can now be easily bypassed by using other words, metaphors for instance, or by using images in place of words. An advanced implementation of the semantic web would make it much easier for governments to control the viewing and creation of online information, as this information would be much easier for an automated content-blocking machine to understand. In addition, the issue has also been raised that, with the use of [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] files and geolocation [[meta-data]], there would be very little anonymity associated with the authorship of articles on things such as a personal blog. Some of these concerns were addressed in the \"Policy Aware Web\" project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policyawareweb.org/ |title=Policy Aware Web Project |publisher=Policyawareweb.org |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> and is an active research and development topic.\n\n=== Doubling output formats ===\nAnother criticism of the semantic web is that it would be much more time-consuming to create and publish content because there would need to be two formats for one piece of data: one for human viewing and one for machines. However, many [[web application]]s in development are addressing this issue by creating a machine-readable format upon the publishing of data or the request of a machine for such data. The development of [[microformat]]s has been one reaction to this kind of criticism. Another argument in defense of the feasibility of semantic web is the likely falling price of human intelligence tasks in digital labor markets, such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon Mechanical Turk|Mechanical Turk]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSpecifications such as [[eRDF (data format)|eRDF]] and [[RDFa]] allow arbitrary RDF data to be embedded in HTML pages. The [[GRDDL]] (Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Language) mechanism allows existing material (including microformats) to be automatically interpreted as RDF, so publishers only need to use a single format, such as HTML.\n\n== Research activities on corporate applications ==\nThe first research group explicitly focusing on the Corporate Semantic Web was the ACACIA team at [[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique|INRIA-Sophia-Antipolis]], founded in 2002.

The following [[HTML]]-fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in [[RDFa]]-syntax using a [[schema.org]] vocabulary and a [[Wikidata]] ID:\n[[File:RDF example.svg|framed|{{anchor|graph1}}Graph resulting from the RDFa example]]\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\" enclose=\"div\">\n<div vocab=\"http://schema.org/\" typeof=\"Person\">\n  <span property=\"name\">Paul Schuster</span> was born in\n  <span property=\"birthPlace\" typeof=\"Place\" href=\"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731\">\n    <span property=\"name\">Dresden</span>.\n  </span>\n</div>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe example defines the following five [[Semantic triple|triples]] (shown in [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] Syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the ''subject'') is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the ''predicate'') the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the ''object'') either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n _:a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Person> .\n _:a <http://schema.org/name> \"Paul Schuster\" .\n _:a <http://schema.org/birthPlace> <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731> .\n <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731> <http://schema.org/itemtype> <http://schema.org/Place> .\n <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731> <http://schema.org/name> \"Dresden\" .\n</div>\n\nThe triples result in the graph shown in [[#graph1|the given figure]].\n\n[[File:RDF example extended.svg|framed|Graph resulting from the RDFa example, enriched with further data from the Web]]\n\nOne of the advantages of using [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)]] is that they can be dereferenced using the [[HTTP]] protocol. According to the so-called [[Linked Open Data]] principles, such a dereferenced URI should result in a document that offers further data about the given URI. In this example, all URIs, both for edges and nodes (e.g. <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/Person</nowiki></tt>, <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/birthPlace</nowiki></tt>, <tt><nowiki>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731</nowiki></tt>) can be dereferenced and will result in further RDF graphs, describing the URI, e.g. that Dresden is a city in Germany, or that a person, in the sense of that URI, can be fictional.\n\nThe second graph shows the previous example, but now enriched with a few of the triples from the documents that result from dereferencing <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/Person</nowiki></tt> (green edge) and <tt><nowiki>http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731</nowiki></tt> (blue edges).\n\nAdditionally to the edges given in the involved documents explicitly, edges can be automatically [[Inference|inferred]]: the triple\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n _:a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://schema.org/Person> .\n</div>\n\nfrom the original RDFa fragment and the triple\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n <http://schema.org/Person> <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#equivalentClass> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .\n</div>\n\nfrom the document at <tt><nowiki>http://schema.org/Person</nowiki></tt> (green edge in the Figure) allow to infer the following triple, given [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] semantics (red dashed line in the second Figure):\n<div class=\"plainlinks\">\n _:a <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person> .\n</div>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Semantic network#History}}\nThe concept of the [[semantic network]] model was formed in the early 1960s by researchers such as the cognitive scientist [[Allan M. Collins]], linguist M. Ross Quillian and psychologist [[Elizabeth F. Loftus]] as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge. When applied in the context of the modern internet, it extends the network of [[hyperlink]]ed human-readable [[web pages]] by inserting machine-readable [[metadata]] about pages and how they are related to each other.  This enables automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform more tasks on behalf of users. The term \"Semantic Web\" was coined by [[Tim Berners-Lee]],<ref name=\"Berners-Lee\"/> the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (\"[[W3C]]\"), which oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards. He defines the Semantic Web as \"a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines\".\n\nMany of the technologies proposed by the W3C already existed before they were positioned under the W3C umbrella. These are used in various contexts, particularly those dealing with information that encompasses a limited and defined domain, and where sharing data is a common necessity, such as scientific research or data exchange among businesses. In addition, other technologies with similar goals have emerged, such as [[microformat]]s.\n\n=== Limitations of HTML ===\nMany files on a typical computer can also be loosely divided into human-readable [[document]]s and machine-readable [[data]]. Documents like mail messages, reports, and brochures are read by humans. Data, such as calendars, addressbooks, playlists, and spreadsheets are presented using an application program that lets them be viewed, searched and combined.\n\nCurrently, the World Wide Web is based mainly on documents written in [[Hypertext Markup Language]] ([[HTML]]), a markup convention that is used for coding a body of text interspersed with multimedia objects such as images and interactive forms. Metadata tags provide a method by which computers can categorize the content of web pages. In the examples below, the field names \"keywords\", \"description\" and \"author\" are assigned values such as \"computing\", and \"cheap widgets for sale\" and \"John Doe\".\n\n<source lang=\"html4strict\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"computing, computer studies, computer\" />\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Cheap widgets for sale\" />\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"John Doe\" />\n</source>\n\nBecause of this metadata tagging and categorization, other computer systems that want to access and share this data can easily identify the relevant values.\n\nWith HTML and a tool to render it (perhaps [[web browser]] software, perhaps another [[user agent]]), one can create and present a page that lists items for sale. The HTML of this catalog page can make simple, document-level assertions such as \"this document's title is 'Widget Superstore{{'\"}}, but there is no capability within the HTML itself to assert unambiguously that, for example, item number X586172 is an Acme Gizmo with a retail price of \u20ac199, or that it is a consumer product. Rather, HTML can only say that the span of text \"X586172\" is something that should be positioned near \"Acme Gizmo\" and \"\u20ac199\", etc. There is no way to say \"this is a catalog\" or even to establish that \"Acme Gizmo\" is a kind of title or that \"\u20ac199\" is a price. There is also no way to express that these pieces of information are bound together in describing a discrete item, distinct from other items perhaps listed on the page.\n\n[[Semantic HTML]] refers to the traditional HTML practice of markup following intention, rather than specifying layout details directly. For example, the use of {{tag|em|o}} denoting \"emphasis\" rather than {{tag|i|o}}, which specifies [[italics]]. Layout details are left up to the browser, in combination with [[Cascading Style Sheets]]. But this practice falls short of specifying the semantics of objects such as items for sale or prices.\n\n[[Microformat]]s extend HTML syntax to create [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] semantic markup about objects including people, organisations, events and products.<ref>{{cite book |last=Allsopp |first=John |title=Microformats: Empowering Your Markup for Web 2.0 |date=March 2007 |publisher=[[Apress|Friends of ED]] |isbn=978-1-59059-814-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781590598146/page/368 368] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781590598146/page/368 }}</ref> Similar initiatives include [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]] and [[Schema.org]].\n\n=== Semantic Web solutions ===\nThe Semantic Web takes the solution further. It involves publishing in languages specifically designed for data: [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), and Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]). HTML describes documents and the links between them. RDF, OWL, and XML, by contrast, can describe arbitrary things such as people, meetings, or airplane parts.\n\nThese technologies are combined in order to provide descriptions that supplement or replace the content of Web documents. Thus, content may manifest itself as descriptive data stored in Web-accessible [[database]]s,<ref>Artem Chebotko and Shiyong Lu, \"Querying the Semantic Web: An Efficient Approach Using Relational Databases\", [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]], {{ISBN|978-3-8383-0264-5}}, 2009.</ref> or as markup within documents (particularly, in Extensible HTML ([[XHTML]]) interspersed with XML, or, more often, purely in XML, with layout or rendering cues stored separately). The machine-readable descriptions enable content managers to add meaning to the content, i.e., to describe the structure of the knowledge we have about that content. In this way, a machine can process knowledge itself, instead of text, using processes similar to human [[deductive reasoning]] and [[inference]], thereby obtaining more meaningful results and helping computers to perform automated information gathering and research.\n\nAn example of a tag that would be used in a non-semantic web page:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n<item>blog</item>\n</source>\n\nEncoding similar information in a semantic web page might look like this:\n<source lang=\"xml\">\n<item rdf:about=\"http://example.org/semantic-web/\">Semantic Web</item>\n</source>\n\nTim Berners-Lee calls the resulting network of [[Linked Data]] the [[Giant Global Graph]], in contrast to the HTML-based [[World Wide Web]]. Berners-Lee posits that if the past was document sharing, the future is [[data sharing]]. His answer to the question of \"how\" provides three points of instruction. One, a URL should point to the data. Two, anyone accessing the URL should get data back. Three, relationships in the data should point to additional URLs with data.\n\n=== Web 3.0 ===\n[[Tim Berners-Lee]] has described the semantic web as a component of \"Web 3.0\".<ref>{{cite news\n | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/technology/23iht-web.html\n | title=A 'more revolutionary' Web\n | accessdate=May 24, 2006\n | author=Victoria Shannon\n | date=June 26, 2006\n | work=International Herald Tribune}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|People keep asking what Web 3.0 is.

[[Automated reasoning system]]s will have to deal with all of these issues in order to deliver on the promise of the Semantic Web.\n* Vastness: The World Wide Web contains many billions of pages. The [[SNOMED CT]] medical terminology [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] alone contains 370,000 class names, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms. Any automated reasoning system will have to deal with truly huge inputs.\n* Vagueness: These are imprecise concepts like \"young\" or \"tall\". This arises from the vagueness of user queries, of concepts represented by content providers, of matching query terms to provider terms and of trying to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts. [[Fuzzy logic]] is the most common technique for dealing with vagueness.\n* Uncertainty: These are precise concepts with uncertain values. For example, a patient might present a set of symptoms that correspond to a number of different distinct diagnoses each with a different probability. [[Probabilistic logic|Probabilistic]] reasoning techniques are generally employed to address uncertainty.\n* Inconsistency: These are logical contradictions that will inevitably arise during the development of large ontologies, and when ontologies from separate sources are combined. [[Deductive reasoning]] fails catastrophically when faced with inconsistency, because [[Principle of explosion|\"anything follows from a contradiction\"]]. [[Defeasible reasoning]] and [[Paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent reasoning]] are two techniques that can be employed to deal with inconsistency.\n* Deceit: This is when the producer of the information is intentionally misleading the consumer of the information. [[Cryptography]] techniques are currently utilized to alleviate this threat. By providing a means to determine the information's integrity, including that which relates to the identity of the entity that produced or published the information, however [[credibility]] issues still have to be addressed in cases of potential deceit.\n\nThis list of challenges is illustrative rather than exhaustive, and it focuses on the challenges to the \"unifying logic\" and \"proof\" layers of the Semantic Web. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) Incubator Group for Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web (URW3-XG) final report lumps these problems together under the single heading of \"uncertainty\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/urw3/XGR-urw3-20080331/Overview.html|title=Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web|website=W3.org|accessdate=20 December 2018}}</ref> Many of the techniques mentioned here will require extensions to the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for example to annotate conditional probabilities.

These technologies are specified as W3C standards and include:\n* [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a general method for describing information\n* [[RDF Schema]] (RDFS)\n* [[Simple Knowledge Organization System]] (SKOS)\n* [[SPARQL]], an RDF query language\n* [[Notation3]] (N3), designed with human-readability in mind\n* [[N-Triples]], a format for storing and transmitting data\n* [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] (Terse RDF Triple Language)\n* [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), a family of knowledge representation languages\n* [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF), a framework of web rule language dialects supporting rule interchange on the Web\n\n[[File:Semantic_web_stack.svg|frame |right |The [[Semantic Web Stack]].]]\n\nThe [[Semantic Web Stack]] illustrates the architecture of the Semantic Web. The functions and relationships of the components can be summarized as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/ |title=OWL Web Ontology Language Overview |date=February 10, 2004 |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref>\n* XML provides an elemental syntax for content structure within documents, yet associates no semantics with the meaning of the content contained within. XML is not at present a necessary component of Semantic Web technologies in most cases, as alternative syntaxes exists, such as [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]]. Turtle is a de facto standard, but has not been through a formal standardization process.\n* [[W3C XML Schema|XML Schema]] is a language for providing and restricting the structure and content of elements contained within XML documents.\n* RDF is a simple language for expressing [[data model]]s, which refer to objects (\"[[web resource]]s\") and their relationships. An RDF-based model can be represented in a variety of syntaxes, e.g., RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, and RDFa.

This could be [[Artificial intelligence|machine-understandable]] information about the human-understandable content of the document (such as the creator, title, description, etc.) or it could be purely [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] representing a set of facts (such as resources and services elsewhere on the site). Note that ''anything'' that can be identified with a ''Uniform Resource Identifier'' (URI) can be described, so the semantic web can reason about animals, people, places, ideas, etc.  There are four semantic annotation formats that can be used in HTML documents; [[Microformat]], [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]] and [[JSON-LD]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web: From HTML5 Microdata to Linked Open Data|last = Sikos|first = Leslie F.|publisher = Apress|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4842-1049-9|location = |pages = 23}}</ref> Semantic markup is often generated automatically, rather than manually.\n* Common metadata vocabularies ([[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]]) and maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to mark up their documents so that agents can use the information in the supplied metadata (so that ''Author'' in the sense of 'the Author of the page' won't be confused with ''Author'' in the sense of a book that is the subject of a book review).\n* Automated agents to perform tasks for users of the semantic web using this data.\n* Web-based services (often with agents of their own) to supply information specifically to agents, for example, a [[Trust service]] that an agent could ask if some online store has a history of poor service or [[spamming]].\n\nSuch services could be useful to public search engines, or could be used for [[knowledge management]] within an organization.

Compared to the public Semantic Web there are lesser requirements on [[scalability]] and the information circulating within a company can be more trusted in general; privacy is less of an issue outside of handling of customer data.\n\n== Skeptical reactions ==\n=== Practical feasibility ===\nCritics question the basic feasibility of a complete or even partial fulfillment of the Semantic Web, pointing out both difficulties in setting it up and a lack of general-purpose usefulness that prevents the required effort from being invested. In a 2003 paper, Marshall and Shipman point out the cognitive overhead inherent in formalizing knowledge, compared to the authoring of traditional web [[hypertext]]:<ref name=\"which\">{{cite conference |title=Which semantic web? |last1=Marshall |first1=Catherine C. |last2=Shipman |first2=Frank M. |conference=Proc.

For example, understanding the class-instance relationship, or the superclass-subclass relationship, is more than understanding that one concept is a \u201ctype of\u201d another concept. [\u2026] These abstractions are taught to computer scientists generally and knowledge engineers specifically but do not match the similar natural language meaning of being a \"type of\" something. Effective use of such a formal representation requires the author to become a skilled knowledge engineer in addition to any other skills required by the domain. [\u2026] Once one has learned a formal representation language, it is still often much more effort to express ideas in that representation than in a less formal representation [\u2026]. Indeed, this is a form of programming based on the declaration of semantic data and requires an understanding of how reasoning algorithms will interpret the authored structures.}}\n\nAccording to Marshall and Shipman, the [[tacit knowledge|tacit]] and changing nature of much knowledge adds to the [[knowledge engineering]] problem, and limits the Semantic Web's applicability to specific domains. A further issue that they point out are domain- or organisation-specific ways to express knowledge, which must be solved through community agreement rather than only technical means.{{r|which}} As it turns out, specialized communities and organizations for intra-company projects have tended to adopt semantic web technologies greater than peripheral and less-specialized communities.<ref name=\"Herman000\">{{cite conference |url=http://www.w3.org/2007/Talks/0424-Stavanger-IH/Slides.pdf |title=State of the Semantic Web |accessdate=July 26, 2007 |author=Ivan Herman |year=2007 |conference=Semantic Days 2007}}</ref> The practical constraints toward adoption have appeared less challenging where domain and scope is more limited than that of the general public and the World-Wide Web.{{r|Herman000}}\n\nFinally, Marshall and Shipman see pragmatic problems in the idea of ([[Knowledge Navigator]]-style) intelligent agents working in the largely manually curated Semantic Web:{{r|which}}\n\n{{quote|In situations in which user needs are known and distributed information resources are well described, this approach can be highly effective; in situations that are not foreseen and that bring together an unanticipated array of information resources, the Google approach is more robust. Furthermore, the Semantic Web relies on inference chains that are more brittle; a missing element of the chain results in a failure to perform the desired action, while the human can supply missing pieces in a more Google-like approach. [\u2026] cost-benefit tradeoffs can work in favor of specially-created Semantic Web metadata directed at weaving together sensible well-structured domain-specific information resources; close attention to user/customer needs will drive these federations if they are to be successful.}}\n\n[[Cory Doctorow]]'s critique (\"[[metacrap]]\") is from the perspective of human behavior and personal preferences. For example, people may include spurious metadata into Web pages in an attempt to mislead Semantic Web engines that naively assume the metadata's veracity. This phenomenon was well known with metatags that fooled the [[Altavista]] ranking algorithm into elevating the ranking of certain Web pages: the Google indexing engine specifically looks for such attempts at manipulation. [[Peter G\u00e4rdenfors]] and [[Timo Honkela]] point out that logic-based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of the relevant phenomena related to semantics.<ref name=\"Gardenfors04\">{{Cite book\n | title=How to make the Semantic Web more semantic\n | first=Peter\n | last=G\u00e4rdenfors\n | pages=17\u201334\n | publisher=IOS Press\n | year=2004\n | work=Formal Ontology in Information Systems: proceedings of the third international conference (FOIS-2004)}}</ref><ref name=\"Honkela08\">{{cite journal\n | title=Simulating processes of concept formation and communication\n | year=2008\n | first1=Timo\n | last1=Honkela\n | first2=Ville\n | last2=K\u00f6n\u00f6nen\n | first3=Tiina\n | last3=Lindh-Knuutila\n | first4=Mari-Sanna\n | last4=Paukkeri\n | work=Journal of Economic Methodology}}</ref>\n\n=== Censorship and privacy ===\nEnthusiasm about the semantic web could be tempered by concerns regarding [[Internet censorship|censorship]] and [[privacy]]. For instance, [[Intelligent text analysis|text-analyzing]] techniques can now be easily bypassed by using other words, metaphors for instance, or by using images in place of words. An advanced implementation of the semantic web would make it much easier for governments to control the viewing and creation of online information, as this information would be much easier for an automated content-blocking machine to understand. In addition, the issue has also been raised that, with the use of [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] files and geolocation [[meta-data]], there would be very little anonymity associated with the authorship of articles on things such as a personal blog. Some of these concerns were addressed in the \"Policy Aware Web\" project<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policyawareweb.org/ |title=Policy Aware Web Project |publisher=Policyawareweb.org |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> and is an active research and development topic.\n\n=== Doubling output formats ===\nAnother criticism of the semantic web is that it would be much more time-consuming to create and publish content because there would need to be two formats for one piece of data: one for human viewing and one for machines. However, many [[web application]]s in development are addressing this issue by creating a machine-readable format upon the publishing of data or the request of a machine for such data. The development of [[microformat]]s has been one reaction to this kind of criticism. Another argument in defense of the feasibility of semantic web is the likely falling price of human intelligence tasks in digital labor markets, such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon Mechanical Turk|Mechanical Turk]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nSpecifications such as [[eRDF (data format)|eRDF]] and [[RDFa]] allow arbitrary RDF data to be embedded in HTML pages. The [[GRDDL]] (Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Language) mechanism allows existing material (including microformats) to be automatically interpreted as RDF, so publishers only need to use a single format, such as HTML.\n\n== Research activities on corporate applications ==\nThe first research group explicitly focusing on the Corporate Semantic Web was the ACACIA team at [[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique|INRIA-Sophia-Antipolis]], founded in 2002.

On December 21, 2009, the Rage organization announced its agreement with [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Philadelphia Union]] to become their official minor league affiliate, and re-branded as Reading United A.C. with immediate effect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/389250.html |title=New era for Reading PDL team |publisher=Uslsoccer.com |date=December 21, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006165210/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/389250.html |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nReading United is one of only three teams in [[USL League Two]] history to reach consecutive league finals - reaching in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe team has had a great deal of success promoting amateur players to the professional ranks, with over 130 former players having gone on to either play professionally, cap for their country in international play, or be drafted by an MLS team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.readingunitedac.com/alumni|title=Reading United Alumni|website=www.readingunitedac.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Reading-American Soccer Club was established in the early 1900s under the name of Germania Soccer Club by a group of German immigrant soccer players and soccer enthusiasts. On April 26, 1926 Germania merged with the Reading Liederkranz (Reading's German-American club), and the Sport Club legally became the Sports Division of the Reading Liederkranz.\n\nLater, under the direction of Germania and Liederkranz members Werner Kraheck and Peter Weiss, the Reading Berks Junior Soccer League was born, providing a foundation for local youth soccer clubs to flourish. The Germania teams were the precursor to the now common \u201cpremier\u201d teams. After the Germania program ended in the late 1970s/early 1980s, the premier teams became the Reading Berks Select program whereby each club could send several of their \u201ctop players\u201d to participate in tournaments and training but then return them to their club teams. After several iterations, the Reading Berks Select teams became known as Reading Berks United, later RBU, and finally Berks Soccer Academy aka B.S.A. Rage.\n\nMany people in the greater Reading area are surprised to learn that the Reading United A.C. (formerly Reading Rage) is the 2nd longest tenured minor league team in the area (behind the R-Phils). Berks Professional Sports introduced the Reading Rage minor league team 15 years ago with a squad that featured a great blend of local talent and \u201cimported\u201d stars. The Reading Rage would not have begun without the efforts of former Penn State All-American Archie Moylan. Archie was playing professional soccer and featured as a player and General Manager for the Philadelphia Freedom. Archie worked tirelessly to recruit an ownership team and staff. In 1996 his dream took the field. While a lot of the players, staff and even owners of the original team moved on, Archie's dream stayed alive. The Rage teams of the 1990s did well, with Archie leading the team to the playoffs in their 2nd season, and capturing a D3 Pro League (precursor to today's USL2) Mid-Atlantic Division Crown in 1997. Archie Moylan continued to build the Rage brand, and the team was rewarded for his management efforts by being named Franchise of the Year. In 1998 Archie further expanded his roles as he took over as head coach of the 3rd year program. The Rage teams of the 1990s featured a lot of local talent including former Wilson H.S. stars Ed Sep, Matt Wolf, Chris Arthur, and Drew Kauffman; Weiser stars Tom Auchenbach and Steve Thomas; and of course Fleetwood greats Keith Schlegel and former US Men's National Team member Troy Snyder. The team played at Fleetwood H.S. for two years prior to transitioning to Central Catholic Stadium in St. Lawrence, where they played for a number of years before moving to Albright College and finally at Exeter's Don Thomas Stadium.\n\nTragically, Archie was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2000. In recognition of Archie's efforts and accomplishments, the United Soccer Leagues has established The Archie Moylan Award to honor a member of the USL family who has exhibited outstanding humanitarian qualities or overcome extraordinary adversity in hopes to give back to the soccer community through their actions and deeds.  Past winners include executive Marcie Laumann with the Hampton Roads Piranhas (W-League), player Todd Elkins for the Southern California Seahorses (PDL), and player, coach, and USL staff member, Stuart Bracher.  Each of these individuals has exemplified the ability to not only overcome adversity but transform it into an opportunity to effectuate positive change by serving as an inspiration to others. This year's honoree was Betsy McAdams. McAdams died in June of brain cancer. She was an original employee of the Charleston Battery since its inception in 1993 and went on to serve in a number of roles including Director of Operations and Director of Finance & Business Administration. She was named Chief Operating Officer in May 2008. USL renamed the Key Grip Award to the Betsy McAdams award because she defined the behind the scenes employee.\n\nDue to the loss of Archie, a string of losing years, and decreasing fan attendance, in 2004 the team transitioned from the Pro Soccer League (USL2) to the rapidly growing PDL. The pro-am PDL allowed focus on younger players and generally less overhead and costs for franchise operations. After some internal shuffling and under the stewardship of owner and general manager Jerry Wojton, the team regained in strength, with Jerry eventually landing seasoned English Club Crystal Palace's Academy Director Derek Broadley to coach the team in 2005. Derek brought his passion for player development and quickly reignited local interest in the team and league with his attractive style of play and confidence in his coaching methodologies. While Derek's team's hovered around .500, he returned the Rage teams to the winning side of things, posting a 7\u20135\u20134 2007 record. One of the players Derek introduced to the Reading Rage in 2007 was a central defender from Boston College, Brendan Burke. Derek left the Reading Rage in the fall of 2007 to take over the Bermuda National team position.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, Reading United saw four former players, including three from the 2010 roster, drafted at the [[2011 MLS SuperDraft]] in Baltimore, Maryland.  2011 MLS Rookie of the Year [[C. J. Sapong]] was selected 10th overall by [[Sporting Kansas City]], followed by [[Corey Hertzog]] who was selected 13th overall by [[New York Red Bulls]].  [[Levi Houapeu]] was selected in the third round by [[Philadelphia Union]] with the 41st pick overall.  Former Reading Rage player, [[Zarek Valentin]], was selected 4th overall by [[Chivas USA]].\n\nIn 2012, three more alumni were selected in the [[2012 MLS SuperDraft]], held in Kansas City, MO.  [[Andrew Wenger]] became the United's first alumnus to be selected with the #1 overall pick by the [[Montreal Impact]].  Defender [[Matt Hedges]] was selected soon after by [[FC Dallas]] with the #11 overall pick.  For the second straight year, the [[Philadelphia Union]] picked a United alum, picking [[Raymon Gaddis]] in the 2nd round of the draft. Probable [[Generation Adidas]] signings [[Billy Schuler]] and [[Brian Span|Brian \"Cobi\" Span]] were likely first round picks, but chose to sign overseas rather than enter the MLS SuperDraft.\n\nFour other former players were also selected during the [[2012 MLS Supplemental Draft]], including [[Dawyne Smith]] (#3 by the [[New England Revolution]]), [[Brian Ownby]] (#7 by the [[Houston Dynamo]]), [[Evans Frimpong]] (#9 by the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]), and [[Christian Barreiro]] (#50 by the [[New York Red Bulls]]).\n\nJust over a week after the Supplemental Draft (January 25, 2012), former keeper [[Jeremy Vuolo]] signed a professional contract with the [[New York Red Bulls]], after spending his first professional season abroad with [[Finland]]'s [[AC Oulu]].\n\nOn December 28, 2013, Reading United announced that David Castellanos was chosen as the club's head coach for the 2014 season.\n\n==Name, colors, and badge==\nThe primary colors of Reading United A.C. are black, gold, and navy blue. The black and gold derive from Reading's civic seal and to the colors of the Germania Liederkranz, one of the area's original soccer clubs. Navy and gold represent the traditional state colors of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe logo for Reading United A.C. includes a stylized train that alludes to the famous [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]], which was one of the first railroads in the United States. The train depiction contains a soccer ball encircled by 11 bolts, symbolizing the 11 players on a soccer field. The shamrocks are a tribute to an [[Irish people|Irishman]] named Paul \"Archie\" Moylan, the Reading Rage's former team captain, general manager, and coach, who died of cancer in 2000. \n\nThe secondary logo features a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]], a symbol used officially by the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] alluding to its colonial designation as the \"Keystone State.\"\n\n\"United\" is a common [[Football club names|soccer appellation]] used in the [[British Isles]] and represents its relationship to the Philadelphia Union. The initials A.C. stand for \"Athletic Club\", which indicates the team's goal of expanding its business to incorporate other sports and fitness programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readingunitedac.com/name-logo-and-colors.html |title=Reading United A.C.

The club's colors are white, black, gold, and navy blue. United formerly fielded a team in the [[Super-20 League]], a league for players seventeen to twenty years of age under the [[United Soccer Leagues]] umbrella.\n\nPrior to the 2010 season, the team was known as the '''Reading Rage'''. On December 21, 2009, the Rage organization announced its agreement with [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Philadelphia Union]] to become their official minor league affiliate, and re-branded as Reading United A.C. with immediate effect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/389250.html |title=New era for Reading PDL team |publisher=Uslsoccer.com |date=December 21, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006165210/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/389250.html |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nReading United is one of only three teams in [[USL League Two]] history to reach consecutive league finals - reaching in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe team has had a great deal of success promoting amateur players to the professional ranks, with over 130 former players having gone on to either play professionally, cap for their country in international play, or be drafted by an MLS team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.readingunitedac.com/alumni|title=Reading United Alumni|website=www.readingunitedac.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Reading-American Soccer Club was established in the early 1900s under the name of Germania Soccer Club by a group of German immigrant soccer players and soccer enthusiasts. On April 26, 1926 Germania merged with the Reading Liederkranz (Reading's German-American club), and the Sport Club legally became the Sports Division of the Reading Liederkranz.\n\nLater, under the direction of Germania and Liederkranz members Werner Kraheck and Peter Weiss, the Reading Berks Junior Soccer League was born, providing a foundation for local youth soccer clubs to flourish. The Germania teams were the precursor to the now common \u201cpremier\u201d teams. After the Germania program ended in the late 1970s/early 1980s, the premier teams became the Reading Berks Select program whereby each club could send several of their \u201ctop players\u201d to participate in tournaments and training but then return them to their club teams. After several iterations, the Reading Berks Select teams became known as Reading Berks United, later RBU, and finally Berks Soccer Academy aka B.S.A. Rage.\n\nMany people in the greater Reading area are surprised to learn that the Reading United A.C. (formerly Reading Rage) is the 2nd longest tenured minor league team in the area (behind the R-Phils). Berks Professional Sports introduced the Reading Rage minor league team 15 years ago with a squad that featured a great blend of local talent and \u201cimported\u201d stars. The Reading Rage would not have begun without the efforts of former Penn State All-American Archie Moylan. Archie was playing professional soccer and featured as a player and General Manager for the Philadelphia Freedom. Archie worked tirelessly to recruit an ownership team and staff. In 1996 his dream took the field. While a lot of the players, staff and even owners of the original team moved on, Archie's dream stayed alive. The Rage teams of the 1990s did well, with Archie leading the team to the playoffs in their 2nd season, and capturing a D3 Pro League (precursor to today's USL2) Mid-Atlantic Division Crown in 1997. Archie Moylan continued to build the Rage brand, and the team was rewarded for his management efforts by being named Franchise of the Year. In 1998 Archie further expanded his roles as he took over as head coach of the 3rd year program. The Rage teams of the 1990s featured a lot of local talent including former Wilson H.S. stars Ed Sep, Matt Wolf, Chris Arthur, and Drew Kauffman; Weiser stars Tom Auchenbach and Steve Thomas; and of course Fleetwood greats Keith Schlegel and former US Men's National Team member Troy Snyder. The team played at Fleetwood H.S. for two years prior to transitioning to Central Catholic Stadium in St. Lawrence, where they played for a number of years before moving to Albright College and finally at Exeter's Don Thomas Stadium.\n\nTragically, Archie was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2000. In recognition of Archie's efforts and accomplishments, the United Soccer Leagues has established The Archie Moylan Award to honor a member of the USL family who has exhibited outstanding humanitarian qualities or overcome extraordinary adversity in hopes to give back to the soccer community through their actions and deeds.  Past winners include executive Marcie Laumann with the Hampton Roads Piranhas (W-League), player Todd Elkins for the Southern California Seahorses (PDL), and player, coach, and USL staff member, Stuart Bracher.  Each of these individuals has exemplified the ability to not only overcome adversity but transform it into an opportunity to effectuate positive change by serving as an inspiration to others. This year's honoree was Betsy McAdams. McAdams died in June of brain cancer. She was an original employee of the Charleston Battery since its inception in 1993 and went on to serve in a number of roles including Director of Operations and Director of Finance & Business Administration. She was named Chief Operating Officer in May 2008. USL renamed the Key Grip Award to the Betsy McAdams award because she defined the behind the scenes employee.\n\nDue to the loss of Archie, a string of losing years, and decreasing fan attendance, in 2004 the team transitioned from the Pro Soccer League (USL2) to the rapidly growing PDL. The pro-am PDL allowed focus on younger players and generally less overhead and costs for franchise operations. After some internal shuffling and under the stewardship of owner and general manager Jerry Wojton, the team regained in strength, with Jerry eventually landing seasoned English Club Crystal Palace's Academy Director Derek Broadley to coach the team in 2005. Derek brought his passion for player development and quickly reignited local interest in the team and league with his attractive style of play and confidence in his coaching methodologies. While Derek's team's hovered around .500, he returned the Rage teams to the winning side of things, posting a 7\u20135\u20134 2007 record. One of the players Derek introduced to the Reading Rage in 2007 was a central defender from Boston College, Brendan Burke. Derek left the Reading Rage in the fall of 2007 to take over the Bermuda National team position.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, Reading United saw four former players, including three from the 2010 roster, drafted at the [[2011 MLS SuperDraft]] in Baltimore, Maryland.  2011 MLS Rookie of the Year [[C. J. Sapong]] was selected 10th overall by [[Sporting Kansas City]], followed by [[Corey Hertzog]] who was selected 13th overall by [[New York Red Bulls]].  [[Levi Houapeu]] was selected in the third round by [[Philadelphia Union]] with the 41st pick overall.  Former Reading Rage player, [[Zarek Valentin]], was selected 4th overall by [[Chivas USA]].\n\nIn 2012, three more alumni were selected in the [[2012 MLS SuperDraft]], held in Kansas City, MO.  [[Andrew Wenger]] became the United's first alumnus to be selected with the #1 overall pick by the [[Montreal Impact]].  Defender [[Matt Hedges]] was selected soon after by [[FC Dallas]] with the #11 overall pick.  For the second straight year, the [[Philadelphia Union]] picked a United alum, picking [[Raymon Gaddis]] in the 2nd round of the draft. Probable [[Generation Adidas]] signings [[Billy Schuler]] and [[Brian Span|Brian \"Cobi\" Span]] were likely first round picks, but chose to sign overseas rather than enter the MLS SuperDraft.\n\nFour other former players were also selected during the [[2012 MLS Supplemental Draft]], including [[Dawyne Smith]] (#3 by the [[New England Revolution]]), [[Brian Ownby]] (#7 by the [[Houston Dynamo]]), [[Evans Frimpong]] (#9 by the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]), and [[Christian Barreiro]] (#50 by the [[New York Red Bulls]]).\n\nJust over a week after the Supplemental Draft (January 25, 2012), former keeper [[Jeremy Vuolo]] signed a professional contract with the [[New York Red Bulls]], after spending his first professional season abroad with [[Finland]]'s [[AC Oulu]].\n\nOn December 28, 2013, Reading United announced that David Castellanos was chosen as the club's head coach for the 2014 season.\n\n==Name, colors, and badge==\nThe primary colors of Reading United A.C. are black, gold, and navy blue. The black and gold derive from Reading's civic seal and to the colors of the Germania Liederkranz, one of the area's original soccer clubs. Navy and gold represent the traditional state colors of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe logo for Reading United A.C. includes a stylized train that alludes to the famous [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]], which was one of the first railroads in the United States. The train depiction contains a soccer ball encircled by 11 bolts, symbolizing the 11 players on a soccer field. The shamrocks are a tribute to an [[Irish people|Irishman]] named Paul \"Archie\" Moylan, the Reading Rage's former team captain, general manager, and coach, who died of cancer in 2000. \n\nThe secondary logo features a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]], a symbol used officially by the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] alluding to its colonial designation as the \"Keystone State.\"\n\n\"United\" is a common [[Football club names|soccer appellation]] used in the [[British Isles]] and represents its relationship to the Philadelphia Union. The initials A.C. stand for \"Athletic Club\", which indicates the team's goal of expanding its business to incorporate other sports and fitness programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readingunitedac.com/name-logo-and-colors.html |title=Reading United A.C.
