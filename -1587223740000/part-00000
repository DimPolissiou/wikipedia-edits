It was first aired on September 19, 2005 on [[CBS]] with a thirty-minute pilot episode, and finished its planned nine-year run on March 31, 2014. Set in present-day [[Manhattan]], the series follows the social and romantic lives of [[Ted Mosby]] ([[Josh Radnor]]) and his four best friends, [[Marshall Eriksen]] ([[Jason Segel]]), [[Robin Scherbatsky]] ([[Cobie Smulders]]), [[Lily Aldrin]] ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), and [[Barney Stinson]] ([[Neil Patrick Harris]]), as Ted seeks out his future wife ([[Cristin Milioti]]). The show tells this story through the [[framing device]] of \"future\" Ted ([[Bob Saget]]) as an [[unreliable narrator]] who is recounting to his son and daughter the events that led him to their mother.<ref>{{cite web|title='How I Met Your Mother's' Craig Thomas on Ted & Barney's Breakup, Eriksen Babies and The Future of Robarn|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/korbitv/2008/05/how-i-met-your-mothers-craig-thomas-on-ted-barneys-breakup-eriksen-babies-and-the-future-of-robarn.html|publisher=Zap2it.com|accessdate=July 21, 2008|quote=[He is] a guy who is telling the story so many years in the future, and he jumbles it up in his memory a little bit.

The club's chairman was [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]]. It was his second period as chairman. At the AGM he took over the presidency from [[Carl Burkhardt]]. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nFor the beginning of this season the club hired the ex German international [[Max Breunig]] as trainer. He came from [[Karlsruher FV]] where he had been trainer for two seasons. Basel played a total of 32 matches in this season. 14 of these were in the domestic league and 18 were friendly matches. Of these 18 friendlies, six were home games played in the [[Landhof]] and 12 were away games. Nine test games ended in a victory, four were drawn and five ended in a defeat. In these tests Basel scored a total of 45 goals and conceded 28. Of these 18 friendlies, seven were during the winter break and one was a mid season game eight were played after the domestic league season had been completed.\n\nAfter just two pre-season friendlies Basel started in the [[1921\u201322 Swiss Serie A]]. The domestic league was again divided into three regional groups, East, Central and West, each group with eight teams. FC Basel and the two other teams from Basel [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern]] and [[BSC Old Boys|Old Boys]] were allocated to the Central group. The other teams playing in this group were [[FC Aarau|Aarau]], [[FC Luzern|Luzern]] and [[FC Biel-Bienne|Biel-Bienne]] and the two teams from the capital, [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys Bern]] and [[FC Bern]]. FC Basel played a mediocre season, winning six matches, drawing three and suffering five defeats, scoring 17 goals and conceding 22. With 15 points they ended the season in fourth position.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Bilanz 1922/23\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1922/23 | title = Bilanz Saison 1922/23 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> Otto Kuhn was the team's top league goal scorer with four goals. \n\nAn outrage and scandal after the 8th round match at the [[Landhof]] on 12 November 1922 against [[BSC Young Boys]]. It came to spme massive disagreements between Basel manager [[Max Breunig|Breunig]]'s co-trainer Mr Sutter, the players of both teams and some fans. The [[Swiss Football Association]] started an enquiry immediately and posponed the match Basel against [[FC Luzern|Luzern]] from 3 December 1922 to 18 February the following year. After an appeal the results of the enquiry ended with following decision: The club Basel was fined 200 Swiss Francs, co-trainer Mr Sutter was banned for three years, Basel's player [[Gustav Putzendopler]] was banned for six months, Young Boy's players Osterwalder and von Arx were both fined 20 Swiss Francs, Referee Josef Wieland received a life long ban for the top tier of Swiss football and the club Basel had to pay the costs of the court. Because Basel won the appeal they did not have to play two matches without supporters.<ref name=\"Die ersten 125 Jahre-1938\u201339\">{{cite | first = Josef | last = Zindel | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2018 | title = Serie A 1922/23, 8 Runde, 12 November 1922, Landhof | format = | work = | publisher = Friedrich Reinhardt Verlag, Basel | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nAnother outrage and scandal was that the team Young Boys sportingly ended the season as Central group winners. But before the start of the championship play-offs, the qualification match FC Biel-Bienne virsus FC Bern (the game had ended 3\u20131) from 25.02.1923 was awarded 0\u20133 due to ineligible players of FC Biel-Bienne. So both Young Boys Bern and FC Bern were level with 22 points and consequently a play-off was to be held for the regional championship. Young Boys withdrew from this match. Thus FC Bern continued to the finals, which they won. After the play-offs finals had been completed, the qualification match Basel virsus FC Bern (the game had ended 0\u20134) from 04.02.1923 was awarded 3\u20130 forfait because FC Bern had played an ineligible player.

The club's chairman was [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]]. It was his second period as chairman. At the AGM he took over the presidency from [[Carl Burkhardt]]. FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel.\n\n== Overview ==\nFor the beginning of this season the club hired the ex German international [[Max Breunig]] as trainer. He came from [[Karlsruher FV]] where he had been trainer for two seasons. Basel played a total of 32 matches in this season. 14 of these were in the domestic league and 18 were friendly matches. Of these 18 friendlies, six were home games played in the [[Landhof]] and 12 were away games. Nine test games ended in a victory, four were drawn and five ended in a defeat. In these tests Basel scored a total of 45 goals and conceded 28. Of these 18 friendlies, seven were during the winter break and one was a mid season game eight were played after the domestic league season had been completed.\n\nAfter just two pre-season friendlies Basel started in the [[1921\u201322 Swiss Serie A]]. The domestic league was again divided into three regional groups, East, Central and West, each group with eight teams. FC Basel and the two other teams from Basel [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern]] and [[BSC Old Boys|Old Boys]] were allocated to the Central group. The other teams playing in this group were [[FC Aarau|Aarau]], [[FC Luzern|Luzern]] and [[FC Biel-Bienne|Biel-Bienne]] and the two teams from the capital, [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys Bern]] and [[FC Bern]]. FC Basel played a mediocre season, winning six matches, drawing three and suffering five defeats, scoring 17 goals and conceding 22. With 15 points they ended the season in fourth position.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Bilanz 1922/23\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1922/23 | title = Bilanz Saison 1922/23 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref> Otto Kuhn was the team's top league goal scorer with four goals. \n\nAn outrage and scandal after the 8th round match at the [[Landhof]] on 12 November 1922 against [[BSC Young Boys]]. It came to spme massive disagreements between Basel manager [[Max Breunig|Breunig]]'s co-trainer Mr Sutter, the players of both teams and some fans. The [[Swiss Football Association]] started an enquiry immediately and posponed the match Basel against [[FC Luzern|Luzern]] from 3 December 1922 to 18 February the following year. After an appeal the results of the enquiry ended with following decision: The club Basel was fined 200 Swiss Francs, co-trainer Mr Sutter was banned for three years, Basel's player [[Gustav Putzendopler]] was banned for six months, Young Boy's players Osterwalder and von Arx were both fined 20 Swiss Francs, Referee Josef Wieland recieved a life long ban for the top tier of Swiss football and the club Basel had to pay the costs of the court. Because Basel won the appeal they did not have to play two matches without supporters.<ref name=\"Die ersten 125 Jahre-1938\u201339\">{{cite | first = Josef | last = Zindel | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2018 | title = Serie A 1922/23, 8 Runde, 12 November 1922, Landhof | format = | work = | publisher = Friedrich Reinhardt Verlag, Basel | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nAnother outrage and scandal was that the team Young Boys sportingly ended the season as Central group winners. But before the start of the championship play-offs, the qualification match FC Biel-Bienne virsus FC Bern (the game had ended 3\u20131) from 25.02.1923 was awarded 0\u20133 due to ineligible players of FC Biel-Bienne. So both Young Boys Bern and FC Bern were level with 22 points and consequently a play-off was to be held for the regional championship. Young Boys withdrew from this match. Thus FC Bern continued to the finals, which they won. After the play-offs finals had been completed, the qualification match Basel virsus FC Bern (the game had ended 0\u20134) from 04.02.1923 was awarded 3\u20130 forfait because FC Bern had played an ineligible player. After this decision Young Boys were again winners of the regional group. The date of this decision was in September 1923 and there was not enough time left for a new Play-off Final before the next season started. Therefore no Swiss championship was awarded for 1922/23 season.<ref name=\"rsssf 1922/23\">{{cite web | first = | last = Erik Garin | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2017 | url = http://www.rsssf.com/tablesz/zwithist-reg.html#1923 | title = Switzerland 1922/23 | format = | work = | publisher =  Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\n== Players ==\n;Squad members\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=GK |name= [[Arthur Fahr]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=GK |name= [[Theodor Sch\u00e4r]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=DF |name= Hasler (II) }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=DF |name= [[Hermann Moll (footballer)|Hermann Moll]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=AUT |pos=DF |name= [[Gustav Putzendopler]] (I) }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=DF |name= [[Peter Riesterer]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Walter Rupprecht]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Max Galler]] (II) }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Ernst Kaltenbach]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF |name= [[Otto Kuhn]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=AUT |pos=MF |name= [[Karl Putzendopler]] (II) }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=MF  |name=[[Karl Wangler]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name=[[Karl Bielser]]}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name=[[Gaetano Dal Ben]]}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Paul Dietz]] (II) }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Jules D\u00fcblin]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Karl Ibach (footballer)|Karl Ibach]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= M\u00fcller }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Hans Rau]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Alfred Schlecht]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Fritz Schneider (footballer)|Fritz Schneider]] (I) }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Karl W\u00fcthrich]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos=FW |name= [[Franz Zeiser]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos= |name= [[Wilhelm Flubacher]] }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=SUI |pos= |name= [[Hans Schneider (footballer)|Hans Schneider]] (II) }}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat= |pos= |name= [[Wilhelm \"Willy\" Geiser]] }}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n== Results ==\n\n;Legend\n{{legend2|#CCFFCC|Win|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#FFFFCC|Draw|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#FFCCCC|Loss|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|#CCCCCC|Postponed|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n\n===Friendly matches===\n====Pre-season====\n{{footballbox collapsible\n| round      = Pre-season  \n| date       = 3 September 1922\n| time       = \n| team1      = [[1.

The movie revolves around two sets of [[Twin#Monozygotic (identical) twins|identical female twins]] mismatched at birth, with one of each pair ending in a wealthy urban family (the Sheltons) and the other in a poor rural family (the Ratliffs).

At the local hospital, they are turned away, because it is exclusively for employees of Hollowmade, the local furniture maker. Mr. Shelton purchases the company on the spot, and Mrs. Shelton is then admitted. The Ratliffs, an impoverished couple, arrive moments later with Mrs. Ratliff also in labor. Both women give birth to twin girls, and the elderly nurse attending the doctor confuses and mixes up the sets of twins. Mr. Ratliff overhears the Sheltons deciding to name their daughters Rose and Sadie, and suggests the same names to his wife.\n\nForty years later, the Shelton sisters are now co-chairwomen of Moramax in [[New York City]], a conglomerate that is the successor to their father's business interests. Sadie Shelton is focused on her career to the detriment of her family, while Rose Shelton wishes for a simpler life in the country. As part of her business plan, Sadie plans to sell Hollowmade, but must get stockholders' approval to proceed. In Jupiter Hollow, Rose Ratliff has risen to the position of forewoman at the Hollowmade Factory, and is also very career-driven. Meanwhile, Sadie Ratliff has always felt misplaced in rural life, and wishes for a more sophisticated life in a big city. Rose discovers Moramax's plans to sell Hollowmade, and makes plans to travel to New York City to stop the sale. Wanting to see the city, Sadie agrees to join her sister.\n\nWhile Sadie Shelton makes plans for the shareholders' meeting, she learns from her employee Graham Sherbourne that \"R. Ratliff\" plans to come to New York with his sister to stop the sale. Sadie orders Sherbourne to locate \"R. Ratliff\" to prevent them from appearing at the meeting. A series of mixups at [[JFK Airport]] leaves the Shelton sisters stranded while the prospective buyer of Hollowmade, Mr. Fabio Alberici, takes their limousine back to the [[Plaza Hotel]] with the Ratliff sisters. The Ratliffs are checked into the Sheltons' suite, and the Sheltons take the suite next door, leading to a series of near-misses between the four sisters, and the men who are pursuing them romantically. In the meantime, Graham and his assistant/boyfriend assume that a visitor from Jupiter Hollow, Rose Ratliff's beau Roone Dimmick, is actually \"R. Ratliff.\"\n\nAll sisters discover their mixup in the lobby bathroom. After Sadie Shelton acts like she will call off the Hollowmade sale, Rose Ratliff calls her out on the strip mining plans.  Rose Shelton then realizes that Sadie has been lying to her, and helps the Ratliffs trap her in the broom closet. Rose Ratliff sits outside the broom closet to keep Sadie Shelton trapped, while Rose Shelton and Sadie Ratliff attend the shareholders' meeting and stop the sale of Hollowmade. Both sets of twins later leave the Plaza hotel with their newfound loves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bette Midler]] \u2014 Sadie Shelton/Sadie Ratliff\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] \u2014 Rose Ratliff/Rose Shelton\n* [[Fred Ward]] \u2014 Roone Dimmick\n* [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] \u2014 Dr. Jay Marshall\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] \u2014 Graham Sherbourne\n* [[Barry Primus]] \u2014 Michael\n* [[Michele Placido]] \u2014 Fabio Alberici\n* [[Seth Green]] \u2014 Jason\n* [[Daniel Gerroll]] \u2014 Chuck\n* [[John Hancock (actor)|John Hancock]] \u2014 Harlan\n* [[Deborah Rush]] \u2014 Binky Shelton\n* [[Nicolas Coster]] \u2014 Hunt Shelton\n* [[J.

Mr. Ratliff overhears the Sheltons deciding to name their daughters Rose and Sadie, and suggests the same names to his wife.\n\nForty years later, the Shelton sisters are now co-chairwomen of Moramax in [[New York City]], a conglomerate that is the successor to their father's business interests. Sadie Shelton is focused on her career to the detriment of her family, while Rose Shelton wishes for a simpler life in the country. As part of her business plan, Sadie plans to sell Hollowmade, but must get stockholders' approval to proceed. In Jupiter Hollow, Rose Ratliff has risen to the position of forewoman at the Hollowmade Factory, and is also very career-driven. Meanwhile, Sadie Ratliff has always felt misplaced in rural life, and wishes for a more sophisticated life in a big city. Rose discovers Moramax's plans to sell Hollowmade, and makes plans to travel to New York City to stop the sale. Wanting to see the city, Sadie agrees to join her sister.\n\nWhile Sadie Shelton makes plans for the shareholders' meeting, she learns from her employee Graham Sherbourne that \"R. Ratliff\" plans to come to New York with his sister to stop the sale. Sadie orders Sherbourne to locate \"R. Ratliff\" to prevent them from appearing at the meeting. A series of mixups at [[JFK Airport]] leaves the Shelton sisters stranded while the prospective buyer of Hollowmade, Mr. Fabio Alberici, takes their limousine back to the [[Plaza Hotel]] with the Ratliff sisters. The Ratliffs are checked into the Sheltons' suite, and the Sheltons take the suite next door, leading to a series of near-misses between the four sisters, and the men who are pursuing them romantically. In the meantime, Graham and his assistant/boyfriend assume that a visitor from Jupiter Hollow, Rose Ratliff's beau Roone Dimmick, is actually \"R. Ratliff.\"\n\nAll sisters discover their mixup in the lobby bathroom. After Sadie Shelton acts like she will call off the Hollowmade sale, Rose Ratliff calls her out on the strip mining plans.  Rose Shelton then realizes that Sadie has been lying to her, and helps the Ratliffs trap her in the broom closet. Rose Ratliff sits outside the broom closet to keep Sadie Shelton trapped, while Rose Shelton and Sadie Ratliff attend the shareholders' meeting and stop the sale of Hollowmade. Both sets of twins later leave the Plaza hotel with their newfound loves.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bette Midler]] \u2014 Sadie Shelton/Sadie Ratliff\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] \u2014 Rose Ratliff/Rose Shelton\n* [[Fred Ward]] \u2014 Roone Dimmick\n* [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] \u2014 Dr. Jay Marshall\n* [[Edward Herrmann]] \u2014 Graham Sherbourne\n* [[Barry Primus]] \u2014 Michael\n* [[Michele Placido]] \u2014 Fabio Alberici\n* [[Seth Green]] \u2014 Jason\n* [[Daniel Gerroll]] \u2014 Chuck\n* [[John Hancock (actor)|John Hancock]] \u2014 Harlan\n* [[Deborah Rush]] \u2014 Binky Shelton\n* [[Nicolas Coster]] \u2014 Hunt Shelton\n* [[J.

The plot is a coincidental{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} and playful combination of three previously recognizable stories: Aesop's ''[[The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse]]'', Mark Twain's ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', and Shakespeare's ''[[Comedy of Errors]]''.\n\nThe production company could not get the rights to film at the actual [[Plaza Hotel]] in [[New York City]], so it had the hotel recreated on sound stages. To recoup construction costs, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] built a sitcom called ''[[The Nutt House]]'' around it.  [[Jim Abrahams]] said he staged one of the boardroom scenes based on an experience he had when a large agency used many employees to get him to sign with them.\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reaction to the film as a whole was generally lukewarm.

A high-ranking member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur must deal with the decline of the [[Wild West]] while attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries in a fictionalized representation of the [[Western United States|Western]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States]]. He is portrayed by [[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]], who provided the character's [[performance capture]].\n\nThe development team at [[Rockstar Games]] decided that the player would control one character in ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', as opposed to the three protagonists in Rockstar's previous title ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), in order to follow the character more personally and understand how the events impact him. They felt that a single character felt more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western. Clark wanted to portray the character in a manner that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He took inspiration from actors such as [[Toshiro Mifune]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Rob Wiethoff]], who also played [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]] in the game and [[Red Dead Redemption|its predecessor]].\n\nThe character has received acclaim from critics, with his complexity and path to redemption most frequently the subject of praise. Reviewers also lauded the character for bringing the game's world and other characters to life. For his work on the game, Clark received numerous [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|nominations]] and was awarded Best Performance at [[The Game Awards 2018|The Game Awards]].\n\n== Character development ==\nThe development team at [[Rockstar Games]] decided that the player would control one character in ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'', as opposed to the three protagonists in Rockstar's previous title ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), in order to follow the character more personally and understand how the events impact him.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> They felt that a single character felt more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western.<ref name=\"THR\"/> Producer Rob Nelson felt that the decision to limit to one protagonist shaped the other creative decisions of development. The conversations and sense of life within the gang environment was inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto V''{{'}}s exploration of the lives of two of the game's playable characters while the player was controlling the other one.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> Rockstar wanted to grant agency to the player when experiencing the story of Arthur Morgan; writer Michael Unsworth noted that Arthur is neither controlled by the storytellers or by the player, but consists of \"a delicate push and pull between the two\".<ref name=\"Variety\"/> The team attempted to give the player more freedom with Arthur's relationship with other characters; when the narrative begins, Arthur has already formed relationships with the other gang members, so the team aimed to develop them in a way for the player to respond appropriately.<ref name=\"VentureBeat\"/>\n\n[[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]] portrayed Arthur in the game. His work was recorded using [[performance capture]], involving simultaneous recording of movement and voice; a small part of his performance was recorded in a voiceover booth.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> For his portrayal, Clark took main inspiration from [[Toshiro Mifune]].<ref name=\"THR Cast\"/> He found that Mifune's characters were stoic while also having a \"crazy\" sense of humor, a complexity he wanted to portray within Arthur.<ref name=\"VG247 Clark\"/> Clark also took inspiration from ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) as it involved a similar situation to Arthur's, wherein he is forced to betray some of his loyalties. He watched films such as ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), as well as the work of [[John Wayne]];<ref name=\"Twinfinite Clark\"/> despite watching the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (1964\u20131966) he did not take much inspiration from [[Clint Eastwood]]'s portrayal of the [[Man with No Name]], as he felt that Arthur was more talkative.<ref name=\"THR Cast\"/> Clark regularly listened to [[Don Edwards]]' 1993 version of the song {{nowrap|\"[[Coyotes (song)|Coyotes]]\"}} during production for inspiration.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/>\n\nClark wanted to portray a character that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He initially faced difficulty with this concept, as the high honor performance was different to the low honor, but he reminded himself that Arthur was a complex character who could easily contradict himself.<ref name=\"Twinfinite Clark\"/> He aimed to portray vulnerability with Arthur's ego. Clark felt that Arthur initially resented [[John Marston (Red Dead Redemption)|John Marston]], as he had a family\u2014something Arthur wishes he could have\u2014but as the gang begins to fall apart, Arthur acts to help John, \"try[ing] to do what he wishes he could have done for himself\".<ref name=\"VG247 Clark\"/> Clark looked to [[Rob Wiethoff]]'s portrayal as John in the first game for inspiration with his own performance.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> A second love interest for Arthur was cut from the game during development.<ref name=\"Vulture\"/>\n\nVice President of Creativity [[Dan Houser]] was interested in subverting the trope of the protagonist starting as weak and becoming stronger as the story progresses; instead, Arthur is already tough at the beginning of the game, and is \"taken on a more intellectual roller coaster when his world view gets taken apart\".<ref name=\"GQ\"/> Houser felt that the decline of the American frontier had a deep impact on Arthur, noting that the character is \"caught between the nastiness of nature and the brutality of encroaching industrialization in civilization\".<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> Houser avoided meeting Clark on set to avoid hearing his real voice.<ref name=\"GQ\"/>\n\n== Appearances ==\nArthur joined the Van der Linde gang when he was 14-years-old, having lost his parents at a young age, and soon became Dutch's first prot\u00e9g\u00e9.{{sfn|Price|2018|p=355}} Arthur had a son, Isaac, with a waitress named Eliza; he demonstrated regular support for them until they were killed by robbers for a trivial sum of money. Over time, Arthur transformed from a lost cause into Dutch's most dedicated enforcer.{{sfn|Price|2018|p=355}} When the gang is forced into a blizzard, Arthur helps to find supplies and later tracks down John. He helps to rob a train owned by Leviticus Cornwall and, after moving to Horseshoe Overlook, fights against Cornwall's hired guns. After moving to Clemens Point, Arthur becomes involved in conflict between two warring families, the Braithwaites and the Grays. The conflict leads to the death of a gang member and the capture of Jack Marston.\n\nArthur retrieves Jack from the supervision of crime lord Angelo Bronte, and helps retaliate against the backstabbing Bronte who leads them into a trap. Arthur notices Dutch's violent outburst as uncharacteristic of him. In Saint Denis, a failed bank heist forces some members of the gang out of town; they soon shipwreck on Guarma, an island near [[Cuba]], but fight alongside a revolutionary in exchange for a ship back to the mainland. Reuniting with the rest of the gang, Arthur and Sadie resolve to save the captured John, much to the disdain of Dutch. Arthur is soon diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Shocked by the grim reality of his imminent death, Arthur contemplates his decisions and reflects on his morals, led further by his friendship with Native American leader Rains Fall. This drives his desire to protect the remnants of the gang, particularly John and his family. Upon saving John, Arthur reveals his growing doubts about Dutch, unable to accept his leader's growing obsession.\n\nDutch seemingly abandons Arthur to die during an assault on an oil refinery, and leaves John for dead when he is shot during a train robbery. When Dutch ignores Arthur's plea to rescue Abigail from Agent Milton, Arthur disavows the gang. Upon confronting Milton, Arthur discovers that Micah Bell has been betraying the gang. He returns to Dutch to inform him of Micah's betrayal; Dutch turns on Arthur and the newly returned John. When Pinkertons invade the camp, Arthur and John flee. Arthur begs John to return to his family. Arthur is soon ambushed by the vengeful Micah, and Dutch intervenes in their fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to abandon Micah and leave. If the player has high honor, Arthur succumbs to his injuries and disease and dies peacefully while watching the sunrise; if the player has low honor, Micah executes him.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Roger Clark - Great Philadelphia Comic Con.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]]'s performance as Arthur Morgan received high praise from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]] and [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|awards ceremonies]].]]\n\nArthur's character received acclaim. ''[[Giant Bomb]]''{{'}}s Alex Navarro wrote that the characters possess humanity often lacking in other Rockstar games, particularly in the thoughtful portrayal of Arthur's internal conflicts.<ref name=\"Giant Bomb Review\"/> Preston Dozsa of ''CG Magazine'' felt similarly, praising the game's interactivity for the player to craft the journey themselves.<ref name=\"CG Magazine Review\"/> ''LevelSkip''{{'}}s Kyle Atwood called Arthur Morgan a \"character of tragedy and, most importantly, humanity\".<ref name=\"LevelSkip\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Kirk Hamilton wrote that Arthur initially seemed unremarkable but became more interesting throughout the game, aided by Clark's performance.<ref name=\"Kotaku Review\"/> ''[[Ars Technica]]''{{'}}s Daniel Starkey felt that, while Arthur's story can be considered \"poignant and memorable\", some will see it as a typical story about a \"'bad man' who isn't necessarily in control\".<ref name=\"Ars Technica Review\"/>\n\n''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Tom Power felt that Arthur's story reflects that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]], with some of the game's characters representing the [[five stages of grief]].<ref name=\"GamesRadar Shakespeare\"/> David Meikleham of GamesRadar+ lauded Arthur's story for being \"nothing short of astonishing\", comparing it to ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGMNow]]''{{'}}s Nick Plessas found the journey of redemption for Arthur Morgan to be \"far more redeeming\" than John Marston's in ''Red Dead Redemption'', noting that his sins heightened his sympathy for the character.<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/> Javy Gwaltney of ''[[Game Informer]]'' echoed this sentiment, noting that Arthur's arc is a \"fantastic take on ''[[memento mori]]'' and how ruthlessly messy and complex redemption can be\".<ref name=\"Game Informer Better\"/> Though ''[[Zero Punctuation]]''{{'}}s [[Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw]] felt that Arthur was \"generic\", he did find himself to be \"quite shook\" by the ending to Arthur's story as \"possibly the emotional impact, more likely from [[delirium tremens]].\"<ref name=\"ZP Review\"/> Conversely, ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Martin Robinson considered Arthur to be less compelling than Marston, leading to a confusing narrative as a result.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Review\"/>\n\nSeveral critics felt that the character brought the game's world to life. ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Paul Walker-Emig noted that Arthur's notebook made him feel \"like a real person with his own inner life, rather than a puppet who does our bidding\".<ref name=\"Guardian Notebooks\"/> Peter Suderman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', found that players \"feel for Arthur Morgan, a bad man with a good heart, because his choices are, in fact, your own\".<ref name=\"NYT Art\"/> Laurence Mozafari of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' felt that Arthur perfectly encapsulated the feeling of the Old West.<ref name=\"Digital Spy Review\"/> ''[[VentureBeat]]''{{'}}s Dean Takahashi praised the Clark's performance for adding to the game's immersion and the character's depth.<ref name=\"VentureBeat Review\"/> Luke Reilly of ''[[IGN]]'' celebrated the life brought into the character, describing his voice as having an \"infectious authenticity\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n\nFor his role as Arthur, Clark won Best Performance at [[The Game Awards 2018]],<ref name=\"Game Awards 2018\"/> and was awarded gold from [[PlayStation Blog]];<ref name=\"PS Blog\"/> he also received nominations at the [[15th British Academy Games Awards]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> the [[NAVGTR Awards]],<ref name=\"NAVGTR Nom\"/> and the New York Game Awards.<ref name=\"New York Game Awards\"/> The character of Arthur received nominations at the [[22nd Annual D.I.C.E.

American\n}}\n'''Arthur Morgan''' is a [[fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the 2018 video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''. A high-ranking member of the Van der Linde gang, Arthur must deal with the decline of the [[Wild West]] while attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries in a fictionalized representation of the [[Western United States|Western]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States]]. He is portrayed by [[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]], who provided the character's [[performance capture]].\n\nThe development team at [[Rockstar Games]] decided that the player would control one character in ''Red Dead Redemption 2'', as opposed to the three protagonists in Rockstar's previous title ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), in order to follow the character more personally and understand how the events impact him. They felt that a single character felt more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western. Clark wanted to portray the character in a manner that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He took inspiration from actors such as [[Toshiro Mifune]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Rob Wiethoff]], who also played [[John Marston (Red Dead)|John Marston]] in the game and [[Red Dead Redemption|its predecessor]].\n\nThe character has received acclaim from critics, with his complexity and path to redemption most frequently the subject of praise. Reviewers also lauded the character for bringing the game's world and other characters to life. For his work on the game, Clark received numerous [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|nominations]] and was awarded Best Performance at [[The Game Awards 2018|The Game Awards]].\n\n== Character development ==\nThe development team at [[Rockstar Games]] decided that the player would control one character in ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'', as opposed to the three protagonists in Rockstar's previous title ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' (2013), in order to follow the character more personally and understand how the events impact him.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> They felt that a single character felt more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western.<ref name=\"THR\"/> Producer Rob Nelson felt that the decision to limit to one protagonist shaped the other creative decisions of development. The conversations and sense of life within the gang environment was inspired by ''Grand Theft Auto V''{{'}}s exploration of the lives of two of the game's playable characters while the player was controlling the other one.<ref name=\"Variety\"/> Rockstar wanted to grant agency to the player when experiencing the story of Arthur Morgan; writer Michael Unsworth noted that Arthur is neither controlled by the storytellers or by the player, but consists of \"a delicate push and pull between the two\".<ref name=\"Variety\"/> The team attempted to give the player more freedom with Arthur's relationship with other characters; when the narrative begins, Arthur has already formed relationships with the other gang members, so the team aimed to develop them in a way for the player to respond appropriately.<ref name=\"VentureBeat\"/>\n\n[[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]] portrayed Arthur in the game. His work was recorded using [[performance capture]], involving simultaneous recording of movement and voice; a small part of his performance was recorded in a voiceover booth.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> For his portrayal, Clark took main inspiration from [[Toshiro Mifune]].<ref name=\"THR Cast\"/> He found that Mifune's characters were stoic while also having a \"crazy\" sense of humor, a complexity he wanted to portray within Arthur.<ref name=\"VG247 Clark\"/> Clark also took inspiration from ''[[The Proposition (2005 film)|The Proposition]]'' (2005) as it involved a similar situation to Arthur's, wherein he is forced to betray some of his loyalties. He watched films such as ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), as well as the work of [[John Wayne]];<ref name=\"Twinfinite Clark\"/> despite watching the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' (1964\u20131966) he did not take much inspiration from [[Clint Eastwood]]'s portrayal of the [[Man with No Name]], as he felt that Arthur was more talkative.<ref name=\"THR Cast\"/> Clark regularly listened to [[Don Edwards]]' 1993 version of the song {{nowrap|\"[[Coyotes (song)|Coyotes]]\"}} during production for inspiration.<ref name=\"SacAnime\"/>\n\nClark wanted to portray a character that was complex enough for the player to choose his path and still make sense. He initially faced difficulty with this concept, as the high honor performance was different to the low honor, but he reminded himself that Arthur was a complex character who could easily contradict himself.<ref name=\"Twinfinite Clark\"/> He aimed to portray vulnerability with Arthur's ego. Clark felt that Arthur initially resented [[John Marston (Red Dead Redemption)|John Marston]], as he had a family\u2014something Arthur wishes he could have\u2014but as the gang begins to fall apart, Arthur acts to help John, \"try[ing] to do what he wishes he could have done for himself\".<ref name=\"VG247 Clark\"/> Clark looked to [[Rob Wiethoff]]'s portrayal as John in the first game for inspiration with his own performance.<ref name=\"Shacknews\"/> A second love interest for Arthur was cut from the game during development.<ref name=\"Vulture\"/>\n\nVice President of Creativity [[Dan Houser]] was interested in subverting the trope of the protagonist starting as weak and becoming stronger as the story progresses; instead, Arthur is already tough at the beginning of the game, and is \"taken on a more intellectual roller coaster when his world view gets taken apart\".<ref name=\"GQ\"/> Houser felt that the decline of the American frontier had a deep impact on Arthur, noting that the character is \"caught between the nastiness of nature and the brutality of encroaching industrialization in civilization\".<ref name=\"Vulture\"/> Houser avoided meeting Clark on set to avoid hearing his real voice.<ref name=\"GQ\"/>\n\n== Appearances ==\nArthur joined the Van der Linde gang when he was 14-years-old, having lost his parents at a young age, and soon became Dutch's first prot\u00e9g\u00e9.{{sfn|Price|2018|p=355}} Arthur had a son, Isaac, with a waitress named Eliza; he demonstrated regular support for them until they were killed by robbers for a trivial sum of money. Over time, Arthur transformed from a lost cause into Dutch's most dedicated enforcer.{{sfn|Price|2018|p=355}} When the gang is forced into a blizzard, Arthur helps to find supplies and later tracks down John. He helps to rob the train owned by Leviticus Cornwall and, after moving to Horseshoe Overlook, fights against Cornwall's hired guns. After moving to Clemens Point, Arthur becomes involved in conflict between two warring families, the Braithwaites and the Grays. The conflict leads to the death of a gang member and the capture of Jack Marston.\n\nArthur retrieves Jack from the supervision of crime lord Angelo Bronte, and helps retaliate against the backstabbing Bronte who leads them into a trap. Arthur notices Dutch's violent outburst as uncharacteristic of him. In Saint Denis, a failed bank heist forces some members of the gang out of town; they soon shipwreck on Guarma, an island near [[Cuba]], but fight alongside a revolutionary in exchange for a ship back to the mainland. Reuniting with the rest of the gang, Arthur and Sadie resolve to save the captured John, much to the disdain of Dutch. Arthur is soon diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. Shocked by the grim reality of his imminent death, Arthur contemplates his decisions and reflects on his morals, led further by his friendship with Native American leader Rains Fall. This drives his desire to protect the remnants of the gang, particularly John and his family. Upon saving John, Arthur reveals his growing doubts about Dutch, unable to accept his leader's growing obsession.\n\nDutch seemingly abandons Arthur to die during an assault on an oil refinery, and leaves John for dead when he is shot during a train robbery. When Dutch ignores Arthur's plea to rescue Abigail from Agent Milton, Arthur disavows the gang. Upon confronting Milton, Arthur discovers that Micah Bell has been betraying the gang. He returns to Dutch to inform him of Micah's betrayal; Dutch turns on Arthur and the newly returned John. When Pinkertons invade the camp, Arthur and John flee. Arthur begs John to return to his family. Arthur is soon ambushed by the vengeful Micah, and Dutch intervenes in their fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to abandon Micah and leave. If the player has high honor, Arthur succumbs to his injuries and disease and dies peacefully while watching the sunrise; if the player has low honor, Micah executes him.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Roger Clark - Great Philadelphia Comic Con.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Roger Clark (actor, born 1978)|Roger Clark]]'s performance as Arthur Morgan received high praise from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]] and [[List of accolades received by Red Dead Redemption 2|awards ceremonies]].]]\n\nArthur's character received acclaim. ''[[Giant Bomb]]''{{'}}s Alex Navarro wrote that the characters possess humanity often lacking in other Rockstar games, particularly in the thoughtful portrayal of Arthur's internal conflicts.<ref name=\"Giant Bomb Review\"/> Preston Dozsa of ''CG Magazine'' felt similarly, praising the game's interactivity for the player to craft the journey themselves.<ref name=\"CG Magazine Review\"/> ''LevelSkip''{{'}}s Kyle Atwood called Arthur Morgan a \"character of tragedy and, most importantly, humanity\".<ref name=\"LevelSkip\"/> ''[[Kotaku]]''{{'}}s Kirk Hamilton wrote that Arthur initially seemed unremarkable but became more interesting throughout the game, aided by Clark's performance.<ref name=\"Kotaku Review\"/> ''[[Ars Technica]]''{{'}}s Daniel Starkey felt that, while Arthur's story can be considered \"poignant and memorable\", some will see it as a typical story about a \"'bad man' who isn't necessarily in control\".<ref name=\"Ars Technica Review\"/>\n\n''[[GamesRadar+]]''{{'}}s Tom Power felt that Arthur's story reflects that of a [[Shakespearean tragedy]], with some of the game's characters representing the [[five stages of grief]].<ref name=\"GamesRadar Shakespeare\"/> David Meikleham of GamesRadar+ lauded Arthur's story for being \"nothing short of astonishing\", comparing it to ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"GamesRadar Review\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGMNow]]''{{'}}s Nick Plessas found the journey of redemption for Arthur Morgan to be \"far more redeeming\" than John Marston's in ''Red Dead Redemption'', noting that his sins heightened his sympathy for the character.<ref name=\"EGM Review\"/> Javy Gwaltney of ''[[Game Informer]]'' echoed this sentiment, noting that Arthur's arc is a \"fantastic take on ''[[memento mori]]'' and how ruthlessly messy and complex redemption can be\".<ref name=\"Game Informer Better\"/> Though ''[[Zero Punctuation]]''{{'}}s [[Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw]] felt that Arthur was \"generic\", he did find himself to be \"quite shook\" by the ending to Arthur's story as \"possibly the emotional impact, more likely from [[delirium tremens]].\"<ref name=\"ZP Review\"/> Conversely, ''[[Eurogamer]]''{{'}}s Martin Robinson considered Arthur to be less compelling than Marston, leading to a confusing narrative as a result.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Review\"/>\n\nSeveral critics felt that the character brought the game's world to life. ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Paul Walker-Emig noted that Arthur's notebook made him feel \"like a real person with his own inner life, rather than a puppet who does our bidding\".<ref name=\"Guardian Notebooks\"/> Peter Suderman, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', found that players \"feel for Arthur Morgan, a bad man with a good heart, because his choices are, in fact, your own\".<ref name=\"NYT Art\"/> Laurence Mozafari of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' felt that Arthur perfectly encapsulated the feeling of the Old West.<ref name=\"Digital Spy Review\"/> ''[[VentureBeat]]''{{'}}s Dean Takahashi praised the Clark's performance for adding to the game's immersion and the character's depth.<ref name=\"VentureBeat Review\"/> Luke Reilly of ''[[IGN]]'' celebrated the life brought into the character, describing his voice as having an \"infectious authenticity\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n\nFor his role as Arthur, Clark won Best Performance at [[The Game Awards 2018]],<ref name=\"Game Awards 2018\"/> and was awarded gold from [[PlayStation Blog]];<ref name=\"PS Blog\"/> he also received nominations at the [[15th British Academy Games Awards]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> the [[NAVGTR Awards]],<ref name=\"NAVGTR Nom\"/> and the New York Game Awards.<ref name=\"New York Game Awards\"/> The character of Arthur received nominations at the [[22nd Annual D.I.C.E.
