He hoped to gain both political power and more wealth with his daughter's marriage, so he conducted the arrangement in a very \"business-like style\".<ref>Green (1850), p.321</ref> He finally found a man suitable to marry Joan (aged 5 at the time), Hartman, son of King [[Rudolph I of Germany]]. Edward then brought her home from France for the first time to meet him.<ref>Green (1850), p321.</ref> As she had spent her entire life away from Edward and Eleanor, when she returned she \"stood in no awe of her parents\"<ref name=\"Parsons 1995, p.40\"/> and had a fairly distanced relationship with them.\n\nUnfortunately for King Edward, his daughter's suitor died before he was able to meet or marry Joan. The news reported that Hartman had fallen through a patch of shallow ice while \"amusing himself in skating\" while a letter sent to the King himself stated that Hartman had set out on a boat to visit his father amidst a terrible fog and the boat had smashed into a rock, drowning him.<ref>Green (1850), p.323</ref>\n\n==First marriage==\nEdward arranged a second marriage almost immediately after the death of Hartman.<ref>Oxford, p. 626.</ref> Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who was almost 30 years older than Joan and newly divorced, was his first choice.<ref>Green (1850), p.327</ref> The earl resigned his lands to Edward upon agreeing to get them back when he married Joan, as well as agreed on a dower of 2,000 silver marks.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.328\">Green (1850), p.328</ref> By the time all of these negotiations were finished, Joan was 12 years old.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.328\"/> Gilbert de Clare became very enamored with Joan, and even though she had to marry him regardless of how she felt, he still tried to woo her.<ref>Green (1850), p329.</ref> He bought her expensive gifts and clothing to try to win favor with her.<ref>Green 1850, p329</ref> The couple were married on 30 April 1290 at Westminster Abbey, and had four children together.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\">Oxford, p. 626</ref> They were:\n\n# [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford]]\n# [[Eleanor de Clare]]\n# [[Margaret de Clare]]\n# [[Elizabeth de Clare]]\n\nJoan's first husband, Gilbert de Clare, died on 7 December 1295.<ref name=\"Acre, Countess p. 626\">\"Joan or Joanna of Acre, Countess.\" Oxford, p. 626</ref>\n\n==Secret second marriage==\nJoan had been a widow for only a little over a year when she caught the eye of [[Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer|Ralph de Monthermer]], a squire in Joan's father's household.<ref>Green (1850), p.342</ref> Joan fell in love and convinced her father to have Monthermer knighted. It was unheard of in European royalty for a noble lady to even converse with a man who had not won or acquired importance in the household. However, Joan secretly married Ralph in January 1297.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.343\">Green (1850), p.343</ref> Joan's father was already planning another marriage for Joan to [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]],<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.343\"/> to occur on 16 March 1297. Being already married, unbeknownst to her father, Joan was in a dangerous predicament.\n\nJoan sent her four young children to their grandfather, in hopes that their sweetness would win Edward's favor, but her plan did not work.<ref>Green (1850) p.345</ref> The king soon discovered his daughter's intentions, but not yet aware that she had already committed to them,<ref name=\"Acre, Countess p. 626\"/> he seized Joan's lands and continued to arrange her marriage to Amadeus of Savoy.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> Soon after the seizure of her lands, Joan told her father that she had married Ralph. The king was enraged and retaliated by immediately imprisoning Monthermer at [[Bristol Castle]].<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> The people of the land had differing opinions on Joan's predicament. It has been argued that the noblemen who were most upset were those who wanted her hand in marriage.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.3\">Higginbotham (2009), p.3</ref>\n\nWith regard to the matter, Joan famously said, \"It is not considered ignominious, nor disgraceful, for a great earl to take a poor and mean woman to wife; neither, on the other hand, is it worthy of blame, or too difficult a thing for a countess to promote to honor a gallant youth.\"<ref>Green (1850), p. 347</ref> Coming at the time of a pregnancy which may have been obvious, Joan's statement seemed to soften Edward's attitude towards the situation.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.3\"/> Her first child by Monthermer was born in October 1297; by the summer of 1297, when the marriage was revealed to the king, Joan's condition would certainly have been apparent, helping to convince Edward that he had no choice but to recognize his daughter's second marriage. Edward I eventually relented, for the sake of his daughter, and released Monthermer from imprisonment in August 1297.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> Monthermer paid homage on 2 August, was granted the titles of [[Earl of Gloucester]] and [[Earl of Hertford]], and rose in the King's favour during Joan's lifetime.<ref name=\"Oxford, p.627\">Oxford, p.627</ref>\n\nMonthermer and Joan had four children:\n\n# [[Mary de Monthermer]], born October 1297. In 1306 her grandfather King Edward I arranged for her to marry [[Duncan Macduff, 8th Earl of Fife]].\n# Joan de Monthermer, born 1299, became a nun at [[Amesbury]].\n# [[Thomas de Monthermer, 2nd Baron Monthermer]], born 1301.\n# Edward de Monthermer, born 1304 and died 1339.\n\n== Relationship with family ==\nJoan of Acre was the seventh of Edward I and Eleanor's fourteen children. Most of her elder siblings died before the age of seven, and many of her younger siblings died before adulthood.<ref>Prestwich (1988), p.51</ref> Those who survived to adulthood were Joan, her younger brother, Edward of [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]] (later [[Edward II]]), and four of her sisters: [[Eleanor of England (1269-1298)|Eleanor]], [[Margaret of England (1275\u20131333)|Margaret]], [[Mary of Woodstock|Mary]], and [[Elizabeth of Rhuddlan|Elizabeth]].<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.52\">Prestwich (1988), p.52</ref>\n\nJoan, like her siblings, was raised outside her parents' household. She lived with her grandmother in Ponthieu for four years, and was then entrusted to the same caregivers who looked after her siblings.<ref>Higginbotham (2009), p.1</ref> Edward I did not have a close relationship with most of his children while they were growing up, yet \"he seemed fonder of his daughters than his sons.\"<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.52\"/>\n\nHowever, Joan of Acre's independent nature caused numerous conflicts with her father. Her father disapproved of her leaving court after her marriage to the Earl of Gloucester, and in turn \"seized seven robes that had been made for her\".<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\">Higginbotham (2009), p.2</ref> He also strongly disapproved of her second marriage to Ralph de Monthermer, a squire in her household, even to the point of attempting to force her to marry someone else.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\"/><ref>Prestwich (1988), p.54</ref> While Edward ultimately developed a cordial relationship with Monthermer, even granting him two earldoms,<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\"/> there appears to have been a notable difference in Edward's treatment of Joan as compared to the treatment of the rest of her siblings. For instance, her father famously paid messengers substantially when they brought news of the birth of grandchildren, but did not do this upon the birth of Joan's daughter.<ref>Prestwich (1988), p.55</ref>\n\nJoan retained a fairly tight bond with her siblings. She and Monthermer both maintained a close relationship with her brother, Edward, which was maintained through letters. After Edward became estranged from his father and lost his royal seal, \"Joan offered to lend him her seal\".<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.53\">Prestwich (1988), p.53</ref>\n\n==Death==\nJoan died on 23 April 1307, at the manor of Clare in Suffolk.<ref name=\"Oxford, p.627\"/> The cause of her death remains unclear, though one popular theory is that she died during childbirth, a common cause of death at the time. While Joan's age in 1307 (about 35) and the chronology of her earlier pregnancies with Ralph de Monthermer suggest that this could well be the case, historians have not confirmed the cause of her death.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\">Higginbotham (2009), p.4</ref>\n\nLess than four months after her death, Joan's father died. Joan's widower, Ralph de Monthermer, lost the title of Earl of Gloucester soon after the deaths of his wife and father-in-law. The earldom of Gloucester was given to Joan's son from her first marriage, Gilbert, who was its rightful holder. Monthermer continued to hold a nominal earldom in Scotland, which had been conferred on him by Edward I, until his death.\n\nJoan's burial place has been the cause of some interest and debate. She is interred in the Augustinian priory at Clare, which had been founded by her first husband's ancestors and where many of them were also buried. Allegedly, in 1357, Joan's daughter, Elizabeth De Burgh, claimed to have \"inspected her mother's body and found the corpse to be intact\",<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\"/> which in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church is an indication of sanctity. This claim was only recorded in a fifteenth-century chronicle, however, and its details are uncertain, especially the statement that her corpse was in such a state of preservation that \"when her [[Breasts|paps]] [breasts] were pressed with hands, they rose up again.\" Some sources further claim that miracles took place at Joan's tomb,<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\"/> but no cause for her [[beatification]] or [[canonization]] has ever been introduced.\n\n==Joan in fiction==\nJoan of Acre makes an appearance in Virginia Henley's historical romance ''Infamous''. In the book, Joan, known as Joanna, is described as a promiscuous young princess, vain, shallow and spoiled. In the novel she is only given one daughter, when she historically had eight children. There is no evidence that supports this picture of Joan.<ref>Higginbotham (2009) p.4</ref>\n\nIn ''The Love Knot'' by Vanessa Alexander, Joan of Acre is an important character. The author portrays a completely different view of the princess from the one in Henley's novel. ''The Love Knot'' tells the story of the love affair between Ralph de Monthermer and Joan of Acre through the discovery of a series of letters the two had written to each other.<ref>Higginbotham, (2009) p.5</ref>\n\nBetween historians and novelists, Joan has appeared in various texts as either an independent and spirited woman or a spoiled brat. In ''Lives of the Princesses of England'' by Mary Anne Everett Green, Joan is portrayed as a \"giddy princess\" and neglectful mother.<ref>Green (1850), p. 342</ref> Many have agreed to this characterization; however, some authors think there is little evidence to support the assumption that Joan of Acre was a neglectful or uncaring mother.<ref>Higginbotham (2009), p.5</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Joan of Acre<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|2010|p=viii}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=532\u2013536}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|p=574}}; {{harvnb|O'Callaghan|1975|p=681}}; {{harvnb|Durand|Cl\u00e9mencet|Dantine|1818|p=435}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2004}}; {{harvnb|Parsons|2004}}</ref>\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

The news reported that Hartman had fallen through a patch of shallow ice while \"amusing himself in skating\" while a letter sent to the King himself stated that Hartman had set out on a boat to visit his father amidst a terrible fog and the boat had smashed into a rock, drowning him.<ref>Green (1850), p.323</ref>\n\n==First marriage==\nEdward arranged a second marriage almost immediately after the death of Hartman.<ref>Oxford, p. 626.</ref> Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who was almost thirty years older than Joan and newly divorced, was his first choice.<ref>Green (1850), p.327</ref> The earl resigned his lands to Edward upon agreeing to get them back when he married Joan, as well as agreed on a dower of two thousand silver marks.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.328\">Green (1850), p.328</ref> By the time all of these negotiations were finished, Joan was twelve years old.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.328\"/> Gilbert de Clare became very enamored with Joan, and even though she had to marry him regardless of how she felt, he still tried to woo her.<ref>Green (1850), p329.</ref> He bought her expensive gifts and clothing to try to win favor with her.<ref>Green 1850, p329</ref> The couple were married on 30 April 1290 at Westminster Abbey, and had four children together.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\">Oxford, p. 626</ref> They were:\n\n# [[Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Hertford]]\n# [[Eleanor de Clare]]\n# [[Margaret de Clare]]\n# [[Elizabeth de Clare]]\n\nJoan's first husband, Gilbert de Clare died on 7 December 1295.<ref name=\"Acre, Countess p. 626\">\"Joan or Joanna of Acre, Countess.\" Oxford, p. 626</ref>\n\n==Secret second marriage==\nJoan had been a widow for only a little over a year when she caught the eye of [[Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer|Ralph de Monthermer]], a squire in Joan's father's household.<ref>Green (1850), p.342</ref> Joan fell in love and convinced her father to have Monthermer knighted. It was unheard of in European royalty for a noble lady to even converse with a man who had not won or acquired importance in the household. However, Joan secretly married Ralph in January 1297.<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.343\">Green (1850), p.343</ref> Joan's father was already planning another marriage for Joan to [[Amadeus V, Count of Savoy]],<ref name=\"Green 1850, p.343\"/> to occur on 16 March 1297. Being already married, unbeknownst to her father, Joan was in a dangerous predicament.\n\nJoan sent her four young children to their grandfather, in hopes that their sweetness would win Edward's favor, but her plan did not work.<ref>Green (1850) p.345</ref> The king soon discovered his daughter's intentions, but not yet aware that she had already committed to them,<ref name=\"Acre, Countess p. 626\"/> he seized Joan's lands and continued to arrange her marriage to Amadeus of Savoy.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> Soon after the seizure of her lands, Joan told her father that she had married Ralph. The king was enraged and retaliated by immediately imprisoning Monthermer at [[Bristol Castle]].<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> The people of the land had differing opinions on Joan's predicament. It has been argued that the noblemen who were most upset were those who wanted her hand in marriage.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.3\">Higginbotham (2009), p.3</ref>\n\nWith regard to the matter, Joan famously said, \"It is not considered ignominious, nor disgraceful, for a great earl to take a poor and mean woman to wife; neither, on the other hand, is it worthy of blame, or too difficult a thing for a countess to promote to honor a gallant youth.\"<ref>Green (1850), p. 347</ref> Coming at the time of a pregnancy which may have been obvious, Joan's statement seemed to soften Edward's attitude towards the situation.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.3\"/> Her first child by Monthermer was born in October 1297; by the summer of 1297, when the marriage was revealed to the king, Joan's condition would certainly have been apparent, helping to convince Edward that he had no choice but to recognize his daughter's second marriage. Edward I eventually relented, for the sake of his daughter, and released Monthermer from imprisonment in August 1297.<ref name=\"Oxford, p. 626\"/> Monthermer paid homage on 2 August, was granted the titles of [[Earl of Gloucester]] and [[Earl of Hertford]], and rose in the King's favour during Joan's lifetime.<ref name=\"Oxford, p.627\">Oxford, p.627</ref>\n\nMonthermer and Joan had four children:\n\n# [[Mary de Monthermer]], born October 1297. In 1306 her grandfather King Edward I arranged for her to marry [[Duncan Macduff, 8th Earl of Fife]].\n# Joan de Monthermer, born 1299, became a nun at [[Amesbury]].\n# [[Thomas de Monthermer, 2nd Baron Monthermer]], born 1301.\n# Edward de Monthermer, born 1304 and died 1339.\n\n== Relationship with family ==\nJoan of Acre was the seventh of Edward I and Eleanor's fourteen children. Most of her elder siblings died before the age of seven, and many of her younger siblings died before adulthood.<ref>Prestwich (1988), p.51</ref> Those who survived to adulthood were Joan, her younger brother, Edward of [[Caernarfon Castle|Caernarfon]] (later [[Edward II]]), and four of her sisters: [[Eleanor of England (1269-1298)|Eleanor]], [[Margaret of England (1275\u20131333)|Margaret]], [[Mary of Woodstock|Mary]], and [[Elizabeth of Rhuddlan|Elizabeth]].<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.52\">Prestwich (1988), p.52</ref>\n\nJoan, like her siblings, was raised outside her parents' household. She lived with her grandmother in Ponthieu for four years, and was then entrusted to the same caregivers who looked after her siblings.<ref>Higginbotham (2009), p.1</ref> Edward I did not have a close relationship with most of his children while they were growing up, yet \"he seemed fonder of his daughters than his sons.\"<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.52\"/>\n\nHowever, Joan of Acre's independent nature caused numerous conflicts with her father. Her father disapproved of her leaving court after her marriage to the Earl of Gloucester, and in turn \"seized seven robes that had been made for her\".<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\">Higginbotham (2009), p.2</ref> He also strongly disapproved of her second marriage to Ralph de Monthermer, a squire in her household, even to the point of attempting to force her to marry someone else.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\"/><ref>Prestwich (1988), p.54</ref> While Edward ultimately developed a cordial relationship with Monthermer, even granting him two earldoms,<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.2\"/> there appears to have been a notable difference in Edward's treatment of Joan as compared to the treatment of the rest of her siblings. For instance, her father famously paid messengers substantially when they brought news of the birth of grandchildren, but did not do this upon the birth of Joan's daughter.<ref>Prestwich (1988), p.55</ref>\n\nJoan retained a fairly tight bond with her siblings. She and Monthermer both maintained a close relationship with her brother, Edward, which was maintained through letters. After Edward became estranged from his father and lost his royal seal, \"Joan offered to lend him her seal\".<ref name=\"Prestwich 1988, p.53\">Prestwich (1988), p.53</ref>\n\n==Death==\nJoan died on 23 April 1307, at the manor of Clare in Suffolk.<ref name=\"Oxford, p.627\"/> The cause of her death remains unclear, though one popular theory is that she died during childbirth, a common cause of death at the time. While Joan's age in 1307 (about 35) and the chronology of her earlier pregnancies with Ralph de Monthermer suggest that this could well be the case, historians have not confirmed the cause of her death.<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\">Higginbotham (2009), p.4</ref>\n\nLess than four months after her death, Joan's father died. Joan's widower, Ralph de Monthermer, lost the title of Earl of Gloucester soon after the deaths of his wife and father-in-law. The earldom of Gloucester was given to Joan's son from her first marriage, Gilbert, who was its rightful holder. Monthermer continued to hold a nominal earldom in Scotland, which had been conferred on him by Edward I, until his death.\n\nJoan's burial place has been the cause of some interest and debate. She is interred in the Augustinian priory at Clare, which had been founded by her first husband's ancestors and where many of them were also buried. Allegedly, in 1357, Joan's daughter, Elizabeth De Burgh, claimed to have \"inspected her mother's body and found the corpse to be intact\",<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\"/> which in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church is an indication of sanctity. This claim was only recorded in a fifteenth-century chronicle, however, and its details are uncertain, especially the statement that her corpse was in such a state of preservation that \"when her [[Breasts|paps]] [breasts] were pressed with hands, they rose up again.\" Some sources further claim that miracles took place at Joan's tomb,<ref name=\"Higginbotham 2009, p.4\"/> but no cause for her [[beatification]] or [[canonization]] has ever been introduced.\n\n==Joan in fiction==\nJoan of Acre makes an appearance in Virginia Henley's historical romance ''Infamous''. In the book, Joan, known as Joanna, is described as a promiscuous young princess, vain, shallow and spoiled. In the novel she is only given one daughter, when she historically had eight children. There is no evidence that supports this picture of Joan.<ref>Higginbotham (2009) p.4</ref>\n\nIn ''The Love Knot'' by Vanessa Alexander, Joan of Acre is an important character. The author portrays a completely different view of the princess from the one in Henley's novel. ''The Love Knot'' tells the story of the love affair between Ralph de Monthermer and Joan of Acre through the discovery of a series of letters the two had written to each other.<ref>Higginbotham, (2009) p.5</ref>\n\nBetween historians and novelists, Joan has appeared in various texts as either an independent and spirited woman or a spoiled brat. In ''Lives of the Princesses of England'' by Mary Anne Everett Green, Joan is portrayed as a \"giddy princess\" and neglectful mother.<ref>Green (1850), p. 342</ref> Many have agreed to this characterization; however, some authors think there is little evidence to support the assumption that Joan of Acre was a neglectful or uncaring mother.<ref>Higginbotham (2009), p.5</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Joan of Acre<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|2010|p=viii}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=532\u2013536}}; {{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|p=574}}; {{harvnb|O'Callaghan|1975|p=681}}; {{harvnb|Durand|Cl\u00e9mencet|Dantine|1818|p=435}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2004}}; {{harvnb|Parsons|2004}}</ref>\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

Lady's Secret was bred by Robert H. Spreen at Lucas Farm in Oklahoma. Spreen sold her for $200,000 to Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Klein (former owner of the San Diego Chargers), and she was prepared for racing by Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. She was a small horse, weighing no more than about 900 pounds.\n\n==Breeding and background==\nLady's Secret was sired by [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S. Triple Crown]] champion [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] and out of Great Lady M., a daughter of Icecapade who was a half brother to [[Ruffian (horse)|Ruffian]]. Lady's Secret was also closely related to Ruffian on her sire's side since Secretariat and Reviewer (Ruffian's sire) shared a sire in Bold Ruler. \n\nLady's Secret was bred by Robert H. Spreen at Lucas Farm in [[Oklahoma]]. Spreen sold her for $200,000 to [[Eugene V. Klein|Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Klein]] (former owner of the [[San Diego Chargers]]), and she was prepared for racing by Hall of Fame trainer [[D. Wayne Lukas]]. She was a small horse, weighing no more than about 900 pounds.\n\n==Racing record==\nLady's Secret, who was a front runner, won twenty-five of her forty-five races and had nine second-place finishes. The daughter of Secretariat dominated the fillies she raced against and was also competitive against males.\n\nAfter winning the [[Moccasin Stakes]] at age two, Lady's Secret won three important races at age three, including two [[Graded stakes race|Grade I]] events, and ran second to stablemate [[Life's Magic]] in the 1985 [[Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic|Breeders' Cup Distaff]]. In 1986, four-year-old Lady's Secret defeated the nation's best male horses four times, winning ten of her fifteen starts that season, all [[graded stakes race]]s.  Eight of these stakes wins were Grade 1 events, a single-season Grade 1 winning record only equaled by the champion [[Cigar (horse)|Cigar]] during his undefeated 1995 campaign.  Nicknamed \"The Iron Lady,\" Lady's Secret was the first female to win the [[Whitney Stakes]] since [[Gallorette]] in 1948.  She finished her year by winning the [[Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic|Breeders' Cup Distaff]] with [[Pat Day]] aboard. Her lifetime earnings equaled $3,021,325.\n\nHer performance throughout the 1986 racing season earned her the [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Female Horse]] plus the most prestigious honor of all, and a rarity for fillies, the [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year]] for 1986. Lady's Secret is ranked at number 76 by [[Blood-Horse magazine|''Blood-Horse'' magazine]] in their list of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century|Top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century]].\n\n==Stud record==\nRetired at age five, in 1989 Lady's Secret was sold to [[Fares Farm]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], as a [[broodmare]].  She and Azeri are the only two female winners of the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year to have produced foals by more than one stallion who was also Horse of the Year (Lady's Secret produced foals by [[Seattle Slew]] and [[Skip Away]]).  Lady's Secret died suddenly on March 4, 2003 at Valley Creek Farm in [[Valley Center, California|Valley Center]], [[California]], as a result of complications in foaling.  She produced 12 foals, with 10 starters and 5 winners. None of her progeny were of particular note.\n\nIn 1992, Lady's Secret was inducted into the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]]. The Lady's Secret Caf\u00e9 at [[Monmouth Park Racetrack]] in [[Oceanport, New Jersey]] is named in her honor.

Lady's Secret was bred by Robert H. Spreen at Lucas Farm in Oklahoma. Spreen sold her for $200,000 to Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Klein (former owner of the San Diego Chargers), and she was prepared for racing by Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. She was a small horse, weighing no more than about 900 pounds.\n\n==Breeding and background==\nLady\u2019s Secret was sired by [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S. Triple Crown]] champion [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] and out of Great Lady M.  Great Lady M was a daughter Icecapade, who was a half brother to Ruffian. Lady's Secret was also closely related to Ruffian on her sire\u2019s side since Secretariat and Reviewer (Ruffian's sire) shared a sire in Bold Ruler. \n\nLady's Secret was bred by Robert H. Spreen at Lucas Farm in [[Oklahoma]]. Spreen sold her for $200,000 to [[Eugene V. Klein|Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Klein]] (former owner of the [[San Diego Chargers]]), and she was prepared for racing by Hall of Fame trainer [[D. Wayne Lukas]]. She was a small horse, weighing no more than about 900 pounds.\n\n==Racing record==\nLady's Secret, who was a front runner, won twenty-five of her forty-five races and had nine second-place finishes. The daughter of Secretariat dominated the fillies she raced against and was also competitive against males.\n\nAfter winning the [[Moccasin Stakes]] at age two, Lady's Secret won three important races at age three, including two [[Graded stakes race|Grade I]] events, and ran second to stablemate [[Life's Magic]] in the 1985 [[Breeders' Cup Ladies' Classic|Breeders' Cup Distaff]]. In 1986, four-year-old Lady's Secret defeated the nation's best male horses four times, winning ten of her fifteen starts that season, all [[graded stakes race]]s.  Eight of these stakes wins were Grade 1 events, a single-season Grade 1 winning record only equaled by the champion [[Cigar (horse)|Cigar]] during his undefeated 1995 campaign.  Nicknamed \"The Iron Lady,\" Lady's Secret was the first female to win the [[Whitney Stakes]] since [[Gallorette]] in 1948.  She finished her year by winning the [[Breeders' Cup Ladies Classic|Breeders' Cup Distaff]] with [[Pat Day]] aboard. Her lifetime earnings equaled $3,021,325.\n\nHer performance throughout the 1986 racing season earned her the [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Female Horse]] plus the most prestigious honor of all, and a rarity for fillies, the [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year]] for 1986. Lady's Secret is ranked at number 76 by [[Blood-Horse magazine|''Blood-Horse'' magazine]] in their list of the [[Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century|Top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century]].\n\n==Stud record==\nRetired at age five, in 1989 Lady's Secret was sold to [[Fares Farm]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], as a [[broodmare]].  She and Azeri are the only two female winners of the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year to have produced foals by more than one stallion who was also Horse of the Year (Lady's Secret produced foals by [[Seattle Slew]] and [[Skip Away]]).  Lady's Secret died suddenly on March 4, 2003 at Valley Creek Farm in [[Valley Center, California|Valley Center]], [[California]], as a result of complications in foaling.  She produced 12 foals, with 10 starters and 5 winners. None of her progeny were of particular note.\n\nIn 1992, Lady's Secret was inducted into the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]]. The Lady's Secret Caf\u00e9 at [[Monmouth Park Racetrack]] in [[Oceanport, New Jersey]] is named in her honor.

As well as serving in this role it also provided specialist engineer units in both World Wars, losing many men in a shipping disaster during the [[Battle of Greece|Greek Campaign]]. Its descendants continued to serve in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] until 1967.\n\n==Origin==\nWhen [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Lt-Gen Sir Andrew Clarke]], Inspector-General of Fortifications 1882\u20136, did not have enough Regular [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) to man the [[Controlled mines|fixed mines]] being installed to defend British seaports, he utilised the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] Engineers for this task. After successful trials the system was rolled out to ports around the country.<ref>Beckett, pp. 184\u20135.</ref><ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 1\u20134.</ref> In October 1884 the [[1st Lancashire Engineers|1st Lancashire Engineer Volunteer Corps]] at [[Edge Hill, Liverpool]] formed K Company to cover the [[Mersey Estuary]].

No 1 (EL) Company was employed on the Mersey defences, No 2 (EL) Company went to Ireland to assist on the defences of [[Lough Swilly]] and [[Cobh|Queenstown]], and No 3 (Works) Company went to [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]] where it worked alongside civilian labour and nearby training units to dig coastal earthworks and trenches to defend Liverpool.<ref name = McGreal/> In the event, Britain's coast defences were hardly tested during the war, but the Lancashire Fortress Engineers provided units and personnel for other roles at home and overseas.\n\nOn the outbreak of war, units of the [[Territorial Force]] were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. Later, many of these were mobilised for overseas service in their own right.<ref>Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.</ref>\n\n===1/3rd Lancashire Company===\nAfter completing the Liverpool defences in December 1914, 1/3rd (Works) Company was sent to [[Malta]], where TF units were relieving the regular garrison for active service elsewhere.<ref name = McGreal/> Then in 1915 the company was sent on again to join the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. It served at [[Cape Helles]] until September, when it was withdrawn to the offshore base on the island of [[Imbros]] where it was engaged in erecting workshops and sinking ships for breakwaters.<ref>1/3rd Lancashire Company War Diary, 1915, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]] file WO 95/4356.</ref>\n\nAfter the Allied evacuation from Gallipoli the company went to Egypt, where it was designated the '''3rd Lancashire Army Troops Company'''. It served with the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] (EEF) as Line of Communication troops in April 1916, then as Corps troops on the [[Suez Canal]] defences.<ref name = GWF>[http://1914-1918.invisionzone.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=192181 555 AT Co RE at Great War Forum]</ref> When the TF units of the RE were given numbers in February 1917, it became the '''555th (Lancashire) Army Troops Company'''.<ref name = GWF/><ref name = REWD>[http://www.re-museum.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Library-War-Diaries-WW1.pdf RE Museum list of war diaries]</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 63.</ref>\n\nIn February 1917 the company joined the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine Campaign]] attached to the [[Desert Mounted Corps|Desert Mounted Column]], then from May 1917 until early 1919 it was working on the Lines of Communications.<ref name = GWF/> During the final advance of the EEF in 1918 the company was in the vicinity of Ludd ([[Lod]]), engaged in quarrying, road repair and bridging [[Wadi]]s.<ref>555 AT Co War Diary, 1918, TNA file WO 95/4730.</ref>\n\n===2/3rd Lancashire Company===\nIn November 1916 the 2/3rd Fortress Company was assigned to [[71st Division (United Kingdom)|71st Division]], a newly formed Home Service division assembling in [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]], which it joined in December. The company was numbered the '''549th (Lancashire) Field Company''' in February 1917. The following month the division moved to the East Coast and concentrated at [[Colchester]], where it formed part of [[Southern Army (Home Forces)|Southern Army]] of Home Forces and was responsible for defending the [[Essex]] coast from [[Mersea Island]] to [[Walton-on-the-Naze]].<ref name = Becke71>Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 101\u20135</ref><ref name = W&R70>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 70.</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 62.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of 1917 the War Office decided to break up the Home Service divisions to provide reinforcements for other formations. This was carried out by February 1918 and in March the 549th Company was redesignated as an Army Troops Company. It embarked for France on 22 June to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], disembarking at [[Le Havre]]. Primarily engaged in constructing dug-outs and protected machine-gun positions during the summer, it successively served under [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First]] and [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]], with [[XVII Corps (United Kingdom)|XVII Corps]] in September 1918 and finally [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] by the time of the [[Armistice with Germany]] in November 1918.<ref name = REWD/><ref name = Becke71/><ref name = W&R70/><ref name = 549WD>549 Company War Diary, 1918\u201319, TNA file WO 95/403.</ref><ref>'Embarkation Dates', TNA file WO 162/7.</ref><ref<Rinaldi, pp. 20, 24.</ref>\n\nThe commanding officer complained in October about the constant moves, pointing out that the unit had little transport with which to move its equipment. That month the company was in the [[Cambrai]] area carrying out repairs. Even the Armistice did not end the company's work: through the winter it was still engaged in repairs, and erecting hutting for demobilisation camps near [[Doullens]] and then at [[Antwerp]], where its own demobilisation began during the Spring of 1919.\n\n===Anti-Aircraft Companies===\nIn addition to operating searchlights for the coastal defence guns, the electric light companies of the fortress engineers began to use them in the Anti-Aircraft (AA) role. As the war progressed and raids by airships and fixed wing bombers became more frequent, the RE formed specialist AA Searchlight Companies. By mid-1916 the Lancashire Fortress Engineers had provided the personnel for '''No 5 (Lancashire) AA Company, RE'''. As the AA defences of the UK expanded, this became Nos '''49''' and '''51 AA Companies RE''', based in Manchester and Liverpool respectively. In January 1918 the AA defences were reorganised and the RE searchlight personnel were attached directly to AA gun companies of the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]]. By May 1918 the Lancashire AA units formed part of Northern Air Defences (NAD). At this stage of the war the NAD was barely troubled by German raids, and most of the men of medical category A1 had been withdrawn from AA duties and sent to join the BEF.<ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 128, 143, 145\u20136, 151.</ref>\n\n==Interwar==\nWhen the TF was reconstituted as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in 1920, the Lancashire (Fortress) RE reformed as single Electric Light & Works company in [[55th (West Lancashire) Division|55th (West Lancashire) Divisional Area]].<ref name = Regts/><ref>''Titles and Designations'', 1927.</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 104.</ref> By the end of the 1930s the company was sharing its Tramway Road HQ with the [[3rd West Lancashire Artillery|70th (3rd West Lancashire) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]].<ref name = MAL>''Monthly Army Lists''</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Mobilisation===\nIn August 1939, prior to the outbreak of war, No 1 (EL & Works) Company, Lancashire Fortress RE, was mobilised at Tramway Road and detachments and went to their war stations at [[Fort Crosby]],  [[Hightown, Merseyside|Hightown]], and [[Fort Perch Rock]], [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], as part of Fixed Defences Mersey (FDM). Shortly after the declaration of war it also manned [[Barrow Blitz#Artillery and defences|Fort Walney]] at [[Barrow-in-Furness]]. The detachments operated generators and searchlights and attended to wiring.<ref name = LFEWD>Lancashire Fortress Engineers War Diary, 1939\u201340, TNA file WO 166/3550.</ref>\n\nIn May 1940 the unit (less small detachments left to man the lights) was withdrawn from the coastal defence forts and concentrated at Tramway Road to become '''580th (Lancashire) Army Troops Company'''. It then moved to a series of billets and camps around the country.<ref name = LFEWD/><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 171, 186.</ref><ref>580 (Lancs) AT Co War Diary, May 1940, TNA file WO 166/3817.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of January 1941, the company embarked at [[Glasgow]], and sailed via [[Gibraltar]], [[Freetown]] and [[Cape Town]] to [[Port Tewfik]] on the Suez Canal, where it disembarked on 4 March, with a strength of 4 officers and 264 other ranks.<ref name = 580WD>580 (Lancs) AT Co War Diary, 1941, TNA file WO 169/1914.</ref>\n\n===Greece===\nIn March 1941, [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] sent troops to assist the Greek Army against a probable German invasion.

As well as serving in this role it also provided specialist engineer units in both World Wars, losing many men in a shipping disaster during the [[Battle of Greece|Greek Campaign]]. Its descendants continued to serve in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] until 1967.\n\n==Origin==\nWhen [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer)|Lt-Gen Sir Andrew Clarke]], Inspector-General of Fortifications 1882\u20136, did not have enough Regular [[Royal Engineers]] (RE) to man the [[Controlled mines|fixed mines]] being installed to defend British seaports, he utilised the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer]] Engineers for this task. After successful trials the system was rolled out to ports around the country.<ref>Beckett, pp. 184\u20135.</ref><ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 1\u20134.</ref> In October 1884 the [[1st Lancashire Engineers|1st Lancashire Engineer Volunteer Corps]] at [[Edge Hill, Liverpool]] formed K Company to cover the [[Mersey Estuary]].

No 1 (EL) Company was employed on the Mersey defences, No 2 (EL) Company went to Ireland to assist on the defences of [[Lough Swilly]] and [[Cobh|Queenstown]], and No 3 (Works) Company went to [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]] where it worked alongside civilian labour and nearby training units to dig coastal earthworks and trenches to defend Liverpool.<ref name = McGreal/> In the event, Britain's coast defences were hardly tested during the war, but the Lancashire Fortress Engineers provided units and personnel for other roles at home and overseas.\n\nOn the outbreak of war, units of the [[Territorial Force]] were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. Later, many of these were mobilised for overseas service in their own right.<ref>Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.</ref>\n\n===1/3rd Lancashire Company===\nAfter completing the Liverpool defences in December 1914, 1/3rd (Works) Company was sent to [[Malta]], where TF units were relieving the regular garrison for active service elsewhere.<ref name = McGreal/> Then in 1915 the company was sent on again to join the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. It served at [[Cape Helles]] until September, when it was withdrawn to the offshore base on the island of [[Imbros]] where it was engaged in erecting workshops and sinking ships for breakwaters.<ref>1/3rd Lancashire Company War Diary, 1915, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives (TNA), Kew]] file WO 95/4356.</ref>\n\nAfter the Allied evacuation from Gallipoli the company went to Egypt, where it was designated the '''3rd Lancashire Army Troops Company'''.

The company was numbered the '''549th (Lancashire) Field Company''' in February 1917. The following month the division moved to the East Coast and concentrated at [[Colchester]], where it formed part of [[Southern Army (Home Forces)|Southern Army]] of Home Forces and was responsible for defending the [[Essex]] coast from [[Mersea Island]] to [[Walton-on-the-Naze]].<ref name = Becke71>Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 101\u20135</ref><ref name = W&R70>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 70.</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 62.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of 1917 the War Office decided to break up the Home Service divisions to provide reinforcements for other formations. This was carried out by February 1918 and in March the 549th Company was redesignated as an Army Troops Company. It embarked for France on 22 June to join the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], disembarking at [[Le Havre]]. Primarily engaged in constructing dug-outs and protected machine-gun positions during the summer, it successively served under [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First]] and [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)|Fifth Army]], with [[XVII Corps (United Kingdom)|XVII Corps]] in September 1918 and finally [[Third Army (United Kingdom)|Third Army]] by the time of the [[Armistice with Germany]] in November 1918.<ref name = REWD/><ref name = Becke71/><ref name = W&R70/><ref name = 549WD>549 Company War Diary, 1918\u201319, TNA file WO 95/403.</ref><ref>'Embarkation Dates', TNA file WO 162/7.</ref><ref<Rinaldi, pp. 20, 24.</ref>\n\nThe commanding officer complained in October about the constant moves, pointing out that the unit had little transport with which to move its equipment. That month the company was in the [[Cambrai]] area carrying out repairs. Even the Armistice did not end the company's work: through the winter it was still engaged in repairs, and erecting hutting for demobilisation camps near [[Doullens]] and then at [[Antwerp]], where its own demobilisation began during the Spring of 1919.\n\n===Anti-Aircraft Companies===\nIn addition to operating searchlights for the coastal defence guns, the electric light companies of the fortress engineers began to use them in the Anti-Aircraft (AA) role. As the war progressed and raids by airships and fixed wing bombers became more frequent, the RE formed specialist AA Searchlight Companies. By mid-1916 the Lancashire Fortress Engineers had provided the personnel for '''No 5 (Lancashire) AA Company, RE'''. As the AA defences of the UK expanded, this became Nos '''49''' and '''51 AA Companies RE''', based in Manchester and Liverpool respectively. In January 1918 the AA defences were reorganised and the RE searchlight personnel were attached directly to AA gun companies of the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]]. By May 1918 the Lancashire AA units formed part of Northern Air Defences (NAD). At this stage of the war the NAD was barely troubled by German raids, and most of the men of medical category A1 had been withdrawn from AA duties and sent to join the BEF.<ref>Short ''et al.'', pp. 128, 143, 145\u20136, 151.</ref>\n\n==Interwar==\nWhen the TF was reconstituted as the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] in 1920, the Lancashire (Fortress) RE reformed as single Electric Light & Works company in [[55th (West Lancashire) Division|55th (West Lancashire) Divisional Area]].<ref name = Regts/><ref>''Titles and Designations'', 1927.</ref><ref>Watson & Rinaldi, p. 104.</ref> By the end of the 1930s the company was sharing its Tramway Road HQ with the [[3rd West Lancashire Artillery|70th (3rd West Lancashire) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery]].<ref name = MAL>''Monthly Army Lists''</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Mobilisation===\nIn August 1939, prior to the outbreak of war, No 1 (EL & Works) Company, Lancashire Fortress RE, was mobilised at Tramway Road and detachments and went to their war stations at [[Fort Crosby]],  [[Hightown, Merseyside|Hightown]], and [[Fort Perch Rock]], [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], as part of Fixed Defences Mersey (FDM). Shortly after the declaration of war it also manned [[Barrow Blitz#Artillery and defences|Fort Walney]] at [[Barrow-in-Furness]].

The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] lists the global [[conservation status]] of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have [[Environmental law|law]]s that protect [[conservation-reliant species]] which, for example, forbid [[hunting]], restrict [[land development]], or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as [[captive breeding]] and [[habitat restoration]].\n\n== Conservation status ==\n{{main|Conservation status}}\n\nThe [[conservation status]] of a [[species]] indicates the likelihood that it will become [[extinct]].

Those species of \"[[Near-threatened species|Near Threatened]]\"&nbsp;(NT) and \"[[Least concern|Least Concern]]\"&nbsp;(LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms \"endangered species\" and \"threatened species\" with particular meanings: \"Endangered\"&nbsp;(EN) species lie between \"[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]\"&nbsp;(VU) and \"[[Critically Endangered species|Critically Endangered]]\"&nbsp;(CR) species.

The [[Salt Creek tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela nevadica lincolniana'') is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species. Also, they are also responsible for adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p.&nbsp;414).\n\nSome endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and rules for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered. Whether restrictions on land development constitute a \"taking\" of land by the [[government]]; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their areas; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from [[hunting|hunters]] and various industries like the [[petroleum industry]], [[construction]] industry, and [[logging]], has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.\n\nThe [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the [[Obama administration]], this policy has been reinstated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/news/news releases/showNews.cfm?newsId=EE78C309-C119-D9DC-042421265ACD62A4|title=FWS.gov|author=|date=|website=fws.gov}}</ref>\n\nBeing listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Courchamp |first=Franck |author2=Elena Angulo |author3=Philippe Rivalan |author4=Richard J.

Actions have been taken to attempt a reduction in whaling and increase population sizes.  The actions include prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).  But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as [[Japan]] continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of \"scientific purposes\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Bill |title=Endangered species |journal=Gale |volume=46 |issue=44 |pages=25 |year=2008 |edition=4th|pmid=30399289 }}</ref> Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list.

Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases, the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases, a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chiras |first=Daniel D. |title=Invader Species |url=http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3753825|journal=Grolier |year=2011 |series=Online}}</ref>\n\n== Conservation ==\n[[File:Dhole.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[dhole]], Asia's most endangered [[top predator]], is on the edge of extinction.]]\n\n===Captive breeding===\n{{main|Captive breeding}}\nCaptive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos, and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilise the population of the species that it will not disappear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/EndangeredSpecies/CapBreedPops/default.cfm |title=Captive Breeding Populations - National Zoo |publisher=Nationalzoo.si.edu |accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref>\n\nThis technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the [[P\u00e8re David's deer]]. However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. [[hilsa]]). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced [[gene pool]] and reduce [[immunity (medical)|resistance]].\n\nIn 1981, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) created a [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP) to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding.  With over 450 SSP Plans, some endangered species are covered by the AZA with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population, created by Taxon Advisory Groups.  These programs are commonly created as a last resort effort. SSP Programs regularly participate in species recovery, veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks, and some other wildlife conservation efforts.  The AZA's Species Survival Plan also has breeding and transfer programs, both within and outside of AZA - certified zoos and aquariums.  Some animals that are part of SSP programs are [[giant pandas]], lowland gorillas, and [[California condors]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =https://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|archive-url =https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090803071836/http://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|url-status =dead|archive-date =2009-08-03|title =Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Programs}}</ref>\n\n===Private farming===\n[[File:Ostafrikanisches Spitzmaulnashorn.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Black rhino]]\n[[File:Thmac u0.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Southern bluefin tuna]]\nWhereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations, legal, for-profit, private farming does the opposite.

Those species of \"[[Near-threatened species|Near Threatened]]\"&nbsp;(NT) and \"[[Least concern|Least Concern]]\"&nbsp;(LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms \"endangered species\" and \"threatened species\" with particular meanings: \"Endangered\"&nbsp;(EN) species lie between \"[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]\"&nbsp;(VU) and \"[[Critically Endangered species|Critically Endangered]]\"&nbsp;(CR) species. In 2012, the IUCN Red List listed 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered (EN) worldwide.[1]\n\n== Endangered species in the United States ==\nThere is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species (DEMES) database and the period that the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Shogren|editor1-first=Jason F.|editor2-last=Tschirhart|editor2-first=John|title=Protecting Endangered Species in the United States: Biological Needs, Political Realities, Economic Choices|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521662109|pages=1}}</ref>\n[[File:U.S. Endangered Species Count by State.gif|thumb|A proportional symbol map of each state's endangered species count.]]\n\n===Endangered Species Act===\n[[File:Status ESA LE.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|\"Endangered\" in relation to \"threatened\" under the ESA.]]\nUnder the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] in the [[United States]], species may be listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\". The [[Salt Creek tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela nevadica lincolniana'') is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species. Also, they are also responsible for adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p.&nbsp;414).\n\nSome endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and rules for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered. Whether restrictions on land development constitute a \"taking\" of land by the [[government]]; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their areas; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from [[hunting|hunters]] and various industries like the [[petroleum industry]], [[construction]] industry, and [[logging]], has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.\n\nThe [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the [[Obama administration]], this policy has been reinstated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/news/news releases/showNews.cfm?newsId=EE78C309-C119-D9DC-042421265ACD62A4|title=FWS.gov|author=|date=|website=fws.gov}}</ref>\n\nBeing listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Courchamp |first=Franck |author2=Elena Angulo |author3=Philippe Rivalan |author4=Richard J.

Actions have been taken to attempt a reduction in whaling and increase population sizes.  The actions include prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).  But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as [[Japan]] continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of \"scientific purposes\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Bill |title=Endangered species |journal=Gale |volume=46 |issue=44 |pages=25 |year=2008 |edition=4th|pmid=30399289 }}</ref> Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list.

Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases, the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases, a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chiras |first=Daniel D. |title=Invader Species |url=http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3753825|journal=Grolier |year=2011 |series=Online}}</ref>\n\n== Conservation ==\n[[File:Dhole.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[dhole]], Asia's most endangered [[top predator]], is on the edge of extinction.]]\n\n===Captive breeding===\n{{main|Captive breeding}}\nCaptive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos, and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilise the population of the species that it will not disappear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/EndangeredSpecies/CapBreedPops/default.cfm |title=Captive Breeding Populations - National Zoo |publisher=Nationalzoo.si.edu |accessdate=2009-12-06}}</ref>\n\nThis technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the [[P\u00e8re David's deer]]. However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. [[hilsa]]). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced [[gene pool]] and reduce [[immunity (medical)|resistance]].\n\nIn 1981, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) created a [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP) to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding.  With over 450 SSP Plans, some endangered species are covered by the AZA with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population, created by Taxon Advisory Groups.  These programs are commonly created as a last resort effort. SSP Programs regularly participate in species recovery, veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks, and some other wildlife conservation efforts.  The AZA's Species Survival Plan also has breeding and transfer programs, both within and outside of AZA - certified zoos and aquariums.  Some animals that are part of SSP programs are [[giant pandas]], lowland gorillas, and [[California condors]].<ref>{{Cite web|url =https://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|archive-url =https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090803071836/http://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|url-status =dead|archive-date =2009-08-03|title =Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Programs}}</ref>\n\n===Private farming===\n[[File:Ostafrikanisches Spitzmaulnashorn.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Black rhino]]\n[[File:Thmac u0.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Southern bluefin tuna]]\nWhereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations, legal, for-profit, private farming does the opposite.

Dr Richard Emslie, a scientific officer at the IUCN, said of such programs, \"Effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned... We have been able to bring local communities into conservation programs.

Many early settlers of Wauconda came from [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] by [[covered wagon]] or through the [[Erie Canal]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\">{{cite web|title=History of Wauconda {{!}} Wauconda, IL|url=https://wauconda-il.gov/217/History-of-Wauconda|website=wauconda-il.gov|accessdate=9 May 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nElihu Hubbard built the first log cabin on the bank of [[Bangs Lake]] in 1836. Justus Bangs, the first settler in Wauconda, built a house next to the lake in 1848 and the lake was later named after him. In 1840, members of the [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] tribe who did not leave the shores of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]] often went to the area to trade. In 1849, Wauconda was formally organized and the first town meeting was held in April 1850 on the first Tuesday.<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\" />\n\nWauconda's first school was built in 1839 and the area's post office was moved to Wauconda on June 27, 1849, with Hazard Green becoming its first postmaster.<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\" />\n\nElder Joel Wheeler of [[McHenry, Illinois|McHenry]] built the first [[Baptists|Baptist]] church in Wauconda in the autumn of 1838. A [[Methodism|Methodist]] church was organized on September 3, 1852 by Reverend C. French, and built in 1856 on the Commons. Both Methodists and Baptists attended prayer at the church until February 1870, when the Baptists reorganized and built a new church on October 30, 1870. A [[Roman Catholic church]] was built in 1877 and its first trustees were James Murray, Charles Davlin, Felix Givens, Hugh Davlin, and Owen McMahon. Its first priest was Father O'Neil.<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\" />\n\nIn 1850, Wauconda had a population of around 200 residents, and the town had three goods stores, two public houses and various mechanics.<ref name=\"WaucondaIL\" />\n\n==Geography==\nWauconda is located at {{coord|42|16|1|N|88|8|34|W|type:city}} (42.266910, -88.142657).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Wauconda has a total area of {{convert|5.732|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|5.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 88.1%) is land and {{convert|0.682|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 11.9%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1779267\n  |title=G001 - Geographic Identifiers - 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-12-25\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213082648/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1779267\n  |archive-date=2020-02-13\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\nA small private airport, [[Air Estates Airport]], is located northeast of Mundelein.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 298\n|1890= 368\n|1900= 397\n|1910= 368\n|1920= 399\n|1930= 554\n|1940= 639\n|1950= 1173\n|1960= 3227\n|1970= 5460\n|1980= 5688\n|1990= 6294\n|2000= 9448\n|2010= 13603\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=13620\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 5, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 9,448 people, 3,611 households, and 2,404 families residing in the village.
