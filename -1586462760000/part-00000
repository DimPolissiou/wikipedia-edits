However, university officials were able to find a loophole: by adding some rooms for gun and weapons storage, construction of the building was able to continue under the guise of an \"armory.\"\n\nAllen Field House was dedicated on March 1, 1955,<ref name=tnwetem/><ref name=fbaln/> a ten-point victory over [[Sunflower Showdown|rival]] [[Kansas State Wilcats men's basketball|Kansas State]].<ref name=bigin>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pdlFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w-cMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6675%2C3746224 |work=Lawrence Daily Journal-World |location=(Kansas) |last=Mayer |first=Bill |title=Jays present Phog big one after coach 'absents' self |date=March 2, 1955 |page=15}}</ref> Renovations have included minor seating expansions in 1986 and 1994, as well as [[accessibility]] upgrades in 1999 to modernize concession stands and restroom facilities, and to install an elevator in the south end. Handicapped seating was moved courtside behind both baskets in 2001.\n\nThe concourse was originally an indoor track. At times the Field House has been home to men's and [[women's basketball]], indoor [[track and field]], [[volleyball]], and practice facilities for the [[American football]] and [[softball]] teams. Since additional facilities were constructed to accommodate many of those needs, it is now used primarily for basketball.\n\n[[Max Falkenstien]] was a stalwart figure in the radio booth, working every home game in Allen Field House from its construction to his retirement in 2006, 51 years later.\n\nRenovations completed in 2005 include a thorough cleaning of the exterior, and the creation of a new Booth Family Hall of Athletics facility on the east side of the Field House, funded by [[David G. Booth]] and his family. Interior renovations include a new hardwood court, new windows, and a multimillion-dollar video board and sound system. After 2006, new banners for the retired jerseys and conference and national championships were installed.\n\nRenovations completed in 2009 include an expansion of the Booth Family Hall of Athletics and the creation of a donor atrium, as well as improved concessions, wider concourses, and restroom upgrades. The building also received brand new locker rooms, training rooms, film rooms, and player lounges. A pedestrian bridge connecting the Field House to the existing facility parking garage was also constructed. The improvements cost approximately $7.8 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Allen Fieldhouse Sporting New Look|first=Gary|last=Bedore|url=http://www2.kusports.com/news/2009/oct/15/allen-fieldhouse-sporting-new-look/?mens_basketball|work=KU Sports|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=October 15, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023084603/http://www2.kusports.com/news/2009/oct/15/allen-fieldhouse-sporting-new-look/?mens_basketball|archivedate=October 23, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2010, the Booth family announced they had purchased the founding document of the game of basketball, Dr. Naismith's original 13 Rules of Basketball.

During Ted Owens' coaching period (1964\u201383), the capacity was reduced to 15,200 to improve fire code-mandated egress routes. It was raised to 15,800 in the 1986 offseason, and since 1993, its official capacity has been 16,300. Of these seats, 4,000 are dedicated to KU students, with most of the remainder taken by season-ticket-holding members of the Williams Educational Fund, the fundraising arm of KU Athletics, named after Lawrence banker Dick Williams and his sons, Skipper and Odd.<ref>{{cite news|title=Programs Help Fans Score Seating Points|first=Dave|last=Ranney|url=http://www.kusports.com/news/seatingplan/story/110758|newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417224510/http://www.kusports.com/news/seatingplan/story/110758|archivedate=April 17, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The largest crowd in Allen Field House for a basketball game was 17,228 on March 1, 1955, when the building was dedicated. Barring another expansion of seating, it is unlikely this record will ever be broken as fire codes have forced KU to strictly enforce the building's capacity since the mid-1980s.\n\n==Banners==\nIn lieu of retiring numbers, banners hang on the south wall of the fieldhouse to honor former players including [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Clyde Lovellette]], [[Jo Jo White]], [[Danny Manning]], [[Paul Pierce]], [[Lynette Woodard]], [[Drew Gooden]], [[Nick Collison]], and [[Kirk Hinrich]], among others.  The banners display the player's surname over his/her number, but the numbers themselves are reused.  There is also a banner to honor [[Max Falkenstien]], a former Jayhawks radio announcer, who was given the \"number\" 60 to commemorate his 60 years of service to the university. To date he is the only non-athlete to be so honored at Allen Field House. The east and west rafters are devoted to KU's multiple Final Fours and conference championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kusports.com/news/2006/mar/02/falkenstien_has_jersey_unfurled/?mens_basketball|title=Falkenstien has 'jersey' unfurled|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717044331/http://www2.kusports.com/news/2006/mar/02/falkenstien_has_jersey_unfurled/?mens_basketball|archivedate=July 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the north wall hang banners for KU's five national championships: their two championships awarded by the [[Helms Athletic Foundation|Helms Foundation]] for KU's 1922 and 1923 seasons, as well as their three NCAA tournament titles in [[1952 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1952]], [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1988]], and [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]].\n\nAbove these championship banners hangs a banner reading \"Pay Heed, All Who Enter: Beware of the Phog\", in reference to the intimidating atmosphere and the team's home court dominance.  The original \"Pay Heed\" banner was constructed out of dormitory shower curtains by a group of KU students before a late-season game against the [[Duke men's basketball|Duke Blue Devils]] in 1988 and is now on display in the Booth Family Hall of Athletics museum. The slogan was inspired in part by advertisements for the 1980s horror movie [[The Fog]]. It hung on the north wall until 1999, by which time it had deteriorated to the point where it was about to fall.<ref name=\"Pay Heed\">{{cite news|last1=Newell|first1=Jesse|title=The story behind KU\u2019s \u2018Beware of the Phog\u2019 banner ... from the men who created it|url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article194617979.html|accessdate=January 15, 2018|work=Kansas City Star|date=January 13, 2018|language=en}}</ref>  The university replaced the banner with a much more regular-looking design, which met with negative reaction from the public.

However, university officials were able to find a loophole: by adding some rooms for gun and weapons storage, construction of the building was able to continue under the guise of an \"armory.\"\n\nAllen Field House was dedicated on March 1, 1955,<ref name=tnwetem/><ref name=fbaln/> a ten-point victory over [[Sunflower Showdown|rival]] [[Kansas State Wilcats men's basketball|Kansas State]].<ref name=bigin>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pdlFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=w-cMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6675%2C3746224 |work=Lawrence Daily Journal-World |location=(Kansas) |last=Mayer |first=Bill |title=Jays present Phog big one after coach 'absents' self |date=March 2, 1955 |page=15}}</ref> Renovations have included minor seating expansions in 1986 and 1994, as well as [[accessibility]] upgrades in 1999 to modernize concession stands and restroom facilities, and to install an elevator in the south end. Handicapped seating was moved courtside behind both baskets in 2001.\n\nThe concourse was originally an indoor track. At times the Field House has been home to men's and [[women's basketball]], indoor [[track and field]], [[volleyball]], and practice facilities for the [[American football]] and [[softball]] teams. Since additional facilities were constructed to accommodate many of those needs, it is now used primarily for basketball.\n\n[[Max Falkenstien]] was a stalwart figure in the radio booth, working every home game in Allen Field House from its construction to his retirement in 2006, 51 years later.\n\nRenovations completed in 2005 include a thorough cleaning of the exterior, and the creation of a new Booth Family Hall of Athletics facility on the east side of the Field House, funded by [[David G. Booth]] and his family. Interior renovations include a new hardwood court, new windows, and a multimillion-dollar video board and sound system. After 2006, new banners for the retired jerseys and conference and national championships were installed.\n\nRenovations completed in 2009 include an expansion of the Booth Family Hall of Athletics and the creation of a donor atrium, as well as improved concessions, wider concourses, and restroom upgrades. The building also received brand new locker rooms, training rooms, film rooms, and player lounges. A pedestrian bridge connecting the Field House to the existing facility parking garage was also constructed. The improvements cost approximately $7.8 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Allen Fieldhouse Sporting New Look|first=Gary|last=Bedore|url=http://www2.kusports.com/news/2009/oct/15/allen-fieldhouse-sporting-new-look/?mens_basketball|work=KU Sports|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=October 15, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023084603/http://www2.kusports.com/news/2009/oct/15/allen-fieldhouse-sporting-new-look/?mens_basketball|archivedate=October 23, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2010, the Booth family announced they had purchased the founding document of the game of basketball, Dr. Naismith's original 13 Rules of Basketball.

During Ted Owens' coaching period (1964\u201383), the capacity was reduced to 15,200 to improve fire code-mandated egress routes. It was raised to 15,800 in the 1986 offseason, and since 1993, its official capacity has been 16,300. Of these seats, 4,000 are dedicated to KU students, with most of the remainder taken by season-ticket-holding members of the Williams Educational Fund, the fundraising arm of KU Athletics, named after Lawrence banker Dick Williams and his sons, Skipper and Odd.<ref>{{cite news|title=Programs Help Fans Score Seating Points|first=Dave|last=Ranney|url=http://www.kusports.com/news/seatingplan/story/110758|newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|date=June 21, 2004|accessdate=March 19, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417224510/http://www.kusports.com/news/seatingplan/story/110758|archivedate=April 17, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The largest crowd in Allen Field House for a basketball game was 17,228 on March 1, 1955, when the building was dedicated. Barring another expansion of seating, it is unlikely this record will ever be broken as fire codes have forced KU to strictly enforce the building's capacity since the mid-1980s.\n\n==Banners==\nIn lieu of retiring numbers, banners hang on the south wall of the fieldhouse to honor former players including [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Clyde Lovellette]], [[Jo Jo White]], [[Danny Manning]], [[Paul Pierce]], [[Lynette Woodard]], [[Drew Gooden]], [[Nick Collison]], and [[Kirk Hinrich]], among others.  The banners display the player's surname over his/her number, but the numbers themselves are reused.  There is also a banner to honor [[Max Falkenstien]], a former Jayhawks radio announcer, who was given the \"number\" 60 to commemorate his 60 years of service to the university. To date he is the only non-athlete to be so honored at Allen Field House. The east and west rafters are devoted to KU's multiple Final Fours and conference championships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kusports.com/news/2006/mar/02/falkenstien_has_jersey_unfurled/?mens_basketball|title=Falkenstien has 'jersey' unfurled|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717044331/http://www2.kusports.com/news/2006/mar/02/falkenstien_has_jersey_unfurled/?mens_basketball|archivedate=July 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn the north wall hang banners for KU's five national championships: their two championships awarded by the [[Helms Athletic Foundation|Helms Foundation]] for KU's 1922 and 1923 seasons, as well as their three NCAA tournament titles in [[1952 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1952]], [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1988]], and [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]].\n\nAbove these championship banners hangs a banner reading \"Pay Heed, All Who Enter: Beware of the Phog\", in reference to the intimidating atmosphere and the team's home court dominance.  The original \"Pay Heed\" banner was constructed out of dormitory shower curtains by a group of KU students before a late-season game against the [[Duke men's basketball|Duke Blue Devils]] in 1988 and is now on display in the Booth Family Hall of Athletics museum. The slogan was inspired in part by advertisements for the 1980s horror movie [[The Fog]].

{"title_page": "Henry Burnell (author)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n\n'''Henry Burnell''' (c. 1590-c. 1654) was an Irish politician, playwright and landowner of the seventeenth century. The details of his life are not well recorded, but it is known that he was a prominent member of the [[Irish Confederacy]], and a  member of a leading Dublin landowning family,  who lost most of their  their possessions after the failure of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. He is now remembered mainly as the author of ''Landgartha'', the first play by an Irish playwright to be produced in an Irish [[theatre]],  and as the father of the poet Eleanor Burnell.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Burnell, Henry |first=John Thomas|last=Gilbert|volume=7}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nHe was the son of Christopher Burnell of [[Balgriffin]], and grandson of [[Henry Burnell]], [[Recorder of Dublin]], who died in 1614.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.223</ref> The [[Burnell family]] had been landowners in [[Dublin]] since the late fourteenth century and were Lords of the Manors of Balgriffin and [[Castleknock]]. They had a long tradition of serving as judges, especially on the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]]; but most of them were stubbornly [[Roman Catholic]] in their religious beliefs and as a result. after the [[Protestant Reformation]] their loyalty to the Crown was often suspect. Little is known of Henry's personal life, except that he was  rich and eligible  enough to marry one of  the Earl of Roscommon's daughters.  He probably inherited his  money from his grandfather, who made a fortune at the [[Irish Bar]].\n\n==Landgartha==\n''Landgartha'', Burnell's only surviving play,<ref>We know of at least one earlier play, now lost.</ref> was produced at the [[Werburgh Street Theatre]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]] 1640. it was the first work by an Irish playwright to be produced on the Irish stage<ref>There is reason to think  that Burnell had tried, but failed to have an earlier play produced in Dublin.</ref> and one of the last productions  before the theatre closed in 1641.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> The text of the play was published in Dublin in 1641 under the title \"Landgartha, a tragi-comedy as it was presented in the new theatre in Dublin with good applause\". The foreword contains evidence that Burnell wrote other plays which have not survived.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> He is thought to have collaborated with the leading English dramatist [[James Shirley]], who was working in Dublin  between 1635 and 1640.   The creation of a distinctive Irish theatre was a personal project of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], and Burnell benefitted from his patronage, despite Strafford's generally poor relations with the [[Anglo-Irish]] gentry.<ref>Wedgwood, C. V.   ''Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford 1593\u20131641: a Revaluation'' Phoenix Press Reissue 2000 pp.226\u20137</ref>\n\n===Summary of the play===\nThe main characters are the heroine Landgartha, a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] \"Amazon\"; Frollo, King of [[Sweden]] and conqueror of [[Norway]]; Reyner, King of [[Denmark]]; Harald, his rival, and Uraca, daughter of Frollo.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\nLandgartha, seeking to free her country from Frollo's tyranny, makes an alliance with Reyner and agrees to marry him. They are victorious in battle and Landgartha kills Frollo herself. She and Reyner marry and have children but her happiness is short-lived. Reyner abandons her and contemplates remarrying Uraca, but when Reyner is threatened with destruction by his rival Harald, Landgartha loyally comes to his aid and defeats Harald. The play ends on a note of reconciliation: it is agreed that the children of Landgartha and Reyner will rule both Denmark and Norway, while Uraca gives up her hope of marrying Reyner. Whether Landgartha and Reyner will live together once more as man and wife is left unclear. Burnell later defended the inconclusive ending, pointing out that his play was neither a comedy or a tragedy, but something in between (as he himself described it,  a \"[[tragicomedy]]\"). This was a  valid point since the tragicomedy was by the seventeen century familiar  to English audiences.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\n===Possible political themes===\nBecause of  the troubled period it was written in, and because of  Burnell's later political career, some scholars have looked for political themes in the play.<ref>Pilkington, Lionel \"Theatre and Ireland\"  Red Globe Press 2010 p.28</ref> It has been suggested that Landgartha symbolises the old [[Anglo-Irish]] ruling class to which Burnell belonged, and that Reyner represents the New English aristocracy who, by denying the Anglo-Irish their full share in public life, abandoned them. In the alternative, it can be read as a straightforward  defence of England's colonizing role in Ireland.<ref>Pilkington p.28</ref> A more elaborate parallel suggests that Reyner represents [[King Charles I of England]] and that the plot reflects the political turbulence which led to the [[English Civil War]].\n\n===Reputation as a playwright===\nBurnell refers to the \"good applause\" his play received, and quotes an English writer who called him \"the true heir of [[Ben Jonson]]\", an opinion which few critics either then or later have shared.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> In more recent times, the biographer of his patron the Earl of Strafford gave her frank view that while ''Landgartha'' was an important milestone in the development of the Irish theatre, it has no merits whatsoever as a play.<ref>Wedgwood p.22</ref> That this view was widely shared in Burnell's own time is suggested by his bitter reference to \"the other babblers\"  (i.e. critics) who had apparently ridiculed his play, and whom he in turn regarded with contempt.  His efforts to have an earlier play produced had apparently failed, due in his opinion to the hostility of his critics.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\n==Irish Confederacy==\nGiven his status as a leading Catholic landowner of [[the Pale]], with a long family tradition of opposition to the Crown, it was natural that Burnell should be a prominent member of the Irish Confederacy. However little is known of his role in the events of 1641\u20139, except that he lost his estates at Balgriffin and Castleknock almost at once, and that his family never recovered them.  He was living at another family estate at Castlerickard in [[County Meath]] in 1642, and was still alive in 1654.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' Alexander Thom and Co. Vol. 6 1920 p.21</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children ==\nBurnell married Frances Dillon, third daughter of [[James Dillon, 1st Earl of Roscommon]] and his wife Eleanor Barnewall; she died in 1640.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> They had four sons and five daughters. The most notable of their children was their daughter Eleanor, one of the few Irish women poets of the seventeenth century. Although her work consists only of a  few [[Latin]] verses, she is unique in being the only female Anglo-Irish poet of her time.<ref>Stevenson, Jane  ''Women Latin Poets from Ancient Times to the Eighteenth Century''  [[Oxford University Press]] 2005 p.384</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burnell, Henry}}\n[[Category:1590s births]]\n[[Category:1650s deaths]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:Year of death uncertain]]\n\n[[Category:17th-century Irish politicians]]\n[[Category:17th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:Irish male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:People from Castleknock\u200e]]\n[[Category:17th-century male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n\n'''Henry Burnell''' (c. 1590-c. 1654) was an Irish politician, playwright and landowner of the seventeenth century.

The foreword contains evidence that Burnell wrote other plays which have not survived.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> He is thought to have collaborated with the leading English dramatist [[James Shirley]], who was in Ireland between 1635 and 1640.   The creation of a distinctive Irish theatre was a personal project of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], and Burnell benefitted from his patronage, despite Strafford's generally poor relations with the [[Anglo-Irish]] gentry.<ref>Wedgwood, C. V.   ''Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford 1593\u20131641: a Revaluation'' Phoenix Press Reissue 2000 pp.226\u20137</ref>\n\n===Summary of the play===\nThe main characters are the heroine Landgartha, a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] \"Amazon\"; Frollo, King of [[Sweden]] and conqueror of [[Norway]]; Reyner, King of [[Denmark]]; Harald, his rival, and Uraca, daughter of Frollo.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\nLandgartha, seeking to free her country from Frollo's tyranny, makes an alliance with Reyner and agrees to marry him. They are victorious in battle and Landgartha kills Frollo herself. She and Reyner marry and have children but her happiness is short-lived. Reyner abandons her and contemplates remarrying Uraca, but when Reyner is threatened with destruction by his rival Harald, Landgartha loyally comes to his aid and defeats Harald. The play ends on a note of reconciliation: it is agreed that the children of Landgartha and Reyner will rule both Denmark and Norway, while Uraca gives up her hope of marrying Reyner. Whether Landgartha and Reyner will live together once more as man and wife is left unclear. Burnell later defended the inconclusive ending, pointing out that his play was neither a comedy or a tragedy, but something in between (as he himself described it,  a \"[[tragicomedy]]\"). This was a  valid point since the tragicomedy was by the seventeen century familiar  to English audiences.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\n===Possible political themes===\nBecause of  the troubled period it was written in, and because of  Burnell's later political career, some scholars have looked for political themes in the play.<ref>Pilkington, Lionel \"Theatre and Ireland\"  Red Globe Press 2010 p.28</ref> It has been suggested that Landgartha symbolises the old [[Anglo-Irish]] ruling class to which Burnell belonged, and that Reyner represents the New English aristocracy who, by denying the Anglo-Irish their full share in public life, abandoned them. In the alternative, it can be read as a straightforward  defence of England's colonizing role in Ireland.<ref>Pilkington p.28</ref> A more elaborate parallel suggests that Reyner represents [[King Charles I of England]] and that the plot reflects the political turbulence which led to the [[English Civil War]].\n\n===Reputation as a playwright===\nBurnell refers to the \"good applause\" his play received, and quotes an English writer who called him \"the true heir of [[Ben Jonson]]\", an opinion which few critics either then or later have shared.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> In more recent times, the biographer of his patron the Earl of Strafford gave her frank view that while ''Landgartha'' was an important milestone in the development of the Irish theatre, it has no merits whatsoever as a play.<ref>Wedgwood p.22</ref> That this view was widely shared in Burnell's own time is suggested by his bitter reference to \"the other babblers\"  (i.e. critics) who had apparently ridiculed his play, and whom he in turn regarded with contempt.  His efforts to have an earlier play produced had apparently failed, due in his opinion to the hostility of his critics.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\n==Irish Confederacy==\nGiven his status as a leading Catholic landowner of [[the Pale]], with a long family tradition of opposition to the Crown, it was natural that Burnell should be a prominent member of the Irish Confederacy. However little is known of his role in the events of 1641\u20139, except that he lost his estates at Balgriffin and Castleknock almost at once, and that his family never recovered them.  He was living at another family estate at Castlerickard in [[County Meath]] in 1642, and was still alive in 1654.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' Alexander Thom and Co. Vol. 6 1920 p.21</ref>\n\n==Marriage and children ==\nBurnell married Frances Dillon, third daughter of [[James Dillon, 1st Earl of Roscommon]] and his wife Eleanor Barnewall; she died in 1640.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> They had four sons and five daughters. The most notable of their children was their daughter Eleanor, one of the few Irish women poets of the seventeenth century. Although her work consists only of a  few [[Latin]] verses, she is unique in being the only female Anglo-Irish poet of her time.<ref>Stevenson, Jane  ''Women Latin Poets from Ancient Times to the Eighteenth Century''  [[Oxford University Press]] 2005 p.384</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burnell, Henry}}\n[[Category:1590s births]]\n[[Category:1650s deaths]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:Year of death uncertain]]\n\n[[Category:17th-century Irish politicians]]\n[[Category:17th-century Irish dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:Irish male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:People from Castleknock\u200e]]\n[[Category:17th-century male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Chrisdoyleorwell", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLandgartha", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Burnell_(author)"}

It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. By 2011, the core ''Super Mario'' video games had grossed an estimated {{US$|12 billion}} in sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Jeff|title=Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101517635|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-6ksl3uLsC&pg=PT8|language=en}}</ref> More than 600 million copies of ''Mario'' games have been sold, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].

Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games. It continued on the Wii as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', on the 3DS as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and on the [[Wii U]] as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' and '' [[New Super Luigi U]]''. This gameplay is further offered by the level creator game ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', released on [[Wii U]] in 2015. A sequel, ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]'', was released on Nintendo Switch in June 2019.\n\nIn 2016, the team behind ''New Super Mario Bros.'' released ''[[Super Mario Run]]'' that became Nintendo's first real [[smartphone]] game and one of the few instances a ''Mario'' game was developed for non-Nintendo hardware.<ref name=\"MarioRun\">{{cite web|last1=Ingraham|first1=Nathan|title='Super Mario Run' is just as much fun as we'd hoped|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/12/08/super-mario-run-iphone-hands-on/|publisher=Engadet|accessdate=December 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Puzzle games ===\n{{Main|List of Mario puzzle games}}\n\n==== ''Dr. Mario'' series ====\n[[File:Dr. Mario series logo.png|thumb|The ''Dr. Mario'' series logo.]]\n\n{{nihongo foot|'''''Dr. Mario'''''|\u30c9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30de\u30ea\u30aa|Dokut\u0101 Mario|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} (stylized as ''D\u211e.

These games did not use the ''Mario'' branding and only featured Mario in the capacity of a cameo. He then appeared in ''[[Mario's Tennis]]'' for the Virtual Boy. After this, [[Camelot Software Planning]] released ''[[Mario Tennis]]'' for the Nintendo 64. They would subsequently develop other games in this series: ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the GameCube and Wii, ''[[Mario Tennis: Power Tour|Power Tour]]'' for the Game Boy Advance, ''[[Mario Tennis Open]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS, ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash|Ultra Smash]]'' for the Wii U, and ''[[Mario Tennis Aces|Aces]]'' for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n==== ''Mario Golf'' series ====\nThe first use of Mario's likeness in a golf game was that the golfer in ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Golf]]'' for NES and Game Boy featured a mustached man resembling Mario. Later, ''[[NES Open Tournament Golf]]'' was released. It featured Mario and Luigi as the golfers, with [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and [[Princess Daisy]] as their caddies.

Few of these games were platformers; most sought to teach skills such as typing, mathematics or history. They are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo. The games were developed independently by Software Toolworks, Interplay and Brainstorm. Nine educational games were released from 1991 to 1996.\n\n=== Games not published by Nintendo ===\nThis section covers games [[Video game developer|developed]] by other companies without Nintendo involvement. These games are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo.\n\n==== Hudson ====\n[[Hudson Soft]] released two games based on ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' and another similar to ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''\n\n''[[Mario Bros.

It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled. Philips was given permission to use [[Nintendo]] characters in CD-i games due to their taking part in developing an unreleased [[Video game accessory|add-on]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES).<ref name=\"SNES-CD\">{{cite web|title=SNES-CD Profile|url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=279|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217040049/http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=279|archivedate=February 17, 2008|publisher=N-Sider|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref> ''Hotel Mario'' did not gain much success, with Nintendo rarely acknowledging it as part of the ''Mario'' series.<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=5&cId=3149883 |title=CD-i Games: Nintendo |first=Danny |last=Cowan |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=April 25, 2006 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120720182316/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=5&cId=3149883 |archivedate=July 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"GD\">{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Workman|title=Mascots Gone Wild: Nintendo Characters' Worst Moments (Hotel Mario)|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/mascots-gone-wild-nintendo-characters-worst-moments/132/?cp=2&page=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012232126/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/mascots-gone-wild-nintendo-characters-worst-moments/132/?cp=2&page=2|archivedate=October 12, 2008|date=December 12, 2007|publisher=[[GameDaily]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' is a cancelled [[video game]] planned for the CD-i, developed by [[NovaLogic]], which attempted to duplicate the gameplay of ''[[Super Mario World]]''. Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros.

Based on the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' video game, the cartoon shows Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and Toad fighting against Bowser and his [[Koopalings]], who went by different names on the show. Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]].

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the Mario franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in [[Super Mario Odyssey]].\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of [[Mario Tennis Aces]].\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into 4 kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario Land]]''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of [[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]].\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. It's the setting for ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The capital is '''Delfino Plaza'''.\n* [[Super Mario Odyssey]] introduces a variety of new locations such as the '''Cap Kingdom''', '''Cascade Kingdom''', '''Metro Kingdom''' and '''Luncheon Kingdom''', just to name a few.\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nMario has been featured in 256 games of various genres (including sports, puzzle, party, racing and first-person shooter), and the ''Mario'' franchise is the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |title=Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=CNW Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911224500/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> At least 31 different ''Mario'' games have sold more than a million copies each since 1995.

It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. By 2011, the core ''Super Mario'' video games had grossed an estimated {{US$|12 billion}} in sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Jeff|title=Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101517635|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-6ksl3uLsC&pg=PT8|language=en}}</ref> More than 600 million copies of ''Mario'' games have been sold, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].

Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games.

As the series has progressed, each new game has introduced new elements in order to keep the gameplay fresh such as a new story, new partners, and new gameplay mechanics. In 2004, ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door|The Thousand-Year Door]]'' for the GameCube introduced the ability of Mario turning into and folding up into a paper [[airplane]] and/or a paper [[boat]] to interact with the overworld. In 2007, ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'' deviated into the 2D [[action RPG]] genre and introduced the ability to \"flip\" into a 3D perspective in which the level rotates to reveal a hidden [[Cartesian coordinate system|z-axis]], placing Mario in a 3D environment. In 2012, ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star|Sticker Star]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS introduced the use of [[stickers]] in both the environment and in turn-based battles. They can be found and peeled off from various areas in the overworld, and can be purchased or received from [[non-playable characters]]. In 2015, ''[[Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam]]'' also for the 3DS where all the ''Paper Mario'' world enters the real one.

These games did not use the ''Mario'' branding and only featured Mario in the capacity of a cameo. He then appeared in ''[[Mario's Tennis]]'' for the Virtual Boy. After this, [[Camelot Software Planning]] released ''[[Mario Tennis]]'' for the Nintendo 64. They would subsequently develop other games in this series: ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the GameCube and Wii, ''[[Mario Tennis: Power Tour|Power Tour]]'' for the Game Boy Advance, ''[[Mario Tennis Open]]'' for the Nintendo 3DS, ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash|Ultra Smash]]'' for the Wii U, and ''[[Mario Tennis Aces|Aces]]'' for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n==== ''Mario Golf'' series ====\nThe first use of Mario's likeness in a golf game was that the golfer in ''[[Golf (1984 video game)|Golf]]'' for NES and Game Boy featured a mustached man resembling Mario. Later, ''[[NES Open Tournament Golf]]'' was released. It featured Mario and Luigi as the golfers, with [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and [[Princess Daisy]] as their caddies.

Few of these games were platformers; most sought to teach skills such as typing, mathematics or history. They are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo. The games were developed independently by Software Toolworks, Interplay and Brainstorm. Nine educational games were released from 1991 to 1996.\n\n=== Games not published by Nintendo ===\nThis section covers games [[Video game developer|developed]] by other companies without Nintendo involvement. These games are officially licensed but not officially recognized by Nintendo.\n\n==== Hudson ====\n[[Hudson Soft]] released two games based on ''[[Mario Bros.]]'' and another similar to ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''\n\n''[[Mario Bros. Special]]'' is a video game released in 1984 for the Japanese computers [[NEC PC-6001]]mkII, [[NEC PC-6601]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[FM-7]] and [[Sharp X1]].

It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled. Philips was given permission to use [[Nintendo]] characters in CD-i games due to their taking part in developing an unreleased [[Video game accessory|add-on]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES).<ref name=\"SNES-CD\">{{cite web|title=SNES-CD Profile|url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=279|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217040049/http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=279|archivedate=February 17, 2008|publisher=N-Sider|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref> ''Hotel Mario'' did not gain much success, with Nintendo rarely acknowledging it as part of the ''Mario'' series.<ref name=\"1up\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=5&cId=3149883 |title=CD-i Games: Nintendo |first=Danny |last=Cowan |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=April 25, 2006 |accessdate=June 21, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120720182316/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=5&cId=3149883 |archivedate=July 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"GD\">{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Workman|title=Mascots Gone Wild: Nintendo Characters' Worst Moments (Hotel Mario)|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/mascots-gone-wild-nintendo-characters-worst-moments/132/?cp=2&page=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012232126/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/mascots-gone-wild-nintendo-characters-worst-moments/132/?cp=2&page=2|archivedate=October 12, 2008|date=December 12, 2007|publisher=[[GameDaily]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' is a cancelled [[video game]] planned for the CD-i, developed by [[NovaLogic]], which attempted to duplicate the gameplay of ''[[Super Mario World]]''. Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' in 1993. The latter lost a large amount of money at the box office and was widely considered to be a [[Box office bomb|failure]].<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. 1993\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=supermariobros.htm |title=Super Mario Bros.

It aired on [[NBC]] from September 8 to December 1, 1990. Based on the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' video game, the cartoon shows Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and Toad fighting against Bowser and his [[Koopalings]], who went by different names on the show. Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]]. It is the third and currently last [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning cartoon]] based on the ''Mario'' series. The show was originally aired on Saturday mornings on [[NBC]] in the 1991\u201392 season. It was featured in a half-hour time slot with a shortened version of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''. Episodes of ''Super Mario World'' were later shown as part of the [[Television syndication|syndication]] package ''Captain N and the Video Game Masters''. Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986. Directed by Masami Hata and produced by Masakatsu Suzuki and Tsunemasa Hatano, it stars [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who get stuck in a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] [[video game]], in which they must save [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]]. A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989.

In Nintendo's work with [[Universal Parks & Resorts]] to create Mario-based attractions, Miyamoto had met Meledandri, and they had several discussions. Miyamoto found Meledandri's creative process similar to his own, and decided he would be the proper lead for a Mario film. They had started more earnest discussions of the film as early as 2016, knowing that if they realized it wasn't working that they could easily walk away. However, by the time of the official announcement, Miyamoto said that they have good discussions over the screenplay and feels good progress to a proper film.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://venturebeat.com/2018/02/09/nintendos-miyamoto-explains-how-illumination-won-mario-movie-rights/ | title = Nintendo's Miyamoto explains how Illumination won Mario movie rights | first = Mike | last = Minotti | date = January 9, 2018 | accessdate = January 9, 2018 | work = [[VentureBeat]] }}</ref> Meledandri stated that the film was a \"priority\" for Illumination and that it will most likely come out in 2022.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the Mario franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in [[Super Mario Odyssey]].\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of [[Mario Tennis Aces]].\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into 4 kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario Land]]''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of [[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]].\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. It's the setting for ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. The capital is '''Delfino Plaza'''.\n* [[Super Mario Odyssey]] introduces a variety of new locations such as the '''Cap Kingdom''', '''Cascade Kingdom''', '''Metro Kingdom''' and '''Luncheon Kingdom''', just to name a few.\n\n== Impact and legacy ==\nMario has been featured in 256 games of various genres (including sports, puzzle, party, racing and first-person shooter), and the ''Mario'' franchise is the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |title=Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |date=December 13, 2007 |publisher=CNW Group |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911224500/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html |url-status=dead |archivedate=September 11, 2009 }}</ref> At least 31 different ''Mario'' games have sold more than a million copies each since 1995.

Khiem was a cargo pilot with the 53rd Tactical Wing of the 5th Air Division stationed at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]]. Khiem flew several missions into communists gained [[Pleiku Air Base|Pleiku]] in hopes to rescue VNAF personnel. On 03 April 1975, Khiem organized a plan to steal a C-130a and gather 53 people to rescue them from the communist [[North Vietnam|North Vietnamese]]. Later, Khiem became a pilot for [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u20131989)|Piedmont Airlines]] until 2006.\n\n== Early Life ==\n[[File:Pham_Family_1960.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|190x190px|Pham family in 1960.]]\nPham Quang Khiem was born on December 27, 1946, in [[V\u0129nh Long|V\u0129nh-Long, Vietnam]]. Khiem had ten siblings (five boys and five girls) and all of his brothers were in the military. Three of them were in the VNAF and one in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]. Khiem got married on June 8, 1972, to Ngoc-My Tran. Together they had three children: two in South Vietnam and one in the [[United States|United States of America]].\n\n\n\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n== Early Career ==\n[[File:Pham_Quang_Khiem_at_Lockbourne_AFB.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|195x195px|Pham Quang Khiem at Lockbourne AFB]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://t28trojanfoundation.com/vnaf.html|title=VNAF|website=Helen Murphy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>In November 1969, Khiem went to [[Lackland Air Force Base|Lackland AFB]] to learn [[English language|English]] as a VNAF air cadet. At [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph AFB]], he earned his basic pilot training, then moved on to [[Keesler Air Force Base|Keesler AFB]], where he flew the [[T-28 Trojan]].\u00a0Khiem also trained at [[Lockbourne AFB]] from October-December of 1970. Eventually, he was designated to fly transport aircraft and was pilot-in-command of [[C-123K]] aircraft before moving up to the 53rd Tactical Wing, 435th Transport Squadron as a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130A]] pilot. \n\n\n\n\n<br />\n=== Hard Landing ===\n[[File:PQK Tough Landing.jpg|thumb|Pham Quang Khiem in front of the C-123K after the crash landing]]\nOn January 24, 1971, Pham Quang Khiem nearly died almost ending his flight career before it started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vnafmamn.com/hall-offame/amazing_story.html|title=VNAF \"amazing story\"|website=vnafmamn.com|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> After a year of training in the states, Khiem's group was sent to [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan-Rang AFB]] by the VNAF to start \"In Country Training\" with the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] on a [[C-123K]]. Khiem was assigned to fly with 1LT. Minh and their American Instructor, Cpt. John Mastronardi. Minh was the Aircraft Commander in the left seat and in the right, Khiem switched with Captain Mastronardi to execute co-pilot duties. One day, they had an assignment to transfer 48 of 175-millimeter high explosive bullet heads from [[Bien Hoa Air Base|Bien-Hoa Air Base]] to a US firebase 113 kilometers north near the [[Cambodia|Cambodian]] border. They had to land into an isolated area for a safe distance from any airport facilities since they carried high explosive material. They landed on the short dirt strip, [[B\u00f9 Gia M\u1eadp District|B\u00f9 Gia M\u1eadp]] Air Strip (aka Djamap). The runway was 3000' on top of a 1620' hill. Co-Pilots (in this training) weren't allowed to make any landing on any runway shorter than 3600'. Minh was supposed to handle this flight, but Captain Mastronardi kept Khiem in the right seat believing he could handle the landing after previous successful landings. Khiem was a young pilot and didn't know the difference between a short runway and a long one. It was a hostile area so they had to come in high and drop fast. They came down to 2000' at 78 knots and when the [[C-123K]] was about 20 feet in the air crossing the end of the runway Khiem decided to cut the power to idle causing the aircraft to drop touching down extremely hard. The left main landing gear fell into the belly wrecking the wheel and scratched all the red dirt on the runway skyrocketing it into the cockpit. Khiem and Minh couldn't see anything in front of them. Captain Mastronardi immediately reversed the right engine, bringing the aircraft back stopping the aircraft. If Captain Mastronardi had not stop the aircraft, the whole aircraft may have run off the dirt strip dropping hundreds of yards exploding on the side of the hill.\n\n== End of the War ==\nAt the end of March 1975, the North Vietnamese had already taken half of South Vietnam. Citizens were fleeing as well as soldiers creating chaos throughout the country. Both civilians and officers were hitching military aircraft to escape the North Vietnamese. At the end of March of 1975, the [[North Vietnamese army|NVA]] was pushing towards the coast to strike [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]], [[Tuy H\u00f2a]], and [[Nha Trang]]. \n\n=== Pleiku ===\n[[File:North Vietnamese Gains in the last week of March of '75.jpg|thumb|249x249px|North Vietnamese Gains in the last week of March of '75]]\n<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snepp|first=Frank|title=Decent Interval|publisher=Random House|year=1977|isbn=0-394-40743-1|location=New York, United States|pages=234}}</ref> In the north of South Vietnam, the only remaining government enclave was [[Da Nang]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Drendel|first=Lou|title=Air War over Southeast Asia|publisher=squadron/signal|year=1984|isbn=0-89747-148-2|location=1115 Crowley Dr., Carrolton, TX|pages=65}}</ref> Khiem flew three missions into and out of [[Pleiku]], evacuating the families of VNAF personnel. The civil population of Pleiku learned of the evacuation and stormed the [[Pleiku Air Base|airport]]. This forced five C-130's en route from Saigon to turn around before their airlifts were complete. Some C-130's flew bombing missions to destroy the aircraft left behind. They were loaded with 55-gallon drums of [[napalm]], then dropped on VNAF aircraft abandoned on the ramps.\n\n=== Da Nang ===\n28 March 1975, Khiem flew one of the last missions to [[Da Nang Air Base|Da Nang]] at 11:00 pm, the night before its loss. When he landed and taxied to the ramp, an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] major jumped into the aircraft to assure himself of a seat. Khiem knew that the thousands of people in the terminal would rush the airplane after seeing this, so Khiem kicked him off. Khiem was a First Lieutenant, and the aircraft commander was searching the terminal for his family. But, the ramp was filled with refugees almost immediately anyway. Around 20,000 pounds of cargo on board, so Khiem yelled at them to offload first. The crowd was too chaotic, so Khiem told the [[loadmaster]] to do unloading and loading through the ramp in the back of the C-130. Once finished, people rushed onto the aircraft. Khiem started the engines, scattering many, allowing Khiem to taxi out.\n\nAs they taxied, the loadmaster yelled at Khiem through the intercom saying he couldn't close the ramp because people were on it. Khiem hit the brakes jamming the refugees in tight allowing the ramp to close. At the end of the runway, an MP (Military Police) in a truck had his family in it, blocking the taxiway and pointing his M-16 at the cockpit.  He motioned to let his family on board. Khiem motioned him to move the truck so he could line up on the runway. Khiem backed up, lined up and took off without the MP. Khiem offloaded at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]] and did a headcount of 350 people. C-130's are maximized to carry 92 passengers but Khiem fit almost four times that amount. \n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lockheed-c-130a-45-lm-hercules|title=Lockheed C-130a 45 lm Hercules|last=|first=|date=|website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020|quote=\"That flight and the panic that Lt.

The following day [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]], South Vietnam's third-largest city was captured by the North Vietnamese. The next target for the North Vietnamese was [[Nha Trang Air Base|Nha Trang]]. Khiem just made it just like he did in Da Nang.\n\n== Flight To Freedom ==\n2 April 1975, Khiem caught a ride on a C-130 \"bladder bird\" into [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]], in hopes to pinpoint his younger brother, who was an airman there.\u00a0Khiem wanted to take him back to [[Saigon]] to be with the rest of their family.\u00a0Khiem couldn't find hi, so left without him. On the way back to Saigon, Khiem thought if Phan Rang is lost, then\u00a0the communists will come to Saigon. Khiem started to devise a plan to escape South Vietnam with his family. Khiem heard that [[Singapore]] as looking for pilots so that was where he would go. VNAF Pilots started talking about stealing planes with their families so command ordered to fuel the aircraft only with enough to complete their missions. This created a major problem for Khiem. Another was finding someone to help a family escape.\u00a0 \n\n=== Preparation ===\nOne of Khiem's close friends was Major Nguyen Canh in the [[VNAF|South Vietnam Air Force]] and he was in Khiem's sister squadron the 437th Squadron. They discussed the escape and Khiem told him they must be the first otherwise there wouldn't be a second. Major Canh's family was in [[Da Lat]], and he wanted to get them to Saigon before leaving.\u00a0 On 2 April, Da Lat was overrun by the communists and Nguyen lost contact with them.\u00a0After that, he was prepared to escape. On 3 April, all the C-130s were used on bombing missions and Khiem was number one standby for the mission planning board, but Khiem needed to tell his family his plan to escape.\u00a0Khiem went to the Squadron Ops telling the Officer he didn't feel good, and he agreed to drop Khiem to the bottom of the list.\u00a0 This gave Khiem time to run home to tell one of his brothers what he had planned.\u00a0Khiem told his brother to make sure his family close to home because they were all gathered in Saigon.  Khiem told his family to rush to the [[Long Thanh Airport]] as soon as they heard from him. [[Bearcat Base|Long Thanh]] was originally a US Army airbase that Khiem had landed many times in training.\u00a0It was closed and deserted since the US withdrawal in 1973. \n[[File:Pham_Quang_Khiem_in_C-130A.jpg|alt=|thumb|27-year-old Pham Quang Khiem in C-130A: 1974]]\nKhiem's house was in a mile of the airport and ran home and told his family to leave.\u00a0But there was a hindrance, Khiem and Nguyen were in different squadrons, and would not usually fly together\u00a0and could not even get into the squadron area because the guards were unfamiliar with him. But luck was on Khiem's side. The airplane Khiem was supposed to escape with had mechanical problems, and the 437th had to borrow the 435th's C-130a HCF 460, nickname \"''Saigon Lady''\", and would let Khiem in the area. Now Khiem\u00a0had to get rid of Canh's co-pilot. The co-pilot let Khiem fly gladly cause he wanted the rest of the day off to prepare for his date.\n\nNow the biggest problem left of all: the fuel. Khiem thought they would only have enough fuel to maybe make it to Thailand. Khiem quickly checked the fuel to find out the entire tank was full. The man fueling the tank took a smoke break and filled the tank all the way. This full tank of gas meant Singapore was possible. \n\nLt. Khiem, Major Canh, and the rest of the crew (not knowing where they were going) were prepared for takeoff. Khiem took off without clearance and turned southeast instead of east. Khiem told the crew on the intercom that they were redirected to Long Thanh instead of [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]]. They landed safely land the loadmaster opened the ramp unloading 20,000 lbs of dry-rice. Khiem's brother in [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]] made it to their parent's house in Saigon a few minutes before the escape. While Khiem's family and friends of 53 people boarded, he told the crew that he was escaping Vietnam and they could come if they wanted. The Flight Engineer got up then sat back down and said he would come. The number one loadmaster thought Khiem and Canh were defecting to the North Vietnamese.\u00a0He served in the VNAF for ten years and ran away as fast as he could. The other loadmaster was on his first C-130 training ride and had no clue as to what was going on, so he just stood next to the open ramp.\n\n=== Escape ===\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://welovedexter.com/2018/09/02/phillip-phams-father-borrows-military-plane-saves-family/|title=Phillip Pham\u2019s Father \u201cBorrows\u201d Military Plane, Saves Family|last=Communities|first=Disover|date=2 September 2019|website=We Love Dexter|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> Khiem started taxiing away but when everyone boarded the plane with their luggage, Khiem's two-year-old daughter was trampled and knocked out with blood everywhere. Khiem's wife, Ngoc-My, saw her thinking she was dead and passed out dropping their infant child on the ground. The infant child was left on the tarmac as Khiem started to taxi but, luckily, Khiem's oldest brother's wife ran out and grabbed the infant and ran back into the moving C-130A (all of them recovered after). As Khiem started taxiing to the takeoff end of the runway, Khiem saw the loadmaster speaking to many [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] soldiers who came in a jeep. As Khiem and Canh turned to take off, the Jeep came and pointed an [[M79 grenade launcher|M-79 grenade launcher]] at the cockpit. Khiem\u00a0took off anyways knowing they wouldn't fire.  The ramp was still open, so Khiem ran back and told the puzzled, inexperienced loadmaster to hold the switch until the ramp was up, then Khiem ran to the cockpit\u00a0just in time to raise the gear. The\u00a0period from Khiem landing to Khiem and the passengers leaving was only seven minutes.\n\n==== Shallow Flying ====\nKhiem and Canh flew at tree-top level until they reached the sea then they dropped down to the sea-level. it got very humid in the back resulting in a thick fog forming. Khiem's family and friends could not see each other because the fog was too thick. One hour later, they raised to 16,000 feet and flew straight to Singapore.\u00a0\n\n==== Singapore ====\n[[File:Picture_of_a_C-130A_of_the_VNAF.jpg|alt=|thumb|One of the C-130A's Khiem flew in the VNAF]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thekopi.co/2020/01/24/refugees-c-130-plane/|title=How Vietnam War Refugees Fled to Singapore Using a Stolen C-130 Plane|last=Ng|first=Vanessa|date=2019|website=The Kopi|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> They arrived in Singapore at around 7:00 PM. Khiem called Approach Control for instructions but could not understand them, so he changed to Tower Frequency, and requested\u00a0landing instruction. Yet, the call was intercepted by the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force|Singapore Air Force]]. Khiem told the other end of the line that the C-130A was off course and running out of fuel. So, they allowed Khiem to land on runway 02. They all stayed put until the authorities came.\n\nThe officials had no clue what to do with them. Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] was out of the country for another two weeks. The Singapore Air Defense Command (SADC) was also renamed the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) on 01 April 1975, just two days before Khiem arrived. \n\nKhiem proposed for them to leave Singapore and go to Australia so Singapore wouldn't have to deal with them. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://raiderrelease.com/1343/features/mr-pham-shares-experience-of-escaping-communist-invasion-of-south-viet-nam/|title=Mr. Pham Shares Experience of Escaping Communist Invasion of South Viet Nam|last=Klegg|first=Kassandra|date=March 3, 2015|website=Raider Release|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>They agreed, but only if they would pay for gas. They only accepted U.S. currency and all the passengers had a combined total of around $100-400. Khiem tried to bribe with jewelry but they would not accept. The group was moved in separate prison trucks to a detention center outside Singapore. Khiem and the others were released until the [[Fall of Saigon]]. \n\n==== Saipan ====\nAfter spending three weeks in the jail, they were all flown to [[Saipan]] in a deluxe hotel. After a week there, they finally learned that the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] (South Vietnam) had fallen to the northern communists.\n\n==== The United States of America ====\nKhiem and his family ended up at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton, California]], where they were processed into the U.S. Finally, Khiem, Canh, and the others were free at last.\n\n== Homecoming ==\nKhiem got his entire family out, except his youngest brother in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]. He was stationed at [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]]. After the communists took over, he was sent to a brain-washing camp for two years. On 01 August 1992, he was reunited with Khiem and his family through the [[Orderly Departure Program|ODP program]].\n\n== Post-Vietnam Career ==\nWhen Captain Mastronardi found out Khiem was in America, he sent Khiem $500 ($2,200+ today). Khiem and his family then settled in [[Dayton, Ohio]], birthplace of flight, and home to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson AFB]]. In the mid 80's, Khiem was hired by [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u20131989)|Piedmont Airlines]], (later merged with [[US Airways|USAir]] and now [[American Airlines|US Airways]]) and moved to the right seat in only 3 years later. \n\n=== Kind of Hard Landing ===\nOn January 30, 1991, Khiem was flying a [[Boeing 737]], and after leaving [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh NC]], he headed up to [[Washington National Airport]]. Khiem was ready to land at runway 36 but when he was about 3 miles from it, the plane taking off that runway aborted making Khiem redirect to runway 33 (a shorter runway). Khiem swung over, aligning with runway 33 and prepared land. Runway 33 was even shorter with the [[Potomac River]] on one end and [[The Pentagon]] on the other. Khiem maintained airspeed and tried to touch down on the runway numbers which are only 500 feet from the end of runway instead of 1000 feet and Khiem let the air speed drop 5 knots. The 737 slammed on the runway with the two main wheels and the nose with 87 people on-board. Khiem knew this landing was a bit hard on the passengers and was the only bad landing he made in his airline pilot career.\n\n== ''Saigon Lady'' ==\n[[File:Pham_Family_Reunited_With_Saigon_Lady_after_10_years.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Khiem Pham and his Family Reunited With Saigon Lady after 10 years.]]\n[[File:\"Saigon_Lady\",_C-130A_at_National_Warplane_Musuem.jpg|link=File:%22Saigon_Lady%22,_C-130A_at_National_Warplane_Musuem.jpg|alt=|thumb|\"Saigon Lady\", C-130A at National Warplane Musuem]]\nOn April 19, 1985, Khiem and his family visited [[Selfridge Air National Guard Base|Selfridge AFB]] to see the plane that brought his family freedom after ten years. \n\n''Saigon Lady'' was transferred to the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]] on January 30, 1989, where it has been until it was transferred to the [[National Warplane Museum]] for restoration and preparation for public display.\n<br />\n[[File:\"Saigon_Lady\"_in_Washington.jpg|link=File:%22Saigon_Lady%22_in_Washington.jpg|alt=|center|thumb|C-130A, \"Saigon Lady\" in Washington]]\n\n\n\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

Khiem was a cargo pilot with the 53rd Tactical Wing of the 5th Air Division stationed at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]]. Khiem flew several missions into communists gained [[Pleiku Air Base|Pleiku]] in hopes to rescue VNAF personnel. On 03 April 1975, Khiem organized a plan to steal a C-130a and gather 53 people to rescue them from the communist [[North Vietnam|North Vietnamese]]. Later, Khiem became a pilot for [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u20131989)|Piedmont Airlines]] until 2006.\n\n== Early Life ==\n[[File:Pham_Family_1960.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|190x190px|Pham family in 1960.]]\nPham Quang Khiem was born on December 27, 1946, in [[V\u0129nh Long|V\u0129nh-Long, Vietnam]]. Khiem had ten siblings (five boys and five girls) and all of his brothers were in the military. Three of them were in the VNAF and one in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]. Khiem got married on June 8, 1972, to Ngoc-My Tran. Together they had three children: two in South Vietnam and one in the [[United States|United States of America]].\n\n\n\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n== Early Career ==\n[[File:Pham_Quang_Khiem_at_Lockbourne_AFB.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|195x195px|Pham Quang Khiem at Lockbourne AFB]]\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://t28trojanfoundation.com/vnaf.html|title=VNAF|website=Helen Murphy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>In November 1969, Khiem went to [[Lackland Air Force Base|Lackland AFB]] to learn [[English language|English]] as a VNAF air cadet. At [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph AFB]], he earned his basic pilot training, then moved on to [[Keesler Air Force Base|Keesler AFB]], where he flew the [[T-28 Trojan]].\u00a0Khiem also trained at [[Lockbourne AFB]] from October-December of 1970. Eventually, he was designated to fly transport aircraft and was pilot-in-command of [[C-123K]] aircraft before moving up to the 53rd Tactical Wing, 435th Transport Squadron as a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130A]] pilot. \n\n\n\n\n=== Hard Landing ===\n[[File:PQK Tough Landing.jpg|thumb|Pham Quang Khiem in front of the C-123K after the crash landing]]\nOn January 24, 1971, Pham Quang Khiem nearly died almost ending his flight career before it started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vnafmamn.com/hall-offame/amazing_story.html|title=VNAF \"amazing story\"|website=vnafmamn.com|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> After a year of training in the states, Khiem's group was sent to [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan-Rang AFB]] by the VNAF to start \"In Country Training\" with the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] on a [[C-123K]]. Khiem was assigned to fly with 1LT. Minh and their American Instructor, Cpt. John Mastronardi. Minh was the Aircraft Commander in the left seat and in the right, Khiem switched with Captain Mastronardi to execute co-pilot duties. One day, they had an assignment to transfer 48 of 175-millimeter high explosive bullet heads from [[Bien Hoa Air Base|Bien-Hoa Air Base]] to a US firebase 113 kilometers north near the [[Cambodia|Cambodian]] border. They had to land into an isolated area for a safe distance from any airport facilities since they carried high explosive material. They landed on the short dirt strip, [[B\u00f9 Gia M\u1eadp District|B\u00f9 Gia M\u1eadp]] Air Strip (aka Djamap). The runway was 3000' on top of a 1620' hill. Co-Pilots (in this training) weren't allowed to make any landing on any runway shorter than 3600'. Minh was supposed to handle this flight, but Captain Mastronardi kept Khiem in the right seat believing he could handle the landing after previous successful landings. Khiem was a young pilot and didn't know the difference between a short runway and a long one. It was a hostile area so they had to come in high and drop fast. They came down to 2000' at 78 knots and when the [[C-123K]] was about 20 feet in the air crossing the end of the runway Khiem decided to cut the power to idle causing the aircraft to drop touching down extremely hard. The left main landing gear fell into the belly wrecking the wheel and scratched all the red dirt on the runway skyrocketing it into the cockpit. Khiem and Minh couldn't see anything in front of them. Captain Mastronardi immediately reversed the right engine, bringing the aircraft back stopping the aircraft. If Captain Mastronardi had not stop the aircraft, the whole aircraft may have run off the dirt strip dropping hundreds of yards exploding on the side of the hill.\n\n== End of the War ==\nAt the end of March 1975, the North Vietnamese had already taken half of South Vietnam. Citizens were fleeing as well as soldiers creating chaos throughout the country. Both civilians and officers were hitching military aircraft to escape the North Vietnamese. At the end of March of 1975, the [[North Vietnamese army|NVA]] was pushing towards the coast to strike [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]], [[Tuy H\u00f2a]], and [[Nha Trang]]. \n\n=== Pleiku ===\n[[File:North Vietnamese Gains in the last week of March of '75.jpg|thumb|249x249px|North Vietnamese Gains in the last week of March of '75]]\n<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snepp|first=Frank|title=Decent Interval|publisher=Random House|year=1977|isbn=0-394-40743-1|location=New York, United States|pages=234}}</ref> In the north of South Vietnam, the only remaining government enclave was [[Da Nang]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Drendel|first=Lou|title=Air War over Southeast Asia|publisher=squadron/signal|year=1984|isbn=0-89747-148-2|location=1115 Crowley Dr., Carrolton, TX|pages=65}}</ref> Khiem flew three missions into and out of [[Pleiku]], evacuating the families of VNAF personnel. The civil population of Pleiku learned of the evacuation and stormed the [[Pleiku Air Base|airport]]. This forced five C-130's en route from Saigon to turn around before their airlifts were complete. Some C-130's flew bombing missions to destroy the aircraft left behind. They were loaded with 55-gallon drums of [[napalm]], then dropped on VNAF aircraft abandoned on the ramps.\n\n=== Da Nang ===\n28 March 1975, Khiem flew one of the last missions to [[Da Nang Air Base|Da Nang]] at 11:00 pm, the night before its loss. When he landed and taxied to the ramp, an [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] major jumped into the aircraft to assure himself of a seat. Khiem knew that the thousands of people in the terminal would rush the airplane after seeing this, so Khiem kicked him off. Khiem was a First Lieutenant, and the aircraft commander was searching the terminal for his family. But, the ramp was filled with refugees almost immediately anyway. Around 20,000 pounds of cargo on board, so Khiem yelled at them to offload first. The crowd was too chaotic, so Khiem told the [[loadmaster]] to do unloading and loading through the ramp in the back of the C-130. Once finished, people rushed onto the aircraft. Khiem started the engines, scattering many, allowing Khiem to taxi out.\n\nAs they taxied, the loadmaster yelled at Khiem through the intercom saying he couldn't close the ramp because people were on it. Khiem hit the brakes jamming the refugees in tight allowing the ramp to close. At the end of the runway, an MP (Military Police) in a truck had his family in it, blocking the taxiway and pointing his M-16 at the cockpit.  He motioned to let his family on board. Khiem motioned him to move the truck so he could line up on the runway. Khiem backed up, lined up and took off without the MP. Khiem offloaded at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]] and did a headcount of 350 people. C-130's are maximized to carry 92 passengers but Khiem fit almost four times that amount. \n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lockheed-c-130a-45-lm-hercules|title=Lockheed C-130a 45 lm Hercules|last=|first=|date=|website=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=7 April 2020|quote=\"That flight and the panic that Lt.

The following day [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]], South Vietnam's third-largest city was captured by the North Vietnamese. The next target for the North Vietnamese was [[Nha Trang Air Base|Nha Trang]].

So, they allowed Khiem to land on runway 02. They all stayed put until the authorities came.\n\nThe officials had no clue what to do with them. Singapore Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] was out of the country for another two weeks. The Singapore Air Defense Command (SADC) was also renamed the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) on 01 April 1975, just two days before Khiem arrived. \n\nKhiem proposed for them to leave Singapore and go to Australia so Singapore wouldn't have to deal with them. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://raiderrelease.com/1343/features/mr-pham-shares-experience-of-escaping-communist-invasion-of-south-viet-nam/|title=Mr. Pham Shares Experience of Escaping Communist Invasion of South Viet Nam|last=Klegg|first=Kassandra|date=March 3, 2015|website=Raider Release|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>They agreed, but only if they would pay for gas. They only accepted U.S. currency and all the passengers had a combined total of around $100-400. Khiem tried to bribe with jewelry but they would not accept. The group was moved in separate prison trucks to a detention center outside Singapore. Khiem and the others were released until the [[Fall of Saigon]]. \n\n==== Saipan ====\nAfter spending three weeks in the jail, they were all flown to [[Saipan]] in a deluxe hotel. After a week there, they finally learned that the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] (South Vietnam) had fallen to the northern communists.\n\n==== The United States of America ====\nKhiem and his family ended up at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton, California]], where they were processed into the U.S. Finally, Khiem, Canh, and the others were free at last.\n\n== Homecoming ==\nKhiem got his entire family out, except his youngest brother in the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]]. He was stationed at [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]]. After the communists took over, he was sent to a brain-washing camp for two years. On 01 August 1992, he was reunited with Khiem and his family through the [[Orderly Departure Program|ODP program]].\n\n== Post-Vietnam Career ==\nWhen Captain Mastronardi found out Khiem was in America, he sent Khiem $500 ($2,200+ today). Khiem and his family then settled in [[Dayton, Ohio]], birthplace of flight, and home to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson AFB]]. In the mid 80's, Khiem was hired by [[Piedmont Airlines (1948\u20131989)|Piedmont Airlines]], (later merged with [[US Airways|USAir]] and now [[American Airlines|US Airways]]) and moved to the right seat in only 3 years later. \n\n=== Kind of Hard Landing ===\nOn January 30, 1991, Khiem was flying a [[Boeing 737]], and after leaving [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh NC]], he headed up to [[Washington National Airport]]. Khiem was ready to land at runway 36 but when he was about 3 miles from it, the plane taking off that runway aborted making Khiem redirect to runway 33 (a shorter runway). Khiem swung over, aligning with runway 33 and prepared land. Runway 33 was even shorter with the [[Potomac River]] on one end and [[The Pentagon]] on the other. Khiem maintained airspeed and tried to touch down on the runway numbers which are only 500 feet from the end of runway instead of 1000 feet and Khiem let the air speed drop 5 knots. The 737 slammed on the runway with the two main wheels and the nose with 87 people on-board. Khiem knew this landing was a bit hard on the passengers and was the only bad landing he made in his airline pilot career.\n\n== ''Saigon Lady'' ==\n[[File:Pham_Family_Reunited_With_Saigon_Lady_after_10_years.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Khiem Pham and his Family Reunited With Saigon Lady after 10 years.]]\n[[File:\"Saigon_Lady\",_C-130A_at_National_Warplane_Musuem.jpg|link=File:%22Saigon_Lady%22,_C-130A_at_National_Warplane_Musuem.jpg|alt=|thumb|\"Saigon Lady\", C-130A at National Warplane Musuem]]\nOn April 19, 1985, Khiem and his family visited [[Selfridge Air National Guard Base|Selfridge AFB]] to see the plane that brought his family freedom after ten years. \n\n''Saigon Lady'' was transferred to the [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]] on January 30, 1989, where it has been until it was transferred to the [[National Warplane Museum]] for restoration and preparation for public display.\n<br />\n[[File:\"Saigon_Lady\"_in_Washington.jpg|link=File:%22Saigon_Lady%22_in_Washington.jpg|alt=|center|thumb|C-130A, \"Saigon Lady\" in Washington]]\n\n\n\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
