The work is carried out by helicopter and by backpack-sprayers.\n\n==Technology==\nThe German Mosquito Control Association, in German Kommunale Aktionsgemeinschaft zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Schnakenplage (KABS), is an association founded in 1976, with its seat in [[Speyer]] (Germany), by 98 bodies (towns, parishes, counties including [[Baden-Wuerttemberg]], 2013 figure) along the upper [[Rhine]] to combat the problem of [[mosquito]]es in the area. Of the 33 species found in the upper Rhine area over 80% are [[Aedes vexans]]. \nIt is not uncommon to find 50 thousand Aedes eggs in a single square meter of river bank in a flood plain area. KABS employees carry out mosquito control on a 300&nbsp;km stretch of the Rhine between [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] and [[Offenburg]] over an area of around six thousand square kilometers. They exclusively use a protein produced by [[Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis]] (BTI).\nThis work is carried out, depending on the current water levels, accessibility of the terrain and statutory requirements, either on foot or by helicopter. In both cases the biologically active ingredient, which is not allowed to contain living bacteria, is applied in areas of water where the larvae breed. The agent must then be ingested by the larvae, as only then is it activated and leads to a breakup of intestinal cells, and thus extremely selectively kills the organisms.\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe active substance is mixed with water and distributed with a backpack sprayer by workers on foot, or applied as an ice granulate from the air by helicopter.\nIn 2007, 260 tons of the agent were spread by the two available helicopters and 250 helpers, on 84 action days of which 47 were supported by helicopter. This involved 33 thousand working hours and 270 thousand kilometers travelled. At a cost of 400 thousand Euros annually the result is a reduction of the mosquito population by 99% compared to untreated areas. \nThe time of application is critical for the efficiency of the treatment. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in hollows above the normal water level, and they are activated when flood levels are reached. Treatment must follow within a week.\n\nIn addition, residents of the KABS areas are supplied with CULINEX tablets free of charge in order to treat smaller bodies of water such as water butts and garden ponds which do not contain fish. A single water butt can be a source of several hundred mosquitoes.\n\n==Association==\nThe president of the association is Paul Sch\u00e4dler, scientific director of KABS is [[Norbert Becker (biologist)|Norbert Becker]]. It is financed by subscription (membership fees of the 98 affiliated municipal areas). For a city such as Wiesbaden (population 570,000) this means a fee of 45 thousand euros per year.\n\n==International activity==\nKABS also makes its expertise internationally available. Under its English name of German Mosquito Control Association it supports the world-wide mosquito control programme of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and is member of the [[World Mosquito Control Association]].<ref>WHO publications: Guideline Specifications for Bacterial Larvicides for Public Health Use, S. 32</ref>\n\n==Current developments==\nAs flood protection is becoming ever more prevalent, the near future will see an increase in low-lying land. These planned flood areas will be further breeding ground for mosquitoes and will require additional effort which will probably require a third helicopter.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Literature==\n*Norbert Becker, Paul Glaser, Hermann Magin: Biologische Stechm\u00fcckenbek\u00e4mpfung am Oberrhein, (Festschrift) 20 Jahre Kommunale Aktionsgemeinschaft zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Schnakenplage, 1996, {{ISBN|3-00-000584-6}} (Biological Gnat Control on the Upper Rhine (publication) 20 years of a communal action association to combat the gnat plague, 1996)\n*Norbert Becker: Biological control of mosquitoes: management of the Upper Rhine mosquito population as a model programme in J\u00f8rgen Eilenberg, Heikki M.

They exclusively use a protein produced by [[Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis]] (BTI).\nThis work is carried out, depending on the current water levels, accessibility of the terrain and statutory requirements, either on foot or by helicopter. In both cases the biologically active ingredient, which is not allowed to contain living bacteria, is applied in areas of water where the larvae breed. The agent must then be ingested by the larvae, as only then is it activated and leads to a breakup of intestinal cells, and thus extremely selectively kills the organisms.\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe active substance is mixed with water and distributed with a backpack sprayer by workers on foot, or applied as an ice granulate from the air by helicopter.\nIn 2007, 260 tons of the agent were spread by the two available helicopters and 250 helpers, on 84 action days of which 47 were supported by helicopter. This involved 33 thousand working hours and 270 thousand kilometers travelled. At a cost of 400 thousand Euros annually the result is a reduction of the mosquito population by 99% compared to untreated areas. \nThe time of application is critical for the efficiency of the treatment. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in hollows above the normal water level, and they are activated when flood levels are reached. Treatment must follow within a week.\n\nIn addition, residents of the KABS areas are supplied with CULINEX tablets free of charge in order to treat smaller bodies of water such as water butts and garden ponds which do not contain fish. A single water butt can be a source of several hundred mosquitoes.\n\n==Association==\nThe president of the association is Paul Sch\u00e4dler, scientific director of KABS is [[Norbert Becker (biologist)|Norbert Becker]]. It is financed by subscription (membership fees of the 98 affiliated municipal areas). For a city such as Wiesbaden (population 570,000) this means a fee of 45 thousand euros per year.\n\n==International activity==\nKABS also makes its expertise internationally available. Under its English name of German Mosquito Control Association it supports the world-wide mosquito control programme of the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and is member of the [[World Mosquito Control Association]].<ref>WHO publications: Guideline Specifications for Bacterial Larvicides for Public Health Use, S. 32</ref>\n\n==Current developments==\nAs flood protection is becoming ever more prevalent, the near future will see an increase in low-lying land. These planned flood areas will be further breeding ground for mosquitoes and will require additional effort which will probably require a third helicopter.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Literature==\n*Norbert Becker, Paul Glaser, Hermann Magin: Biologische Stechm\u00fcckenbek\u00e4mpfung am Oberrhein, (Festschrift) 20 Jahre Kommunale Aktionsgemeinschaft zur Bek\u00e4mpfung der Schnakenplage, 1996, {{ISBN|3-00-000584-6}} (Biological Gnat Control on the Upper Rhine (publication) 20 years of a communal action association to combat the gnat plague, 1996)\n*Norbert Becker: Biological control of mosquitoes: management of the Upper Rhine mosquito population as a model programme in J\u00f8rgen Eilenberg, Heikki M.

It was the twenty-first named storm and the tenth typhoon of the [[2016 Pacific typhoon season|annual Pacific typhoon season]]. Sarika developed from a tropical disturbance east of the Philippines on October&nbsp;13. The system steadily strengthened as it traveled westwards, becoming a tropical storm later that day and then a typhoon on October&nbsp;15. [[Rapid intensification]] commenced as Sarika turned to the west-northwest towards [[Luzon]], reaching its peak intensity just before making [[landfall]] in [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]] early on October&nbsp;16. Sarika weakened significantly as it crossed land, emerging over the [[South China Sea]] as a minimal typhoon, then weakening further to a severe tropical storm on October&nbsp;17. Sarika maintained its strength for the rest of the day and made landfall in [[Hainan]] province in China on October&nbsp;18. Turning to the northwest, Sarika weakened quickly as it emerged into the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], before moving onshore once again in [[Guangxi]] province on October&nbsp;19. The system dissipated shortly after.\n\nSarika produced significant impacts in the Philippines as a strong typhoon. Strong winds and flooding rainfall caused landslides, power outages, disruption of telecommunications services, and widespread agricultural damage. Nearly 13,000&nbsp;homes were damaged or destroyed, and more than 200,000&nbsp;people were displaced. While not as strong at subsequent landfalls in China, Sarika combined with the northeast monsoon to produce heavy rains across South China and northeast Vietnam. [[Hong Kong]] saw its October hourly rainfall record broken by thunderstorms from Sarika on October&nbsp;19. Gusty winds and torrential rains affected Hainan, Guangxi, and [[Guangdong]], causing damage to crops and infrastructure. At least one person was killed and economic losses reached US$894&nbsp;million.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Sarika 2016 track.png}}\nSarika was first noted by the United States-based [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) as a disorganized tropical disturbance on October&nbsp;11, while it was about {{convert|1050|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Manila]] in the Philippines.<ref name=\"STWA 11/10\">{{cite web|archivedate=January 12, 2015|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/ab/abwpweb.txt|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans October 11, 2016 06z|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VWSRDpix?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/ABPW10-PGTW_201501111100.htm|accessdate=October 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The system quickly consolidated within a favorable environment of low [[wind shear]] and high [[sea surface temperature]]s of about {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}}, leading the JTWC to issue a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]].<ref>{{cite web|archivedate=January 12, 2015|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/ab/abwpweb.txt|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans October 11, 2016 22z|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VWSRDpix?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/ABPW10-PGTW_201501111100.htm|accessdate=October 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> By 00:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;13, the system's [[low-level circulation center]] became increasingly symmetric as it tracked northwestwards and the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression.<ref name=\"JMA BT\">{{cite web |author1=Japan Meteorological Agency |title=RSMC Tropical Cyclone Best Track  Name 1621 Sarika (1621) |url=http://www.wis-jma.go.jp/cms/warning/2016/11/22/typhoon-best-track-2016-11-22t070000z/ |publisher=Tokyo Global Information System Centre |accessdate=April 13, 2020 |date=November 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202035829/http://www.wis-jma.go.jp/cms/warning/2016/11/22/typhoon-best-track-2016-11-22t070000z/ |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"PR 03\">{{cite web |url=http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt |publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center |title=Prognostic Reasoning for Tropical Depression 24W (Twenty-four) Warning Nr 03 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/72IsjwRNh?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/WDPN31-PGTW_201809090300.htm |archivedate=September 9, 2018 |accessdate=April 13, 2020 |date=October 13, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The JTWC followed suit six hours later.<ref name=\"JTWC BT\">{{cite web |last1=Chu |first1=J.

It was the twenty-first named storm and the tenth typhoon of the [[2016 Pacific typhoon season|annual Pacific typhoon season]]. Sarika developed from a tropical disturbance east of the Philippines on October&nbsp;13. The system steadily strengthened as it traveled westwards, becoming a tropical storm later that day and then a typhoon on October&nbsp;15. [[Rapid intensification]] commenced as Sarika turned to the west-northwest towards [[Luzon]], reaching its peak intensity just before making [[landfall]] in [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]] early on October&nbsp;16. Sarika weakened significantly as it crossed land, emerging over the [[South China Sea]] as a minimal typhoon, then weakening further to a severe tropical storm on October&nbsp;17. Sarika maintained its strength for the rest of the day and made landfall in [[Hainan]] province in China on October&nbsp;18. Turning to the northwest, Sarika weakened quickly as it emerged into the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], before moving onshore once again in [[Guangxi]] province on October&nbsp;19. The system dissipated shortly after.\n\nSarika produced significant impacts in the Philippines as a strong typhoon. Strong winds and flooding rainfall caused landslides, power outages, disruption of telecommunications services, and widespread agricultural damage. Nearly 13,000&nbsp;homes were damaged or destroyed, and more than 200,000&nbsp;people were displaced. While not as strong at subsequent landfalls in China, Sarika combined with the northeast monsoon to produce heavy rains across South China and northeast Vietnam. [[Hong Kong]] saw its October hourly rainfall record broken by thunderstorms from Sarika on October&nbsp;19. Gusty winds and torrential rains affected Hainan, Guangxi, and [[Guangdong]], causing damage to crops and infrastructure. At least one person was killed and economic losses reached US$894&nbsp;million.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Sarika 2016 track.png}}\nSarika was first noted by the United States-based [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) as a disorganized tropical disturbance on October&nbsp;11, while it was about {{convert|1050|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Manila]] in the Philippines.<ref name=\"STWA 11/10\">{{cite web|archivedate=January 12, 2015|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/ab/abwpweb.txt|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans October 11, 2016 06z|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VWSRDpix?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/ABPW10-PGTW_201501111100.htm|accessdate=October 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The system quickly consolidated within a favorable environment of low [[wind shear]] and high [[sea surface temperature]]s of about {{convert|30|C|F|abbr=on}}, leading the JTWC to issue a [[Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert]].<ref>{{cite web|archivedate=January 12, 2015|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/ab/abwpweb.txt|publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans October 11, 2016 22z|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VWSRDpix?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/ABPW10-PGTW_201501111100.htm|accessdate=October 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> By 00:00&nbsp;UTC on October&nbsp;13, the system's [[low-level circulation center]] became increasingly symmetric as it tracked northwestwards and the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] (JMA) upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression.<ref name=\"JMA BT\">{{cite web |author1=Japan Meteorological Agency |title=RSMC Tropical Cyclone Best Track  Name 1621 Sarika (1621) |url=http://www.wis-jma.go.jp/cms/warning/2016/11/22/typhoon-best-track-2016-11-22t070000z/ |publisher=Tokyo Global Information System Centre |accessdate=April 13, 2020 |date=November 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202035829/http://www.wis-jma.go.jp/cms/warning/2016/11/22/typhoon-best-track-2016-11-22t070000z/ |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"PR 03\">{{cite web |url=http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/raw/wd/wdpn31.pgtw..txt |publisher=Joint Typhoon Warning Center |title=Prognostic Reasoning for Tropical Depression 24W (Twenty-four) Warning Nr 03 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/72IsjwRNh?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/WDPN31-PGTW_201809090300.htm |archivedate=September 9, 2018 |accessdate=April 13, 2020 |date=October 13, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The JTWC followed suit six hours later.<ref name=\"JTWC BT\">{{cite web |last1=Chu |first1=J.
