It differs from the UK's intelligence agencies ([[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], [[GCHQ]] and [[MI5]]) in that it is an integral part of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) rather than a stand-alone organisation. The organisation employs a mixture of civilian and military staff and is funded within the UK's defence budget. The organisation was formerly known as the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS), but changed its name in 2009.\n\nThe primary role of Defence Intelligence is that of '[[All-source intelligence|all-source]]' [[intelligence analysis]]. This discipline draws information from a variety of overt and covert sources to provide the intelligence needed to support military operations, contingency planning, and to inform defence policy and procurement decisions. The maintenance of the ability to give timely strategic warning of politico-military and scientific and technical developments with the potential to affect UK interests is a vital part of the process. DI's assessments are used outside the MoD to support the work of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC)]] and to assist the work of other Government departments (OGDs) and international partners (such as [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]). It is this 'all-source' function which distinguishes Defence Intelligence from other organisations such as SIS and GCHQ which focus on the collection of 'single-source' Human Intelligence ([[HUMINT]]) and Signals Intelligence ([[SIGINT]]) respectively. As such Defence Intelligence occupies a unique position within the UK intelligence community.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early Years ===\nDefence Intelligence can trace its history back to 1873 and the formation Intelligence Branch of the British [[War Office]], which later became the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]]. The [[Admiralty]], responsible for the command of the [[Royal Navy]], subsequently formed the Foreign Intelligence Committee in 1882, which evolved into the [[Naval Intelligence Department (United Kingdom)|Naval Intelligence Department]] (NID) in 1887 while the [[Committee of Imperial Defence]], established in 1902, was responsible for co-ordination between the different armed services of on issues of [[military strategy]] intelligence assessments and estimates. During [[World War I]], British [[Secret service|secret services]] were divided into numbered sections named ''Military Intelligence'' together with a department number, such as MI1 for the secretariat of the Director of Military Intelligence. Many of the original MI departments, such as MI4 (Aerial Photography) were eventually subsumed into Defence Intelligence, while the more famous [[MI5]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] denoted the liaison sections with the Security Service and Secret Intelligence Service respectively.\n\n=== Post-war years ===\nShortly after the Second World War, the topographical department of the [[War Office]] was transformed into the Joint Intelligence Bureau (JIB), and its director, [[Kenneth Strong|Sir Kenneth Strong]], became a full member of the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] (JIC) in January 1947.\u00a0 The JIB was a high-powered research unit collating topographic and economic intelligence with political background so as to serve possible future military operations. It was not loved by the armed services, where its mingling of services and uniformed and civilian experts was seen as a threat to the traditional forms of service intelligence but it represented a first step in the direction of full integration of defence intelligence<ref>{{Cite book|last=Craddock|first=Percy|title=Know Your Enemy: How the Joint Intelligence Committee Saw the World.|publisher=John Murray Ltd|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=p.261}}</ref>.\n\n==Organisation==\nDefence Intelligence is headed by the Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) who is a serving [[three-star rank|three-star military officer]] and who, as the MOD's 'intelligence process owner', is also responsible for the overall co-ordination of intelligence activities throughout the Armed Forces and single Service Commands.

Examples of the support DI has provided to operations are:<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n* Coalition action in Iraq\n* NATO led forces in Afghanistan and Bosnia\n* UN humanitarian and peace-support operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cyprus, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo\nDI has deployed intelligence analysts, linguists and reservists overseas, and provide geographic support by supplying both standard and specialised mapping to overseas theatres.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Support to contingency planning for operations''': DI provides intelligence data and all source assessments that assist in preparations for future situations with the potential to require the commitment of UK Armed Forces. These products, which cover political and military developments, country and cultural information, critical infrastructure and internal security, all aid contingency planning.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of early warning''': A fundamental responsibility of Defence Intelligence is to alert ministers, chiefs of staff, senior officials and defence planners to impending crises around the world. Such warning is vital for short and medium term planning. DI meets this responsibility by focusing on current areas and topics of concern, highlighting the effects of changing circumstances, predicting security and stability trends, and assessing how these trends may develop. The assessments are distributed to decision-makers throughout the MOD, the Armed Forces, other government departments, allies, and UK Embassies and High Commissions.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of longer-term analysis of emerging threats''': Defence Intelligence provides longer-term assessments of likely scenarios around the world where UK Armed Forces might need to operate and of the equipment that they might face. It also provides technical support to the development of future military equipment and to the development of countermeasures against potentially hostile systems.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n==How Defence Intelligence carries out its work==\n'''Direction''': The Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) receives direction from the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) on MOD's Intelligence needs and draws national guidance from the Cabinet Office Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).\n\n'''Analysis and production''': Intelligence assessments are written to meet the needs of customers and must be timely and relevant. The assessment process involves judging the authenticity and reliability of new information and its relevance to existing intelligence. Assessments focus on probable and possible outcomes, to provide the best available advice for developing a response or resolution. They are continually adjusted in light of new intelligence or events.\n\n==Chiefs of Defence Intelligence==\nThe Chiefs have been as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |title=Ministry of Defence Senior Posts |accessdate=7 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033054/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2015 }}</ref><br>\n'''Director-General Intelligence'''\n* Major-General Sir [[Kenneth Strong]], 1964\u20131966\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Alfred Earle]], rtd 1966\u20131968\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Harold Maguire]], rtd 1968\u20131972\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Louis Le Bailly]] rtd 1972\u20131975\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[David Willison]], rtd 1975\u20131978\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[John Aiken (RAF officer)|John Aiken]], rtd 1978\u20131981\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Roy Halliday]], rtd 1981\u20131984\n\n'''Chiefs of Defence Intelligence'''\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Michael Armitage (RAF officer)|Michael Armitage]] 1984\u20131986\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Derek Boorman]] 1986\u20131988\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[John Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|John Kerr]] 1988\u20131991\n* Air Marshal Sir [[John Walker (RAF officer)|John Walker]], 1991\u20131994\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[John Foley (British Army general)|John Foley]], 1994\u20131997\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan West, Baron West of Spithead|Sir Alan West]], 1997\u20132000\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Joe French]], 2000\u20132003\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Andrew Ridgway]], 2003\u20132006\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Stuart Peach]] 2006\u20132009\n* Air Marshal [[Chris Nickols|Christopher Nickols]] 2009\u20132012\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan Richards]] 2012\u20132015\n* Air Marshal [[Philip Osborn]] 2015\u20132018\n* Lieutenant-General [[James Hockenhull]] 2018\u2013present\n\n==See also==\n* [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] \u2013 United States counterpart\n* [[JARIC]]\n* [[List of intelligence agencies]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]\n* [[Operation Rockingham]]\n* [[RAF Intelligence]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Dylan|first=Huw |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sSTSBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=twopage&q&f=false|title=Defence Intelligence and the Cold War: Britain's Joint Intelligence Bureau 1945\u20131964|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0199657025}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/defence-intelligence#defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence Staff] (last updated 2012)\n* [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/caboff/nim/0114301808.pdf/ National Intelligence Machinery]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence-services#defence-geospatial-intelligence-fusion-centre/ Defence Intelligence] (last updated 2012;

Examples of the support DI has provided to operations are:<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n* Coalition action in Iraq\n* NATO led forces in Afghanistan and Bosnia\n* UN humanitarian and peace-support operations in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cyprus, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo\nDI has deployed intelligence analysts, linguists and reservists overseas, and provide geographic support by supplying both standard and specialised mapping to overseas theatres.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Support to contingency planning for operations''': DI provides intelligence data and all source assessments that assist in preparations for future situations with the potential to require the commitment of UK Armed Forces. These products, which cover political and military developments, country and cultural information, critical infrastructure and internal security, all aid contingency planning.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of early warning''': A fundamental responsibility of Defence Intelligence is to alert ministers, chiefs of staff, senior officials and defence planners to impending crises around the world. Such warning is vital for short and medium term planning. DI meets this responsibility by focusing on current areas and topics of concern, highlighting the effects of changing circumstances, predicting security and stability trends, and assessing how these trends may develop. The assessments are distributed to decision-makers throughout the MOD, the Armed Forces, other government departments, allies, and UK Embassies and High Commissions.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n'''Provision of longer-term analysis of emerging threats''': Defence Intelligence provides longer-term assessments of likely scenarios around the world where UK Armed Forces might need to operate and of the equipment that they might face. It also provides technical support to the development of future military equipment and to the development of countermeasures against potentially hostile systems.<ref name=\"DIS\"/>\n\n==How Defence Intelligence carries out its work==\n'''Direction''': The Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI) receives direction from the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) on MOD's Intelligence needs and draws national guidance from the Cabinet Office Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).\n\n'''Analysis and production''': Intelligence assessments are written to meet the needs of customers and must be timely and relevant. The assessment process involves judging the authenticity and reliability of new information and its relevance to existing intelligence. Assessments focus on probable and possible outcomes, to provide the best available advice for developing a response or resolution. They are continually adjusted in light of new intelligence or events.\n\n==Chiefs of Defence Intelligence==\nThe Chiefs have been as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |title=Ministry of Defence Senior Posts |accessdate=7 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117033054/http://www.gulabin.com/armynavy/pdf/Ministry%20of%20Defence%20Senior%20Posts.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2015 }}</ref><br>\n'''Director-General Intelligence'''\n* Major-General Sir [[Kenneth Strong]], 1964\u20131966\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Alfred Earle]], rtd 1966\u20131968\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Harold Maguire]], rtd 1968\u20131972\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Louis Le Bailly]] rtd 1972\u20131975\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[David Willison]], rtd 1975\u20131978\n* Air Chief Marshal Sir [[John Aiken (RAF officer)|John Aiken]], rtd 1978\u20131981\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[Roy Halliday]], rtd 1981\u20131984\n\n'''Chiefs of Defence Intelligence'''\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Michael Armitage (RAF officer)|Michael Armitage]] 1984\u20131986\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Derek Boorman]] 1986\u20131988\n* Vice-Admiral Sir [[John Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|John Kerr]] 1988\u20131991\n* Air Marshal Sir [[John Walker (RAF officer)|John Walker]], 1991\u20131994\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[John Foley (British Army general)|John Foley]], 1994\u20131997\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan West, Baron West of Spithead|Sir Alan West]], 1997\u20132000\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Joe French]], 2000\u20132003\n* Lieutenant-General Sir [[Andrew Ridgway]], 2003\u20132006\n* Air Marshal Sir [[Stuart Peach]] 2006\u20132009\n* Air Marshal [[Chris Nickols|Christopher Nickols]] 2009\u20132012\n* Vice-Admiral [[Alan Richards]] 2012\u20132015\n* Air Marshal [[Philip Osborn]] 2015\u20132018\n* Lieutenant-General [[James Hockenhull]] 2018\u2013present\n\n==See also==\n* [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] \u2013 United States counterpart\n* [[JARIC]]\n* [[List of intelligence agencies]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]\n* [[Operation Rockingham]]\n* [[RAF Intelligence]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last=Dylan|first=Huw |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sSTSBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=twopage&q&f=false|title=Defence Intelligence and the Cold War: Britain's Joint Intelligence Bureau 1945\u20131964|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0199657025}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/defence-intelligence#defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence Defence Intelligence Staff] (last updated 2012)\n* [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/caboff/nim/0114301808.pdf/ National Intelligence Machinery]\n* [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/defence-intelligence-services#defence-geospatial-intelligence-fusion-centre/ Defence Intelligence] (last updated 2012; withdrawn 2014)\n\n{{Military intelligence agencies}}\n{{UK_Intelligence_Agencies}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:British intelligence agencies]]\n[[Category:Huntingdonshire]]\n[[Category:Military communications of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Military intelligence agencies]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1964]]\n[[Category:Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Cambridgeshire]]\n", "name_user": "Kenstrong", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Intelligence"}

Rocky, a small-time [[club fighter]], gets a shot at the [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|world heavyweight championship]]. The film also stars [[Talia Shire]] as Adrian, [[Burt Young]] as Adrian's brother Paulie, [[Burgess Meredith]] as Rocky's trainer [[Mickey Goldmill]], and [[Carl Weathers]] as the reigning champion, [[Apollo Creed]].\n\nThe film, made on a budget of just over $1 million, was a [[sleeper hit]]; it earned $225 million in global box office receipts, becoming the [[1976 in film|highest-grossing film of 1976]]. The film was critically acclaimed and solidified Stallone's career as well as commenced his rise to prominence as a major [[movie star]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Sylvester_Stallone.shtml|title=Inside the Actors Studio with Sylvester Stallone|publisher=[[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006041106/http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Sylvester_Stallone.shtml|archivedate=October 6, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 28, 2006}}</ref> Among other accolades, it went on to receive ten [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning three, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\". ''Rocky'' is considered to be one of [[List of films considered the best#Sports|the greatest sports films ever made]] and was ranked as the second-best in the genre, after ''[[Raging Bull]]'', by the [[American Film Institute]] in 2008.\n\nThe film has spawned [[Rocky (film series)|seven sequels]]: ''[[Rocky II]]'' (1979), ''[[Rocky III]]'' (1982), ''[[Rocky IV]]'' (1985), ''[[Rocky V]]'' (1990), ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (2006), ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]'' (2015), and ''[[Creed II]]'' (2018). Stallone portrays Rocky in all eight films, wrote seven of the eight films, and directed four of the six titular installments. In July 2019, Stallone said in an interview that there have been ongoing discussions about a prequel to the original film based on the life of a young Rocky Balboa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://popculture.com/movies/2019/07/23/sylvester-stallone-reveals-rocky-sequel-prequel-in-development/ |title=Sylvester Stallone Reveals 'Rocky' Sequel and Prequel Are in Development |work= popculture.com |accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please try to refrain from expanding the plot, adding POV style information and including aspects of the fight that the reader doesn't need to know and can learn from renting the film.

However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him.\n\nCreed selects [[Rocky Balboa]], a journeyman [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]] boxer who fights primarily in small gyms and works as a collector for a loan shark. Rocky meets with [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] George Jergens under the presumption that Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of beef as [[punching bag]]s.\n\nRocky is later approached by Mickey \"Mighty Mick\" Goldmill, an aging former [[bantamweight]] fighter turned trainer whose gym Rocky frequents, about training him further. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and sees him as a wasted talent, but eventually accepts the offer.\n\nMeanwhile, Rocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at a [[pet store]], culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie helps him get a date for his sister and even offered to work as a corner man with him, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the [[Meat packing industry|meatpacking business]] Paulie works for as part of the upcoming fight. Rocky turned him down. The night before the fight, a sleepless Rocky visits the Philadelphia Spectrum and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to [[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]] against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone. That is he can go the distance and still standing he won't be another bum from a neighborhood.\n\nOn [[New Year's Day]], the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as [[George Washington]] and then [[Uncle Sam]]. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round\u2014the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries. Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut in order to restore his vision. Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.\n\nAfter the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was \"the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring\", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a [[split decision]] (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Rocky characters}} \n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]]\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrianna \"Adrian\" Pennino]]\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as [[Mickey Goldmill]]\n* [[Thayer David]] as [[List of Rocky characters#George \"Miles\" Jergens|George \"Miles\" Jergens]]\n* [[Joe Spinell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Tony Gazzo|Tony Gazzo]]\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]\n* [[Pedro Lovell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Spider Rico|Spider Rico]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[Sylvester Stallone]] wrote the screenplay for ''Rocky'' in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Chuck Wepner]] that took place at [[Richfield Coliseum]] in [[Richfield, Ohio]] on March 24, 1975.

The producers also had trouble casting other major characters in the story, with Apollo Creed and Adrian cast unusually late by production standards. Real-life boxer [[Ken Norton]] was initially sought for the role of [[Apollo Creed]], but he pulled out and the role was ultimately given to [[Carl Weathers]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vellin|first1=Bob|title=Former heavyweight champion Ken Norton dies at 70|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/boxing/2013/09/18/former-heavywegith-champion-ken-norton-die/2834521/|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=December 2, 2015|date=September 19, 2013}}</ref> Norton had had three fights with [[Muhammad Ali]], upon whom Creed was loosely based. According to ''The Rocky Scrapbook'', [[Carrie Snodgress]] was originally chosen to play Adrian, but a money dispute forced the producers to look elsewhere. [[Susan Sarandon]] auditioned for the role but was deemed too pretty for the character. After [[Talia Shire]]'s ensuing audition, Chartoff and Winkler, along with Avildsen, insisted that she play the part.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nBoxer [[Joe Frazier]] has a [[cameo appearance]] in the film. The character of Apollo Creed was influenced by outspoken boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] who fought Frazier three times. During the [[49th Academy Awards]] ceremony in 1977, Ali and Stallone staged a brief comic confrontation to show Ali was not offended by the film. Some of the plot's most memorable moments\u2014Rocky's carcass-punching scenes and Rocky running up the steps of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], as part of his training regimen\u2014are taken from the real-life exploits of Joe Frazier, for which he received no credit.<ref name = \"Joe Frazier Inspiration\">{{cite news|title=Still smokin' over Ali but there's no time for hatred now|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/nov/11/sportinterviews-boxing|work=The Guardian|first=Donald|last=McRae|date=November 11, 2008|accessdate=October 3, 2010|location=London}}</ref>\n\nDue to the film's comparatively low budget, members of Stallone's family played minor roles.

However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him.\n\nCreed selects [[Rocky Balboa]], a journeyman [[Southpaw stance|southpaw]] boxer who fights primarily in small gyms and works as a collector for a loan shark. Rocky meets with [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] George Jergens under the presumption that Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. Rocky undergoes several weeks of unorthodox training, such as using sides of beef as [[punching bag]]s.\n\nRocky is later approached by Mickey \"Mighty Mick\" Goldmill, an aging former [[bantamweight]] fighter turned trainer whose gym Rocky frequents, about training him further. Rocky is not willing initially, as Mickey has not shown much interest in helping him before and sees him as a wasted talent, but eventually accepts the offer.\n\nMeanwhile, Rocky begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at a [[pet store]], culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie helps him get a date for his sister and even offered to work as a corner man with him, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky placates him by agreeing to advertise the [[Meat packing industry|meatpacking business]] Paulie works for as part of the upcoming fight. Rocky turned him down. The night before the fight, a sleepless Rocky visits the Philadelphia Spectrum and begins to lose confidence. He confesses to Adrian that he does not believe he can win, but strives to [[The distance (boxing)|go the distance]] against Creed, which no other fighter has done, to prove himself to everyone. That is he can go the distance and still standing he won't be another bum from a neighborhood.\n\nOn [[New Year's Day]], the fight is held with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as [[George Washington]] and then [[Uncle Sam]]. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round\u2014the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humbled and worried, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries. Rocky, with hits to the head and swollen eyes, requires his right eyelid to be cut in order to restore his vision. Apollo, with internal bleeding and a broken rib, struggles to breathe. As the fight concludes, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.\n\nAfter the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was \"the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring\", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a [[split decision]] (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{main|List of Rocky characters}} \n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]]\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrianna \"Adrian\" Pennino]]\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as [[Mickey Goldmill]]\n* [[Thayer David]] as [[List of Rocky characters#George \"Miles\" Jergens|George \"Miles\" Jergens]]\n* [[Joe Spinell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Tony Gazzo|Tony Gazzo]]\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]\n* [[Pedro Lovell]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Spider Rico|Spider Rico]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and writing===\n[[Sylvester Stallone]] wrote the screenplay for ''Rocky'' in three and a half days, shortly after watching the championship match between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Chuck Wepner]] that took place at [[Richfield Coliseum]] in [[Richfield, Ohio]] on March 24, 1975.
