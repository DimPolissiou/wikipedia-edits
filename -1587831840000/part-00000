{"title_page": "Elections in California", "text_new": "{{Elections in California}}\n'''Elections in California''' are held to fill various local, state and federal seats. In [[California]], regular elections are held every even year (such as 2006 and 2008); however, some seats have terms of office that are longer than two years, so not every seat is on the ballot in every election. [[By-election|Special elections]] may be held to fill vacancies at other points in time.  [[Recall election]]s can also be held.  Additionally, statewide [[initiative]]s, [[legislative referral]]s and [[Referendum|referenda]] may be on the ballot.\n\n==Elected offices==\n===Federal===\nAs with every other state in the [[United States]], California participates in Federal elections including electing Representatives to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and Senators to the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Additionally, the state (as of 2010) casts 55 votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] during [[United States presidential election|Presidential elections]].\n\n====President====\n{{main|United States presidential election|United States presidential elections in California}}\nEvery four years (since 1792), the United States holds a national [[indirect election]] for [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. In such elections, voters cast their votes for a slate of representatives (electors) who have pledged to cast their votes for a particular presidential and vice presidential candidate (a [[Ticket (election)|ticket]]) in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. During the election, the voters of the state select the slate of electors on the ballot by voting for the ticket that they are pledged to. The slate of electors pledged to the ticket with the most votes statewide gets to vote in the Electoral College. Although, the electors are not obligated to vote for the candidates they are pledged to, they usually do. The number of electors the state is allocated is equal to the number representatives in [[United States Congress|Congress]] that the state has (the members in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], plus the two [[United States Senate|senators]]).\n\n====Senate====\nCalifornia, like all other states in the United States, is represented in the United States Senate by two [[United States Senator|Senators]]. In addition to Representatives in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], California's Senators represent the state's constituents in Congress. [[Kamala Harris]] and [[Dianne Feinstein]] currently serve as the state's senators. Each senator is elected to serve a six-year term with Harris having last been elected in 2016 (filling the recently vacated seat of former ret. U.S. Senator [[Barbara Boxer]]) and Feinstein in 2018. Each U.S. Senator is elected in a statewide election following earlier primary elections typically held in the first week of June during which both major national parties (the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and [[Republicans (GOP)|Republicans]]) and minor parties nominate candidates via popular vote. There is no limit to the number of terms that a senator may serve so long as they continue to be elected to the position via statewide vote.\n\n====House of Representatives====\n{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in California}}\nSimilarly, California is also represented in the US Congress by fifty-three [[Congressmen|Congressional Representatives]] representing the fifty-three congressional districts in the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/CA#representatives|title=California Senators, Representatives, and Congressional District Maps - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> As in all other states, these congressional districts are [[United States congressional apportionment|reapportioned]] every ten years following the release of a new census.

These representatives are elected for two year terms as per the rules of the House of Representatives and currently feature a number of prominent members of the body such as House minority leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], and House majority leader and current [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].\n\n===State===\nCalifornia has a [[Governor of California|gubernatorial election]] every four years and, in 2003, it had a [[California recall election, 2003|recall election]].  [[Primary election]]s were held in March or June until 2008, when they were held in February.  [[General election]]s, which cover statewide issues, continue to be held in November.  On a county-by-county basis, elections also cover electing municipal leaders.  In addition, a [[special election]] can occur at any time.\n\n===Local===\n{{further|Local government in California}}\n\nIn addition, many if not most of California's [[list of counties in California|county]], [[list of cities in California|city]], [[list of school districts in California|school district]], [[California Community Colleges System|community college district]], [[list of California Health Districts|health care district]], [[municipal utility district]], [[transit district]] and other special district officers are elected.\n\nEffective January 1, 2018, all of California's cities, K-12 school districts, community college districts and special districts will have to move their election dates to a statewide election (primary or general) held during an even-numbered year due to the passage of Senate Bill 415 (California Voter Participation Rights Act), which was approved by the California Senate and Assembly and signed by the Governor in 2015. The 2018 elections will be held on June 5 (primary) and November 6 (general). Starting in 2020, the Presidential Primary will move to March which also include the U.S. House of Representatives, California State Senate and Assembly and County Boards of Supervisors. U.S. Senate Primary in California will take place in March 2022. Los Angeles City Council and School Board will have its Primary election in March and its runoff election in November beginning in 2020, due to the passage of Charter Amendments 1 and 2 during the 2015 elections.\n\n==Procedure==\nPursuant to [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|Proposition 14 (2010)]], California uses a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] for \"voter-nominated\" offices, which include:<ref name=\"lwvc\">{{cite web|title=Voting in the Primary Election|publisher=League of Women Voters California|url=http://cavotes.org/vote/primary}}</ref>\n\n* United States Senators,\n* United States Representatives,\n* State Senators,\n* State Assembly members,\n* the Governor,\n* the Lieutenant Governor,\n* the State Treasurer,\n* the State Controller,\n* the State Insurance Commissioner,\n* the State Superintendent of Public Instruction (nonpartisan),\n* the Secretary of State,\n* and the State Attorney General.\n\nIn this system voters may vote for any candidate in the primary and the top two candidates who receive the most votes advance to the general election.

It may take the form of a [[constitutional amendment]] or an ordinary [[statute]]. A ballot proposition may be proposed by the [[California State Legislature|State Legislature]] or by a petition signed by members of the public under the [[initiative]] system.

Likewise, there is some consensus that a ''True Adventurers Grand Slam'' is achieved by also visiting the magnetic [[North Magnetic Pole|north]] and [[South Magnetic Pole|south]] poles.<ref>{{cite web |title=First person to complete the Adventurers Grand Slam |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-person-to-complete-the-adventurers-grand-slam |website=Guinness World Records |accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, [[David Hempleman-Adams]] became the first person to complete a ''Explorers Grand Slam''.<ref>{{cite news|title=North Pole party for 'Grand Slam' Briton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/85916.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1998-04-30}}</ref><ref name=\"theexpweb\">{{cite web |last1=Van Den Broek |first1=Alex |title=Can the Explorer\u2019s Grand Slam Be Saved? |url=https://explorersweb.com/2018/08/22/can-the-explorers-grand-slam-be-saved/ |website=The Explorers Web |accessdate=22 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2005, [[Park Young Seok]] became the first person to complete a ''True Explorers Grand Slam''.<ref name=\"park-2005\">{{cite web|title=Mr. Park completes the Grand Slam|url=http://www.everestnews.com/stories2005/park05012005.htm|publisher=EverestNews.com|date=April 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, former [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales rugby union international]] [[Richard Parks]] became the first person ever to complete the (Last Degrees) Grand Slam within a single calendar year, doing so within seven months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/143809.html?e=headline |title=Parks completes epic challenge |work=ESPN Scrum |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref>\n\nOn April 16, 2013, [[Vanessa O'Brien]] became the first woman to complete the (Last Degree) Grand Slam under a single calendar year, doing so in eleven months.<ref name=vob1>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/culturedesk/2013/04/18/climber/QE0KzoLvVoOYpdvZSIJvUO/story.html |title=Boston's Vanessa O'Brien Completes 'Explorer's Grand Slam' in Record Time |publisher=Boston.com|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref name=vob2>{{cite web |url=http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/excursions/post/woman-does-explorers-grand-slam-in-record-time/ |title=Boston's Vanessa O'Brien Becomes First Woman to Climb Seven Summits |publisher=Grind TV |date=May 2013 |access-date=2013-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827080810/http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/excursions/post/woman-does-explorers-grand-slam-in-record-time/ |archive-date=2014-08-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"theexpweb\" />\n\nOn April 22, 2013, Cheryl Bart became the first Australian female and the 31st person worldwide to complete the Explorer's Grand Slam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/historic-feat-for-australian-woman-conquering-explorers-grand-slam/1121012 |title=Historic feat for Australian woman conquering Explorer's Grand Slam}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-diary/kings-landing-another-success-with-fantasy-food-20130423-2icrr.html |title=Icy grand slam success | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Jing Wang (mountaineer)|Jing Wang]] became the fastest woman to complete the (last degree) Grand Slam in 142 days.<ref name=\"gantabya\">{{cite web|title=AN AWESOME ADVENTURE OF WANG JING|url=http://gantabyanepalnews.com/interview/2833|website=Gantabya Nepal News|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Ryan Waters]] became the first American to complete the ''True Adventurers Grand Slam'' by skiing full-length, unsupported and unassisted North and South Pole expeditions and climbing the seven summits.\n\nOn April 21, 2015, [[Tashi and Nungshi Malik|Tashi Malik and Nungshi Malik]] became world's first twins and siblings as well as the first South Asians to complete the Explorers Grand Slam (last degree).\n\nOn May 27, 2016, [[Colin O'Brady]] became the fastest person to complete the Explorers Grand Slam (Last Degree), doing so in 139 days.

Likewise, there is some consensus that a ''True Adventurers Grand Slam'' is achieved by also visiting the magnetic [[North Magnetic Pole|north]] and [[South Magnetic Pole|south]] poles.<ref>{{cite web |title=First person to complete the Adventurers Grand Slam |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-person-to-complete-the-adventurers-grand-slam |website=Guinness World Records |accessdate=18 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, [[David Hempleman-Adams]] became the first person to complete a ''Explorers Grand Slam''.<ref>{{cite news|title=North Pole party for 'Grand Slam' Briton|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/85916.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=1998-04-30}}</ref><ref name=\"theexpweb\">{{cite web |last1=Van Den Broek |first1=Alex |title=Can the Explorer\u2019s Grand Slam Be Saved? |url=https://explorersweb.com/2018/08/22/can-the-explorers-grand-slam-be-saved/ |website=The Explorers Web |accessdate=22 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2005, [[Park Young Seok]] became the first person to complete a ''True Explorers Grand Slam''.<ref name=\"park-2005\">{{cite web|title=Mr. Park completes the Grand Slam|url=http://www.everestnews.com/stories2005/park05012005.htm|publisher=EverestNews.com|date=April 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, former [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales rugby union international]] [[Richard Parks]] became the first person ever to complete the (Last Degrees) Grand Slam within a single calendar year, doing so within seven months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/143809.html?e=headline |title=Parks completes epic challenge |work=ESPN Scrum |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2011-07-12}}</ref>\n\nOn April 16, 2013, [[Vanessa O'Brien]] became the first woman to complete the (Last Degree) Grand Slam under a single calendar year, doing so in eleven months.<ref name=vob1>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/culturedesk/2013/04/18/climber/QE0KzoLvVoOYpdvZSIJvUO/story.html |title=Boston's Vanessa O'Brien Completes 'Explorer's Grand Slam' in Record Time |publisher=Boston.com|date=April 2013}}</ref><ref name=vob2>{{cite web |url=http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/excursions/post/woman-does-explorers-grand-slam-in-record-time/ |title=Boston's Vanessa O'Brien Becomes First Woman to Climb Seven Summits |publisher=Grind TV |date=May 2013 |access-date=2013-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827080810/http://www.grindtv.com/outdoor/excursions/post/woman-does-explorers-grand-slam-in-record-time/ |archive-date=2014-08-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"theexpweb\" />\n\nOn April 22, 2013, Cheryl Bart became the first Australian female and the 31st person worldwide to complete the Explorer's Grand Slam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/historic-feat-for-australian-woman-conquering-explorers-grand-slam/1121012 |title=Historic feat for Australian woman conquering Explorer's Grand Slam}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-diary/kings-landing-another-success-with-fantasy-food-20130423-2icrr.html |title=Icy grand slam success | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Jing Wang (mountaineer)|Jing Wang]] became the fastest woman to complete the (last degree) Grand Slam in 142 days.<ref name=\"gantabya\">{{cite web|title=AN AWESOME ADVENTURE OF WANG JING|url=http://gantabyanepalnews.com/interview/2833|website=Gantabya Nepal News|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Ryan Waters]] became the first American to complete the ''True Adventurers Grand Slam'' by skiing full-length, unsupported and unassisted North and South Pole expeditions and climbing the seven summits.\n\nOn April 21, 2015, [[Tashi and Nungshi Malik|Tashi Malik and Nungshi Malik]] became world's first twins and siblings as well as the first South Asians to complete the Explorers Grand Slam (last degree).\n\nOn May 27, 2016, [[Colin O'Brady]] became the fastest person to complete the Explorers Grand Slam (Last Degree), doing so in 139 days.

The medication would include [[hydroxychloroquine]], which is established in other countries as an anti-malarial drug but is known to have serious side-effects.  The Australian drugs regulator, the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA), had warned that this drug and its derivatives \u201cpose well-known serious risks to patients including cardiac toxicity potentially leading to sudden heart attacks, irreversible eye damage and severe depletion of blood sugar potentially leading to coma\u201d.

It was planned that ''[[Titanic II]]'' would be built in China and would make its maiden voyage from [[Southampton]] to New York City in 2016 (later postponed to 2018). Palmer hoped to recreate the ''Titanic'' as closely as possible with its familiar external and internal appearances. According to Palmer, the ''Titanic II'' would be 883 feet long, weigh 55,800 gross tons and carry 2,435 passengers and 900 crew.

The medication would include [[hydroxychloroquine]], which is established in other countries as an anti-malarial drug but is known to have serious side-effects.  The Australian drugs regulator, the [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] (TGA), had warned that this drug and its derivatives \u201cpose well-known serious risks to patients including cardiac toxicity potentially leading to sudden heart attacks, irreversible eye damage and severe depletion of blood sugar potentially leading to coma\u201d.

Palmer hoped to recreate the ''Titanic'' as closely as possible with its familiar external and internal appearances. According to Palmer, the ''Titanic II'' would be 883 feet long, weigh 55,800 gross tons and carry 2,435 passengers and 900 crew. Palmer said the ''Titanic II'' would honour the memories of those who died and survived on the ''Titanic''.
