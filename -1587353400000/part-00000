This was the Crimson Tide's 125th overall season, 86th as a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC), and 28th within the SEC's [[Southeastern Conference#Current members|Western Division]]. They played their home games at [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], and were led by 13th-year head coach [[Nick Saban]].\n\nThe defending national runners-up, Alabama began the season ranked second in the AP Poll, and were the favorites to repeat as SEC Champions. The Crimson Tide won their first seven games of the year handily, and rose to first in the AP Poll, but were ranked third in the first [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the year heading into an anticipated match-up against second-ranked [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], which Alabama lost 46\u201341. The next week, Alabama lost starting quarterback [[Tua Tagovailoa]] to a season-ending hip injury in the game against [[2019 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]]. They finished the regular season with a 48\u201345 loss to rival [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]].\n\nWith a regular season record of 10\u20132, Alabama was not selected for the [[College Football Playoff]] for the first time since the inception of the format in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]. While the Crimson Tide were not invited to a [[New Year's Six]] bowl game, they defeated [[2019 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in the [[2020 Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]].\n\nQuarterback Tua Tagovailoa, at the time of his injury, was considered a candidate for the Heisman Trophy and was on pace to break his own NCAA FBS passer rating record. He was replaced by backup [[Mac Jones]] for the remainder of the season. Running back [[Najee Harris]] led the team with 1,224 rushing yards and 20 total touchdowns, tied for the SEC lead. Receivers [[Jerry Jeudy]] and [[Devonta Smith]] were both named All-SEC. On defense, the team was led by first-team all-conference players linebacker [[Anfernee Jennings]] and safety [[Xavier McKinney]].\n\n==Previous season==\nIn [[2018 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2018]], Alabama went undefeated in the regular season and won the [[2018 SEC Championship Game]] over [[2018 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]]. The Crimson Tide entered the [[College Football Playoff]] as the number one seed, winning the semi-final played at the [[2018 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] over [[2018 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] before falling to [[2018 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in the [[2019 College Football Playoff National Championship]].\n\n==Offseason==\n===Position key===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[Running back|Back]]\n|'''B'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Center (American football)|Center]]\n|'''C'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Cornerback]]\n|'''CB'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Defensive back]]\n|'''DB'''\n|-\n|[[Defensive end]]\n|'''DE'''\n|[[Defensive lineman]]\n|'''DL'''\n|[[Defensive tackle]]\n|'''DT'''\n|[[End (American football)|End]]\n|'''E'''\n|-\n|[[Fullback (American football)|Fullback]]\n|'''FB'''\n|[[Guard (American football)|Guard]]\n|'''G'''\n|[[Halfback (American football)|Halfback]]\n|'''HB'''\n|[[Placekicker|Kicker]]\n|'''K'''\n|-\n|[[Kickoff returner]]\n|'''KR'''\n|[[Offensive tackle]]\n|'''OT'''\n|[[Lineman (American football)|Offensive lineman]]\n|'''OL'''\n|[[Linebacker]]\n|'''LB'''\n|-\n|[[Long snapper]]\n|'''LS'''\n|[[Punter (American football)|Punter]]\n|'''P'''\n|[[Punt returner]]\n|'''PR'''\n|[[Quarterback]]\n|'''QB'''\n|-\n|[[Running back]]\n|'''RB'''\n|[[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|Safety]]\n|'''S'''\n|[[Tight end]]\n|'''TE'''\n|[[Wide receiver]]\n|'''WR'''\n|}\n\n===Offseason departures===\nSeven Alabama players with remaining eligibility declared early for the [[2019 NFL Draft]].

This was the Crimson Tide's 125th overall season, 86th as a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC), and 28th within the SEC's [[Southeastern Conference#Current members|Western Division]]. They played their home games at [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], and were led by 13th-year head coach [[Nick Saban]].\n\nThe defending national runners-up, Alabama began the season ranked second in the AP Poll, and were the favorites to repeat as SEC Champions. The Crimson Tide won their first seven games of the year handily, and rose to first in the AP Poll, but were ranked third in the first [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the year heading into an anticipated match-up against second-ranked [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], which Alabama lost 46\u201341. The next week, Alabama lost starting quarterback [[Tua Tagovailoa]] to a season-ending hip injury in the game against [[2019 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]]. They finished the regular season with a 48\u201345 loss to rival [[2019 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]]. \n\nWith a regular season record of 10\u20132, Alabama was not selected for the [[College Football Playoff]] for the first time since the inception of the format in [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2014]]. While the Crimson Tide were not invited to a [[New Year's Six]] bowl game, they defeated [[2019 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in the [[2020 Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]].\n\nQuarterback Tua Tagovailoa, at the time of his injury, was considered a candidate for the Heisman Trophy and was on pace to break his own NCAA FBS passer rating record. He was replaced by backup [[Mac Jones]] for the remainder of the season. Running back [[Najee Harris]] led the team with 1,224 rushing yards and 20 total touchdowns, tied for the SEC lead. Receivers [[Jerry Jeudy]] and [[Devonta Smith]] were both named All-SEC. On defense, the team was led by first-team all-conference players linebacker [[Anfernee Jennings]] and safety [[Xavier McKinney]].\n\n==Previous season==\nIn [[2018 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2018]], Alabama went undefeated in the regular season and won the [[2018 SEC Championship Game]] over [[2018 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]]. The Crimson Tide entered the [[College Football Playoff]] as the number one seed, winning the semi-final played at the [[2018 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] over [[2018 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] before falling to [[2018 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in the [[2019 College Football Playoff National Championship]].\n\n==Offseason==\n===Position key===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[Running back|Back]]\n|'''B'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Center (American football)|Center]]\n|'''C'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Cornerback]]\n|'''CB'''\n|rowSpan=\"6\" style=\"background-color:lightgrey;\"|\n|[[Defensive back]]\n|'''DB'''\n|-\n|[[Defensive end]]\n|'''DE'''\n|[[Defensive lineman]]\n|'''DL'''\n|[[Defensive tackle]]\n|'''DT'''\n|[[End (American football)|End]]\n|'''E'''\n|-\n|[[Fullback (American football)|Fullback]]\n|'''FB'''\n|[[Guard (American football)|Guard]]\n|'''G'''\n|[[Halfback (American football)|Halfback]]\n|'''HB'''\n|[[Placekicker|Kicker]]\n|'''K'''\n|-\n|[[Kickoff returner]]\n|'''KR'''\n|[[Offensive tackle]]\n|'''OT'''\n|[[Lineman (American football)|Offensive lineman]]\n|'''OL'''\n|[[Linebacker]]\n|'''LB'''\n|-\n|[[Long snapper]]\n|'''LS'''\n|[[Punter (American football)|Punter]]\n|'''P'''\n|[[Punt returner]]\n|'''PR'''\n|[[Quarterback]]\n|'''QB'''\n|-\n|[[Running back]]\n|'''RB'''\n|[[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|Safety]]\n|'''S'''\n|[[Tight end]]\n|'''TE'''\n|[[Wide receiver]]\n|'''WR'''\n|}\n\n===Offseason departures===\nSeven Alabama players with remaining eligibility declared early for the [[2019 NFL Draft]].

They played their home games at [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] and were led by eleventh-year head coach [[Nick Saban]].\n\nAlabama ended the season as consensus [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champions]] by winning their second [[College Football Playoff]] national championship. This was their 17th claimed national title in school history, and fifth under head coach Nick Saban.\n\nAlabama, coming off a national title game loss to [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in [[2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2016]], began the year ranked first in the [[AP Poll]]. The team opened the year with a victory over then-No. 3 [[2017 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] in the [[Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game]], which was the highest ranked season-opening match-up in the history of the AP Poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/08/31/college-football-week-1-theres-no-better-kickoff-than-alabama-florida-state/|title=College football Week 1 TV schedule: Alabama vs. Florida State is a pretty, pretty good kickoff|date=September 2, 2017|first=Matt|last=Bonesteel|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Alabama won their first 11 games convincingly, but fell on the road to rival [[2017 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] in the regular season finale, and since the two teams were tied atop the SEC West Division at 7\u20131, Auburn advanced to the [[2017 SEC Championship Game]] on the head-to-head tiebreaker. Alabama fell to number six in the rankings leading up to conference championship weekend. In the final [[2017 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]] of the year, 11\u20131 Alabama  controversially rose to number four after sitting idle, ahead of 12\u20131 [[2017 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], 11\u20132 [[Big Ten Conference]] champion [[2017 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] and 12\u20130 [[American Athletic Conference]] champion [[2017 UCF Knights football team|UCF]]. This earned Alabama a place in the national semi-final to be played at the [[2018 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] against first-seeded [[2017 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], the third consecutive playoff meeting between the two schools. Alabama won by a score of 24\u20136 and advanced to the [[2018 College Football Playoff National Championship]] against SEC champion [[2017 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]]. The Crimson Tide pulled off a dramatic come-from-behind overtime victory to win the game 26\u201323 and the national title.\n\nAlabama's offense was led by sophomore quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]], who finished with 2,081 passing yards, 17 passing touchdowns and just one interception. He added 855 rushing yards and 8 rushing touchdowns on the ground. Freshman quarterback [[Tua Tagovailoa]] served as the backup and was named game MVP of the national championship game after Hurts was benched at halftime. Running back [[Damien Harris]] led the rushing attack with exactly 1,000 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on the year. Wide receiver [[Calvin Ridley]] and offensive tackle [[Jonah Williams]] were named [[2017 All-SEC football team|first-team All-SEC]]. The Crimson Tide defense, which led the country in scoring and yards allowed, was led by [[2017 College Football All-America Team|consensus first-team All-American]] and [[Chuck Bednarik Award]]-winning safety [[Minkah Fitzpatrick]]. He was joined on the All-SEC first team by defensive tackles [[Daron Payne]] and [[Raekwon Davis]], linebacker [[Rashaan Evans]], and safety [[Ronnie Harrison]].\n\n== Previous season and offseason ==\n{{Main|2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team}}\n\nIn 2016, Alabama came into the season ranked No. 1 in both preseason polls and finished the regular season 13\u20130, 8\u20130 SEC. The Crimson Tide were ranked number one the entire season prior to their national championship appearance against [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. Alabama won the Western Division of SEC and qualified to play in the [[2016 SEC Championship Game]] against the [[2016 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]]. Alabama defeated the Gators again in the rematch from the previous year's SEC Championship 54\u201316 in Atlanta, Georgia, clinching the program's 26th SEC title. As the No. 1 seed in the third season of the [[College Football Playoff]], the Crimson Tide were selected to play in the semifinal game at the [[2016 Peach Bowl]] against No. 4 [[2016 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] of the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. Alabama beat the Huskies 24\u20137, advancing them to the [[2017 College Football Playoff National Championship]] Game against No. 2 Clemson of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. The Crimson Tide lost to the Tigers in the rematch from the previous year's College Football Playoff National Championship 35\u201331 after [[Deshaun Watson]] threw the game-winning TD pass to [[Hunter Renfrow]] with :01 left. The Crimson Tide finished the 2016 season with a record of 14\u20131.\n\n===Departures===\nThe Crimson Tide lost twenty-three senior football players to graduation, another four players to the NFL Draft, and four more players from the 2016 team due to various other reasons.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Offseason departures\n|-\n!

season in the brand new [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] against No. 3-ranked Florida State. Alabama came into the game with the mantra \"Don't waste a failure\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/07/12/alabamas-offseason-goal-dont-waste-a-failure/103637694/|title=Alabama's offseason goal: Don't waste a faulure|date=July 12, 2017|website=USA Today|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> a reference to the disappointing loss to Clemson in the previous season's 2017 CFP National Championship game. Although having a competitive first half, the game was considered by some to fall short of preseason expectations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/alabama-florida-state-a-dud-as-only-one-team-showed-glimmer-of-a-title-contender/|title=Alabama-Florida State a dud as only one team showed glimmer of a title contender|date=September 3, 2017|first=Dennis|last=Dodd|website=CBS Sports}}</ref> Furthermore, Florida State would post a disappointing 7\u20136 record on the year, due in part to a season ending injury to starting QB [[Deondre Francois]] in the fourth quarter, failing to deliver on much of the game's promised impact. The game for Alabama would also prove somewhat of a [[pyrrhic victory]] as linebackers Terrell Lewis and Christian Miller would be out with significant injuries, a theme that would continue to haunt the Alabama defense for the entirety of the regular season.\n\nThe first half was characterized largely as a defensive struggle for both teams. After a turnover on downs stop by the Alabama defense on fourth and 2, the offense would march down the field for a 36-yard Andy Pappanastos field goal (ALA 3 FSU 0) late in the first quarter. FSU would respond with a drive of their own culminating in a 3-yard pass to Auden Tate (ALA 3 FSU 7) which was matched by a 53-yard bomb from Alabama's Jalen Hurts to Calvin Ridley for a touchdown on Alabama's next drive (ALA 10 FSU 3). Both teams would hold the other's offense to minimal production for the rest of the half including a blocked FG attempt by FSU from Alabama's Minkah Fitzpatrick.\n\nFlorida State would open the second half with a promising drive that stalled at midfield after an Alabama sack. After a few possession exchanges, Alabama would find itself in prime position to score after a punt attempt by Florida State was blocked and recovered by Alabama deep in FSU territory. This would culminate in an Andy Pappanastos FG for 25 yards (ALA 13 FSU 7). On the ensuing kick return, Alabama's Dylan Moses would force a fumble recovered by Alabama, and on the first play of Alabama's drive, Damien Harris would score on a rushing touchdown from 11 yards out. Alabama would come away with a successful two-point conversion attempt after the touchdown to go up by two touchdowns (ALA 21 FSU 7). For the rest of the game, the Alabama defense would dominate FSU including picking off two passes by Deondre Francois. Alabama would kick one more field goal late in the game from 33 yards out (ALA 24 FSU 7) to seal the Alabama victory. The Alabama defense held the Seminoles to 40 yards rushing. Bama quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]] completed 10 of 17 passes for 96 yards and one touchdown while [[Damien Harris]] ran for 73 yards and a touchdown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=400933827|title=Florida State vs. Alabama \u2013 Game Recap \u2013 September 2, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Florida State\n!Alabama\n|-\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|250\n|269\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|210\n|96\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|40\n|173\n|-\n|Penalties\n|4\u201330\n|5\u201330\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|3\n|0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|27:13\n|32:47\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Fresno State ===\n{{See also|2017 Fresno State Bulldogs football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Visitor = Fresno State\n| Host ='''No. 1 Alabama'''\n| V1 =3 | V2 = 0 | V3 =0| V4 =7 \n| H1 =14 |H2 =14| H3 =3 | H4 = 10\n| Location = [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa, AL]]\n| Date = September 9\n| StartTime = 2:35 p.m.\n| Attendance = 101,127\n| Weather =79\u00b0, Wind ENE 9 mph, Clear, Sunny\n| Referee = Marc Curles\n| TVAnnouncers= Adam Amin (play-by-play), [[Anthony Becht]] (color), [[Rocky Boiman]] (sideline)\n| TVStation= [[ESPN2]]\n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time=14:21 |Team=ALA |Event=Jalen Hurts 55-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=08:24 |Team=ALA |Event=Hale Hentges 23-yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=04:03 |Team=FSU |Event=Jimmy Camacho 27-yard field goal |Score=ALA 14\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=14:25 |Team=ALA |Event=Jalen Hurts 3-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 14\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=01:15 |Team=ALA |Event=Damien Harris 5-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 21\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=02:03 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 24-yard field goal |Score=ALA 31\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=07:08 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 22-yard field goal |Score=ALA 34\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=06:06 |Team=FSU |Event=Derrion Grim 26-yard pass from Chason Virgil (Jimmy Camacho kick)|Score=ALA 34\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=02:41|Team=ALA |Event=Henry Ruggs III 16-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 41\u201310|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nThe Tide welcomed Fresno State to Bryant-Denny Stadium for their first home game of the season in what would be a predictable blowout of the talented but outmatched Bulldogs, a team that would go on to play in the [[2017 Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game|Mountain West Championship Game]].\n\nAlabama would start the game on offense to begin the first quarter. On the second play of Alabama's opening drive, QB Jalen Hurts would run for a 55-yard touchdown. Alabama would also score a touchdown on their next possession in a 23-yard Jalen Hurts pass to Hale Hentges, and again on the drive after that in a 4-yard Bo Scarbrough run as time expired on the first quarter. During this time, Fresno State would put together a respectable 70 yard drive for a field goal. (ALA 21 FRESNO 3). In the second quarter, Alabama would  see a Damien Harris touchdown run from five yards out late in the second quarter while Fresno State would stall on their last possession of the half (ALA 28 FRESNO 3).\n\nIn the second half, Alabama would put together a drive which culminated in an Andy Pappanastos FG from 24 yards out in the third quarter before pulling starting QB Jalen Hurts for the backup QB and future CFP National Championship game offensive MVP Tua Tagovailoa. (ALA 31 FRESNO 3). In the fourth quarter, Tua would engineer a field goal and touchdown drive in a 16-yard pass to Henry Ruggs III for Alabama while Fresno State would find the endzone after a 63-yard punt return and 26 yard touchdown pass from QB Chason Virgil to Derrion Grim. (ALA 41 FRESNO 10). The Alabama defense held the Bulldogs to 58 yards rushing while the Tide amassed 305 yards on the ground.\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Fresno State\n!Alabama\n|-\n|Total Yards\n| 274\n| 497\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n| 216\n| 192\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n| 58\n| 305\n|-\n|Penalties\n| 1\u20136\n| 4\u201330\n|-\n|Turnovers\n| 1\n| 0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n| 29:18\n| 30:42\n|}\n\n=== Colorado State ===\n{{See also|2017 Colorado State Rams football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Visitor = Colorado State\n| Host = '''No. 1  Alabama'''\n| V1 =0 | V2 =10| V3 =0| V4 =13\n| H1 =17 |H2 =7 |H3 =14| H4 =3\n| Location = Tuscaloosa, AL\n| Date = September 16\n| StartTime = 6:05 p.m.\n| Attendance = 101,821\n| Weather = 83\u00b0, Partly cloudy, Wind E @ 1mph\n| Referee = Matt Loeffler\n| TVAnnouncers= [[Mark Jones (sportscaster)|Mark Jones]] (play-by-play), [[Rod Gilmore]] (color), [[Quint Kessenich]] (sideline)\n| TVStation= ESPN2\n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n \n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time=12:43 |Team=ALA |Event=Jalen Hurts 27-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=08:56 |Team=ALA |Event=Calvin Ridley 78-yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=05:13 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 46-yard field goal |Score=ALA 17\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=10:34 |Team=CSU |Event=Wyatt Bryan 27-yard field goal |Score=ALA 17\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=02:18 |Team=CSU |Event=Warren Jackson 4-yard pass from Nick Stevens (Wyatt Bryan kick)|Score=ALA 17\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=01:00 |Team=ALA |Event=[[Robert Foster (American football)|Robert Foster]] 52-yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 24\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=07:19 |Team=ALA |Event=Miller Forristall 12-yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 31\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=05:18 |Team=ALA |Event=Damien Harris 5-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 38\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=14:51 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 43-yard field goal|Score=ALA 41\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=09:53 |Team=CSU |Event=Nick Stevens 5-yard run (Wyatt Bryan kick)|Score=ALA 41\u201317}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=01:46 |Team=CSU |Event=Warren Jackson 3-yard pass from Nick Stevens (two-point conversion failed) |Score=ALA 41\u201323|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nAlabama welcomed the (2\u20131) Colorado State Rams for the second home game of the season who were led by third year head coach [[Mike Bobo]]. Although Alabama would win convincingly, this game was marked by several momentum shifts which benefited Colorado State against the Alabama defense (lacking several key starters due to injury) early in the game and at the end of the game during [[garbage time]]. Offensively, Alabama would post a strong 487 yards, including passing and rushing touchdowns from Alabama QB Jalen Hurts. Colorado State would go on to post a winning 7\u20136 Record on the year and finish second in their division within the Mountain West Conference.\n\nAlabama received the ball to start the game and would score on this drive and its next two drives. The first culminated in a Jalen Hurts 27 yard run, the second with a 78-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Ridley, and the third an Andy Pappanastos field goal from 46 yards out (ALA 17 CSU 0). Although the Alabama defense would hold CSU to no points in the first quarter, CSU would engineer two lengthy drives comprising a field goal and touchdown off strong passing proficiency from CSU QB Nick Stevens (ALA 17 CSU 10). The Alabama offense would rally though late in the second quarter wherein Jalen Hurts would find [[Robert Foster (American football)|Robert Foster]] for a 52 passing touchdown. (ALA 24 CSU 10) to effectively end the first half.\n\nIn the second half, Nick Stevens would be picked off two times in the third quarter which Alabama would capitalize on in both situations for touchdowns, one in a Bo Scarbrough run for 9 yards for a TD and another in a Damien Harris run for 5 yards for a TD, virtually guaranteeing the Alabama win (ALA 38 CSU 10). In the fourth quarter, the Alabama defense would give up two touchdown drives while the Alabama offense, under the control of backup QB Tua Tagovailoa, would post a field goal to end the game. (ALA 41 CSU 23).\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Colorado State\n!Alabama\n|-\n|Total Yards\n| 391\n| 487\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n| 247\n| 248\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n| 144\n| 239\n|-\n|Penalties\n| 3\u201314\n| 4\u201345\n|-\n|Turnovers\n| 2\n| 0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n| 33:53\n| 26:07\n|}\n\n=== at Vanderbilt ===\n{{See also|2017 Vanderbilt Commodores football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = \n| Visitor = '''No. 1 Alabama'''\n| Host = Vanderbilt\n| V1 =21 |V2 =10 | V3 =21 |V4 =7\n| H1 =0| H2 =0| H3 =0| H4 =0 \n| Location = [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville, TN]]\n| Date = September 23\n| StartTime = 2:39 p.m.\n| Attendance = 40,350\n| Weather = 88\u00b0, Partly Cloudy, Wind NE @ 3 mph\n| Referee = Ken Williamson\n| TVAnnouncers= [[Brad Nessler]] (play-by-play), [[Gary Danielson]] (color), [[Allie LaForce]] (sideline)\n| TVStation= CBS \n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry|FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=Q1|Time=06:16|Team=ALA|Event=Bo Scarbrough 6-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1|Time=03:32|Team=ALA|Event=Damien Harris 61-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=00:42 |Team=ALA|Event=Damien Harris 2-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 21\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=09:09 |Team=ALA|Event=Bo Scarbrough 2-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 28\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=01:18 |Team=ALA|Event=Andy Pappanastos 22-yard Field Goal |Score=ALA 31\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=12:07 |Team=ALA|Event=Damien Harris 2-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 38\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=09:02 |Team=ALA|Event=Jerry Jeudy 34-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 45\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=05:45 |Team=ALA|Event=DeVonta Smith 27-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 52\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |LastEntry=yes |Quarter=Q4 |Time=13:26 |Team=ALA|Event=Brian Robinson Jr. 17-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 59\u20130}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nAlabama opened up its SEC schedule with a road game (though 75% of the stadium were Alabama fans<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/college/vanderbilt/2017/09/23/alabama-football-taking-over-vanderbilt-stands-among-best-worst-crushing-loss-nick-saban/691684001/|title=Alabama taking over Vanderbilt stands among best, worst of crushing loss|date=September 23, 2017|website=Tennessean|first=Adam|last=Sparks}}</ref>) against a (3\u20130) Vanderbilt Commodores team led by 4th season head coach, [[Derek Mason]].

Although Alabama would not capitalize on this turnover, on their next four possessions afterwards they would find the endzone for four rushing touchdowns. The first came off a run by Bo Scarbrough from 6 yards out, the second a 61-yard Damien Harris run, the third (off a fumble recovery forced by Anfernee Jennings) a methodical rushing drive culminating in a 2-yard Damien Harris touchdown, and the fourth another rushing drive which ended with a 2-yard rushing touchdown for Bo Scarbrough. (ALA 28 VANDY 0). Alabama would tack on one more field goal in the second quarter and Vanderbilt would be held to very minimal offensive production (ALA 31 VANDY 0).\n\nAlabama opened the second half with a drive consisting largely of the run ending in a 2-yard rushing touchdown for Damien Harris. This drive was the last for starting QB Jalen Hurts who was 9/17 for 78 yards through the air and 48 yards on the ground. After a Vanderbilt 3 and out, Alabama backup QB Tua Tagovailoa would play for the remainder of the game, accounting for two passing touchdowns, one to Jerry Jeudy from 34 yards out and one to DeVonta Smith from 27 yards out. Alabama would tack on one more touchdown with the help of a long passing play to set up a 17-yard run from Brian Robinson Jr. (ALA 59 VANDY 0).\n\nThe shift between Hurts and Tagovailoa was marked by a dramatic shift in playcalling and offensive scheme which was representative of the strengths of each quarterback. Drives orchestrated by Hurts tended to use an offensive scheme developed by former OC [[Lane Kiffin]]: a hybrid between an option offense for running schemes and a west-coast offense characterized by running veers and horizontal passing attacks. However, the offensive scheme under Tagovailoa resembled a traditional pro-style offense, a scheme that then OC Brian Daboll favored, which emphasize pocket presence, multiple downfield reads, play-action, vertical passing, and between-the-tackles-running. This difference in playcalling would arise down the line as a major factor in Alabama\u2019s come from behind win against Georgia in the 2018 CFP National Championship Game (see Georgia below).\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Alabama\n!Vanderbilt\n|-\n|Total Yards\n| 677\n|78\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n| 181\n| 38\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n| 496\n| 40\n|-\n|Penalties\n| 6\u201340\n| 5\u201320\n|-\n|Turnovers\n| 0\n| 2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n| 42:55\n| 17:05\n|}\n\n=== Ole Miss ===\n{{See also|2017 Ole Miss Rebels football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = \n| Visitor = Ole Miss\n| Host = '''No. 1 Alabama'''\n| V1 =3| V2 =0| V3 =0| V4 =0 \n| H1 =21| H2 =14| H3 =24| H4 =7 \n| Location = Tuscaloosa, AL\n| Date = September 30\n| StartTime = 8:10 p.m.\n| Attendance = 101,821\n| Weather = 77\u00b0, Clear skies, Wind NNE @ 10mph\n| Referee = John McDaid\n| TVAnnouncers= [[Joe Tessitore]] (play-by-play), [[Todd Blackledge]] (color), [[Holly Rowe]] (sideline)\n| TVStation= ESPN \n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time=10:04 |Team=ALA |Event=Bo Scarbrough 6 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 7\u20130 }}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=9:20 |Team=ALA |Event=Levi Wallace 35 yard interception return (Andy Pappanstos kick) |Score=ALA 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=5:13 |Team=ALA |Event=Hale Hentges 3 yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 21\u20130 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q1 |Time=2:42 |Team=MISS |Event=26 yard field goal by Gary Wunderlich |Score=ALA 21\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time=12:53 |Team=ALA |Event=Josh Jacobs 18 yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 28\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time=3:42 |Team=ALA |Event=Jalen Hurts 10 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 35\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=12:37 |Team=ALA |Event=JK Scott 48 yard field goal |Score=ALA 38\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=9:07 |Team=ALA |Event=Najee Harris 4 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 45\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=6:05 |Team=ALA |Event=Tua Tagovailoa 2 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 52\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=2:36 |Team=ALA |Event=Henry Ruggs III 8 yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 59\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=6:51 |Team=ALA |Event=Ronnie Clark 9 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 66\u20133 |LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nAlabama welcomed the Ole Miss Rebels to Tuscaloosa for Alabama's first intradivisional match-up. Although Alabama was heavily favored going into this game, the recent history of this meeting was a tumultuous  one for Alabama, having lost to Ole Miss in 2014 and 2015 and narrowly avoiding losing to them in 2016 (Alabama at one point trailed 24 to 3 and required a come from behind victory in the fourth quarter). However 2017 Ole Miss was coached by interim coach Matt Luke and not previous head-coach [[Hugh Freeze]] (who coached Ole Miss from 2012 through the 2016 Ole Miss seasons). This was a result of a sudden departure of Hugh Freeze during the off-season who was all but forced to resign when it came to light that, during Ole Miss' more public legal dispute between itself and former Ole Miss Head Coach Houston Nutt, a \"concerning pattern\" of behavior came to light wherein Ole Miss was made aware of several call logs between Hugh Freeze and a female escort service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2017/07/20/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-resigns-matt-luke-interim-head-coach|title=Ole Miss Head Coach Hugh Freeze Resigns|date=July 20, 2017|first=Jeremy|last=Woo|website=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> As such, Ole Miss was in less of a position (due to off-the-field distractions) to cause Alabama trouble as it had in the past, resulting in an obliterating 66\u20133 Score.\n\nIn the first quarter, Alabama would find the endzone three times. Two of these scores were on offense the first being the result of favorable starting position that culminated in a 6-yard Bo Scarbrough rushing touchdown (ALA 7, MISS 0) and the second a long 85 yard drive comprising a spectacular 60-yard reception from [[Cam Sims]] that culminated in a 3-yard Hale Hentges reception. These two scores bookended an interception for a touchdown from Levi Wallace (ALA 21\u20133). Ole Miss would find the score board off a field goal late in the first from 26-yards out by kicker Gary Wunderlich. (ALA 21 MISS 3). The second quarter, more quiet than the first, included a Jalen Hurts pass to Josh Jacobs from 18-yards out (ALA 28 MISS 3) and another drive off a short field in two back-to-back Jalen Hurts rushes (ALA 35 MISS 3).\n\nAs Ole Miss started the game with possession, Alabama would receive the ball to start the second half which would culminate in a beautiful 48-yard kick from JK Scott (ALA 38 MISS 3). By this point, Ole Miss could not generate any form of offense or defense, allowing Alabama to simply pile on drive after drive, including a 4-yard Najee Harris run for a touchdown (ALA 45 MISS 3), then (after a QB exchange and off the back of a 45-yard Josh Jacobs rush) a 3-yard rush from back-up QB Tua Tagovailoa (ALA 52 MISS 3), then (off another Levi Wallace interception) an 8-yard pass from Tagovailoa to Henry Ruggs III (ALA 59 MISS 3), and finally a 91-yard drive lasting over 8 in-game minutes that culminated in a Ronnie Clark 9-yard run (ALA 66 MISS 3). This was Alabama's largest margin-of-victory since 1979. However, in line with the rest of the season, Alabama linebacker Da'Shawn Hand would be injured in the third quarter, further depleting Alabama's already sparse defensive backfield.\n\n'''Statistics''' \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Ole Miss\n!Alabama\n|-\n|Total Yards\n| 253\n| 613\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n| 165\n| 248\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n| 88\n| 365\n|-\n|Penalties\n| 3\u201330\n| 7\u201360\n|-\n|Turnovers\n| 2\n| 0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n| 23:23\n| 36:37\n|}\n\n=== at Texas A&M ===\n{{See also|2017 Texas A&M Aggies football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = \n| Visitor = '''No. 1 Alabama'''\n| Host = Texas A&M\n| V1 =7 | V2 =10| V3 =7| V4 = 3\n| H1 =3| H2 =0| H3 =7| H4 =9\n| Location = [[College Station, Texas|College Station, TX]]\n| Date = October 7\n| StartTime = 6:20 p.m.\n| Attendance = 101.058\n| Weather = 89\u00b0, Sunny, Wind N @ 6 mph\n| Referee = Matt Austin\n| TVAnnouncers= Joe Tessitore (play-by-play), Todd Blackledge (color), Holly Rowe (sideline)\n| TVStation= ESPN\n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time=9:59 |Team=TA&M |Event=Daniel LaCamera 52 yard field goal |Score=TA&M 3\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q1 |Time=9:46 |Team=ALA |Event=Damien Harris 75 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 7\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time=5:41 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 34 yard field goal |Score=ALA 10\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time=3:16 |Team=ALA |Event=Jalen Hurts 1 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 17\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=11:01 |Team=ALA |Event=Henry Ruggs III 8 yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 24\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=1:39 |Team=TA&M |Event=Christian Kirk 2 yard pass from Kellen Mond |Score=ALA 24\u201310 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=10:18 |Team=TA&M |Event=Cullen Gillaspia blocks punt for safety |Score=ALA 24\u201312 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=2:09 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 44 yard field goal |Score=ALA 27\u201312 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=0:17 |Team=TA&M |Event=Kellen Mond 1 yard run (Daniel LaCamera kick) |Score=ALA 27\u201319 |LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nAlabama next traveled to SEC West foe [[2017 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]] (4\u20131, 2\u20130 SEC), and were 26.5-point favorites in the game.

At the beginning of the game, Alabama won the coin toss and elected to defer their choice to the second half. The game was marked throughout the game by strong defensive performances by both Clemson and a healthy, rejuvenated Alabama defense. During the middle of the first quarter, Alabama had an opportunity in the red zone stalled and settled for a 24-yard field goal from kicker Andy Pappanastos (AL 3 \u2013 CLEM 0). After another 3 and out by Clemson, Alabama would, with great field position, drive down the field which culminated in a 12-yard pass from QB Jalen Hurts to Calvin Ridley (AL 10 \u2013 CLEM 0). Clemson, however would respond in the second quarter with a drive which ended with a 44-yard FG from Clemson kicker Alex Spence(AL 10 \u2013 CLEM 3). Defensive performances by both teams would keep this score the same going into the half.\n\nIn the second half, Alabama would receive the ball but uncharacteristically fumbled deep in their own territory on a muffed handoff between QB Jalen Hurts and RB Damien Harris. A strong Alabama defensive response would limit this turnover to a 42-yard Alex Spence FG (AL 10 \u2013 CLEM 6). After an Alabama three and out, a promising Clemson drive would be cut short when Clemson QB Kelly Bryant was tackled as he threw the ball causing it to wobble into the arms of Alabama defensive tackle [[Daron Payne]] for an interception. Alabama would capitalize on this momentum with a drive into the Clemson redzone, where, on second and goal, Alabama would bring in their goal line set which includes Payne as a downhill blocker fullback. However, instead of running Payne up the middle, he would roll out for a 1-yard reception from Jalen Hurts (AL 17- CLEM 6) in what is affectionately known as a \"big man touchdown\".  On the first play of Clemson's next drive, Kelly Bryant's intended pass to [[Deon Cain]] was deflected by Alabama's Levi Wallace into the arms of Mack Wilson for an interception returned for a touchdown (ALA 24 CLEM 6). The Alabama defense would control Clemson for the remainder of the 3rd and 4th quarter, ending the game (ALA 24 CLEM 6).\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Alabama\n!Clemson\n|-\n|Total Yards\n| 261\n| 188\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n| 120\n| 124\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n| 141\n| 64\n|-\n|Penalties\n| 2\u201310\n| 4\u201329\n|-\n|Turnovers\n| 1\n| 2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n| 32:11\n| 27:49\n|}\n\n=== vs. Georgia (CFP National Championship) ===\n{{See also|2017 Georgia Bulldogs football team|2018 College Football Playoff National Championship}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title     = CFP National Championship\n| Visitor   = '''No. 4 Alabama'''\n| Host      = No. 3 Georgia \n| V1 =0 | V2 =0 | V3 =10 | V4= 10 | VOT= 6 \n| H1 =0 | H2 =13 | H3 =7 | H4 = 0 | HOT= 3\n| Location  = Atlanta, GA\n| Date      = January 8, 2018\n| StartTime = 8:19 p.m.\n| Attendance = 77,430\n| Weather    = Indoors \n| Referee    = Dan Capron\n| TVAnnouncers = Chris Fowler (play-by-play), Kirk Herbstreit (color), Maria Taylor & Tom Rinaldi (sideline)\n| TVStation    = ESPN \n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=2Q |Time=14:14 |Team=UGA |Event=Rodrigo Blankenship 41 yard field goal |Score=UGA 3\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=2Q |Time=7:33 |Team=UGA |Event=Rodrigo Blankenship 27 yard field goal |Score=UGA 6\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=2Q |Time=0:07 |Team=UGA |Event=[[Mecole Hardman]] 1 yard run (Rodrigo Blankenship kick) |Score=UGA 13\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=8:52 |Team=ALA |Event=Henry Ruggs III 6 yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=UGA 13\u20137 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=6:52 |Team=UGA |Event=Mecole Hardman 80 yard pass from Jake Fromm (Rodrigo Blankenship kick) |Score=UGA 20\u20137 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=5:15 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 43 yard field goal |Score=UGA 20\u201310 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=9:24 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 30 yard field goal |Score=UGA 20\u201313 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=3:49 |Team=ALA |Event=Calvin Ridley 7 yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=TIED 20\u201320 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=OT |Time= |Team=UGA |Event=Rodrigo Blankenship 51 yard field goal |Score=UGA 23\u201320 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=OT |Time= |Team=ALA |Event=DeVonta Smith 41 yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa |Score=ALA 26\u201323 |LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nAfter Alabama's win in the CFP Semi-final in the Sugar Bowl over Clemson and Georgia's overtime win over Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl, Alabama and Georgia, who did not play during SEC play, were slated to play on January 8, 2018 in the Mercedes-Benz Dome in Atlanta, Georgia for the [[2018 College Football Playoff National Championship|2018 College Football National Championship Game]]. This game marked the first time ex-Defensive Coordinator for Alabama [[Kirby Smart]], head coach of Georgia faced off against his mentor Nick Saban.\n\nAlabama won the coin toss and elected to defer. On Georgia's opening drive, Alabama's Tony Brown intercepted a pass intended for Georgia's [[Riley Ridley]], the younger brother of Alabama's Calvin Ridley. Alabama used this momentum to get Andy Pappanastos in a position for a 40-yard field goal, which he shanked badly to the left. This was Alabama's only meaningful offensive production for the entire half. On the Georgia side, Georgia QB [[Jake Fromm]] utilized a very effective balanced offensive to stress an increasingly exhausted Alabama defense (due to a combination of abysmal offensive production by Alabama and excellent, preternatural play from the Georgia offense). During the middle of the first quarter, on third and 20, the Alabama defense were gashed by Georgia's [[Sony Michel]] for 26 yards to get within field goal range. The Alabama defense tightened up and held Georgia to a completed 41-yard field goal from Georgia's [[Rodrigo Blankenship]] (AL 0 GA 3). After another Alabama three and out, Georgia again marched down the field to the Alabama red zone.  Again, Alabama held Georgia to a field goal, this time from 27 yards (AL 0 GA 6). Alabama and Georgia traded minimal drives until Georgia gained possession of the ball with 1:12 left in the half. On this drive, which included a strong QB run from Jake Fromm, Georgia ultimately capitalized on a tired and frustrated Alabama defense with a 1-yard touchdown run by Georgia Mecole Hardman (AL 0 GA 13). Alabama took a knee to end the half.\n\nAlabama received the ball to start the half, with one significant modification of personnel: benching two-year starting QB Jalen Hurts for true freshman Hawaiian phenom Tua Tagovailoa. Though Alabama did not see an immediate benefit\u2014their first drive going for a three and out\u2014Tua almost single-handedly resurrected a rudderless Alabama offense.\n\nAfter holding Georgia to a three and out, a reinvigorated Alabama offense faced a third down and 7 near midfield.  Tua eluded four unblocked defenders in the backfield and ran for an Alabama first down. Capturing the momentum, Alabama sealed the drive with a 6-yard strike from Tua to Henry Ruggs III (AL 7 GA 13). Four plays into Georgia's next drive, on third and long, Fromm threw an 80-yard pass to Mecole Hardman for a touchdown (AL 7 GA 20), negating Alabama's gain. Worse yet for Alabama, on its next possession, Tua was picked off deep in Alabama territory on an ill-advised pass.  At the brink of collapse, Alabama received a godsend on the very next play in a deflected Jake Fromm pass for an Alabama interception by Raekwon Davis. Using this sudden turnover, Alabama drove into field goal range with a 43-yard Andy Pappanastos field goal (AL 10 GA 20). Alabama and Georgia traded minimal drives to end the third quarter. On Georgia's first drive of the fourth quarter, the beleaguered Alabama defense once more stood tall and allowed Alabama to get the ball back. During Alabama's first drive of the fourth quarter, another freshman phenom, RB Najee Harris, put the Alabama offense in position for another completed FG, this time from 30 yards (AL 13 GA 20). After stopping Georgia on its next possession, Alabama again drove down the field.  On fourth down and 4, deep in Georgia territory, Alabama elected to go for the touchdown instead of kicking another field goal. Tua's pass was completed into triple coverage to Calvin Ridley for a 7-yard touchdown (AL 20 GA 20). The exhausted Alabama defense proved once again their mettle and held Georgia to a three and out. In prime position with 2:50 left in the game, Alabama drove down the field and set up a potentially game-winning field goal with three seconds left on the clock. However, reminiscent of his first kick of the game, Andy Pappanastos, missed wide left from 36 yards out, sending the game into overtime.\n[[File:Alabama Crimson Tide at White House 2018.jpg|thumb|2017 Alabama Crimson Tide with [[Donald J. Trump]] at the [[White House]] in 2018.]]\nIn overtime, Alabama again won the coin toss and elected to play defense. For the last time, the Alabama defense stood tall with a Terrell Lewis sack of Jake Fromm for a 13-yard loss. Despite the distance, a stellar 51-yard kick for from Rodrigo Blankenship put Georgia up. (AL 20 GA 23). On Alabama's first play of their drive, Tua, showing his inexperience, attempted to outmaneuver two unblocked defenders in the backfield instead of throwing the ball away, putting Alabama back 16 yards. With everything on the line, instead of trying to get some of the yards back, Alabama elected to run what it calls \"Seattle,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-football/alabama-won-the-national-championship-over-georgia-on-a-play-called-seattle/|title=Alabama won the national championship over Georgia on a play called \u2026 \"Seattle\"?|date=January 9, 2018|website=SeattleTimes.com|access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref> a play designed for long passes.

This season marked the Crimson Tide's 125th overall season, its 84th as a member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) and its 26th within the SEC [[Southeastern Conference#Current members|Western Division]]. They played their home games at [[Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] and were led by eleventh-year head coach [[Nick Saban]].\n\nAlabama ended the season as consensus [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national champions]] by winning their second [[College Football Playoff]] national championship. This was their 17th claimed national title in school history, and fifth under head coach Nick Saban.\n\nAlabama, coming off a national title game loss to [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in [[2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2016]], began the year ranked first in the [[AP Poll]]. The team opened the year with a victory over then-No. 3 [[2017 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]] in the [[Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game]], which was the highest ranked season-opening match-up in the history of the AP Poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/08/31/college-football-week-1-theres-no-better-kickoff-than-alabama-florida-state/|title=College football Week 1 TV schedule: Alabama vs. Florida State is a pretty, pretty good kickoff|date=September 2, 2017|first=Matt|last=Bonesteel|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Alabama won their first 11 games convincingly, but fell on the road to rival [[2017 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] in the regular season finale, and since the two teams were tied atop the SEC West Division at 7\u20131, Auburn advanced to the [[2017 SEC Championship Game]] on the head-to-head tiebreaker. Alabama fell to number six in the rankings leading up to conference championship weekend. In the final [[2017 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]] of the year, 11\u20131 Alabama  controversially rose to number four after sitting idle, ahead of 12\u20131 [[2017 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], 11\u20132 [[Big Ten Conference]] champion [[2017 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] and 12\u20130 [[American Athletic Conference]] champion [[2017 UCF Knights football team|UCF]]. This earned Alabama a place in the national semi-final to be played at the [[2018 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] against first-seeded [[2017 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], the third consecutive playoff meeting between the two schools. Alabama won by a score of 24\u20136 and advanced to the [[2018 College Football Playoff National Championship]] against SEC champion [[2017 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]]. The Crimson Tide pulled off a dramatic come-from-behind overtime victory to win the game 26\u201323 and the national title.\n\nAlabama's offense was led by sophomore quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]], who finished with 2,081 passing yards, 17 passing touchdowns and just one interception. He added 855 rushing yards and 8 rushing touchdowns on the ground. Freshman quarterback [[Tua Tagovailoa]] served as the backup and was named game MVP of the national championship game after Hurts was benched at halftime. Running back [[Damien Harris]] led the rushing attack with exactly 1,000 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns on the year. Wide receiver [[Calvin Ridley]] and offensive tackle [[Jonah Williams]] were named [[2017 All-SEC football team|first-team All-SEC]]. The Crimson Tide defense, which led the country in scoring and yards allowed, was led by [[2017 College Football All-America Team|consensus first-team All-American]] and [[Chuck Bednarik Award]]-winning safety [[Minkah Fitzpatrick]]. He was joined on the All-SEC first team by defensive tackles [[Daron Payne]] and [[Raekwon Davis]], linebacker [[Rashaan Evans]], and safety [[Ronnie Harrison]].\n\n== Previous season and offseason ==\n{{Main|2016 Alabama Crimson Tide football team}}\n\nIn 2016, Alabama came into the season ranked No. 1 in both preseason polls and finished the regular season 13\u20130, 8\u20130 SEC. The Crimson Tide were ranked number one the entire season prior to their national championship appearance against [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. Alabama won the Western Division of SEC and qualified to play in the [[2016 SEC Championship Game]] against the [[2016 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]]. Alabama defeated the Gators again in the rematch from the previous year's SEC Championship 54\u201316 in Atlanta, Georgia, clinching the program's 26th SEC title. As the No. 1 seed in the third season of the [[College Football Playoff]], the Crimson Tide were selected to play in the semifinal game at the [[2016 Peach Bowl]] against No. 4 [[2016 Washington Huskies football team|Washington]] of the [[Pac-12 Conference]]. Alabama beat the Huskies 24\u20137, advancing them to the [[2017 College Football Playoff National Championship]] Game against No. 2 Clemson of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. The Crimson Tide lost to the Tigers in the rematch from the previous year's College Football Playoff National Championship 35\u201331 after [[Deshaun Watson]] threw the game-winning TD pass to [[Hunter Renfrow]] with :01 left. The Crimson Tide finished the 2016 season with a record of 14\u20131.\n\n===Departures===\nThe Crimson Tide lost twenty-three senior football players to graduation, another four players to the NFL Draft, and four more players from the 2016 team due to various other reasons.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Offseason departures\n|-\n!

Alabama came into the game with the mantra \"Don't waste a failure\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2017/07/12/alabamas-offseason-goal-dont-waste-a-failure/103637694/|title=Alabama's offseason goal: Don't waste a faulure|date=July 12, 2017|website=USA Today|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> a reference to the disappointing loss to Clemson in the previous season's 2017 CFP National Championship game. Although having a competitive first half, the game was considered by some to fall short of preseason expectations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/alabama-florida-state-a-dud-as-only-one-team-showed-glimmer-of-a-title-contender/|title=Alabama-Florida State a dud as only one team showed glimmer of a title contender|date=September 3, 2017|first=Dennis|last=Dodd|website=CBS Sports}}</ref> Furthermore, Florida State would post a disappointing 7\u20136 record on the year, due in part to a season ending injury to starting QB [[Deondre Francois]] in the fourth quarter, failing to deliver on much of the game's promised impact. The game for Alabama would also prove somewhat of a [[pyrrhic victory]] as linebackers Terrell Lewis and Christian Miller would be out with significant injuries, a theme that would continue to haunt the Alabama defense for the entirety of the regular season.\n\nThe first half was characterized largely as a defensive struggle for both teams. After a turnover on downs stop by the Alabama defense on fourth and 2, the offense would march down the field for a 36-yard Andy Pappanastos field goal (ALA 3 FSU 0) late in the first quarter. FSU would respond with a drive of their own culminating in a 3-yard pass to Auden Tate (ALA 3 FSU 7) which was matched by a 53-yard bomb from Alabama's Jalen Hurts to Calvin Ridley for a touchdown on Alabama's next drive (ALA 10 FSU 3). Both teams would hold the other's offense to minimal production for the rest of the half including a blocked FG attempt by FSU from Alabama's Minkah Fitzpatrick.\n\nFlorida State would open the second half with a promising drive that stalled at midfield after an Alabama sack. After a few possession exchanges, Alabama would find itself in prime position to score after a punt attempt by Florida State was blocked and recovered by Alabama deep in FSU territory. This would culminate in an Andy Pappanastos FG for 25 yards (ALA 13 FSU 7). On the ensuing kick return, Alabama's Dylan Moses would force a fumble recovered by Alabama, and on the first play of Alabama's drive, Damien Harris would score on a rushing touchdown from 11 yards out. Alabama would come away with a successful two-point conversion attempt after the touchdown to go up by two touchdowns (ALA 21 FSU 7). For the rest of the game, the Alabama defense would dominate FSU including picking off two passes by Deondre Francois. Alabama would kick one more field goal late in the game from 33 yards out (ALA 24 FSU 7) to seal the Alabama victory. The Alabama defense held the Seminoles to 40 yards rushing. Bama quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]] completed 10 of 17 passes for 96 yards and one touchdown while [[Damien Harris]] ran for 73 yards and a touchdown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=400933827|title=Florida State vs. Alabama \u2013 Game Recap \u2013 September 2, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Florida State\n!Alabama\n|-\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|250\n|269\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|210\n|96\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|40\n|173\n|-\n|Penalties\n|4\u201330\n|5\u201330\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|3\n|0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|27:13\n|32:47\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Fresno State ===\n{{See also|2017 Fresno State Bulldogs football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Visitor = Fresno State\n| Host ='''No. 1 Alabama'''\n| V1 =3 | V2 = 0 | V3 =0| V4 =7 \n| H1 =14 |H2 =14| H3 =3 | H4 = 10\n| Location = [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa, AL]]\n| Date = September 9\n| StartTime = 2:35 p.m.\n| Attendance = 101,127\n| Weather =79\u00b0, Wind ENE 9 mph, Clear, Sunny\n| Referee = Marc Curles\n| TVAnnouncers= Adam Amin (play-by-play), [[Anthony Becht]] (color), [[Rocky Boiman]] (sideline)\n| TVStation= [[ESPN2]]\n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time=14:21 |Team=ALA |Event=Jalen Hurts 55-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 7\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=08:24 |Team=ALA |Event=Hale Hentges 23-yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=04:03 |Team=FSU |Event=Jimmy Camacho 27-yard field goal |Score=ALA 14\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=14:25 |Team=ALA |Event=Jalen Hurts 3-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 14\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q2 |Time=01:15 |Team=ALA |Event=Damien Harris 5-yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 21\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q3 |Time=02:03 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 24-yard field goal |Score=ALA 31\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=07:08 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 22-yard field goal |Score=ALA 34\u20133}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=06:06 |Team=FSU |Event=Derrion Grim 26-yard pass from Chason Virgil (Jimmy Camacho kick)|Score=ALA 34\u201310}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q4 |Time=02:41|Team=ALA |Event=Henry Ruggs III 16-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 41\u201310|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nThe Tide welcomed Fresno State to Bryant-Denny Stadium for their first home game of the season in what would be a predictable blowout of the talented but outmatched Bulldogs, a team that would go on to play in the [[2017 Mountain West Conference Football Championship Game|Mountain West Championship Game]].\n\nAlabama would start the game on offense to begin the first quarter. On the second play of Alabama's opening drive, QB Jalen Hurts would run for a 55-yard touchdown. Alabama would also score a touchdown on their next possession in a 23-yard Jalen Hurts pass to Hale Hentges, and again on the drive after that in a 4-yard Bo Scarbrough run as time expired on the first quarter. During this time, Fresno State would put together a respectable 70 yard drive for a field goal. (ALA 21 FRESNO 3).

(ALA 31 FRESNO 3). In the fourth quarter, Tua would engineer a field goal and touchdown drive in a 16-yard pass to Henry Ruggs III for Alabama while Fresno State would find the endzone after a 63-yard punt return and 26 yard touchdown pass from QB Chason Virgil to Derrion Grim. (ALA 41 FRESNO 10).

Although Alabama would win convincingly, this game was marked by several momentum shifts which benefited Colorado State against the Alabama defense (lacking several key starters due to injury) early in the game and at the end of the game during [[garbage time]]. Offensively, Alabama would post a strong 487 yards, including passing and rushing touchdowns from Alabama QB Jalen Hurts. Colorado State would go on to post a winning 7\u20136 Record on the year and finish second in their division within the Mountain West Conference.\n\nAlabama received the ball to start the game and would score on this drive and its next two drives. The first culminated in a Jalen Hurts 27 yard run, the second with a 78-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Ridley, and the third an Andy Pappanastos field goal from 46 yards out (ALA 17 CSU 0). Although the Alabama defense would hold CSU to no points in the first quarter, CSU would engineer two lengthy drives comprising a field goal and touchdown off strong passing proficiency from CSU QB Nick Stevens (ALA 17 CSU 10). The Alabama offense would rally though late in the second quarter wherein Jalen Hurts would find [[Robert Foster (American football)|Robert Foster]] for a 52 passing touchdown. (ALA 24 CSU 10) to effectively end the first half.\n\nIn the second half, Nick Stevens would be picked off two times in the third quarter which Alabama would capitalize on in both situations for touchdowns, one in a Bo Scarbrough run for 9 yards for a TD and another in a Damien Harris run for 5 yards for a TD, virtually guaranteeing the Alabama win (ALA 38 CSU 10). In the fourth quarter, the Alabama defense would give up two touchdown drives while the Alabama offense, under the control of backup QB Tua Tagovailoa, would post a field goal to end the game.

Although Alabama would not capitalize on this turnover, on their next four possessions afterwards they would find the endzone for four rushing touchdowns. The first came off a run by Bo Scarbrough from 6 yards out, the second a 61-yard Damien Harris run, the third (off a fumble recovery forced by Anfernee Jennings) a methodical rushing drive culminating in a 2-yard Damien Harris touchdown, and the fourth another rushing drive which ended with a 2-yard rushing touchdown for Bo Scarbrough. (ALA 28 VANDY 0). Alabama would tack on one more field goal in the second quarter and Vanderbilt would be held to very minimal offensive production (ALA 31 VANDY 0).\n\nAlabama opened the second half with a drive consisting largely of the run ending in a 2-yard rushing touchdown for Damien Harris. This drive was the last for starting QB Jalen Hurts who was 9/17 for 78 yards through the air and 48 yards on the ground. After a Vanderbilt 3 and out, Alabama backup QB Tua Tagovailoa would play for the remainder of the game, accounting for two passing touchdowns, one to Jerry Jeudy from 34 yards out and one to DeVonta Smith from 27 yards out. Alabama would tack on one more touchdown with the help of a long passing play to set up a 17-yard run from Brian Robinson Jr. (ALA 59 VANDY 0).\n\nThe shift between Hurts and Tagovailoa was marked by a dramatic shift in playcalling and offensive scheme which was representative of the strengths of each quarterback. Drives orchestrated by Hurts tended to use an offensive scheme developed by former OC [[Lane Kiffin]]: a hybrid between an option offense for running schemes and a west-coast offense characterized by running veers and horizontal passing attacks. However, the offensive scheme under Tagovailoa resembled a traditional pro-style offense, a scheme that then OC Brian Daboll favored, which emphasize pocket presence, multiple downfield reads, play-action, vertical passing, and between-the-tackles-running. This difference in playcalling would arise down the line as a major factor in Alabama\u2019s come from behind win against Georgia in the 2018 CFP National Championship Game (see Georgia below).\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Alabama\n!Vanderbilt\n|-\n|Total Yards\n| 677\n|78\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n| 181\n| 38\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n| 496\n| 40\n|-\n|Penalties\n| 6\u201340\n| 5\u201320\n|-\n|Turnovers\n| 0\n| 2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n| 42:55\n| 17:05\n|}\n\n=== Ole Miss ===\n{{See also|2017 Ole Miss Rebels football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = \n| Visitor = Ole Miss\n| Host = '''No. 1 Alabama'''\n| V1 =3| V2 =0| V3 =0| V4 =0 \n| H1 =21| H2 =14| H3 =24| H4 =7 \n| Location = Tuscaloosa, AL\n| Date = September 30\n| StartTime = 8:10 p.m.\n| Attendance = 101,821\n| Weather = 77\u00b0, Clear skies, Wind NNE @ 10mph\n| Referee = John McDaid\n| TVAnnouncers= [[Joe Tessitore]] (play-by-play), [[Todd Blackledge]] (color), [[Holly Rowe]] (sideline)\n| TVStation= ESPN \n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time=10:04 |Team=ALA |Event=Bo Scarbrough 6 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick)|Score=ALA 7\u20130 }}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=9:20 |Team=ALA |Event=Levi Wallace 35 yard interception return (Andy Pappanstos kick) |Score=ALA 14\u20130}}\n{{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter=Q1 |Time=5:13 |Team=ALA |Event=Hale Hentges 3 yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 21\u20130 }}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q1 |Time=2:42 |Team=MISS |Event=26 yard field goal by Gary Wunderlich |Score=ALA 21\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time=12:53 |Team=ALA |Event=Josh Jacobs 18 yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 28\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time=3:42 |Team=ALA |Event=Jalen Hurts 10 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 35\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=12:37 |Team=ALA |Event=JK Scott 48 yard field goal |Score=ALA 38\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=9:07 |Team=ALA |Event=Najee Harris 4 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 45\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=6:05 |Team=ALA |Event=Tua Tagovailoa 2 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 52\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=2:36 |Team=ALA |Event=Henry Ruggs III 8 yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 59\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=6:51 |Team=ALA |Event=Ronnie Clark 9 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 66\u20133 |LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nAlabama welcomed the Ole Miss Rebels to Tuscaloosa for Alabama's first intradivisional match-up. Although Alabama was heavily favored going into this game, the recent history of this meeting was a tumultuous  one for Alabama, having lost to Ole Miss in 2014 and 2015 and narrowly avoiding losing to them in 2016 (Alabama at one point trailed 24 to 3 and required a come from behind victory in the fourth quarter). However 2017 Ole Miss was coached by interim coach Matt Luke and not previous head-coach [[Hugh Freeze]] (who coached Ole Miss from 2012 through the 2016 Ole Miss seasons). This was a result of a sudden departure of Hugh Freeze during the off-season who was all but forced to resign when it came to light that, during Ole Miss' more public legal dispute between itself and former Ole Miss Head Coach Houston Nutt, a \"concerning pattern\" of behavior came to light wherein Ole Miss was made aware of several call logs between Hugh Freeze and a female escort service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2017/07/20/hugh-freeze-ole-miss-resigns-matt-luke-interim-head-coach|title=Ole Miss Head Coach Hugh Freeze Resigns|date=July 20, 2017|first=Jeremy|last=Woo|website=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> As such, Ole Miss was in less of a position (due to off-the-field distractions) to cause Alabama trouble as it had in the past, resulting in an obliterating 66\u20133 Score.\n\nIn the first quarter, Alabama would find the endzone three times. Two of these scores were on offense the first being the result of favorable starting position that culminated in a 6-yard Bo Scarbrough rushing touchdown (ALA 7, MISS 0) and the second a long 85 yard drive comprising a spectacular 60-yard reception from [[Cam Sims]] that culminated in a 3-yard Hale Hentges reception. These two scores bookended an interception for a touchdown from Levi Wallace (ALA 21\u20133). Ole Miss would find the score board off a field goal late in the first from 26-yards out by kicker Gary Wunderlich. (ALA 21 MISS 3). The second quarter, more quiet than the first, included a Jalen Hurts pass to Josh Jacobs from 18-yards out (ALA 28 MISS 3) and another drive off a short field in two back-to-back Jalen Hurts rushes (ALA 35 MISS 3).\n\nAs Ole Miss started the game with possession, Alabama would receive the ball to start the second half which would culminate in a beautiful 48-yard kick from JK Scott (ALA 38 MISS 3). By this point, Ole Miss could not generate any form of offense or defense, allowing Alabama to simply pile on drive after drive, including a 4-yard Najee Harris run for a touchdown (ALA 45 MISS 3), then (after a QB exchange and off the back of a 45-yard Josh Jacobs rush) a 3-yard rush from back-up QB Tua Tagovailoa (ALA 52 MISS 3), then (off another Levi Wallace interception) an 8-yard pass from Tagovailoa to Henry Ruggs III (ALA 59 MISS 3), and finally a 91-yard drive lasting over 8 in-game minutes that culminated in a Ronnie Clark 9-yard run (ALA 66 MISS 3). This was Alabama's largest margin-of-victory since 1979. However, in line with the rest of the season, Alabama linebacker Da'Shawn Hand would be injured in the third quarter, further depleting Alabama's already sparse defensive backfield.\n\n'''Statistics''' \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Ole Miss\n!Alabama\n|-\n|Total Yards\n| 253\n| 613\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n| 165\n| 248\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n| 88\n| 365\n|-\n|Penalties\n| 3\u201330\n| 7\u201360\n|-\n|Turnovers\n| 2\n| 0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n| 23:23\n| 36:37\n|}\n\n=== at Texas A&M ===\n{{See also|2017 Texas A&M Aggies football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = \n| Visitor = '''No. 1 Alabama'''\n| Host = Texas A&M\n| V1 =7 | V2 =10| V3 =7| V4 = 3\n| H1 =3| H2 =0| H3 =7| H4 =9\n| Location = [[College Station, Texas|College Station, TX]]\n| Date = October 7\n| StartTime = 6:20 p.m.\n| Attendance = 101.058\n| Weather = 89\u00b0, Sunny, Wind N @ 6 mph\n| Referee = Matt Austin\n| TVAnnouncers= Joe Tessitore (play-by-play), Todd Blackledge (color), Holly Rowe (sideline)\n| TVStation= ESPN\n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=Q1 |Time=9:59 |Team=TA&M |Event=Daniel LaCamera 52 yard field goal |Score=TA&M 3\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q1 |Time=9:46 |Team=ALA |Event=Damien Harris 75 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 7\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time=5:41 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 34 yard field goal |Score=ALA 10\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q2 |Time=3:16 |Team=ALA |Event=Jalen Hurts 1 yard run (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 17\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=11:01 |Team=ALA |Event=Henry Ruggs III 8 yard pass from Jalen Hurts (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=ALA 24\u20133 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=1:39 |Team=TA&M |Event=Christian Kirk 2 yard pass from Kellen Mond |Score=ALA 24\u201310 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=10:18 |Team=TA&M |Event=Cullen Gillaspia blocks punt for safety |Score=ALA 24\u201312 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=2:09 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 44 yard field goal |Score=ALA 27\u201312 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=0:17 |Team=TA&M |Event=Kellen Mond 1 yard run (Daniel LaCamera kick) |Score=ALA 27\u201319 |LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nAlabama next traveled to SEC West foe [[2017 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]] (4\u20131, 2\u20130 SEC), and were 26.5-point favorites in the game.

At the beginning of the game, Alabama won the coin toss and elected to defer their choice to the second half. The game was marked throughout the game by strong defensive performances by both Clemson and a healthy, rejuvenated Alabama defense. During the middle of the first quarter, Alabama had an opportunity in the red zone stalled and settled for a 24-yard field goal from kicker Andy Pappanastos (AL 3 \u2013 CLEM 0). After another 3 and out by Clemson, Alabama would, with great field position, drive down the field which culminated in a 12-yard pass from QB Jalen Hurts to Calvin Ridley (AL 10 \u2013 CLEM 0). Clemson, however would respond in the second quarter with a drive which ended with a 44-yard FG from Clemson kicker Alex Spence(AL 10 \u2013 CLEM 3). Defensive performances by both teams would keep this score the same going into the half.\n\nIn the second half, Alabama would receive the ball but uncharacteristically fumbled deep in their own territory on a muffed handoff between QB Jalen Hurts and RB Damien Harris. A strong Alabama defensive response would limit this turnover to a 42-yard Alex Spence FG (AL 10 \u2013 CLEM 6). After an Alabama three and out, a promising Clemson drive would be cut short when Clemson QB Kelly Bryant was tackled as he threw the ball causing it to wobble into the arms of Alabama defensive tackle [[Daron Payne]] for an interception. Alabama would capitalize on this momentum with a drive into the Clemson redzone, where, on second and goal, Alabama would bring in their goal line set which includes Payne as a downhill blocker fullback. However, instead of running Payne up the middle, he would roll out for a 1-yard reception from Jalen Hurts (AL 17- CLEM 6) in what is affectionately known as a \"big man touchdown\".  On the first play of Clemson's next drive, Kelly Bryant's intended pass to [[Deon Cain]] was deflected by Alabama's Levi Wallace into the arms of Mack Wilson for an interception returned for a touchdown (ALA 24 CLEM 6). The Alabama defense would control Clemson for the remainder of the 3rd and 4th quarter, ending the game (ALA 24 CLEM 6).\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!Alabama\n!Clemson\n|-\n|Total Yards\n| 261\n| 188\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n| 120\n| 124\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n| 141\n| 64\n|-\n|Penalties\n| 2\u201310\n| 4\u201329\n|-\n|Turnovers\n| 1\n| 2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n| 32:11\n| 27:49\n|}\n\n=== vs. Georgia (CFP National Championship) ===\n{{See also|2017 Georgia Bulldogs football team|2018 College Football Playoff National Championship}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title     = CFP National Championship\n| Visitor   = '''No. 4 Alabama'''\n| Host      = No. 3 Georgia \n| V1 =0 | V2 =0 | V3 =10 | V4= 10 | VOT= 6 \n| H1 =0 | H2 =13 | H3 =7 | H4 = 0 | HOT= 3\n| Location  = Atlanta, GA\n| Date      = January 8, 2018\n| StartTime = 8:19 p.m.\n| Attendance = 77,430\n| Weather    = Indoors \n| Referee    = Dan Capron\n| TVAnnouncers = Chris Fowler (play-by-play), Kirk Herbstreit (color), Maria Taylor & Tom Rinaldi (sideline)\n| TVStation    = ESPN \n}}\n*'''Sources:'''\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry=yes |Quarter=2Q |Time=14:14 |Team=UGA |Event=Rodrigo Blankenship 41 yard field goal |Score=UGA 3\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=2Q |Time=7:33 |Team=UGA |Event=Rodrigo Blankenship 27 yard field goal |Score=UGA 6\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=2Q |Time=0:07 |Team=UGA |Event=[[Mecole Hardman]] 1 yard run (Rodrigo Blankenship kick) |Score=UGA 13\u20130 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=8:52 |Team=ALA |Event=Henry Ruggs III 6 yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=UGA 13\u20137 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=6:52 |Team=UGA |Event=Mecole Hardman 80 yard pass from Jake Fromm (Rodrigo Blankenship kick) |Score=UGA 20\u20137 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q3 |Time=5:15 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 43 yard field goal |Score=UGA 20\u201310 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=9:24 |Team=ALA |Event=Andy Pappanastos 30 yard field goal |Score=UGA 20\u201313 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=Q4 |Time=3:49 |Team=ALA |Event=Calvin Ridley 7 yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa (Andy Pappanastos kick) |Score=TIED 20\u201320 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=OT |Time= |Team=UGA |Event=Rodrigo Blankenship 51 yard field goal |Score=UGA 23\u201320 |LastEntry=}}\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry= |Quarter=OT |Time= |Team=ALA |Event=DeVonta Smith 41 yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa |Score=ALA 26\u201323 |LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nAfter Alabama's win in the CFP Semi-final in the Sugar Bowl over Clemson and Georgia's overtime win over Oklahoma in the Rose Bowl, Alabama and Georgia, who did not play during SEC play, were slated to play on January 8, 2018 in the Mercedes-Benz Dome in Atlanta, Georgia for the [[2018 College Football Playoff National Championship|2018 College Football National Championship Game]]. This game marked the first time ex-Defensive Coordinator for Alabama [[Kirby Smart]], head coach of Georgia faced off against his mentor Nick Saban.\n\nAlabama won the coin toss and elected to defer. On Georgia's opening drive, Alabama's Tony Brown intercepted a pass intended for Georgia's [[Riley Ridley]], the younger brother of Alabama's Calvin Ridley. Alabama used this momentum to get Andy Pappanastos in a position for a 40-yard field goal, which he shanked badly to the left. This was Alabama's only meaningful offensive production for the entire half. On the Georgia side, Georgia QB [[Jake Fromm]] utilized a very effective balanced offensive to stress an increasingly exhausted Alabama defense (due to a combination of abysmal offensive production by Alabama and excellent, preternatural play from the Georgia offense). During the middle of the first quarter, on third and 20, the Alabama defense were gashed by Georgia's [[Sony Michel]] for 26 yards to get within field goal range. The Alabama defense tightened up and held Georgia to a completed 41-yard field goal from Georgia's [[Rodrigo Blankenship]] (AL 0 GA 3). After another Alabama three and out, Georgia again marched down the field to the Alabama red zone.  Again, Alabama held Georgia to a field goal, this time from 27 yards (AL 0 GA 6). Alabama and Georgia traded minimal drives until Georgia gained possession of the ball with 1:12 left in the half. On this drive, which included a strong QB run from Jake Fromm, Georgia ultimately capitalized on a tired and frustrated Alabama defense with a 1-yard touchdown run by Georgia Mecole Hardman (AL 0 GA 13). Alabama took a knee to end the half.\n\nAlabama received the ball to start the half, with one significant modification of personnel: benching two-year starting QB Jalen Hurts for true freshman Hawaiian phenom Tua Tagovailoa. Though Alabama did not see an immediate benefit\u2014their first drive going for a three and out\u2014Tua almost single-handedly resurrected a rudderless Alabama offense.\n\nAfter holding Georgia to a three and out, a reinvigorated Alabama offense faced a third down and 7 near midfield.  Tua eluded four unblocked defenders in the backfield and ran for an Alabama first down. Capturing the momentum, Alabama sealed the drive with a 6-yard strike from Tua to Henry Ruggs III (AL 7 GA 13). Four plays into Georgia's next drive, on third and long, Fromm threw an 80-yard pass to Mecole Hardman for a touchdown (AL 7 GA 20), negating Alabama's gain. Worse yet for Alabama, on its next possession, Tua was picked off deep in Alabama territory on an ill-advised pass.  At the brink of collapse, Alabama received a godsend on the very next play in a deflected Jake Fromm pass for an Alabama interception by Raekwon Davis. Using this sudden turnover, Alabama drove into field goal range with a 43-yard Andy Pappanastos field goal (AL 10 GA 20). Alabama and Georgia traded minimal drives to end the third quarter. On Georgia's first drive of the fourth quarter, the beleaguered Alabama defense once more stood tall and allowed Alabama to get the ball back. During Alabama's first drive of the fourth quarter, another freshman phenom, RB Najee Harris, put the Alabama offense in position for another completed FG, this time from 30 yards (AL 13 GA 20). After stopping Georgia on its next possession, Alabama again drove down the field.  On fourth down and 4, deep in Georgia territory, Alabama elected to go for the touchdown instead of kicking another field goal. Tua's pass was completed into triple coverage to Calvin Ridley for a 7-yard touchdown (AL 20 GA 20). The exhausted Alabama defense proved once again their mettle and held Georgia to a three and out. In prime position with 2:50 left in the game, Alabama drove down the field and set up a potentially game-winning field goal with three seconds left on the clock. However, reminiscent of his first kick of the game, Andy Pappanastos, missed wide left from 36 yards out, sending the game into overtime.\n[[File:Alabama Crimson Tide at White House 2018.jpg|thumb|2017 Alabama Crimson Tide with [[Donald J. Trump]] at the [[White House]] in 2018.]]\nIn overtime, Alabama again won the coin toss and elected to play defense. For the last time, the Alabama defense stood tall with a Terrell Lewis sack of Jake Fromm for a 13-yard loss. Despite the distance, a stellar 51-yard kick for from Rodrigo Blankenship put Georgia up. (AL 20 GA 23). On Alabama's first play of their drive, Tua, showing his inexperience, attempted to outmaneuver two unblocked defenders in the backfield instead of throwing the ball away, putting Alabama back 16 yards.
