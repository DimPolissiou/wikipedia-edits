This year, Jose Polanco and Ignacio Rodriguez were granted El Rancho Conejo by Governor [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arrillaga]] of Alta California. The land contained 48,671.56 acres.

In 1822, Captain [[Jos\u00e9 de la Guerra y Noriega]] filed Conejo Valley as part of the [[Mexican land grant]]. It remained a part of Mexico until the short-lived [[California Republic]] was established in 1846. It became a part of the U.S. after California gained statehood in 1850.

A resident deputy had also been assigned to the valley prior to the new station, who received his calls out of the family home.

There were four one-man patrol vehicles which were operated on 24-hour basis.<ref name=\"Commerce 1973 Page 9\"/>\n\nAt first, the police station was housed in a room at the Park Oaks Fire Station, on the corner of Avenida de Los Arboles and Moorpark Road. As the officers soon outgrew the small room, the house across the street was rented and turned into a police station. The little house on Avenida de Los Arboles gave way to a professional sheriff's station, which was established on Olsen Road in 1969. It was replaced in 1988 with a more modern station, located just a half mile down Olsen Road.<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). ''Tales and Voices of the Conejo''.

It had a 4,300 foot surfaced and lighted runway, and was described by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': \"It was the finest executive aircraft facility on the West Coast\u2026 and will serve the needs of the fast-moving executives of the space-age industries.\" The airport was used in the filming of ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World]]'' in 1963. The airport closed by 1965\u201366, and the land remained empty until 1991 when [[Shapell Industries]] constructed Rancho Conejo Village homes. The former site is northwest of the intersection of Lawrence Drive and Ventu Park Road in Newbury Park.<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). ''Tales and Voices of the Conejo''.

This year, Jose Polanco and Ignacio Rodriguez were granted El Rancho Conejo by Governor [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arrillaga]] of Alta California. The land contained 48,671.56 acres. [[Rancho El Conejo|El Conejo]] was just one of two land grants in what became [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]], the other being [[Rancho Simi]].<ref name=\"Maulhardt, Jeffrey Wayne 2010 Page 7\"/>\n\nAs a result of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] in 1822, Alta California became a Mexican territory. In 1822, Captain [[Jos\u00e9 de la Guerra y Noriega]] filed Conejo Valley as part of the [[Mexican land grant]]. It remained a part of Mexico until the short-lived [[California Republic]] was established in 1846. It became a part of the U.S. after California gained statehood in 1850.

The original structure was built 1876 but was destroyed by fire in the early 1970s. The Inn is a Monterey style structure of northern California redwood with a wrap-around porch and balcony. The original structure served as a school, post office, steak house, church, gift shop and movie set. Location: 51 South Ventu Park Road. The present location is not the original site of the structure. Its original location was nearer the Route 101 Freeway where a historical marker is placed.\n\nCity#2: Sycamore Tree \u2013 County #44 (designated June 1978). This unusually large and old specimen of California Sycamore was over 150 year old when designated as a landmark.

Fifteen officers, a sergeant, and a station commander serving as police chief, began work officially on July 1, 1965. Prior to the new police station, the closest deputies were in the city of [[Ventura, California|Ventura]] and had to make the far trek to the [[Conejo Valley]] when crimes occurred. A resident deputy had also been assigned to the valley prior to the new station, who received his calls out of the family home. When the police station was established, it was originally two patrol cars to cover the city.<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). ''Tales and Voices of the Conejo''.

There were four one-man patrol vehicles which were operated on 24-hour basis.<ref name=\"Commerce 1973 Page 9\"/>\n\nAt first, the police station was housed in a room at the Park Oaks Fire Station, on the corner of Avenida de Los Arboles and Moorpark Road. As the officers soon outgrew the small room, the house across the street was rented and turned into a police station. The little house on Avenida de Los Arboles gave way to a professional sheriff's station, which was established on Olsen Road in 1969. It was replaced in 1988 with a more modern station, located just a half mile down Olsen Road.<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012). ''Tales and Voices of the Conejo''.

It had the first qualified flying field in the [[Conejo Valley]], and was opened sometime between 1946 and 1949 by the [[Janss Corporation]], which had large land holdings in the area. The airport had 2,800 feet of unpaved runway, located parallel to Ventura Road, now known as [[Thousand Oaks Boulevard]] (near Moorpark Road). When the state established a highway through town in 1952, the airfield was moved to the south side of the 101 [[Ventura Freeway]]. The airport was often featured in movies, including ''[[Francis (film)|Francis the Talking Mule]]'' (1950) with [[Donald O'Conner]].<ref>Sprankling, Miriam and Ruthanne Begun (2012).

The Janss Corporation later announced they would construct a new airport on the 1,400 acre Friedrich Ranch in [[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]], which they had purchased to develop the [[Rancho Conejo Industrial Park]]. Rancho Conejo Airport opened on May 5, 1960, and considered an executive airport. It had a 4,300 foot surfaced and lighted runway, and was described by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': \"It was the finest executive aircraft facility on the West Coast\u2026 and will serve the needs of the fast-moving executives of the space-age industries.\" The airport was used in the filming of ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World]]'' in 1963. The airport closed by 1965\u201366, and the land remained empty until 1991 when [[Shapell Industries]] constructed Rancho Conejo Village homes.

Newbury and other residents of the Conejo Valley were unprepared for the 1876\u201378 drought. There were only six inches of rain in 30 months. The drought devastated Newbury Park and the valley. With no rain, the crops died and natural grasses as well, which were food for the ranchers' sheep. Egbert went bankrupt and decided to move with his family in 1877, and rode with his wagon and family back to Michigan where he ultimately settled in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. On September 28, 1878, the land Egbert once called \"Newbury Park\" was sold at a sheriff's sale.

As the efforts collected signatures from 29% of registered voters, and not Newbury Park landowners, the petition never appeared on the ballot.<ref name=\"Bidwell, Carol A. 1989 Page 54\">Bidwell, Carol A.

As the efforts collected signatures from 29% of registered voters, and not Newbury Park landowners, the petition never appeared on the ballot.<ref name=\"Bidwell, Carol A. 1989 Page 54\">Bidwell, Carol A.

He was succeeded by his top assistant, [[Wimp Sanderson]].  He had been at Alabama since 1960 as a graduate assistant to Newton's predecessor, [[Hayden Riley]]; he was named a full-fledged assistant in 1961.  In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267\u2013119 record, and they won 4 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and eight NCAA tournaments making the \"Sweet 16\" five times. Sanderson is the only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the SEC Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987.<ref name=\"ashof\" >{{cite web |title=''Wimp Sanderson'' |work=Alabama Sports Hall of Fame |url=http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view=company&srctype=display&back=company&id=230&category=Basketball&submenu=Inductees&pos=0,15,14&PHPSESSID=4558f07a5692c8f5eb8069936dd5870d |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>\n\nSanderson was best known for wearing garish [[Tartan|plaid]] [[sports jacket]]s on the sidelines.  At one point, [[Coleman Coliseum]] was known as the \"Plaid Palace\", and the mid-court logo was painted in a crimson-and-white plaid pattern.\n\n===David Hobbs===\nHobbs was hired at Alabama as an assistant coach for Wimp Sanderson in 1985 and spent seven years as an assistant in Tuscaloosa helping the Crimson Tide win one SEC Championship and four SEC Tournament crowns while the Tide made four appearances in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. As an assistant, he had the opportunity to coach such All-SEC performers as [[Robert Horry]], [[James Robinson (basketball)|James \"Hollywood\" Robinson]] and [[Latrell Sprewell]].\n\nWhen Sanderson left Alabama following the 1992 season, Hobbs was named head coach. In his first season, the Tide finished 16\u201313 and advanced to the NIT. In 1994 and 1995, Alabama recorded 20-win seasons and advanced to the NCAA Tournament behind the play of future NBA All-Star [[Antonio McDyess]]. In 1996, Hobbs led UA to a 19\u201313 mark and a berth in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] Final Four.

He was hired by Alabama in March 1998 after coaching at [[Murray State]] for three seasons.\n\nThe Crimson Tide achieved the highest pinnacle ever for the school in both the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Championship Tournament]] and the [[AP Poll|Associated Press Poll]] reaching the Elite Eight in the tournament in 2004 and reaching the No. 1 spot in the nation in the AP poll in 2002, both under Mark Gottfried's command.\n\nGottfried led the Tide to its only SEC Championship under his watch during the 2001\u201302 season, although the team never won a conference tournament championship during his tenure. For his efforts in 2002, Gottfried was named SEC Coach of the Year by both the Associated Press and his fellow Southeastern Conference coaches. Perhaps his biggest accomplishment as coach at Alabama was leading the Crimson Tide to five consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2002\u20132006, another first for the school that occurred under his watch.\n\nGottfried resigned on January 26, 2009 with 11 regular season games still remaining on the team's schedule.

Under former coach [[Mark Gottfried]], the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003, and competed for an NCAA Regional Tournament Championship in 2004.  The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach [[Wimp Sanderson]] and in the 1970s under coach [[C. M. Newton]]. Alabama has eight NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 appearances.  In the [[2003\u201304 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2003\u201304 season]], the team defeated #1-seeded [[2003\u201304 Stanford Cardinal men's basketball team|Stanford]] in the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], and reached the [[Elite Eight]] round where they lost to the eventual national champion, [[2003\u201304 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|Connecticut]].\n\n==History==\nFormer coaches with at least five years with the Crimson Tide include the following: [[Hank Crisp]] (1923\u20131942, 1945\u20131946), [[Hayden Riley]] (1960\u20131968), [[C.

He was succeeded by his top assistant, [[Wimp Sanderson]].  He had been at Alabama since 1960 as a graduate assistant to Newton's predecessor, [[Hayden Riley]]; he was named a full-fledged assistant in 1961.  In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267\u2013119 record, and they won 4 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and eight NCAA tournaments making the \"Sweet 16\" five times. Sanderson is the only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the SEC Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987.<ref name=\"ashof\" >{{cite web |title=''Wimp Sanderson'' |work=Alabama Sports Hall of Fame |url=http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view=company&srctype=display&back=company&id=230&category=Basketball&submenu=Inductees&pos=0,15,14&PHPSESSID=4558f07a5692c8f5eb8069936dd5870d |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>\n\nSanderson was best known for wearing garish [[Tartan|plaid]] [[sports jacket]]s on the sidelines.  At one point, [[Coleman Coliseum]] was known as the \"Plaid Palace\", and the mid-court logo was painted in a crimson-and-white plaid pattern.\n\n===David Hobbs===\nHobbs was hired at Alabama as an assistant coach for Wimp Sanderson in 1985 and spent seven years as an assistant in Tuscaloosa helping the Crimson Tide win one SEC Championship and four SEC Tournament crowns while the Tide made four appearances in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. As an assistant, he had the opportunity to coach such All-SEC performers as [[Robert Horry]], [[James Robinson (basketball)|James \"Hollywood\" Robinson]] and [[Latrell Sprewell]].\n\nWhen Sanderson left Alabama following the 1992 season, Hobbs was named head coach. In his first season, the Tide finished 16\u201313 and advanced to the NIT. In 1994 and 1995, Alabama recorded 20-win seasons and advanced to the NCAA Tournament behind the play of future NBA All-Star [[Antonio McDyess]]. In 1996, Hobbs led UA to a 19\u201313 mark and a berth in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] Final Four.

He was hired by Alabama in March 1998 after coaching at [[Murray State]] for three seasons.\n\nThe Crimson Tide achieved the highest pinnacle ever for the school in both the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Championship Tournament]] and the [[AP Poll|Associated Press Poll]] reaching the Elite Eight in the tournament in 2004 and reaching the No. 1 spot in the nation in the AP poll in 2002, both under Mark Gottfried's command.\n\nGottfried led the Tide to its only SEC Championship under his watch during the 2001\u201302 season, although the team never won a conference tournament championship during his tenure. For his efforts in 2002, Gottfried was named SEC Coach of the Year by both the Associated Press and his fellow Southeastern Conference coaches. Perhaps his biggest accomplishment as coach at Alabama was leading the Crimson Tide to five consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2002\u20132006, another first for the school that occurred under his watch.\n\nGottfried resigned on January 26, 2009 with 11 regular season games still remaining on the team's schedule.

About {{convert|40|mi|km}} long, it drains a rugged area of the [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] east of [[Big Sur]] before flowing through the agricultural [[Salinas Valley]].\n\n==Name==\n\"Arroyo Seco\" means \"dry streambed\" or \"dry wash\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The river probably got its name because it disappears into the ground more than {{convert|10|mi|km}} above its mouth for most of the year, however, it reaches the Salinas during the rainy season. The river above the Salinas Valley is actually a fairly large perennial stream.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/arroyo/\n|title=Arroyo Seco River Hike\n|publisher=Stanford University\n|work=Stanford Theory Group\n|date=2010-07-12\n|accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref> The common name, Arroyo Seco River or Arroyo Seco Creek, is actually a [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] because the name contains two mentions of \"watercourse\", thus \"Arroyo Seco River\" literally translates to \"dry streambed river\".<ref>Gudde and Bright, p. 18</ref>\n\n==Course==\nThe river rises in several unnamed forks in the [[Santa Lucia Mountains]] of the Coast Ranges near the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It flows generally north, cutting into a steep gorge, receiving Lost Valley Creek and Tassajara Creek both from the left. After the confluence with Rocky Creek, the Arroyo Seco swings abruptly east, passing a pair of intermittent natural lakes simply known as \"The Lakes\". Here, the valley begins to widen and the stream lazes out onto a shallower, sandier bed, passing the unincorporated communities of Millers Ranch and [[Sycamore Flat, California|Sycamore Flat]]. Another major tributary, Piney Creek, enters just downstream of the former.<ref name=\"ACME\">{{cite map\n|publisher=ACME Mapper\n|title=USGS Topo Maps for United States\n|cartography=[[United States Geological Survey]]\n|accessdate=2011-04-23\n|url=http://mapper.acme.com/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110409042859/http://mapper.acme.com/| archivedate= 9 April 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nMeandering east between low bluffs, the river receives Vaqueros Creek and Reliz Creek from the right, emerging from the mountains about {{convert|3|mi|km}} southwest of [[Greenfield, California|Greenfield]]. The river flows north into the [[Salinas Valley]], where much of its water is diverted for irrigation. Turning northwest, it begins to parallel [[U.S. Highway 101]] as a seasonally dry wash. It joins the Salinas just south of the city of [[Soledad, California|Soledad]]. The source, mouth and entire course of the river are entirely within [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]]. There are no dams on the Arroyo Seco, making it prone to [[flash flood]]ing.<ref name=\"ACME\"/>\n\n==Watershed==\nDraining {{convert|275|mi2|km2}}, the Arroyo Seco River is the last major tributary of the Salinas River that enters before it reaches the Pacific. Most of the watershed lies in the rugged coastal range areas southwest of Greenfield and Soledad, and the [[drainage divide]] runs along the crest of the Santa Lucia Mountains to the west and the lower [[Sierra de Salinas]] to the northeast. Although the mountains are not particularly high, with the highest point just {{convert|5853|ft|m}} above sea level at [[Junipero Serra Peak]], most of the basin nonetheless has great topographical relief, dissected by numerous canyons and ridges. Watersheds bordering the Arroyo Seco drainage are those of the [[Carmel River]] and [[Big Sur River]] to the northwest, multiple small creeks flowing into the Pacific on the west, the [[San Antonio River (California)|San Antonio River]] to the south, and other smaller tributaries of the Salinas on the east.\n\n==Ecology==\nBecause of its relatively pristine condition, the Arroyo Seco River in the foothills and mountains supports a rich [[riparian zone]] habitat that is home to such sensitive species as the [[western pond turtle|southwestern pond turtle]] and California [[spotted owl]].

About {{convert|40|mi|km}} long, it drains a rugged area of the [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] east of [[Big Sur]] before flowing through the agricultural [[Salinas Valley]].\n\n==Name==\n\"Arroyo Seco\" means \"dry streambed\" or \"dry wash\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The river above the Salinas Valley is actually a fairly large perennial stream.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/arroyo/\n|title=Arroyo Seco River Hike\n|publisher=Stanford University\n|work=Stanford Theory Group\n|date=2010-07-12\n|accessdate=2011-04-23}}</ref> The common name, Arroyo Seco River or Arroyo Seco Creek, is actually a [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]] because the name contains two mentions of \"watercourse\", thus \"Arroyo Seco River\" literally translates to \"dry streambed river\".<ref>Gudde and Bright, p. 18</ref>\n\n==Course==\nThe river rises in several unnamed forks in the [[Santa Lucia Mountains]] of the Coast Ranges near the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It flows generally north, cutting into a steep gorge, receiving Lost Valley Creek and Tassajara Creek both from the left. After the confluence with Rocky Creek, the Arroyo Seco swings abruptly east, passing a pair of intermittent natural lakes simply known as \"The Lakes\". Here, the valley begins to widen and the stream lazes out onto a shallower, sandier bed, passing the unincorporated communities of [[Millers Ranch, Monterey County, California|Millers Ranch]] and [[Sycamore Flat, California|Sycamore Flat]]. Another major tributary, Piney Creek, enters just downstream of the former.<ref name=\"ACME\">{{cite map\n|publisher=ACME Mapper\n|title=USGS Topo Maps for United States\n|cartography=[[United States Geological Survey]]\n|accessdate=2011-04-23\n|url=http://mapper.acme.com/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110409042859/http://mapper.acme.com/| archivedate= 9 April 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nMeandering east between low bluffs, the river receives Vaqueros Creek and Reliz Creek from the right, emerging from the mountains about {{convert|3|mi|km}} southwest of [[Greenfield, California|Greenfield]]. The river flows north into the [[Salinas Valley]], where much of its water is diverted for irrigation. Turning northwest, it begins to parallel [[U.S. Highway 101]] as a seasonally dry wash. It joins the Salinas just south of the city of [[Soledad, California|Soledad]]. The source, mouth and entire course of the river are entirely within [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]]. There are no dams on the Arroyo Seco, making it prone to [[flash flood]]ing.<ref name=\"ACME\"/>\n\n==Watershed==\nDraining {{convert|275|mi2|km2}}, the Arroyo Seco River is the last major tributary of the Salinas River that enters before it reaches the Pacific. Most of the watershed lies in the rugged coastal range areas southwest of Greenfield and Soledad, and the [[drainage divide]] runs along the crest of the Santa Lucia Mountains to the west and the lower [[Sierra de Salinas]] to the northeast. Although the mountains are not particularly high, with the highest point just {{convert|5853|ft|m}} above sea level at [[Junipero Serra Peak]], most of the basin nonetheless has great topographical relief, dissected by numerous canyons and ridges. Watersheds bordering the Arroyo Seco drainage are those of the [[Carmel River]] and [[Big Sur River]] to the northwest, multiple small creeks flowing into the Pacific on the west, the [[San Antonio River (California)|San Antonio River]] to the south, and other smaller tributaries of the Salinas on the east.\n\n==Ecology==\nBecause of its relatively pristine condition, the Arroyo Seco River in the foothills and mountains supports a rich [[riparian zone]] habitat that is home to such sensitive species as the [[western pond turtle|southwestern pond turtle]] and California [[spotted owl]]. The only perennial Salinas River tributary without dams, the river also supports a respectable run of [[steelhead trout]], one of the last remnant populations along the Central California coast.

The road continues north, with access usually restricted to major intersections which are controlled via [[traffic light]]s.\n\nLawrence Expressway continues northeasterly and junctions with [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] and Stevens Creek Boulevard over a complex shared separated grade crossing. Lawrence proceeds under I-280 before immediately rising over Stevens Creek Boulevard. Lawrence Expressway and Stevens Creek Boulevard also share ramps for access to I-280 with the exception of the onramp to Southbound I-280 which is accessed directly from Lawrence Expressway, a frequent cause of confusion for drivers on Stevens Creek Boulevard wishing to access I-280 due to unclear signage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Lawrence Expressway continues north into [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] and widens to 8 lanes with an [[HOV]] lane occupying the far right lane.\n\nLawrence Expressway also has another separated grade interchange with [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] ([[California State Route 82|SR 82]]) with Lawrence Expressway passing over El Camino Real just prior to Lawrence Expressway entering [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]].

At the time of G2's inception SR 85 was in the early planning stages and an interchange had been envisioned at Quito Road. However opposition to the freeway was intense in Saratoga and the planned interchange between SR 85 and G2 along with an interchange further north at Prospect Road were abandoned in favor of the existing Saratoga Avenue interchange. G2 is unsigned from SR 85 to Saratoga Avenue along Quito Road. North of Saratoga Avenue Lawrence Expressway is currently signed as G2.\n\nIn the 1990s Lawrence Expressway was widened north of I-280 to 8 lanes to accommodate an [[High-occupancy vehicle|HOV]] carpool lane.\n\nThe section of Quito Road between Bucknall Road and Saratoga Avenue in Saratoga is slated for expansion to 3 lanes in the fall of 2006.\n\n===Major intersections===\n{{CAinttop|county=Santa Clara}}\n{{CAint\n|location=Saratoga\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|85}} (overcrossing only)\n|notes=No Interchange\n}}\n{{CAint\n|location=San Jose|lspan=2\n|road=Saratoga Avenue / Quito Road\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road={{jct|state=CA|I|280|dir1=south|city1=San Jose}}\n|notes=I-280 exit 9A\n}}\n{{CAint\n|location1=San Jose\n|location2=Santa Clara\n|road={{jct|state=CA|to1=to|I|280|dir1=north|road=Stevens Creek Boulevard|city1=San Francisco}}\n|notes=interchange\n}}\n{{CAint\n|location=Santa Clara\n|road=[[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] ([[SR 82 (CA)|SR 82]])\n|notes=interchange\n}}\n{{CAint\n|location1=Santa Clara\n|location2=Sunnyvale\n|road=[[Central Expressway (California)|Central Expressway]] ([[CR G6 (CA)|CR G6]])\n|notes=interchange\n}}\n{{CAint\n|location=Sunnyvale|lspan=2\n|road={{jct|state=CA|US|101|city1=San Francisco}}\n|notes=interchange; US 101 exit 394\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|237|road=Caribbean Drive|city1=Mountain View|city2=Milpitas}}\n|notes=interchange; SR 237 exit 5\n}}\n{{jctbtm}}\n\n==G3==\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=CA\n|type=CR\n|county=Santa Clara\n|route=G3\n|location=[[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]]\n|length_mi=4.52\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"cahighways-g\"/>\n|formed=1962\n|yr_ref=<ref name=\"cahighways-g\"/>\n}}\n[[File:Oregon Expressway underpass.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Oregon Expressway passing under Alma Street.]]\n\n'''County Route G3''', more commonly known as '''Page Mill Road''' and '''Oregon Expressway''' is a short {{convert|4.5|mi|km|adj=on}} northeast-southwest [[arterial]] route that spans the lower [[San Francisco Peninsula|peninsula region]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] from [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] to [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]].

It is part of the Santa Clara County Expressway System.\n\n===Route description===\nG3 begins in the west at its interchange with I-280 in Los Altos Hills just south of Stanford University. It proceeds northeast as a four lane expressway over the rolling hills of Stanford University until it reaches [[Foothill Expressway]] (G5) with which it shares an [[at-grade intersection]]. East of Foothill Expressway, G3 descends down into the more urban areas of the lower peninsula going through the industrialized area of the Stanford Research Park located in Palo Alto. The road along this section has a reduced speed limit and several turnoffs along its length until it reaches [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] ([[California State Route 82|SR 82]]).\n\nAfter SR 82, Oregon Expressway branches from Page Mill Road, which becomes a short two-lane street, and G3 follows Oregon Expressway under [[Caltrain]] tracks and onward for the remainder of its northeastward journey. Oregon Expressway resumes expressway status with limited access confined mainly to large intersections. G3 reaches its eastern terminus at its junction with [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]].\n\nPage Mill Road (no longer designated G3) continues southwest of I-280 for {{convert|6|mi|km}}, a twisting two-lane road that climbs to [[Skyline Boulevard]] ([[California State Route 35|SR 35]]) at the crest of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. It passes the entrance to Palo Alto's Foothills Park (which is accessible to Palo Alto residents and their guests only) and the [[Monte Bello Open Space Preserve|Monte Bello]] and [[Los Trancos Open Space Preserve]]s. Under the name West Alpine Road, the road descends west of Skyline Boulevard to a turn-off that leads to [[Portola Redwoods State Park]], where the original Page sawmill is located.  Other than a commemorative sign, no artifacts remain at the mill site, which is accessible only by Slate Creek Trail from either Portola Redwoods state park or from [[Skyline Boulevard]] (SR 35).\n\n===History===\nThis route was designated in 1962.

It proceeds northwest directly east of I-280 making it a viable alternative route for short trips between Cupertino and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. The road is a four-lane expressway along its entire route. Access is generally limited to major intersections that are governed by [[traffic lights]] except for an interchange at Fremont Avenue, which the interchange also provides access to Miramonte Avenue and Loyola Drive. G5 travels through several affluent neighborhoods in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]] before climbing up into the [[foothills]] to its northern terminus at the intersection with [[Santa Clara County Route G3|Page Mill Road (G3)]].

This is due to the fact that all of these routes move in an east&ndash;west direction in this area, but these other routes continue longer than Central Expressway and are mostly north&ndash;south overall. This route is part of the Santa Clara County Expressway System.\n\n===Route description===\nRoute G6 actually begins in the west at [[Oregon Expressway]] as Alma Street in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].  In Palo Alto, G6 remains a major surface street with four lanes of traffic and a center turning lane to service the many driveways and turnoffs available.  At the Palo Alto &ndash; [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] border at San Antonio Road, G6's character changes, removing the driveways and frequent intersections and adding a center divider, and is renamed Central Expressway. Central continues east as a 4 lane road through the city of Mountain View. Through this section Central Expressway has more at-grade intersections than is typical for a designated expressway.  This section's intersections are primarily at-grade with cross streets controlled by [[traffic lights]], although there are some overpasses, such as for San Antonio Road, Shoreline Blvd., Whisman Ave, [[California State Route 237|SR 237]] and [[California State Route 85|SR 85]].\n\nUp to this point, the road parallels the [[Caltrain]] rail line, which limits the intersections and driveways on the south side of the road.\n\nAfter crossing under [[California State Route 85|SR 85]], Central Expressway takes on a very freeway-like appearance (which is not typical for most county roads) for several miles through [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]. Through this section Central Expressway has a wide center divider and a sequence of several separated grade interchanges with main cross streets and no turnoffs or driveways. The final in this sequence is at [[Lawrence Expressway]]. East of Lawrence Expressway, Central Expressway resumes at grade intersections along with sporadic [[High-occupancy vehicle|HOV]] lanes at the approaches to intersections. Central has one final separated grade interchange with [[San Tomas Expressway]]. Central reaches its end at De La Cruz Blvd in Santa Clara, just outside the north end of [[San Jose International Airport]]. Route G6 makes a turn on to De La Cruz for a few hundred feet until it reaches [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]], which serves as the route's eastern terminus.\n\n===History===\nCentral Expressway was first designated in 1962. Central Expressway was a vital route through the western Silicon Valley in the days before [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]] and [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] had been widened as an alternate route. Central Expressway still acts as an alternate route to US 101 through the west valley, however usage has declined as both freeways are now much larger and more direct routes. Construction was completed in 2007 near the eastern terminus widening Central Expressway to accommodate an [[High-occupancy vehicle|HOV]] lane and a reconfiguration of the intersection with Lafayette Street.\n\nCentral Expressway is currently signed as G6 sporadically along its entire length.\n\nIn 1982, the prohibition against bicyclists using Central Expressway's shoulders was lifted.

G8 is also part of the Santa Clara County Expressway System.\n\n===Route description===\nG8 begins in the south at its junction with [[California State Route 152|State Route 152]] in [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]]. It proceeds north along Watsonville Road as a two-lane country road until it reaches the intersection of Watsonville Rd and Uvas Road. G8 turns left and proceeds north along Uvas Road which is a winding two-lane mountain road that passes by Uvas, Chesbro and Calero reservoirs and their surrounding parks. In [[Calero Reservoir County Park]], Uvas Road is renamed McKean Road and proceeds into the [[Almaden Valley, San Jose, California|Almaden Valley]] area of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. At the north end of McKean Rd, G8 turns briefly right on Harry Road for a short distance and then left on to the south end of Almaden Expressway.\n\nAs Almaden Expressway, G8 begins as a 2-lane undivided road for 1/2 mile before expanding to 4-lane divided expressway approaching the intersection of Almaden Road. Almaden Expressway eventually expands to a 6-8 lane expressway with the majority of access limited to major intersections controlled by traffic signals. The major exception to this is near [[California State Route 85|Highway 85]] and [[Santa Clara County Route G10|Blossom Hill Road (G10)]] where there are several major shopping centers.\n\nG8 intersects G10 at Blossom Hill Rd and SR 85 a quarter mile north. This interchange is one of the busiest in [[Silicon Valley]] due to several shopping centers and a [[Costco]] warehouse store all sharing driveways with this interchange. G8 continues north resuming its expressway design. G8 shares a separated grade interchange with the terminus of [[County Route G21 (California)|Capitol Expressway Auto Mall]] and again with Curtner Avenue. Other intersections along this part of the route are at grade. Almaden Expressway crosses [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]] with which it shares a northbound only interchange.\n\nG8 continues past the north end of Almaden Expressway on to Almaden Road as a 4-lane city street. At the intersection Almaden Road and Alma Avenue, G8 turns east along Alma Ave and proceeds for about a quarter mile to its eastern terminus at First Street (former [[California State Route 82|SR 82]]).\n\n===History===\nG8 was originally designated in 1962 along Almaden Expwy which had begun construction in 1959. Almaden Expwy was not completed to its southern terminus until 1984. Before that time the section between McKean Rd and the southern end of the expressway (which was further north at the time) took a zig zag path from McKean Rd to Harry Rd to Almaden Road (S) to Barnes Lane, to the then southern end of Almaden Expwy.\n\nG8 is signed sporadically along its entire length.\n\n===Major intersections===\n{{CAinttop|county=Santa Clara}}\n{{CAint\n|location=none\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|152|city1=Watsonville|city2=Gilroy}}\n}}\n{{CAint\n|location=none\n|road=Watsonville Road - [[Morgan Hill, CA|Morgan Hill]]\n}}\n{{CAint\n|location=San Jose|lspan=7\n|road=[[Blossom Hill Road]] ([[CR G10 (CA)|CR G10]])\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|85}}\n|notes=interchange; SR 85 exit 6\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road=Hillsdale Avenue / [[Capitol Expressway Auto Mall]] ([[CR G21 (CA)|CR G21]])\n|notes=interchange\n}}\n{{CAint|type=incomplete\n|road=Lincoln Avenue - [[Willow Glen, CA|Willow Glen]]\n|notes=interchange; northbound exit and southbound entrance\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road={{jct|state=CA|to1=to|SR|87|dir1=south|road=Curtner Avenue}}\n|notes=interchange\n}}\n{{CAint|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|87|dir1=north}}\n|notes=interchange; SR 87 exit 3B; no northbound entrance\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road=First Street / Monterey Road\n|notes=former [[SR 82 (CA)|SR 82]]\n}}\n{{jctbtm}}\n\n==G9==\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=CA\n|type=CR\n|county=Santa Clara\n|route=G9\n|location=[[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]]\n|length_mi=4.17\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"cahighways-g\"/>\n|formed=1963\n|yr_ref=<ref name=\"cahighways-g\"/>\n}}\n\n'''County Route G9''' is a county road in [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]] and unincorporated [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]].

It proceeds northwest directly east of I-280 making it a viable alternative route for short trips between Cupertino and [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]]. The road is a four-lane expressway along its entire route. Access is generally limited to major intersections that are governed by [[traffic lights]] except for an interchange at Fremont Avenue, which the interchange also provides access to Miramonte Avenue and Loyola Drive. G5 travels through several affluent neighborhoods in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]] before climbing up into the [[foothills]] to its northern terminus at the intersection with [[Santa Clara County Route G3|Page Mill Road (G3)]].

This is due to the fact that all of these routes move in an east&ndash;west direction in this area, but these other routes continue longer than Central Expressway and are mostly north&ndash;south overall. This route is part of the Santa Clara County Expressway System.\n\n===Route description===\nRoute G6 actually begins in the west at [[Oregon Expressway]] as Alma Street in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].  In Palo Alto, G6 remains a major surface street with four lanes of traffic and a center turning lane to service the many driveways and turnoffs available.  At the Palo Alto &ndash; [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] border at San Antonio Road, G6's character changes, removing the driveways and frequent intersections and adding a center divider, and is renamed Central Expressway. Central continues east as a 4 lane road through the city of Mountain View. Through this section Central Expressway has more at-grade intersections than is typical for a designated expressway.  This section's intersections are primarily at-grade with cross streets controlled by [[traffic lights]], although there are some overpasses, such as for San Antonio Road, Shoreline Blvd., Whisman Ave, [[California State Route 237|SR 237]] and [[California State Route 85|SR 85]].\n\nUp to this point, the road parallels the [[Caltrain]] rail line, which limits the intersections and driveways on the south side of the road.\n\nAfter crossing under [[California State Route 85|SR 85]], Central Expressway takes on a very freeway-like appearance (which is not typical for most county roads) for several miles through [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]. Through this section Central Expressway has a wide center divider and a sequence of several separated grade interchanges with main cross streets and no turnoffs or driveways. The final in this sequence is at [[Lawrence Expressway]]. East of Lawrence Expressway, Central Expressway resumes at grade intersections along with sporadic [[High-occupancy vehicle|HOV]] lanes at the approaches to intersections. Central has one final separated grade interchange with [[San Tomas Expressway]]. Central reaches its end at De La Cruz Blvd in Santa Clara, just outside the north end of [[San Jose International Airport]]. Route G6 makes a turn on to De La Cruz for a few hundred feet until it reaches [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]], which serves as the route's eastern terminus.\n\n===History===\nCentral Expressway was first designated in 1962. Central Expressway was a vital route through the western Silicon Valley in the days before [[U.S. Route 101 in California|US 101]] and [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] had been widened as an alternate route. Central Expressway still acts as an alternate route to US 101 through the west valley, however usage has declined as both freeways are now much larger and more direct routes. Construction was completed in 2007 near the eastern terminus widening Central Expressway to accommodate an [[High-occupancy vehicle|HOV]] lane and a reconfiguration of the intersection with Lafayette Street.\n\nCentral Expressway is currently signed as G6 sporadically along its entire length.\n\nIn 1982, the prohibition against bicyclists using Central Expressway's shoulders was lifted.

G8 is also part of the Santa Clara County Expressway System.\n\n===Route description===\nG8 begins in the south at its junction with [[California State Route 152|State Route 152]] in [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]]. It proceeds north along Watsonville Road as a two-lane country road until it reaches the intersection of Watsonville Rd and Uvas Road. G8 turns left and proceeds north along Uvas Road which is a winding two-lane mountain road that passes by Uvas, Chesbro and Calero reservoirs and their surrounding parks. In [[Calero Reservoir County Park]], Uvas Road is renamed McKean Road and proceeds into the [[Almaden Valley, San Jose, California|Almaden Valley]] area of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. At the north end of McKean Rd, G8 turns briefly right on Harry Road for a short distance and then left on to the south end of Almaden Expressway.\n\nAs Almaden Expressway, G8 begins as a 2-lane undivided road for 1/2 mile before expanding to 4-lane divided expressway approaching the intersection of Almaden Road. Almaden Expressway eventually expands to a 6-8 lane expressway with the majority of access limited to major intersections controlled by traffic signals. The major exception to this is near [[California State Route 85|Highway 85]] and [[Santa Clara County Route G10|Blossom Hill Road (G10)]] where there are several major shopping centers.\n\nG8 intersects G10 at Blossom Hill Rd and SR 85 a quarter mile north. This interchange is one of the busiest in [[Silicon Valley]] due to several shopping centers and a [[Costco]] warehouse store all sharing driveways with this interchange. G8 continues north resuming its expressway design. G8 shares a separated grade interchange with the terminus of [[County Route G21 (California)|Capitol Expressway Auto Mall]] and again with Curtner Avenue. Other intersections along this part of the route are at grade. Almaden Expressway crosses [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]] with which it shares a northbound only interchange.\n\nG8 continues past the north end of Almaden Expressway on to Almaden Road as a 4-lane city street. At the intersection Almaden Road and Alma Avenue, G8 turns east along Alma Ave and proceeds for about a quarter mile to its eastern terminus at First Street (former [[California State Route 82|SR 82]]).\n\n===History===\nG8 was originally designated in 1962 along Almaden Expwy which had begun construction in 1959. Almaden Expwy was not completed to its southern terminus until 1984. Before that time the section between McKean Rd and the southern end of the expressway (which was further north at the time) took a zig zag path from McKean Rd to Harry Rd to Almaden Road (S) to Barnes Lane, to the then southern end of Almaden Expwy.\n\nG8 is signed sporadically along its entire length.\n\n===Major intersections===\n{{CAinttop|county=Santa Clara}}\n{{CAint\n|location=none\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|152|city1=Watsonville|city2=Gilroy}}\n}}\n{{CAint\n|location=none\n|road=Watsonville Road - [[Morgan Hill, CA|Morgan Hill]]\n}}\n{{CAint\n|location=San Jose|lspan=7\n|road=[[Blossom Hill Road]] ([[CR G10 (CA)|CR G10]])\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|85}}\n|notes=interchange; SR 85 exit 6\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road=Hillsdale Avenue / [[Capitol Expressway Auto Mall]] ([[CR G21 (CA)|CR G21]])\n|notes=interchange\n}}\n{{CAint|type=incomplete\n|road=Lincoln Avenue - [[Willow Glen, CA|Willow Glen]]\n|notes=interchange; northbound exit and southbound entrance\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road={{jct|state=CA|to1=to|SR|87|dir1=south|road=Curtner Avenue}}\n|notes=interchange\n}}\n{{CAint|type=incomplete\n|road={{jct|state=CA|SR|87|dir1=north}}\n|notes=interchange; SR 87 exit 3B; no northbound entrance\n}}\n{{CAint\n|road=First Street / Monterey Road\n|notes=former [[SR 82 (CA)|SR 82]]\n}}\n{{jctbtm}}\n\n==G9==\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=CA\n|type=CR\n|county=Santa Clara\n|route=G9\n|location=[[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]]\n|length_mi=4.17\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"cahighways-g\"/>\n|formed=1963\n|yr_ref=<ref name=\"cahighways-g\"/>\n}}\n\n'''County Route G9''' is a county road in [[Gilroy, California|Gilroy]] and unincorporated [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]].
