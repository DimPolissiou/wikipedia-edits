The station is owned by [[Gray Television]]. WBAY-TV's studios are located on South Jefferson Street in downtown Green Bay (across from the historic [[Brown County Courthouse (Wisconsin)|Brown County Courthouse]]), and its transmitter is located in [[Ledgeview, Wisconsin]] (shared with the transmitters of [[PBS Wisconsin]] station WPNE-TV and [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] station [[WPNE (FM)|WPNE]] (89.3 FM)).\n\n==History==\n[[File:WBAYTVMidwestRadioGreenBayWisconsinStudiosMay2007.jpg|thumb|left|Studios in 2007.]]\nWBAY-TV first signed on the air on March 17, 1953 as the second television station in Wisconsin, after [[WTMJ-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]]. It was originally owned by the [[Norbertine]] Order of Priests, whose abbey is in nearby [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]]. The priests run [[St. Norbert College]] in De Pere, and already operated WBAY radio (1360 AM, now [[WTAQ]]) in Green Bay and [[WHBY]] radio in [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. Like WTMJ when that station started in 1947, as the only station in the market, WBAY originally carried programming from all four networks of the day \u2013 channel 2 was a primary [[CBS]] affiliate with secondary affiliations with [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]].\n\nNBC moved to [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]]'s WMBV-TV (channel 11, now [[WLUK-TV]]) when it signed on in 1954, with WNAM-TV (channel 42, now [[WFRV-TV]] Channel 5) from [[Neenah, Wisconsin|Neenah]] taking the ABC affiliation upon its 1955 debut. With the shutdown of DuMont in 1956, WBAY was left as an exclusive CBS affiliate, and remained the only station licensed to Green Bay proper until the 1959 relocation of WLUK to the city. Channel 2 upgraded its transmitter and began broadcasting network programming in color around 1959; locally produced programs were broadcast in color starting in 1966.\n\nThe station's studios in downtown Green Bay were built in 1924 as a former [[Knights of Columbus]] clubhouse and later was turned into a private [[Roman Catholic]] [[high school]] during the [[Great Depression]] when the Norbertines took over the building. The former gymnasium/auditorium is now called the WBAY Auditorium and is used as the studio for the station's [[cerebral palsy]] [[telethon]]. During the early years of WBAY, it served as the main studio until 1954 when an addition was built behind the main building. The auditorium has also been used for local theatrical productions. The station's newsroom is in the basement of the building in an area that originally held a [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] pool and [[bowling]] alley. The WBAY building also served as the home of the WBAY radio stations (now WTAQ and [[WIXX]]), which were later purchased by [[Midwest Communications]] in the late 1970s, but remained in the building until Midwest built a combined Green Bay operations facility/company headquarters in 2007 and a news-weather sharing agreement was maintained between WBAY-TV and its former radio sisters for many years before it was discontinued in favor of an agreement with WLUK-TV.\n\nAs a CBS affiliate, WBAY-TV benefited from that network's [[NFL on CBS|coverage]] of [[National Football League]] games, primarily those of the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The station carried its first Packers game a few months after signing on, and continued to air most Packers games until 1991 by virtue of CBS holding the rights to the Packers' conference, the [[National Football Conference]] (for the 1992 and 1993 seasons, Packers games moved to WFRV when that station switched to CBS). Packers games drew up to a 90 percent share of the audience during the team's championship era of the 1960s under [[Vince Lombardi]] (including the team's first two Super Bowl triumphs in [[Super Bowl I]] and [[Super Bowl II]], the former of which was also carried by then-NBC affiliate WFRV), and the station carried the team's coaches' show ''The Vince Lombardi Show.'' The station also originated the team's exhibition game coverage from the 1960s to 2002, with some exceptions. Main anchor Bill Jartz has been [[Lambeau Field]]'s [[public address|PA system]] announcer since the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. The station continued to air ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' Packer games originating from [[ESPN]] beginning with the move of ''MNF'' to cable starting with the 2006 until the 2015 season. For the 2016 season, [[WLUK-TV]], the Packers' primary home by virtue of [[Fox NFL|Fox presently holding the rights to the NFC]], acquired the syndication rights to the ESPN games under a multi-year agreement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox11online.com/sports/packers-and-nfl/fox-11-to-air-hall-of-fame-game-packers-mnf-games|title=FOX 11 to air Hall of Fame Game, Packers MNF games|date=July 6, 2016|publisher=WLUK-TV|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> It was the first time that WBAY did not carry a Packers game during an NFL season in its 63-year history.\n\nIn 1974, WBAY was sold to [[Nationwide Communications]], which operated the station until 1993, when it was sold to [[Young Broadcasting]] along with its two ABC-affiliated sisters [[WATE-TV]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and [[WRIC-TV]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].\n\nIn 1991, CBS purchased the assets of Midwest Television to acquire its long-dominant affiliate in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], [[WCCO-TV]]. Midwest also owned channel 2's longtime competitor, WFRV. CBS considered WBAY a strong affiliate, and tried to sell WFRV and their [[Escanaba, Michigan]]-based satellite station, [[WJMN-TV]], after the deal with Midwest closed. However, after FCC rules were relaxed at the time to allow one company to own more stations, the network decided to keep the two stations as a result and switched WFRV/WJMN to CBS in 1992 (CBS sold WFRV/WJMN to [[Liberty Media]] in 2007, the stations are now owned by the [[Nexstar Media Group]]).\n\nAfter it was announced that WFRV would join CBS, channel 2 then decided to take WFRV/WJMN's ABC affiliation; WBAY management insisted that the change take place on or near the anniversary of its sign-on date, March 17. Since that date fell on a Tuesday in 1992, WFRV and WBAY swapped networks on March 15, which fell on a Sunday.\n\nThe station formerly preempted the first hour of the ABC lineup (7-8 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]) on Tuesday evenings during the football season to carry the local program ''Tuesday Night Touchback'', which was formerly known as ''Monday Night Countdown'' before it was moved in 2007 because of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and the departure of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' from ABC (for most of the 2000s, the slot was among the lowest-rated on ABC's prime time schedule, as was the case with the pre-''MNF'' timeslot). Programs normally seen during that hour then aired later on early Wednesday morning after ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' during the football season. However, in November 2009, this was changed temporarily due to viewer feedback involving the pre-emption of the series premiere of ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'', which forced that program to be aired after the Saturday 10 p.m. newscast; for the remainder of November, ''V'' aired at 7 p.m., while ''Tuesday Night Touchback'' preempted ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' and aired before prime time in a truncated half-hour format. ''TNT'' has not aired since the 2011-12 season, and the station now airs ABC's Tuesday night's programming in pattern.\n\nWBAY was one of seven Young-owned stations whose management and operations were handled by [[Gray Television]] as part of a proposed takeover of Young Broadcasting by its secured creditors (a plan tentatively approved by a New York bankruptcy judge on July 22, 2009; it was approved in late April 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/451854-Gray_TV_Back_in_Business_With_Young_Stations.php|title=Gray TV Back in Business With Young Stations|publisher=}}</ref>). Under Gray management, this made it a semi-sister station in Wisconsin to [[NBC]] affiliates [[WMTV]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[WEAU-TV]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], and [[CBS]] affiliate [[WSAW-TV]] in [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]]. The Gray management agreement ended in 2012 as Young returned to some financial stability and the pursuit of a sale partner.\n\nIn late January 2010, the station stopped [[sign-on and sign-off|signing off]] during the early morning hours on Saturdays and Sundays, after a major transmitter problem forced the station to reconsider this mode of operation. WBAY was the last commercial station in the state to start broadcasting 24 hours a day daily, the former off-hours on WBAY's main signal are now taken up by a simulcast of WBAY-DT2.

The ownership transaction saw WBAY remove the Media General-mandated infotainment program ''Hollywood Today Live'' from their schedule (airing in late night on tape delay rather than in the mid-afternoon; the program was cancelled at the end of April) after March 3, along with Gray taking control of the station's website and mobile apps. With WBAY now having sister stations statewide, Gray began to distribute WBAY's Sunday night sports show, ''Sunday Sports Night: Cover 2'', to their other stations with the start of the [[2017 NFL season]].\n\nThe station sponsors the yearly \"WBAY Boat Show\" and the \"WBAY [[recreational vehicle|RV]] and [[Camping]] Show\", both held in the winter months, formerly at the [[Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena|Brown County Arena]]/[[Shopko]] Hall (which will move to the new [[Brown County Expo Center|expo center in 2021]]), along with a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] door-to-door food drive (\"[[Scouting for Food]]\") in the fall, and the market's [[Toys for Tots]] effort with the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve|Marine Corps Reserve]].\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until the November 2010 launch of WGBA's [[TheCoolTV]] (currently [[MeTV]]) subchannel, it was the only commercial station in the market to utilize any [[digital subchannel]] services.\n\nIn late June 2010, WBAY-TV became the third commercial station in Green Bay to air syndicated programming (previously only the ABC schedule and [[ESPN|ESPN HD]] broadcasts of ''Monday Night Football'') in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. WBAY-TV also began to produce some outside advertising for local businesses and internal station promos in both HD and [[16:9]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] in mid-2010.\n\nSince July 2013, the station uses the [[Active Format Description|AFD #10]] flag to present all programming in [[letterbox]]ed [[widescreen]] for viewers watching on [[cable television]] and over-the-air through traditional 4:3 sets, with the same done for 2.2. and 2.3 within the same year; a re-imaging in November 2015 saw the station's graphical image adjusted to meet this presentation mode. The 2.1 signal had a [[secondary audio program|SAP audio channel]] added in late September 2013, allowing the station to transmit [[audio description]] and [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish-language]] [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of ABC network programming, along with a 2017 upgrade to allow automated description of on-screen weather warning scrolls per new FCC rules.\n\n====First Alert Weather 24/7 (2.2)====\nWBAY operates '''First Alert Weather 24/7''' (formerly '''Stormcenter 2 24/7'''), a local weather channel that launched on August 7, 2005, and is carried on [[digital subchannel]] 2.2 and all local cable providers. The channel is produced in-house with no assistance from national services. It is fully [[automation|automated]], using the station's weather computers. 2.2 carried gavel-to-gavel coverage of [[Steven Avery]]'s murder trial daily throughout March 2007 in a rare break from format. The subchannel originally launched in the summer of 2004, carrying [[ABC News: Live|ABC News Now]]'s coverage of the [[2004 Republican National Convention|Republican]] and [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic conventions]], along with that year's [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election]].\n\nAn upgrade in early March 2012 streamlined the channel's presentation to the station's HD upgrade. [[Mills Fleet Farm]] began to sponsor Stormcenter 2 and 24/7. Mills Fleet Farm's sponsorship of Stormcenter 2 24/7 ended in March 2016, and the weather department is currently sponsored by local home improvement company Tundraland. On July 23, 2014, a further upgrade was completed which converted the presentation to a widescreen format, allowing all the station's weather graphics and local advertising to be presented in their native form on 2.2.\n\nThe \"24/7\" title has been an occasional [[misnomer]] over-the-air due to WBAY going [[dark (broadcasting)|off the air]] for 3\u00bd hours on early Saturday and Sunday mornings until the winter of 2010, but since February 2008 the subchannel is also streamed through the station's website and weather app 24 hours a day. The subchannel now simulcasts on 2.1 on early Saturday and Sunday mornings since WBAY converted to a daily 24-hour schedule. In late May 2015, the subchannel resumed carrying E/I programming weekdays at 6 p.m. (consisting of six episodes per week of ''[[Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures]]''), where newscasts air most evenings on the main channel; WBAY-DT3 had aired six hours of E/I programming a week since 2013 to allow 2.2 to be a 24/7 service. In 2017, that programming was moved to 4 p.m. weekdays. Changes in the FCC's E/I rules in September 2019 allowed the use of the E/I allotments on WBAY's other four subchannels to count towards their fulfillment, allowing 2.2 to return to a true 24/7 service. It was rebranded on-air as \"First Alert Weather 24/7\" on November 11, 2019; however, it is still referenced as StormCenter 2 by a few viewers.\n====Circle (2.3)====\n[[File:WBAY LWN Logo.png|125px|thumb|right|Logo for WBAY's Live Well Network.]]\n\n=====Previous history=====\nIn January 2008, the station launched a third digital subchannel, '''WBAY RTV''' (formerly \"RTN 2-3\"), which aired a customized schedule of [[Retro Television Network]] programming for much of its history to avoid any conflicts with shows seen on RTV that were carried on other Green Bay stations, though with the network's June 2011 restructuring and loss of program rights it carried RTV's default feed with little deviation. Because of the network's technical and internal contractual problems, the subchannel ran a [[station identification]] on-screen at all times in case RTV ran into technical difficulties due to the network's ownership transfer in January 2009 where identification was not done on the network level; RTV also erroneously identified themselves as being on WBAY-DT2, which was never rectified through their entire run on the station.\n\nOn February 6, 2012 at 4 a.m., RTV was replaced with a [[480i]] [[letterbox]]ed feed of the [[Live Well Network]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbay.com/story/16619010/wbay-tv-joins-the-live-well-network|title=WBAY-TV Joins the Live Well Network|date=January 27, 2012|publisher=Station press release|accessdate=January 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129234052/http://www.wbay.com/story/16619010/wbay-tv-joins-the-live-well-network|archive-date=January 29, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> as part of a group deal with the network and Young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/479562-Young_Broadcasting_Stations_Look_to_Live_Well.php|title=Young Broadcasting Stations Look to Live Well|publisher=}}</ref> The 24/7 ID was removed on this date due to station identification being inserted at the [[master control]] level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070824/GPG04/70824126/1978|title=GPG-Life&Style - Press Gazette Media - greenbaypressgazette.com|work=Press Gazette Media}}</ref> The station took heavy viewer criticism for replacing the network despite Retro TV having lost rights to spotlight programming in June 2011, and the near removal of the network from most of the Midwest due to other networks such as [[Antenna TV]] (carried by WLUK-DT2) and [[Me-TV]] (which is carried locally by WGBA-DT2) making carriage deals with former stations for the network; it no longer has any presence in Wisconsin. However, most transitions from Retro TV involved Antenna TV and MeTV, or a major netlet, without any issues, and at the time, RTV was rarely replaced by a lifestyle channel such as Live Well, as in this case.\n\nIn October 2013, Channel 2.3 was converted into a 16:9 widescreen presentation to fill the entire screen, as WBAY began to carry other college football games offered by ABC and ESPN on Saturday afternoons over 2.3 in addition to the main game offered by the network on 2.1, along with serving as the overflow channel for ''[[NBA on ABC]]'' coverage which in the past was fully preempted by the CP Telethon. In 2016 and 2017, WCWF carried the pre-empted NBA games to allow them to be carried on [[direct-broadcast satellite television|satellite]] and be presented in HD; since 2018, WBAY and ABC refer viewers to streaming those games via the [[WatchESPN|ESPN App]].\n\n=====Live Well Network=====\nOn January 9, 2015, the station announced that it would carry the new [[CBS]]/[[Weigel Broadcasting]] network [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]] as a replacement for the Live Well Network, which originally was to end operations in mid-January. During the interim period between WBAY's discontinuation of Live Well and the official launch of Decades on May 25, 2015, the station was to carry 'soft launch' of the network with [[Marathon (media)|marathon]] blocks of the network's series.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Web Archive: DECADES launches January 16 on WBAY-TV 2.3 |publisher=Station website |date=January 9, 2015 |url=http://wbay.com/2015/01/09/decades-launches-january-16-on-wbay-tv-2-3/ |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110030601/http://wbay.com/2015/01/09/decades-launches-january-16-on-wbay-tv-2-3/ |archivedate=January 10, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"WDJT\">{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/tvradio/tv-flashback-weigel-to-add-new-nostalgia-channel-in-milwaukee-b99424889z1-288430431.html|title=TV flashback: Weigel to add new nostalgia channel in Milwaukee|last=Foran|first=Chris|date=January 13, 2015|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 2015, ABCOTS made a last-minute announcement that the Live Well Network would continue for an additional two months with a revised program schedule to allow their affiliate and programs more time to find new programming and distributors; WBAY additionally decided to continue to carry Live Well indefinitely with the new revised schedule and delay the launch of Decades on 2.3, continuing to do so even after the network's official April 15 end date along with their other Young/Media General sister stations.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Live Well Network Lives On|publisher=Station website|date=January 13, 2015|url=http://wbay.com/2015/01/13/live-well-network-lives-on/|accessdate=January 14, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115011611/http://wbay.com/2015/01/13/live-well-network-lives-on/|archivedate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> The Live Well Network continued to air on WBAY-DT3, even as [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]] began to air on ABCOTS stations (Scripps subsequently placed that network on WGBA-DT3 locally).

This marked Ion's return to Green Bay for the first time since 2005, when [[WCWF]] (originally WPXG, later WIWB) discontinued carrying all programming from the network in overnight hours after the station was purchased from Paxson Communications in 1999 and converted to an affiliate of [[The WB]]. Viewers in the Green Bay market still had cable and satellite coverage of Ion's national feed in the 10-year interregnum. Due to duplication rules involving [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]'s Ion O&O [[WPXE-TV]] in the Milwaukee market and [[Antigo, Wisconsin|Antigo]]-licensed O&O [[WTPX-TV]] in the Wausau market, the carriage of WBAY's Ion subchannel was discontinued on some systems on the outer areas of the Green Bay market which have those stations available to them from Spectrum.\n=====2.6 from December 2019\u2013present=====\nOn December 2, 2019, a simulcast launched on WBAY-DT6, which became the network's permanent home on the WBAY channel lineup on December 16 to make way for Circle on WBAY-DT3.\n\n===Analog-to-digital conversion===\nWBAY-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate.

Currently the telethon is a local-only effort, using local broadcasters and people to host the broadcast, and the funds raised benefit the local organization, cerebral palsy, Inc.

The station currently exchanges news stories with [[Hearst Television]]'s [[WISN-TV]] in Milwaukee, in addition to airing that station's Wisconsin-focused [[Sunday morning talk show]], ''UpFront with Adrienne Pedersen''. Other sharing partners outside of its Gray sisters in Wisconsin are [[Quincy Newspapers]]' slate of ABC stations throughout the western part of the state, and [[Hubbard Broadcasting]]'s ABC stations in [[KSTP-TV|Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] and [[WDIO-DT|Duluth, Minnesota]]. The station utilizes the [[NEXRAD]] radar from the [[National Weather Service]] office just north of [[Austin Straubel International Airport]]. It formerly maintained an older self-owned Doppler unit until it mothballed the unit and removed its radar dome atop the station's downtown building in 2015.\n\n[[File:WBAY-TV News Logo.png|thumb|left|175px|WBAY's logo for \"Action 2 News\".]]\nWBAY's news operation is branded under the [[Action News]] title as ''Action 2 News'', and has used the title since the mid-1980s (with the ''HD'' suffix added upon its transition to high definition newscasts), predating its ABC affiliation. The station rarely refreshes its graphical imaging, having only done so three times since 1995, but has maintained long-term dominance in the local ratings for most of its history. Until September 2012, when WFRV debuted its 4 p.m. newscast, it was the only one in the market to have a late afternoon newscast in that timeslot. In late 2011, the station released mobile applications for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, followed by a separate weather app for both platforms in February 2013.\n\nBecause the station decided to maintain its noon newscast, WBAY-TV was among the few ABC affiliates that carried ''[[The Chew]]'' on a one-day delay (three days with the Friday edition) at 11 a.m. weekdays due to the network not offering an alternate feed for stations who wish to air the program at an earlier time, which was continued from a one-day delay on ''[[All My Children]]'' since 1992; this caused complaints among viewers, especially during the holidays when episodes timed to them aired after their occurrence, making the recipes presented in them superfluous. As of September 14, 2015, this was rectified, with ''The Chew'' moved to a same-day airing on tape at 2 p.m., and the delay will be maintained in September 2018 for the replacement show for ''The Chew'', ''[[Strahan, Sara and Keke|GMA3: Strahan, Sara and Keke]]''. The only times of year the station does not run a newscast are on [[Christmas]] morning, during the CP telethon, and the evening before [[Easter]] when ABC runs ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' yearly (due to the film presentation ending after midnight; a one-year shift to an 11 p.m. show was made in 2020 in order to provide up-to-date coverage about the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Wisconsin|coronavirus pandemic]]; two days later the station also added a special weeknight late night newscast from Gray, ''Full Court Press Now'', to their late night schedule).\n\nThe station began the process of upgrading to full HD production with a control room upgrade in the second quarter of 2011, a process hamstrung by the Young bankruptcy until Gray was able to begin operating the company's stations. The news department's conversion began on October 15 after that morning's newscast when construction began on a new set and the relocation of the older set (which had been in use with constant refreshing since the late 1980s) to another part of the building; the new set was completed by mid-December after a training/rehearsal period, using a common set design and graphics package that is used by all of the New Young stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/WBAY-TV-2|title=''Tomorrow, after Action 2 News This Morning-Weekend Edition, we will be dismantling this news set to make way for our HD improvements.

After all four local news operations established HD or widescreen presences, WBAY dropped the \"HD\" suffix from their brandings on June 2, 2014. On November 1, 2019, the station unveiled its first new slogan in decades, abandoning \"Coverage You Can Count On\" for the new tagline \"Your First Alert Station\" to tie into the [[push notification]]s sent from the station's news and weather [[mobile apps]]; likewise, weather is now branded as \"First Alert Weather\".\n\nAs of the fall of 2019, it also carries ''Full Court Press'', a national Sunday morning talk show from Gray featuring Appleton native [[Greta Van Susteren]], who regularly provides commentary to WBAY-TV regarding national and local politics as part of her role as the station group's chief national political analyst.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Rob Fowler (meteorologist)|Rob Fowler]] - meteorologist (1985-1987;

The station is owned by [[Gray Television]]. WBAY-TV's studios are located on South Jefferson Street in downtown Green Bay (across from the historic [[Brown County Courthouse (Wisconsin)|Brown County Courthouse]]), and its transmitter is located in [[Ledgeview, Wisconsin]] (shared with the transmitters of [[PBS Wisconsin]] station WPNE-TV and [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] station [[WPNE (FM)|WPNE]] (89.3 FM)).\n\n==History==\n[[File:WBAYTVMidwestRadioGreenBayWisconsinStudiosMay2007.jpg|thumb|left|Studios in 2007.]]\nWBAY-TV first signed on the air on March 17, 1953 as the second television station in Wisconsin, after [[WTMJ-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]]. It was originally owned by the [[Norbertine]] Order of Priests, whose abbey is in nearby [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]]. The priests run [[St. Norbert College]] in De Pere, and already operated WBAY radio (1360 AM, now [[WTAQ]]) in Green Bay and [[WHBY]] radio in [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. Like WTMJ when that station started in 1947, as the only station in the market, WBAY originally carried programming from all four networks of the day \u2013 channel 2 was a primary [[CBS]] affiliate with secondary affiliations with [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]].\n\nNBC moved to [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]]'s WMBV-TV (channel 11, now [[WLUK-TV]]) when it signed on in 1954, with WNAM-TV (channel 42, now [[WFRV-TV]] Channel 5) from [[Neenah, Wisconsin|Neenah]] taking the ABC affiliation upon its 1955 debut. With the shutdown of DuMont in 1956, WBAY was left as an exclusive CBS affiliate, and remained the only station licensed to Green Bay proper until the 1959 relocation of WLUK to the city. Channel 2 upgraded its transmitter and began broadcasting network programming in color around 1959; locally produced programs were broadcast in color starting in 1966.\n\nThe station's studios in downtown Green Bay were built in 1924 as a former [[Knights of Columbus]] clubhouse and later was turned into a private [[Roman Catholic]] [[high school]] during the [[Great Depression]] when the Norbertines took over the building. The former gymnasium/auditorium is now called the WBAY Auditorium and is used as the studio for the station's [[cerebral palsy]] [[telethon]]. During the early years of WBAY, it served as the main studio until 1954 when an addition was built behind the main building. The auditorium has also been used for local theatrical productions. The station's newsroom is in the basement of the building in an area that originally held a [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] pool and [[bowling]] alley. The WBAY building also served as the home of the WBAY radio stations (now WTAQ and [[WIXX]]), which were later purchased by [[Midwest Communications]] in the late 1970s, but remained in the building until Midwest built a combined Green Bay operations facility/company headquarters in 2007 and a news-weather sharing agreement was maintained between WBAY-TV and its former radio sisters for many years before it was discontinued in favor of an agreement with WLUK-TV.\n\nAs a CBS affiliate, WBAY-TV benefited from that network's [[NFL on CBS|coverage]] of [[National Football League]] games, primarily those of the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The station carried its first Packers game a few months after signing on, and continued to air most Packers games until 1991 by virtue of CBS holding the rights to the Packers' conference, the [[National Football Conference]] (for the 1992 and 1993 seasons, Packers games moved to WFRV when that station switched to CBS). Packers games drew up to a 90 percent share of the audience during the team's championship era of the 1960s under [[Vince Lombardi]] (including the team's first two Super Bowl triumphs in [[Super Bowl I]] and [[Super Bowl II]], the former of which was also carried by then-NBC affiliate WFRV), and the station carried the team's coaches' show ''The Vince Lombardi Show.'' The station also originated the team's exhibition game coverage from the 1960s to 2002, with some exceptions. Main anchor Bill Jartz has been [[Lambeau Field]]'s [[public address|PA system]] announcer since the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. The station continued to air ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' Packer games originating from [[ESPN]] beginning with the move of ''MNF'' to cable starting with the 2006 until the 2015 season. For the 2016 season, [[WLUK-TV]], the Packers' primary home by virtue of [[Fox NFL|Fox presently holding the rights to the NFC]], acquired the syndication rights to the ESPN games under a multi-year agreement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox11online.com/sports/packers-and-nfl/fox-11-to-air-hall-of-fame-game-packers-mnf-games|title=FOX 11 to air Hall of Fame Game, Packers MNF games|date=July 6, 2016|publisher=WLUK-TV|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> It was the first time that WBAY did not carry a Packers game during an NFL season in its 63-year history.\n\nIn 1974, WBAY was sold to [[Nationwide Communications]], which operated the station until 1993, when it was sold to [[Young Broadcasting]] along with its two ABC-affiliated sisters [[WATE-TV]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and [[WRIC-TV]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].\n\nIn 1991, CBS purchased the assets of Midwest Television to acquire its long-dominant affiliate in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], [[WCCO-TV]]. Midwest also owned channel 2's longtime competitor, WFRV. CBS considered WBAY a strong affiliate, and tried to sell WFRV and their [[Escanaba, Michigan]]-based satellite station, [[WJMN-TV]], after the deal with Midwest closed. However, after FCC rules were relaxed at the time to allow one company to own more stations, the network decided to keep the two stations as a result and switched WFRV/WJMN to CBS in 1992 (CBS sold WFRV/WJMN to [[Liberty Media]] in 2007, the stations are now owned by the [[Nexstar Media Group]]).\n\nAfter it was announced that WFRV would join CBS, channel 2 then decided to take WFRV/WJMN's ABC affiliation; WBAY management insisted that the change take place on or near the anniversary of its sign-on date, March 17. Since that date fell on a Tuesday in 1992, WFRV and WBAY swapped networks on March 15, which fell on a Sunday.\n\nThe station formerly preempted the first hour of the ABC lineup (7-8 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]) on Tuesday evenings during the football season to carry the local program ''Tuesday Night Touchback'', which was formerly known as ''Monday Night Countdown'' before it was moved in 2007 because of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and the departure of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' from ABC (for most of the 2000s, the slot was among the lowest-rated on ABC's prime time schedule, as was the case with the pre-''MNF'' timeslot). Programs normally seen during that hour then aired later on early Wednesday morning after ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' during the football season. However, in November 2009, this was changed temporarily due to viewer feedback involving the pre-emption of the series premiere of ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'', which forced that program to be aired after the Saturday 10 p.m. newscast; for the remainder of November, ''V'' aired at 7 p.m., while ''Tuesday Night Touchback'' preempted ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' and aired before prime time in a truncated half-hour format. ''TNT'' has not aired since the 2011-12 season, and the station now airs ABC's Tuesday night's programming in pattern.\n\nWBAY was one of seven Young-owned stations whose management and operations were handled by [[Gray Television]] as part of a proposed takeover of Young Broadcasting by its secured creditors (a plan tentatively approved by a New York bankruptcy judge on July 22, 2009; it was approved in late April 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/451854-Gray_TV_Back_in_Business_With_Young_Stations.php|title=Gray TV Back in Business With Young Stations|publisher=}}</ref>). Under Gray management, this made it a semi-sister station in Wisconsin to [[NBC]] affiliates [[WMTV]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[WEAU-TV]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], and [[CBS]] affiliate [[WSAW-TV]] in [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]]. The Gray management agreement ended in 2012 as Young returned to some financial stability and the pursuit of a sale partner.\n\nIn late January 2010, the station stopped [[sign-on and sign-off|signing off]] during the early morning hours on Saturdays and Sundays, after a major transmitter problem forced the station to reconsider this mode of operation. WBAY was the last commercial station in the state to start broadcasting 24 hours a day daily, the former off-hours on WBAY's main signal are now taken up by a simulcast of WBAY-DT2. On June 6, 2013, Young Broadcasting announced that it would merge with [[Media General]]. The sale was approved on November 8, and consummated on November 12.<ref name=tvnc-youngmgcomplete>{{cite news|title=Media General, Young Now Officially One|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/71928/media-general-young-now-officially-one|accessdate=November 12, 2013|newspaper=TVNewsCheck|date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> At that time it became both Media General's first station in Wisconsin and the Upper Midwest, and the company's northernmost asset.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, [[LIN Media]] entered into an agreement to merge with Media General in a $1.6 billion deal. Because LIN already owned Fox affiliate WLUK-TV and [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WCWF]] (channel 14), with WBAY and WLUK ranking among the four highest-rated stations in the Green Bay market in total day viewership, the companies were required to sell either WBAY or WLUK to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit [[local marketing agreement|sharing agreements]].<ref>[https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/tv-station-mega-merger-media-general-lin-set-1-6-billion-deal-1201141567/ TV Station Mega Merger: Media General, LIN Set $1.6 Billion Deal] from ''Variety'' (March 21, 2014)</ref><ref>[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-lin-media-general-merge-20140321,0,5277028.story Media General acquiring LIN Media for $1.6 billion], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 21, 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/74959/media-genlin-to-sellswap-in-five-markets Media Gen/LIN To Sell/Swap In Five Markets], ''TVNewsCheck'', March 21, 2014.</ref> On August 20, 2014, Media General announced that it would retain WBAY, trading WLUK and WCWF to [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] as part of several exchanges between other broadcast groups.<ref name=tvnc-wluksinclair>{{cite news|title=Media General, LIN Sell Stations In 5 Markets|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/78615/media-general-lin-sell-stations-in-5-markets|accessdate=August 20, 2014|work=TVNewsCheck|date=August 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn January 27, 2016, Media General announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]].<ref name=tvnc-mgnexstar>{{cite web|title=Nexstar-Media General: It's A Done Deal|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/91865/nexstarmedia-general-its-a-done-deal|website=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=January 27, 2016|date=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=nyt-mgnex>{{cite news|title=Nexstar Clinches Deal to Acquire Media General|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/business/dealbook/nexstar-clinches-deal-to-acquire-media-general.html?_r=0|accessdate=January 27, 2016|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Because Nexstar already owned WFRV, it was required to sell that station or WBAY to another owner, though with the financial outlay Nexstar had invested into WFRV since its 2011 purchase, a swap for WBAY was unlikely despite the latter's first-place market ranking.\n\nOn June 3, 2016, it was announced that Nexstar would retain WFRV, selling WBAY to [[Gray Television]] for $270 million; this time in addition to the original Gray stations in the 2010 management deal, WBAY also became a sister station to new [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WZAW-LD]] in Wausau and [[WLUC-TV]] in Marquette (which had been an on-and-off sister station to WLUK over the years), which Gray acquired more recently.<ref name=tvnc-graymc>{{cite web|title=Gray Buying Two Nexstar Spinoffs For $270M|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/95259/gray-buying-two-nexstar-spinoffs-for-270m|website=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=June 3, 2016|date=June 3, 2016}}</ref><ref name=bc-graymediageneral>{{cite news|first=Diana|last=Marszalek|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/gray-buys-nexstar-stations-green-bay-davenport/157035|title=Gray Buys Nexstar Stations in Green Bay, Davenport|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media]], [[limited liability company|LLC]]|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}</ref> The sale was closed on January 17, 2017, with a possible removal of WBAY on [[Dish Network]] due to Gray's previous [[retransmission consent]] deal ending averted with a renewal only hours later. The ownership transaction saw WBAY remove the Media General-mandated infotainment program ''Hollywood Today Live'' from their schedule (airing in late night on tape delay rather than in the mid-afternoon; the program was cancelled at the end of April) after March 3, along with Gray taking control of the station's website and mobile apps. With WBAY now having sister stations statewide, Gray began to distribute WBAY's Sunday night sports show, ''Sunday Sports Night: Cover 2'', to their other stations with the start of the [[2017 NFL season]].\n\nThe station sponsors the yearly \"WBAY Boat Show\" and the \"WBAY [[recreational vehicle|RV]] and [[Camping]] Show\", both held in the winter months, formerly at the [[Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena|Brown County Arena]]/[[Shopko]] Hall (which will move to the new [[Brown County Expo Center|expo center in 2021]]), along with a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] door-to-door food drive (\"[[Scouting for Food]]\") in the fall, and the market's [[Toys for Tots]] effort with the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve|Marine Corps Reserve]].\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until the November 2010 launch of WGBA's [[TheCoolTV]] (currently [[MeTV]]) subchannel, it was the only commercial station in the market to utilize any [[digital subchannel]] services.\n\nIn late June 2010, WBAY-TV became the third commercial station in Green Bay to air syndicated programming (previously only the ABC schedule and [[ESPN|ESPN HD]] broadcasts of ''Monday Night Football'') in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. WBAY-TV also began to produce some outside advertising for local businesses and internal station promos in both HD and [[16:9]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] in mid-2010.\n\nSince July 2013, the station uses the [[Active Format Description|AFD #10]] flag to present all programming in [[letterbox]]ed [[widescreen]] for viewers watching on [[cable television]] and over-the-air through traditional 4:3 sets, with the same done for 2.2. and 2.3 within the same year; a re-imaging in November 2015 saw the station's graphical image adjusted to meet this presentation mode. The 2.1 signal had a [[secondary audio program|SAP audio channel]] added in late September 2013, allowing the station to transmit [[audio description]] and [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish-language]] [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of ABC network programming, along with a 2017 upgrade to allow automated description of on-screen weather warning scrolls per new FCC rules.\n\n====First Alert Weather 24/7 (2.2)====\nWBAY operates '''First Alert Weather 24/7''' (formerly '''Stormcenter 2 24/7'''), a local weather channel that launched on August 7, 2005, and is carried on [[digital subchannel]] 2.2 and all local cable providers. The channel is produced in-house with no assistance from national services. It is fully [[automation|automated]], using the station's weather computers. 2.2 carried gavel-to-gavel coverage of [[Steven Avery]]'s murder trial daily throughout March 2007 in a rare break from format. The subchannel originally launched in the summer of 2004, carrying [[ABC News: Live|ABC News Now]]'s coverage of the [[2004 Republican National Convention|Republican]] and [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic conventions]], along with that year's [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election]].\n\nAn upgrade in early March 2012 streamlined the channel's presentation to the station's HD upgrade. [[Mills Fleet Farm]] began to sponsor Stormcenter 2 and 24/7. Mills Fleet Farm's sponsorship of Stormcenter 2 24/7 ended in March 2016, and the weather department is currently sponsored by local home improvement company Tundraland. On July 23, 2014, a further upgrade was completed which converted the presentation to a widescreen format, allowing all the station's weather graphics and local advertising to be presented in their native form on 2.2.\n\nThe \"24/7\" title has been an occasional [[misnomer]] over-the-air due to WBAY going [[dark (broadcasting)|off the air]] for 3\u00bd hours on early Saturday and Sunday mornings until the winter of 2010, but since February 2008 the subchannel is also streamed through the station's website and weather app 24 hours a day. The subchannel now simulcasts on 2.1 on early Saturday and Sunday mornings since WBAY converted to a daily 24-hour schedule. In late May 2015, the subchannel resumed carrying E/I programming weekdays at 6 p.m. (consisting of six episodes per week of ''[[Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures]]''), where newscasts air most evenings on the main channel; WBAY-DT3 had aired six hours of E/I programming a week since 2013 to allow 2.2 to be a 24/7 service. In 2017, that programming was moved to 4 p.m. weekdays. Changes in the FCC's E/I rules in September 2019 allowed the use of the E/I allotments on WBAY's other four subchannels to count towards their fulfillment, allowing 2.2 to return to a true 24/7 service. It was rebranded on-air as \"First Alert Weather 24/7\" on November 11, 2019; however, it is still referenced as StormCenter 2 by a few viewers.\n====Circle (2.3)====\n[[File:WBAY LWN Logo.png|125px|thumb|right|Logo for WBAY's Live Well Network.]]\n\n=====Previous history=====\nIn January 2008, the station launched a third digital subchannel, '''WBAY RTV''' (formerly \"RTN 2-3\"), which aired a customized schedule of [[Retro Television Network]] programming for much of its history to avoid any conflicts with shows seen on RTV that were carried on other Green Bay stations, though with the network's June 2011 restructuring and loss of program rights it carried RTV's default feed with little deviation. Because of the network's technical and internal contractual problems, the subchannel ran a [[station identification]] on-screen at all times in case RTV ran into technical difficulties due to the network's ownership transfer in January 2009 where identification was not done on the network level; RTV also erroneously identified themselves as being on WBAY-DT2, which was never rectified through their entire run on the station.\n\nOn February 6, 2012 at 4 a.m., RTV was replaced with a [[480i]] [[letterbox]]ed feed of the [[Live Well Network]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbay.com/story/16619010/wbay-tv-joins-the-live-well-network|title=WBAY-TV Joins the Live Well Network|date=January 27, 2012|publisher=Station press release|accessdate=January 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129234052/http://www.wbay.com/story/16619010/wbay-tv-joins-the-live-well-network|archive-date=January 29, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> as part of a group deal with the network and Young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/479562-Young_Broadcasting_Stations_Look_to_Live_Well.php|title=Young Broadcasting Stations Look to Live Well|publisher=}}</ref> The 24/7 ID was removed on this date due to station identification being inserted at the [[master control]] level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070824/GPG04/70824126/1978|title=GPG-Life&Style - Press Gazette Media - greenbaypressgazette.com|work=Press Gazette Media}}</ref> The station took heavy viewer criticism for replacing the network despite Retro TV having lost rights to spotlight programming in June 2011, and the near removal of the network from most of the Midwest due to other networks such as [[Antenna TV]] (carried by WLUK-DT2) and [[Me-TV]] (which is carried locally by WGBA-DT2) making carriage deals with former stations for the network; it no longer has any presence in Wisconsin. However, most transitions from Retro TV involved Antenna TV and MeTV, or a major netlet, without any issues, and at the time, RTV was rarely replaced by a lifestyle channel such as Live Well, as in this case.\n\nIn October 2013, Channel 2.3 was converted into a 16:9 widescreen presentation to fill the entire screen, as WBAY began to carry other college football games offered by ABC and ESPN on Saturday afternoons over 2.3 in addition to the main game offered by the network on 2.1, along with serving as the overflow channel for ''[[NBA on ABC]]'' coverage which in the past was fully preempted by the CP Telethon. In 2016 and 2017, WCWF carried the pre-empted NBA games to allow them to be carried on [[direct-broadcast satellite television|satellite]] and be presented in HD; since 2018, WBAY and ABC refer viewers to streaming those games via the [[WatchESPN|ESPN App]].\n\n=====Live Well Network=====\nOn January 9, 2015, the station announced that it would carry the new [[CBS]]/[[Weigel Broadcasting]] network [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]] as a replacement for the Live Well Network, which originally was to end operations in mid-January. During the interim period between WBAY's discontinuation of Live Well and the official launch of Decades on May 25, 2015, the station was to carry 'soft launch' of the network with [[Marathon (media)|marathon]] blocks of the network's series.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Web Archive: DECADES launches January 16 on WBAY-TV 2.3 |publisher=Station website |date=January 9, 2015 |url=http://wbay.com/2015/01/09/decades-launches-january-16-on-wbay-tv-2-3/ |accessdate=January 10, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110030601/http://wbay.com/2015/01/09/decades-launches-january-16-on-wbay-tv-2-3/ |archivedate=January 10, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"WDJT\">{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/tvradio/tv-flashback-weigel-to-add-new-nostalgia-channel-in-milwaukee-b99424889z1-288430431.html|title=TV flashback: Weigel to add new nostalgia channel in Milwaukee|last=Foran|first=Chris|date=January 13, 2015|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 2015, ABCOTS made a last-minute announcement that the Live Well Network would continue for an additional two months with a revised program schedule to allow their affiliate and programs more time to find new programming and distributors; WBAY additionally decided to continue to carry Live Well indefinitely with the new revised schedule and delay the launch of Decades on 2.3, continuing to do so even after the network's official April 15 end date along with their other Young/Media General sister stations.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Live Well Network Lives On|publisher=Station website|date=January 13, 2015|url=http://wbay.com/2015/01/13/live-well-network-lives-on/|accessdate=January 14, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115011611/http://wbay.com/2015/01/13/live-well-network-lives-on/|archivedate=January 15, 2015}}</ref> The Live Well Network continued to air on WBAY-DT3, even as [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]] began to air on ABCOTS stations (Scripps subsequently placed that network on WGBA-DT3 locally).

This marked Ion's return to Green Bay for the first time since 2005, when [[WCWF]] (originally WPXG, later WIWB) discontinued carrying all programming from the network in overnight hours after the station was purchased from Paxson Communications in 1999 and converted to an affiliate of [[The WB]]. Viewers in the Green Bay market still had cable and satellite coverage of Ion's national feed in the 10-year interregnum. Due to duplication rules involving [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]'s Ion O&O [[WPXE-TV]] in the Milwaukee market and [[Antigo, Wisconsin|Antigo]]-licensed O&O [[WTPX-TV]] in the Wausau market, the carriage of WBAY's Ion subchannel was discontinued on some systems on the outer areas of the Green Bay market which have those stations available to them from Spectrum.\n=====2.6 from December 2019\u2013present=====\nOn December 2, 2019, a simulcast launched on WBAY-DT6, which became the network's permanent home on the WBAY channel lineup on December 16 to make way for Circle on WBAY-DT3.\n\n===Analog-to-digital conversion===\nWBAY-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate.

The telethon airs for 22 hours from 8 p.m. Saturday to 6 p.m. Sunday the first weekend in March although prior to WBAY switching to 24-hour daily broadcasts in 2010, it broke between midnight and 6 a.m., as the station signed off in the overnight hours on weekends (the break allows WBAY's Saturday syndicated programming to air without interruption). Past hosts of the telethon have included [[Gloria DeHaven]], [[Raymond Burr]], [[Dennis James]] (who would later host the [[United Cerebral Palsy]] national telethon), [[Dennis Weaver]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Jason R.|title=I will sing my songs again : the inconceivable life story of Ronnie Fuller|date=2004|publisher=iUniverse|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0595313272|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YtWTEAd9CeUC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=cerebral+palsy+telethon+wbay#v=onepage&q=cerebral%20palsy%20telethon%20wbay&f=false}}</ref> and [[Tom Wopat]]. Currently the telethon is a local-only effort, using local broadcasters and people to host the broadcast, and the funds raised benefit the local organization, cerebral palsy, Inc. Before the sale of the WBAY stations by the Norbertine Fathers, the telethon was [[simulcast]] over WBAY (AM) (later WGEE, now [[WTAQ]]) and WBAY-FM (now [[WIXX]]).\n\nWBAY's cerebral palsy telethon both pre-dated and succeeded the national telethon for United cerebral palsy, which ran on numerous stations nationwide from the mid-1970s to 1997.\n\n===Sunday Mass===\nThe station continues to air a [[Sunday Mass]] on Sunday mornings, as it has since signing on under the ownership of the Norbertine Fathers. After the sale of the station from them however, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay]] began producing the Mass at WBAY's studio. The Diocese provided a presider, [[choir]], liturgical coordinator, and producer while WBAY provided camera operators, a [[technical director]] and audio technician.\n\nOn December 27, 2009, the Diocese of Green Bay ended local production of the Mass, instead choosing to contract with the [http://thesundaymass.org/ Passionist Spiritual Center] to carry their nationally syndicated Mass program from [[Riverhead, New York]] by mutual agreement of the station and the Diocese, a transition that was planned two years before and took priority after the September 2009 death of the Diocese's communications director and Mass producer Tony Kuick.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thecompassnews.org/2009/12/diocese-will-no-longer-produce-tv-masses/|title=Diocese will no longer produce TV Masses; Televised Masses will now be produced by Passionist Communications|date=December 16, 2009|publisher=The Compass, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay]]|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n{{expand section|further information on the history of WBAY's news department|date = November 2010}}\nWBAY-TV presently broadcasts 31 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5 hours on weekdays and 3 hours on weekends), along with a half-hour sports-focused extension of the Sunday late news known as ''Sunday Sports Night: Cover 2'' in football season (as mentioned above, that program airs statewide on Gray's stations as of September 2017). The station currently exchanges news stories with [[Hearst Television]]'s [[WISN-TV]] in Milwaukee, in addition to airing that station's Wisconsin-focused [[Sunday morning talk show]], ''UpFront with Adrienne Pedersen''. Other sharing partners outside of its Gray sisters in Wisconsin are [[Quincy Newspapers]]' slate of ABC stations throughout the western part of the state, and [[Hubbard Broadcasting]]'s ABC stations in [[KSTP-TV|Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] and [[WDIO-DT|Duluth, Minnesota]]. The station utilizes the [[NEXRAD]] radar from the [[National Weather Service]] office just north of [[Austin Straubel International Airport]]. It formerly maintained an older self-owned Doppler unit until it mothballed the unit and removed its radar dome atop the station's downtown building in 2015.\n\n[[File:WBAY-TV News Logo.png|thumb|left|175px|WBAY's logo for \"Action 2 News\".]]\nWBAY's news operation is branded under the [[Action News]] title as ''Action 2 News'', and has used the title since the mid-1980s (with the ''HD'' suffix added upon its transition to high definition newscasts), predating its ABC affiliation. The station rarely refreshes its graphical imaging, having only done so three times since 1995, but has maintained long-term dominance in the local ratings for most of its history. Until September 2012, when WFRV debuted its 4 p.m. newscast, it was the only one in the market to have a late afternoon newscast in that timeslot. In late 2011, the station released mobile applications for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, followed by a separate weather app for both platforms in February 2013.\n\nBecause the station decided to maintain its noon newscast, WBAY-TV was among the few ABC affiliates that carried ''[[The Chew]]'' on a one-day delay (three days with the Friday edition) at 11 a.m. weekdays due to the network not offering an alternate feed for stations who wish to air the program at an earlier time, which was continued from a one-day delay on ''[[All My Children]]'' since 1992; this caused complaints among viewers, especially during the holidays when episodes timed to them aired after their occurrence, making the recipes presented in them superfluous. As of September 14, 2015, this was rectified, with ''The Chew'' moved to a same-day airing on tape at 2 p.m., and the delay will be maintained in September 2018 for the replacement show for ''The Chew'', ''[[Strahan, Sara and Keke|GMA3: Strahan, Sara and Keke]]''. The only times of year the station does not run a newscast are on [[Christmas]] morning, during the CP telethon, and the evening before [[Easter]] when ABC runs ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' yearly (due to the film presentation ending after midnight).\n\nThe station began the process of upgrading to full HD production with a control room upgrade in the second quarter of 2011, a process hamstrung by the Young bankruptcy until Gray was able to begin operating the company's stations. The news department's conversion began on October 15 after that morning's newscast when construction began on a new set and the relocation of the older set (which had been in use with constant refreshing since the late 1980s) to another part of the building; the new set was completed by mid-December after a training/rehearsal period, using a common set design and graphics package that is used by all of the New Young stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/WBAY-TV-2|title=''Tomorrow, after Action 2 News This Morning-Weekend Edition, we will be dismantling this news set to make way for our HD improvements.

This supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry.  The sourcing of play-by-mail games in this list largely comes from these magazines, whether from reviews or advertisements, as well as additional magazines such as ''[[Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]'', ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]'', and other publications that serviced the gaming community broadly, resuming with the contemporary online magazine ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'', which supports the small but active play-by-mail gaming community today.\n\nIn some cases, more than one publisher can be found for the same game on the list. This is because the rights to play-by-mail games were occasionally sold among publishers.{{efn|For example, in 1993, play-by-mail gaming company [[Schubel & Sons]] sold all games and licenses to Northwest Simulations.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 27|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} In other cases, games were licensed from the publishing company, which might be then moderated by a different company\u2014potentially even translated and played in a different country.{{efn|For example, in the March/April 1993 issue of ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' magazine, Prime Time Simulations announced that its play-by-mail game [[World Conquest (play-by-mail game)|''World Conquest'']] was licensed to multiple companies in Europe and was available in English, French, German, Dutch, and Italian.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 25|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} Many more play-by-mail games existed in nascent, playtest form than there are on this list. Only games which completed playtesting and were released for play are included here as a \"published\" game. This list includes games that are (or were) played only by [[postal mail]], as well as those which had a play-by-email option, as well as games that are played in a turn-based play-by-email (PBEM) format. Additionally, this list includes games which are no longer available for play as well as games that are still active. Game durations range from those which were only briefly available for play, such as ''Quest of Gorr'',<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Scheid|first= J.

Other publishers followed suit, with significant expansion across the industry in the 1980s. This supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications such as ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'', and [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry.  The sourcing of play-by-mail games in this list largely comes from these magazines, whether from reviews or advertisements, as well as additional magazines such as ''[[Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer]]'', ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]'', and other publications that serviced the gaming community broadly, resuming with the contemporary online magazine ''[[Suspense and Decision]]'', which supports the small but active play-by-mail gaming community today.\n\nIn some cases, more than one publisher can be found for the same game on the list. This is because the rights to play-by-mail games were occasionally sold among publishers.{{efn|For example, in 1993, play-by-mail gaming company [[Schubel & Sons]] sold all games and licenses to Northwest Simulations.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 27|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} In other cases, games were licensed from the publishing company, which might be then moderated by a different company\u2014potentially even translated and played in a different country.{{efn|For example, in the March/April 1993 issue of ''[[Paper Mayhem]]'' magazine, Prime Time Simulations announced that its play-by-mail game [[World Conquest (play-by-mail game)|''World Conquest'']] was licensed to multiple companies in Europe and was available in English, French, German, Dutch, and Italian.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Gameline |url= |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]]|location= |publisher= The Paper Mayhem Association |issue= 59|page= 25|date= March\u2013April 1993|access-date= }}</ref>}} Many more play-by-mail games existed in nascent, playtest form than there are on this list. Only games which completed playtesting and were released for play are included here as a \"published\" game. This list includes games that are (or were) played only by [[postal mail]], as well as those which had a play-by-email option, as well as games that are played in a turn-based play-by-email (PBEM) format.

Flores testified at the 2009 hearing that based on his own review of the scene and a discussion with the medical examiner, it was apparent that Alexander had been shot in the forehead first. Contrary to Flores' testimony at the 2009 hearing, the medical examiner told jurors the gunshot probably would have incapacitated Alexander. Given his extensive defense wounds, including stab marks and slashes to his hands, arms and legs, it was not likely the shot came first. Flores denied perjury and said during his trial testimony that he just misunderstood what the medical examiner told him.<ref name=\"ap_may29\"/>\n\nIn April, the defense claimed the prosecutor had acted inappropriately and said the case resembled a modern-day equivalent to the [[Salem witch trials]]. In the motion the defense team contended \"the [[prosecutorial misconduct]] has infested these proceedings with a level of unfairness that cannot be cured by any other means.\" The motion also stated there is a \"circus-like atmosphere inside the courtroom\" and that Martinez had yelled at witnesses, attacked witnesses on a personal level, and had thrown evidence. The motion also alleged that Martinez chose to release evidence and to pose for pictures with his fans on the steps of the courthouse. The attorneys claimed Arias was in a position in which she could not present a complete defense and that the only constitutional course was to declare a mistrial.\n\nOn May 20, 2013, defense attorneys filed motion which alleged that a defense witness who had been due to testify the preceding Friday, the 17th, began receiving [[death threat]]s for her scheduled testimony on Arias' behalf. The day before the filing, the witness contacted counsel for Arias, stating that she was no longer willing to testify because of the threats. The motion continued, \"It should also be noted that these threats follow those made to Alyce LaViolette, a record of which was made ex-parte and under seal.\" The motion was denied, as was a motion for a stay in the proceedings that had been sought to give time to appeal the decisions to the [[Arizona Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/20130520jodi-arias-witness-withdraws-because-death-threats.html|title=Jodi Arias witness withdraws because of death threats|work=The Arizona Republic }}</ref>\n\nOn May 29, 2013, the Arizona Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal filed three months earlier, also refused by the mid-level [[Arizona Court of Appeals]]. Nurmi had asked the high court to throw out the aggravating factor of cruelty because the judge had allowed it to go forward based on a different theory of how the murder occurred. The lead detective originally claimed that the gunshot occurred first, followed by the stabbing and slitting of the throat. Based on that theory, Stephens ruled there was probable cause to find the crime had been committed in an especially cruel manner, an aggravating factor under state law. Subsequent to this initial hearing, the medical examiner testified that the gunshot occurred postmortem.<ref name=\"ap_may29\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/Jodi-Arias-case-Arizona-Supreme-Court-denies-review-in-Valley-murder-case|title=Jodi Arias: Arizona Supreme Court denies review in Valley murder case|agency=Associated Press|access-date=2013-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607120817/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/Jodi-Arias-case-Arizona-Supreme-Court-denies-review-in-Valley-murder-case|archive-date=2013-06-07|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/jodi-arias-denied-case-re_n_3355882.html|title=Jodi Arias Denied Case Review By Arizona Supreme Court|work=HuffPost|date=May 29, 2013|access-date=May 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530141733/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/29/jodi-arias-denied-case-re_n_3355882.html|archive-date=May 30, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn July 6, 2018, Arias' current attorneys, Margaret M.

Flores testified at the 2009 hearing that based on his own review of the scene and a discussion with the medical examiner, it was apparent that Alexander had been shot in the forehead first. Contrary to Flores' testimony at the 2009 hearing, the medical examiner told jurors the gunshot probably would have incapacitated Alexander. Given his extensive defense wounds, including stab marks and slashes to his hands, arms and legs, it was not likely the shot came first. Flores denied perjury and said during his trial testimony that he just misunderstood what the medical examiner told him.<ref name=\"ap_may29\"/>\n\nIn April, the defense claimed the prosecutor had acted inappropriately and said the case resembled a modern-day equivalent to the [[Salem witch trials]]. In the motion the defense team contended \"the [[prosecutorial misconduct]] has infested these proceedings with a level of unfairness that cannot be cured by any other means.\" The motion also stated there is a \"circus-like atmosphere inside the courtroom\" and that Martinez had yelled at witnesses, attacked witnesses on a personal level, and had thrown evidence. The motion also alleged that Martinez chose to release evidence and to pose for pictures with his fans on the steps of the courthouse. The attorneys claimed Arias was in a position in which she could not present a complete defense and that the only constitutional course was to declare a mistrial.\n\nOn May 20, 2013, defense attorneys filed motion which alleged that a defense witness who had been due to testify the preceding Friday, the 17th, began receiving [[death threat]]s for her scheduled testimony on Arias' behalf. The day before the filing, the witness contacted counsel for Arias, stating that she was no longer willing to testify because of the threats. The motion continued, \"It should also be noted that these threats follow those made to Alyce LaViolette, a record of which was made ex-parte and under seal.\" The motion was denied, as was a motion for a stay in the proceedings that had been sought to give time to appeal the decisions to the [[Arizona Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/20130520jodi-arias-witness-withdraws-because-death-threats.html|title=Jodi Arias witness withdraws because of death threats|work=The Arizona Republic }}</ref>\n\nOn May 29, 2013, the Arizona Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal filed three months earlier, also refused by the mid-level [[Arizona Court of Appeals]].

The lead detective originally claimed that the gunshot occurred first, followed by the stabbing and slitting of the throat. Based on that theory, Stephens ruled there was probable cause to find the crime had been committed in an especially cruel manner, an aggravating factor under state law.

{"title_page": "Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony", "text_new": "[[File:Kitano Grand Tea Gathering monument.jpg|thumb|Grand Kitano Tea Gathering monument at Kitano Tenmangu shrine, Kyoto]]\nThe '''Grand Kitano Tea Ceremony''' (Japanese: \u5317\u91ce\u5927\u8336\u6e6f; ''Kitano \u014dchanoyu''), also known in English as the Grand Kitano Tea Gathering, was a large [[Japanese tea ceremony]] event that was hosted by the regent and chancellor [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] at [[Kitano Tenmang\u016b]] shrine in Kyoto on the first day of the tenth month in the year [[Tensh\u014d (Momoyama period)|Tensh\u014d]] 15 (1587). Japanese cultural historians view it as a major cultural event of the [[Momoyama period]]. Louise Cort points out these three reasons: The event was \"a key move in Hideyoshi's strategy to prove his cultural legitimacy; a turning point in the development of chanoyu style and theory; and a crisis in the personal relationship between its chief designers, two of the most influential figures of the Momoyama period, Hideyoshi and [[Sen no Riky\u016b]]\".<ref>Cort, Louise. \"The Grand Kitano Tea Gathering,\" Chanoyu Quarterly, no. 31 (Urasenke Foundation, Kyoto, 1982: {{ISSN|0009-1537}}), p. 15.</ref>\n\n== Historical background ==\nToyotomi Hideyoshi, a warrior of humble background who rose to eventually become the national ruler, recognized cultural knowledge to be as important an attribute of leadership as military might and took up the practice of chanoyu as a means of demonstrating his cultivation. This had been the same with aspiring rulers before him, such as [[Oda Nobunaga]] in particular, whom Hideyoshi succeeded in the campaign to reunify the country after the fall of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]]. To further enhance their image as legitimate rulers, Nobunaga and Hideyoshi after him sought to acquire works of art that had belonged to the Ashikaga sh\u014dguns. Nobunaga acquired some of those treasures as tokens of allegiance from warlords and merchants with whom he had formed political alliances. Others he ordered confiscated from their owners, often men whom he had defeated on the battlefield.<ref>Guth, Christine M.E., ''Art, Tea, and Industry: Masuda Takashi and the Mitsui Circle'', chapter 2, \"Art Collecting and Chanoyu,\" pp. 49-50. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Uni. Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-691-03206-8}})</ref> Nobunaga furthermore made use of \nchanoyu as his \"way of politics\" (''chanoyu goseid\u014d'') in his relationships with his military commanders. This was by prohibiting them from practicing chanoyu without his permission, and giving them esteemed art works for use in chanoyu as rewards for distinguished service.<ref>Murai, Yasuhiko. \"Biography of Sen Riky\u016b,\" pp. 28-29, in Chanoyu Quarterly no. 61. (Urasenke Foundation, Kyoto: 1990)</ref>\n\nAfter the dramatic death of Nobunaga in the summer of 1582 at [[Honn\u014d-ji Incident|Honn\u014d-ji]] temple, Kyoto, Hideyoshi within days had seized political initiative. He continued the course set by Nobunaga and, with respect to chanoyu, he took possession of Nobunaga's cherished art works for chanoyu use, symbols of his new wealth and culture.<ref>Kumakura, Isao. \"Sen no Riky\u016b: Inquiries into His Life and Tea\", in Varley, Paul and Kumakura, Isao (eds.), ''Tea in Japan: Essays on the History of Chanoyu'', pp. 34-35. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1989. ISBN 0-8248-1218-2.</ref> Later that year, he announced to Nobunaga's three chief chanoyu advisors -- Riky\u016b, [[Tsuda S\u014dgy\u016b]], and [[Imai S\u014dky\u016b]] -- his intention of enlisting them in his own service.<ref>Cort, Louise. p. 20.</ref> \n  \nThe Grand Kitano Tea Gathering was one of the many extravaganzas staged by Hideyoshi as part of his quest for legitimacy through cultural authority.<ref>Guth, Christine M.E., p. 69.</ref> In 1583, he marked the opening of his newly completed Osaka Castle with a volley of ceremonies that lasted days and brought together both tea men and warlords. The visiting generals at that event followed custom by presenting him with art works for chanoyu use. On the 5th day of the 3rd month in 1585, he held a mammoth event at [[Daitoku-ji]], heartland of Zen power in the capital and training ground for many men who became lay monks as part of their chanoyu practice. The participants included twenty-five chanoyu practitioners from Sakai, fifty merchants from Kyoto, the monks of the temple, and Hideyoshi's commanders and allies. As the focal point of the event, Hideyoshi set up a display of his collection within the abbot's quarters of [[S\u014dken-in]], the subtemple which he himself had had built to commemorate Nobunaga's family. In the 5th month of 1587, Hideyoshi was victorious in his campaign against one of his last undefeated opponents, [[Shimazu Yoshihisa]], who had dominated most of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Hideyoshi had the support of the wealthy merchant, Kamiya S\u014dtan, and other prominent merchants in the port city of Hakata, and after his victory on the battlefield, he returned to Hakata, where he celebrated with a round of tea gatherings hosted by those influential merchants. The site for these tea gatherings was the seaside pine grove at Hakozaki. Then, just two weeks after his triumphant arrival back in Osaka, the notices went out announcing the Grand Kitano Tea Gathering.<ref>Cort, Louise. pp. 23-25.</ref> \n\nIt is especially notable that this grand event was intended to be impartial to social rank or wealth, and, together with Hideyoshi's own chanoyu venue, venues hosted by the three great chanoyu masters in Hideyoshi's service, who all were of the influential merchant class in the politically crucial city of Sakai, were designed as the special attractions.<ref>''Genshoku Chad\u014d Daijiten'' (\u539f\u8272\u8336\u9053\u5927\u8f9e\u5178; Color-illustrated Chad\u014d Encyclopedia) entry, \"Kitano Daichakai\".

Japanese cultural historians view it as a major cultural event of the [[Momoyama period]]. Louise Cort points out these three reasons: The event was \"a key move in Hideyoshi's strategy to prove his cultural legitimacy; a turning point in the development of chanoyu style and theory; and a crisis in the personal relationship between its chief designers, two of the most influential figures of the Momoyama period, Hideyoshi and [[Sen no Riky\u016b]]\".<ref>Cort, Louise. \"The Grand Kitano Tea Gathering,\" Chanoyu Quarterly, no. 31 (Urasenke Foundation, Kyoto, 1982: {{ISSN|0009-1537}}), p. 15.</ref>\n\n== Historical background ==\nToyotomi Hideyoshi, a warrior of humble background who rose to eventually become the national ruler, recognized cultural knowledge to be as important an attribute of leadership as military might and took up the practice of chanoyu as a means of demonstrating his cultivation. This had been the same with aspiring rulers before him, such as [[Oda Nobunaga]] in particular, whom Hideyoshi succeeded in the campaign to reunify the country after the fall of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]]. To further enhance their image as legitimate rulers, Nobunaga and Hideyoshi after him sought to acquire works of art that had belonged to the Ashikaga sh\u014dguns. Nobunaga acquired some of those treasures as tokens of allegiance from warlords and merchants with whom he had formed political alliances. Others he ordered confiscated from their owners, often men whom he had defeated on the battlefield.<ref>Guth, Christine M.E., ''Art, Tea, and Industry: Masuda Takashi and the Mitsui Circle'', chapter 2, \"Art Collecting and Chanoyu,\" pp. 49-50. (Princeton Uni. Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-691-03206-8}})</ref> Nobunaga furthermore made use of \nchanoyu as his \"way of politics\" (''chanoyu goseid\u014d'') in his relationships with his military commanders. This was by prohibiting them from practicing chanoyu without his permission, and giving them esteemed art works for use in chanoyu as rewards for distinguished service.<ref>Murai, Yasuhiko. \"Biography of Sen Riky\u016b,\" pp. 28-29, in Chanoyu Quarterly no. 61. (Urasenke Foundation, Kyoto: 1990)</ref>\n\nAfter the dramatic death of Nobunaga in the summer of 1582 at [[Honn\u014d-ji Incident|Honn\u014d-ji]] temple, Kyoto, Hideyoshi within days had seized political initiative. He continued the course set by Nobunaga and, with respect to chanoyu, he took possession of Nobunaga's cherished art works for chanoyu use, symbols of his new wealth and culture.<ref>Kumakura, Isao. \"Sen no Riky\u016b: Inquiries into His Life and Tea\", in Varley, Paul and Kumakura, Isao (eds.), ''Tea in Japan: Essays on the History of Chanoyu'', pp. 34-35.

ISBN 0-8248-1218-2.</ref> Later that year, he announced to Nobunaga's three chief chanoyu advisors -- Riky\u016b, [[Tsuda S\u014dgy\u016b]], and [[Imai S\u014dky\u016b]] -- his intention of enlisting them in his own service.<ref>Cort, Louise. p. 20.</ref> \n  \nThe Grand Kitano Tea Gathering was one of the many extravaganzas staged by Hideyoshi as part of his quest for legitimacy through cultural authority.<ref>Guth, Christine M.E., p. 69.</ref> In 1583, he marked the opening of his newly completed Osaka Castle with a volley of ceremonies that lasted days and brought together both tea men and warlords. The visiting generals at that event followed custom by presenting him with art works for chanoyu use. On the 5th day of the 3rd month in 1585, he held a mammoth event at [[Daitoku-ji]], heartland of Zen power in the capital and training ground for many men who became lay monks as part of their chanoyu practice. The participants included twenty-five chanoyu practitioners from Sakai, fifty merchants from Kyoto, the monks of the temple, and Hideyoshi's commanders and allies. As the focal point of the event, Hideyoshi set up a display of his collection within the abbot's quarters of [[S\u014dken-in]], the subtemple which he himself had had built to commemorate Nobunaga's family. In the 5th month of 1587, Hideyoshi was victorious in his campaign against one of his last undefeated opponents, [[Shimazu Yoshihisa]], who had dominated most of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Hideyoshi had the support of the wealthy merchant, Kamiya S\u014dtan, and other prominent merchants in the port city of Hakata, and after his victory on the battlefield, he returned to Hakata, where he celebrated with a round of tea gatherings hosted by those influential merchants. The site for these tea gatherings was the seaside pine grove at Hakozaki. Then, just two weeks after his triumphant arrival back in Osaka, the notices went out announcing the Grand Kitano Tea Gathering.<ref>Cort, Louise. pp. 23-25.</ref> \n\nIt is especially notable that this grand event was intended to be impartial to social rank or wealth, and, together with Hideyoshi's own chanoyu venue, venues hosted by the three great chanoyu masters in Hideyoshi's service, who all were of the influential merchant class in the politically crucial city of Sakai, were designed as the special attractions.<ref>''Genshoku Chad\u014d Daijiten'' (Color-illustrated Chad\u014d Encyclopedia) entry, \"Kitano Daichakai\".
