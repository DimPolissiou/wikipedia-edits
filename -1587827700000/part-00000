{"title_page": "Anne de Chantraine", "text_new": "{{cleanup|reason=Needs to be properly wiki-formated|date=April 2020}}\n'''Anne de Chantraine''' ( March 19 1601 \u2013 18 October 1622) was one of the many people to be accused and burned for witchcraft in the Great Witch Hunts of the 17th century. At the age of 21 she was burned at the stake for witchcraft in the village of Waret-la-Chaussee in Belgium France. Just before being burned she was strangled by the executioner. <ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref>\n\n==Trial of Anne de Chantraine==\n\n===26 March 1620===\nThe sergeant of the court of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e arrested a young lady called Anne de Chantraine; she was 19 years old, she had come to live in the village with her father and was reputed to be a witch. Anne was a very beautiful girl, she has long red hair, people associated her hair with the flames of hell. There has been a lot of things going on in the village. The crops have been failing, the cows were not giving milk and the hens were laying sterile eggs, all this was deemed to be the workings of witchcraft. The person who denounced Anne a witch was none other than her neighbour, whose advances she refused. \n\nOn March 28, 1620, the accused was examined informally. She was brought before the mayor, Thomas Douclet, and the aldermen of the district. Fearing the instruments of the master of high works, she avoided torture by confessing freely to being a witch. She then made the most brazen avowals. \n\nBorn on March 19, 1601. in the town of Liege, to a traveling merchant father, her mother died when Anne was only 1 years old. Not long after the death of her mother, Anne's father placed her in the hospital of saint jean the Baptist in liege. Little Anne resided at the hospital for fifteen years, where she was fed and raised up, and along with other little girls was taught to read and write, also was taught about religion, and learned how to sew. Has heard that her father Jean de Chantraine is still alive and living in Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e. At the age of 17 she went to live in the house of one named Christine de la Ch\u00e9raille, to where Anne was taken and presented by a certain servant at the hospital named Catherine ; her having said that she knew how to sew well. Anne became a seamstress, her job was to sew, make new clothes, and sometimes mend old clothes. Catherine was Christine's daughter, she also had a son called Henry. One evening, Anne was asked by Christine if she wanted to go to a wedding celebration with her ? To which she agreed. And the same day, at midnight, she was woken by Christine, saying it was time to go to the party and being close to her she rubbed on some black grease down to her waist and encouraged the prisoner to do the same. To what To which she replied she didn\u2019t have scabies. Upon which Christine replied to her that she would be even more beautiful and afterwards Christine anointed her and having proffered the following words : \" kneel down, touch the ground, then straight, straight up ! \" flew up the chimney and then the prisoner did the same and was taken to a grand room where she found there to be many people amongst those other than Christine, the aforementioned CHAUMONT, with many others that she shall say upon afterwards, being all seated around a table where there were silver goblets and having taken a piece of meat in her mouth and smelling that it was foul she spat it from her mouth, saying also that the candles that were burning were black. And when the said prisoner asked of the said assembly where she had come to, it was said to her in reply that they had come to her wedding celebration, and having said \"well beautiful bride who shall be the groom,\" a young, beardless man with a black hat and cloven feet approached closely to her and asked her if she wanted to be married to him. And she having replied to him that she had not yet done any lovemaking. She replied to him that they were not accustomed to making love. And after having spent some time he asked her if he could be seated with her. She said \"Jesus Mary how have I came to do this\" ? And all of a sudden, the company and all who had been in the chamber disappeared and she found herself in a courtyard where she stayed some time. And at the breaking of the day, Christine, came to collect her and as she said that she could not go on foot, she took her under the arms and carried her to a river where she found a boat and two women who took her back and took two days to arrive in Li\u00e8ge. And after having been ill for a long time, Christine asked her if she wanted to give herself to the devil and that in doing so she would be cured. Her having refused to do so, Christine took up a knife threatening to cut her throat and after several moments, she finally gave in Christine who gave her some bread, having eaten of which she was cured. The same evening Christine, with Laurent, took her to the same room or chamber as before, or first to some handsome companions, the name of whom she has forgotten at present, the one who had feathers in his hat, the one who requested to get upon her. This which he did and has done many times since in fact every time she went to the dances that being three times a week, be it known on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Saying also that the member of her so-called demon was very cold and his semen hot, as it seemed to her, and as soon as he removed his member, under where it came out, according to her, something red has been there since. Confessing also that Laurent CHAUMONT had many affairs with her ; saying that his member was hot and twice as big as that of her demon's. During the dances here taking place there was a lame witch lying on her stomach, the whole length of the table, and with a black candle placed in the hole of her arse serving as a candlestick and that she danced around for a quarter of an hour, and when she had finished, all those of the assembly went and kissed the arse of a goat and worshipped it, each carrying a lit black candle, which they left upon the table. Then the goat burst into flames and was reduced to ashes, and these ashes were distributed amongst all the witches for their use, and just as they had been ordered to by their gallants. Saying also that the said goat, though having been burnt to ashes, stood upright as a man and distributed the said powder or ashes himself. And this done, each of the said gallants had relations with each witch just as they had had relations them with them previously at the dances. Laurent de Chamont, brother-in-law and lover of her mistress, he was the king of the witches in that region, he was the leader of the group. They entered people's houses at night by magic and stole money, jewelry, books, clothes, and food. It was Laurent de Chamont who shaved and cut hairs from his sexual organs, and armpits, placing them on the palm of his hand, he blew them into keyholes; for it was thus, by the help of the devil, that doors of houses and locks of chests were opened. But the gang of witches were finally caught. Anne denounced Christine, Laurent, Catherine, and henry witches, they were arrested and burned alive at the stake. She had resided with Christine in the space of one year, until She left Christine, because she and her children along with Laurent de Chaumont, brother-in-law of Christine were engaged in crime and they were so evil. Having left she went to live at La Seraille, a place she knew of because Christine was going to go there with a cart as she desired many goods and accoutrements belonging to the wife of the said Teraille ; the prisoner having warned the said wife which was the reason that she was received in the house having placed all her trust in the woman, the prisoner's job there was to wash the laundry, hanging the laundry out and ironing the laundry. Having left the said Teraille, she went to live with her godmother Agnes Le Pape, she lived there for the whole of winter. This Agnes gave her a bandeau. It was then that the prisoner was arrested. The prisoner's punishment was not to be tortured or executed like her accomplices, but she was to be banished from Liege. Leaving the principality of Liege, she was taken to her father, who had settled at War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, he had re married. Anne hired herself as a milkmaid to a farmer named Laurent Streignart, she milked his cows. She lived in Waret with her father for a whole year for 13 months. His new wife Marie Descry was very nice to her, Anne looked on her as the mother she never had. \n\nThese were the confessions of Anne de Chantraine. But the magistrate wanted to know more information. So that same day the tribunal decided to send one of its members to Liege to obtain more complete information. They will interrogate the prisoner to know more of her crimes and if she had any other accomplices now in Waret.\nGuilame BODART 1620\n\n===September 15, 1620===\nBecause of the number of cases under consideration, Anne's trial was put on hold. It ended up being for six months. A member of the tribunal has finally now been sent to Liege.\n\n===Enquiry held at Li\u00e8ge 15 September 1620===\nI the undersigned, deputy burgomaster of the High Court of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e, commissioner in this region, deputy of the Court by their ordinance laid down in certain words, containing the instruction to necessitate any enquiries or information to be given by the Mayor of Waret against, Anne de Chantraie, have, on the 15th of September 1620, left Namur and travelled to the city of Li\u00e8ge ; where upon arrival, on this day, today the 16th of the same month, after having taken leave of the parties, Mayors and deputy burgomasters of Li\u00e8ge, have provided the said necessary information as follows : \n\n1st Witness \n1.

These, Christine and her daughter who anointed themselves with grease under their arms and also anointed each other; thus forthwith they left by the chimney and the devil carried them far away to beautiful rooms and a nuptial banquet where they found many people seated at the table, upon which table she says there was neither salt, nor knives, and that there she recognized Laurent Chaumont, who was serving at table.

And that she has never before known how to make the Sign of the Cross. Also testifying again, that at the time she stayed in the house of Agn\u00e8s, a child of Marie LE MESSAGIER, who lived in a room at the top of the house of Agn\u00e8s, became ill, and Agn\u00e8s took flight forthwith, the child languished and died ; for which people have a bad opinion of her.

And that at these said dances they would have recognized Laurent CHAUMONT, and several women, these which Laurent served at table with a serviette on his arm carrying pots and afterwards took to dancing with their backs against each other.

Saying that each time she returned from the sabbath, she were brought back in the same fashion as she were taken away, apart from the first time when she stayed in the cave. she was asked if the cave was in a village or a field or near to any woods ; she said it was a lone cave quite close to a stream, without her being able to perceive any house or anyone who lives around it, and being there she acknowledged that the cave is very obscure and full of ordure not having any provision ; saying that the cave was not largely spread but anyways the whole assembly could rest inside. not having seen anyone upon leaving the cave, not being able to say which village she passed because she returned by water and entered Li\u00e8ge by the stream, landing on the banks upon the gravel near the gate of Amercoeur; taking two days to return to Li\u00e8ge and that at night they were lodged in a village that she doesn\u2019t know the name of and that the boat was steered by two women, unknown to her, and that upon this boat was Christine, her daughter and her son and Laurent CHAUMONT.

L\u00e9onard JACQUES: Says she also solicited the child of L\u00e9onard JACQUES being still resident in Li\u00e8ge, and this after having also asked for leave of the devil, saying that she gave oils to the mother of the child that she sold to her. The girl MAUPAS Says also that the daughter of the daughter-in-law MAUPAS came to see her in prison, being still herself, and that the prisoner ordered her to stay for a few days in this town, but having returned to Li\u00e8ge, she has not seen her since and doesn\u2019t know how she fares, having made her turn around, asking of the devil if he should wish to solicit her. Jean de LATOUR Says she also solicited one of the children of Jean de LATOUR keeper of the banks of Les Pieres, making him turn around and say the words, as above. And this is what she wishes to say. \nJ. GAIFFIER J. de LOFFE priest\n\nOctober 14th, 1620.\nAnne has told today that once, at night, the devil was to be found in her bedroom of which she was in the house of Christine, and he prevented her from throwing Holy Water that she had in a dish, and that he had his way with Anne, even saying that his ejaculate was extremely cold.\n\nOn the same day today, three women of the village of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e, came forward as witnesses against her. The first said she knew the accused had the reputation of being a witch, and one day when she felt ill, she was convinced she had been bewitched by Anne. Accordingly she complained to the accused, and Anne prepared some pancakes for her. When she had eaten the first, she began to vomit and immediately felt better. The second witness was a friend of the accused and had received certain confidences from her which she made known to the tribunal-common- places about the Sabbath and the magic powders. She could give only one definite fact: one of her children had been poisoned and later on cured by Anne on the same day. The third witness declared on oath that the prisoner had healed two bewitched children by taking away a spell, but that she had also caused the death of a young girl who lived in the village. \nGuilame BODART 1620\n\nDecember 7, 1620. \nPresented by the said Mayor assisted by the advocate DARDENE the 7th December 1620.

And having returned to Waret said they had danced in the woods at Escu, in Tomble at Glymes, behind the court of the Mayor. In which places, after the dances had ended, they always had relations with their gallants, saying that her gallant was called Green Bonnet, having forgotten the name of the one that she had at Li\u00e8ge. \n\nHow does she know that Catharine Cigne gave poison to the infant of the Marshall of Waret ?\nSaid that she knows because she was present when the devil advised her and gave her the powder to do so. And this was at the dance behind the court of the mayor.\n\nWho advised her to cure the said child and why had she treated it in such a way rather than otherwise ? \nSaid that her step-mother, to whom she had declared her deed, had asked her to find the said infant. And having been asked of her how she had done so ? Told us that she had asked earlier of the devil to give her leave to do so, saying in these terms : \"Satan, would you truly wish me to cure this child ? \". This which she repeated three times, and this said, she took up the infant under the arms, turned around with it, and thus he was cured. And asked her : who had taught her to do so ? Said that it had been Christine, adding having also cured Philippe's son Jamie using the same method as above.   \n\nHow does she know that Catherine Cigne had placed poison in the cinders in the house of the prisoner to poison her step-mother ? \nSaid that she had been at a dance another time and had seen that the devil gave the poison to the said Catherine to kill her step-mother. It was a black powder that came from a goat that was burned at the Sabbath. This poison which was placed by this Catharine in the cinders at the house with this intention. Knowing of this, the prisoner fearing that her step-mother should die, had taken it out, having her hand seriously burned. \n\nWas asked of her what she had done with the poison that she had taken away from her step-mother ?\nSaid she had thrown it onto the fire. \n\nWas asked what did she do with the poison that she took from the Marshall's child?\nSaid she had given it to a unknown girl who she came across.\n\nAnd after having made her read her responses as above she persisted in them.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk 1620\n\n10th of February 1621.\nPresented by the advocate DARDENNE, in the name of the said officer, on the 10th of February 1621, in the presence of Pierre DELVAULX ; LINCHAMPS and MORTEAUME magistrates of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e.

This poison was black, enveloped in paper. Before, Christine said upon taking the said poison : that she would do it. Said also that being on the street named upon Meuze in Li\u00e8ge, with Christine and seeing the wife of the said Leonard, Christine said to the prisoner : \"Wait, here is my friend, I am going to give to her that which Cain gave to me.\" And in fact approached her, saying : \"Good day, my friend \". And on saying this, she touched her hip with the powder that she had in her hand.\n\nBy which means does she know, and from whom, that the wife of the said L\u00e9onard JACQUE, must have rejected the poison that she had ?  \nSaid that Christine had taught her how to cure those that had been poisoned saying three times whenever someone was presented to them having been poisoned in order to be cured : \u00ab Satan do you wish me to take this away from them that you have made take the poison ? \u00bb And this question asked, made held them up under the arms, made them turn one turn, and again said the same words as above whilst touching the hand of the empoisoned, saying that there was more assurance of recovery by making them turn around, and that she had cured the wife of L\u00e9onard JACQUE.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk 1621\n\nOf the 15th of April, 1621. \nHaving today have appear before us Jean de Chantraine father of the prisoner, To which he declared when his wife died, his daughter was 1 years old. After his wife died, he held livestock and that as his merchandise was confiscated by his creditors, he did not have the means to pay, nor to feed his daughter. And so he left the prisoner in the hospital of Saint-Jean the Baptist at Li\u00e8ge, he entrusted his daughter in the care of kindly nuns. When asked if upon the return of the prisoner to Waret, he had noticed anything about her or her behaviour? Said that several times she had fallen as if with a sickness, not really knowing what caused this in her, although he believed, that it was due to drink, to which she had taken to sometimes, or if the devil was tormenting her. Saying also that at no time had this happened upon her when she had not been drinking. And having, the witness, asked of his daughter from where this came upon her? Said nothing else, apart from this happened to her several times in two years, and that afterwards he pulled three hairs from his head, took salt and Holy Water and threw them over his head behind her. When asked also, if following this which we know having heard, as above, from the witness, the prisoner then did anything to him? He said that as she did not wish to obey, he beat her and struck her, after which she said, as she left the house, that she would do even worse. And at the same instant it seemed, to the witness, that he lost his sight or at least that it was blurred, and that instead of seeing one person he saw three or four of the same, and this not long after all this happened. \n\nHaving also had brought before us Marie Descry (the new) wife of Jean de Chantraine, She stated that she thought of Anne as her actual daughter, always spoke with her, got on very well with her. Told that on one day the prisoner having returned from milking her cows at work, she took a knife and afterwards gave it back to the witness, Marie saying if Anne had kept the knife she would have stabbed herself because she was in so much despair. Later that evening when Anne had gone to bed, Marie heard a moan coming from her room. Going in she surprised her by seeing Anne trying to strangle herself with the cords of her headdress. Fortunately they were not strong enough. Anne started crying, Marie rushed to her hugging her and reassuring her, she rocked Anne in her arms where she fell asleep with her tears. And being, the witness, asked if Anne had saved her from taken poison out of her drink, said yes and she confirmed what she had said that she had thrown it into the fire. She also said that Anne had told her that Catherine had poised the Marshal's child. To which her step-mother urged her to go to the child and hurry to cure it at once. Anne later on coming back home she assured her step-mother that she had saved the child, and the child was now fine. \nAnd after reading they both confirmed that above.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk That same day Anne was asked why she had given the poison to the girl who lives two leagues from Waret. To which right then the prisoner declared that she don't remember saying that she gave the poison to some girl.\n\nOn the 16th of the same month of April (1621), before LINCHAMPS, de LOFFE, GAIFFIER and BOYEMANS. Having seen, Anne de Chantraine prisoner, previously examined upon whether she had given the poison mentioned in the two articles of this instruction of the said Master advisor to the girl therein mentioned: said she has no memory of this, to which she insisted.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621 \n\nSince then and at the time has confessed to it being veritable, that after having taken the poison from the child of the new marshal of the said Waret, in the presence of and assisted by the devil her gallant called Green-Bonnet, she had given the said poison, that consisted of a black powder that came from a goat that was ordinarily burnt at the dances, to a girl who passed behind Waret along the main road that goes from Namur to Hannut ; \u2026\u2026 asked touching with the hand in which she held the powder upon the back of the skirts of the said girl with the intention of killing her. Not knowing who she is, or where she lives, other than that she had afterwards been told by her gallant, that she was the daughter of a censor residing two leagues from the said Waret, without naming the name, or her residence, but that her father had the good means to support her. This which occurred not long before her imprisonment saying that on the day after her so-called gallant told her that the said girl was dead and that since then he told her she was not and that the devil was a liar. Not knowing of any other thing. And examined as to why she had until the present been secretive and had denied that above : said that she feared that we would have her done to death.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621\n \nOf the 9th of June 1621 \nAnne de Chantraine prisoner was interrogated upon which houses the crimes were committed in of which she spoke in her deposition of the said day and that Christine, Laurent de CHAUMONT and herself had stolen away. Has replied that the most they had taken away had been at la Theraille, where they had taken and stole away much money, sheets of lace, cloths and napkins. Item, in the house of L\u00e9onard de VAULX, they stole away : money, all at once, many sacks of oats, skirts, coats and cloaks. Item, in the house of Chenseval they stole away sheets of lace, and many other things, and also much money. At Cigne, upon le Goffe at Li\u00e8ge : wine in a bottle, only once. And said that when they returned they came with demons and said that all these crimes were carried out when they returned from the dances. Said that otherwise, said that they had stripped a house on the bridge to the Isle, the house known to belong to the Lady de la Theraille, and they took from this house : sheets for a skirt, money and silk. And from a house in front of the Court they stole away a barrel of white wine. \nGuilame BODART \n\nOn June 15th 1621. \nfive witnesses came from Li\u00e8ge to testify on her morals. They were Conrad de Phencenal, from whom she had stolen many tin plates; , Anne de Chevron who had been robbed by her of linen and jewels; L\u00e9onard de Vaulx and his daughter, who brought a theft of 300 florins against her. A young merchant, Wautier Betoren, declared he had been her victim to the extent of a piece of linen, but that a friend of Anne, had given him twenty florins by way of indemnity.\n\nThe mayor of War\u00eat had a meeting at Namur, where the Provincial Council gave an authorisation for torture, in order to know if the accused might have any other accomplices in War\u00eat.\n\nJune 19th, 1621. \nThe torturer of Namur L\u00e9onard Balzat came to War\u00eat. It was decided that the accused should be submitted to the torture of water cure. \nTwo days later the torture was repeated, but this time the torturer poured very hot water through the funnel placed in her throat. It was a horrible scene, when the funnel was removed from her mouth, Anne was coughing, moaning, sobbing. However this still did not make her to reveal her accomplices, nothing more could be found out. She was in a very bad condition, she could not eat any food that evening. She refused to eat because of her throat. \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\nJuly 23rd, 1621. \nThe judges of Waret then turned to their superiors in Namur who opted for death. On July 23, the delegates of the Provincial Council condemned Anne de Chantraine to death. \"for the confessed crime of witchcraft, and for having assisted at several larcenies by night, by means of the same witchcraft, in the houses of citizens in the city of Li\u00e8ge.\" \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\nJuly 26th 1621\nThe sentence was made known to Anne on the 26th. She in a burst of despair, denied all her confessions.\n\n===December 9, 1621===\nAnne de Chantraine was not executed. During the winter of 1621 the mayor made another visit to Namur. On December 9 he received an answer that \"in view of the inquiries held by a deputed commission since the sentence pronounced in the court of War\u00eat on July 26, the aldermen should see to it that the said sentence be carried into execution according to due form and tenor.\"  \n\n===December 14, 1621===\nThe undersigned clerk of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e certifies that on this day the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), at about six o\u2019clock in the morning, he has to be found at the gates of the prison, in which Anne de CHANTRAINE was imprisoned, where in the presence of Jacques de HERAUDE rag merchant, sentence was pronounced upon the prisoner obtained against her by the Mayor of Waret following the judgement made by My lords of the Council of Namur on the 9th of this month. After which announcement, the undersigned said to the prisoner that she should repent truly of all her sins so she would be able to properly give herself over to God. To which she made no reply. And that instantly father MONCEAU Jesuit and his companion came in, and after the sign of the cross having been made by MONCEAU he had asked of the prisoner how she fared, remonstrating with her, and that since she had been sentenced, that she should make a good and full confession. Upon which, the prisoner replied that she was happy to die for her sins but not for being a witch, which she twice reiterated to which father MONCEAU replied to her that a witch must die as a witch, a thief as a thief. Upon these words, the undersigned left to go and find the Lord Councillor BODART, leaving the Jesuits alone with the prisoner. Such was done the day and year above.  \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk to the Court \nOf the said Waret \n\nUpon this day, the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), Godefroid GAIFFIER, licensed in law and Jan de LOFFE magistrates of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e, were taken to the gaols of this town to Anne de CHANTRAINE prisoner, with effect to hear if she persists in her denials of events of witchcraft heretofore voluntarily confessed to by her, not only before those of the Court, but to the Lord Councillor BODART, and to question if the confessions made before, touching upon these events, were veritable. She replied no. And it was asked of her why she had accused herself as a witch for? To which she said she does not know why she told people that she was a witch. And it was asked of her where she had learned of the events and that she could not have any knowledge of them if she was not truly a witch. Said she learned by hearsay, and that she dare not die upon the false confessions of these events. And was asked of her if she was resolved to die. Replied that yes, but only for her sins. And it was asked of her if her sins were other than those legally confessed to by her. Gave no reply apart from some ambiguous ones, not wanting to reply pertinently, even when pressed. This day, brother Jean Bartholom\u00e9, a religious of the order of Saint Francis, declared to us that he had heard the prisoner today in her confession. And that after this was ended, the prisoner told him that she wishes to restore the honor and good reputation that she had taken from all those she had accused in her legal confessions as witches and that she doesn\u2019t know of badness in them and that they were good people like her and that she had decided to declare this in such a way publicly to the Judiciary. Outside the room, the clerk of the court was interested in the sanity of the prisoner, the jailer was asked if he had at anytime noticed anything abnormal about Anne, he said that \"the prisoner was stupid, did not understand what she said, though sometimes she seemed quite right in her mind\".\nBy ordonance. \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n\nAgain Anne de Chantraine was still not executed. Not sure if Anne was insane, or if she was a witch. Her execution was put on hold. She languished for sometime in the prison of Waret. In September 1622 on the 7th, the Council decided to re-examine the facts confessed by the accused. Two new councillors were appointed. Upon examining the said prisoner she acted like she was troubled in spirit. It was hard to know if the prisoner was insane, or if the devil was making her tell lies, and preventing her from making a full confession. In order to facilitate the inquiry, the judges have decided to turn to their superiors in Namur for help. The prisoner has been taken to Namur where she was imprisoned in the Tour de Bordial, on the bank of the Sambre, at the foot of the citadel.\nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n \n12th of September 1622. \nWas heard the commissioner\u2019s report upon what is required made law by them upon this day. Anne de Chantraine prisoner, has been advised that the first commissioner shall be informed by the jailer, his wife and others that the jailer shall name, upon whether during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner, they remarked that she was troubled in spirit and in judgement, as she demonstrated during the discourse held with the commissioners on this day, and on the 7th of the same month. They said that the prisoner was troubled in spirit. \n\nAnne was brought into the council at Namur, The jailer armed with scissors and razer cut Anne's hair and shaved her head. She was stripped of her shift, and dressed in a plain shift. Afterwards she had an exorcism performed on her by priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU.\nGuillaume BODART\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===28 September 1622===\nSummoned before us{{Who|date=March 2020}} is Jacques de HERAUD prison warder in this town, the same man heard and examined in conformity with the decree of the 12th of this month in order to know if during daily chats and conversations he, his wife or servants may have had with Anne de Chantraine, prisoner, if they noticed that she was troubled of spirit or in judgement ? Upon which, he replied to us under oath that he has not had any other conversation with the prisoner, apart from on the occasions when he checked up on her in prison and brought her something to eat or had it taken by his children, who he also accompanied, if then he had asked her at any time what she had done ? To which she had always responded well regarding this, never continuing on at any time from previous discourse, he remarked that he had not now noticed if she seemed troubled, or lacking in spirit, since the exorcism. Though by the hearsay of the priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU having visited her ; the prisoner was heavy-hearted and did not know what she was saying, and that going there to see her just after the witness, he found that she spoke and conversed as well as she had always been seen to do, saying \"if they make me say something enough I shall say it\", knowing that she is a witch, but that soon afterwards she revoked it. He told us also, that the prisoner's father came to see her. Where he made it heard that he blamed Anne his daughter for her actions, saying \"look well for yourselves, swear even that she has not done so\", and at that she replied, \"let us not speak of this at all father, if I have done something to you, I asked it of you\". The jailer also added that whilst she had been in prison, she had had a quarrel with two women (his) young nieces. Those who usually brought her something to eat, and this because they had not known soon enough, or well enough, what she desired upon which occasion, she menaced them and said they will pay for it. And in fact, sometimes having been near to the prisoner, they returned sick: spending water and foul stuff from their mouths, seeming to be ill enough to die. By which the jailer was overcame by emotion and trouble and accused the prisoner and harassed and menaced her, saying to her that if she did not cure them, there would be no other executioner than he to see her killed. Upon which she replied to him that she had not done anything to them, but that she could cure them fully, and having upon the instant brought the two girls towards her, he saw that she took them by the hand and started to say words which he cannot remember and that he began to run away, leaving behind with her the two girls, and forthwith and in an instant they returned to being all changed and healed just as they had been before, as was seen by several prisoners they were completely amazed and said, \"she must be a devil herself\". And as much the two girls have since been well, apart from one who seems to still feel the effects, as there may be no doubt. The hearsay of one of his nieces was, one time when she was taking Anne's food to her, she entered the room alone where Anne was languishing. Anne was sprawled on the straw. Her head in the corner made a light spot: the clarity was dull. when she gave the prisoner her food, Anne stared at her with a dead look. It was a terrible look. It seemed to the niece an accusation and a reproach. The niece was unable to bear it. She fled the room. The jailer states that the very first day the prisoner was brought to this prison, she had words and discourse with him pertaining to her doings and acts of witchcraft, circumstances and reasons and so surely that he was shocked and amazed by it all. Saying having had many witches on his hands, as many in Fernelmont as here, and that he has never heard any of them talk as much about witchcraft, nor none before, as does the prisoner. Upon which he insists. \nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\nOf the 5th of October 1622 before LINCHAMPS and de LOFFE. \nSummoned Marie de FODAU, wife of Jacques de HERAUDE (the jailer) aged seventy-two years. She after having sworn by oath, was examined upon whether if, during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner since she was in prison, had she noticed that she was troubled of spirit and judgement? Has stated not having any other conversation with the prisoner unless it was whilst bringing her food or having food brought to her by her two nieces, during which times they often conversed with her, not noticing in any way at all that she seemed troubled in spirit or in judgement. Given that she spoke and has always spoken and replied with assurance and good judgement, as she still does daily, without noticing any change from her since she has been in prison. Upon this she insists. \nNot having signed for not knowing how to write. \nB. de LINCHAMPS 1622  J. de LOFFE 1622 \n\nOctober 17, 1622, the definitive sentence was brought in: death by fire with preliminary strangulation. On that day Anne was brought back to War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, the place that would be fixed for her execution. During the following night L\u00e9onard Balzat and his assistant prepared the pyre, a huge heap of a hundred fagots bought in the village itself. In the centre, sheaves of straw were placed, and a hollow was made large enough in the straw to contain a stool. The prisoner had no idea that she was going to be executed the next day, nobody told her.\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===October 18, 1622===\nAt dawn Anne was awakened by the jailer, the clerk of the court, and a priest, who announced the fatal news to her. She said she was glad to die for her sins, but persisted in her denial of not being a witch. She was led out. The executioner was waiting with a cart, and the condemned girl climbed into it. When they reached the end of the village where the pyre was, L\u00e9onard Balzat took Anne out of the cart and walked her over to the stake. In a loud voice, Anne denied that she was a witch, admitted that she was a thief, and acknowledged that everything she did was wrong. Leonard Balzat helped her to climb the pyre, seated her on the stool among the straw, then with his own hands he abruptly strangled her. The executioner set fire to the stake.

At the age of 21 she was burned at the stake for witchcraft in the village of Waret-la-Chaussee in Belgium France. Just before being burned she was strangled by the executioner. <ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref>\n\n==Trial of Anne de Chantraine==\n\n===26 March 1620===\nThe sergeant of the court of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e arrested a young lady called Anne de Chantraine; she was 19 years old, she had come to live in the village with her father and was reputed to be a witch. Anne was a very beautiful girl, she has long red hair, people associated her hair with the flames of hell. There has been a lot of things going on in the village. The crops have been failing, the cows were not giving milk and the hens were laying sterile eggs, all this was deemed to be the workings of witchcraft. The person who denounced Anne a witch was none other than her neighbour, whose advances she refused. \n\nOn March 28, 1620, the accused was examined informally. She was brought before the mayor, Thomas Douclet, and the aldermen of the district. Fearing the instruments of the master of high works, she avoided torture by confessing freely to being a witch. She then made the most brazen avowals. \n\nBorn on March 19, 1601. in the town of Liege, to a traveling merchant father, her mother died when Anne was only 1 years old. Not long after the death of her mother, Anne's father placed her in the hospital of saint jean the Baptist in liege. Little Anne resided at the hospital for fifteen years, where she was fed and raised up, and along with other little girls was taught to read and write, also was taught about religion, and learned how to sew. Has heard that her father Jean de Chantraine is still alive and living in Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e. At the age of 17 she went to live in the house of one named Christine de la Ch\u00e9raille, to where Anne was taken and presented by a certain servant at the hospital named Catherine ; her having said that she knew how to sew well. Anne became a seamstress, her job was to sew, make new clothes, and sometimes mend old clothes. Catherine was Christine's daughter, she also had a son called Henry. One evening, Anne was asked by Christine if she wanted to go to a wedding celebration with her ? To which she agreed. And the same day, at midnight, she was woken by Christine, saying it was time to go to the party and being close to her she rubbed on some black grease down to her waist and encouraged the prisoner to do the same. To what To which she replied she didn\u2019t have scabies. Upon which Christine replied to her that she would be even more beautiful and afterwards Christine anointed her and having proffered the following words : \" kneel down, touch the ground, then straight, straight up ! \" flew up the chimney and then the prisoner did the same and was taken to a grand room where she found there to be many people amongst those other than Christine, the aforementioned CHAUMONT, with many others that she shall say upon afterwards, being all seated around a table where there were silver goblets and having taken a piece of meat in her mouth and smelling that it was foul she spat it from her mouth, saying also that the candles that were burning were black. And when the said prisoner asked of the said assembly where she had come to, it was said to her in reply that they had come to her wedding celebration, and having said \"well beautiful bride who shall be the groom,\" a young, beardless man with a black hat and cloven feet approached closely to her and asked her if she wanted to be married to him. And she having replied to him that she had not yet done any lovemaking. She replied to him that they were not accustomed to making love. And after having spent some time he asked her if he could be seated with her. She said \"Jesus Mary how have I came to do this\" ? And all of a sudden, the company and all who had been in the chamber disappeared and she found herself in a courtyard where she stayed some time. And at the breaking of the day, Christine, came to collect her and as she said that she could not go on foot, she took her under the arms and carried her to a river where she found a boat and two women who took her back and took two days to arrive in Li\u00e8ge. And after having been ill for a long time, Christine asked her if she wanted to give herself to the devil and that in doing so she would be cured. Her having refused to do so, Christine took up a knife threatening to cut her throat and after several moments, she finally gave in Christine who gave her some bread, having eaten of which she was cured. The same evening Christine, with Laurent, took her to the same room or chamber as before, or first to some handsome companions, the name of whom she has forgotten at present, the one who had feathers in his hat, the one who requested to get upon her. This which he did and has done many times since in fact every time she went to the dances that being three times a week, be it known on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Saying also that the member of her so-called demon was very cold and his semen hot, as it seemed to her, and as soon as he removed his member, under where it came out, according to her, something red has been there since. Confessing also that Laurent CHAUMONT had many affairs with her ; saying that his member was hot and twice as big as that of her demon's. During the dances here taking place there was a lame witch lying on her stomach, the whole length of the table, and with a black candle placed in the hole of her arse serving as a candlestick and that she danced around for a quarter of an hour, and when she had finished, all those of the assembly went and kissed the arse of a goat and worshipped it, each carrying a lit black candle, which they left upon the table. Then the goat burst into flames and was reduced to ashes, and these ashes were distributed amongst all the witches for their use, and just as they had been ordered to by their gallants. Saying also that the said goat, though having been burnt to ashes, stood upright as a man and distributed the said powder or ashes himself. And this done, each of the said gallants had relations with each witch just as they had had relations them with them previously at the dances. Laurent de Chamont, brother-in-law and lover of her mistress, he was the king of the witches in that region, he was the leader of the group. They entered people's houses at night by magic and stole money, jewelry, books, clothes, and food. It was Laurent de Chamont who shaved and cut hairs from his sexual organs, and armpits, placing them on the palm of his hand, he blew them into keyholes; for it was thus, by the help of the devil, that doors of houses and locks of chests were opened. But the gang of witches were finally caught. Anne denounced Christine, Laurent, Catherine, and henry witches, they were arrested and burned alive at the stake. She had resided with Christine in the space of one year, until She left Christine, because she and her children along with Laurent de Chaumont, brother-in-law of Christine were engaged in crime and they were so evil. Having left she went to live at La Seraille, a place she knew of because Christine was going to go there with a cart as she desired many goods and accoutrements belonging to the wife of the said Teraille ; the prisoner having warned the said wife which was the reason that she was received in the house having placed all her trust in the woman, the prisoner's job there was to wash the laundry, hanging the laundry out and ironing the laundry. Having left the said Teraille, she went to live with her godmother Agnes Le Pape, she lived there for the whole of winter. This Agnes gave her a bandeau. It was then that the prisoner was arrested. The prisoner's punishment was not to be tortured or executed like her accomplices, but she was to be banished from Liege. Leaving the principality of Liege, she was taken to her father, who had settled at War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, he had re married. Anne hired herself as a milkmaid to a farmer named Laurent Streignart, she milked his cows. She lived in Waret with her father for a whole year for 13 months. His new wife Marie Descry was very nice to her, Anne looked on her as the mother she never had. \n\nThese were the confessions of Anne de Chantraine. But the magistrate wanted to know more information. So that same day the tribunal decided to send one of its members to Liege to obtain more complete information. They will interrogate the prisoner to know more of her crimes and if she had any other accomplices now in Waret.\nGuilame BODART 1620\n\n===September 15, 1620===\nBecause of the number of cases under consideration, Anne's trial was put on hold.

And on saying this, she touched her hip with the powder that she had in her hand.\n\nBy which means does she know, and from whom, that the wife of the said L\u00e9onard JACQUE, must have rejected the poison that she had ?  \nSaid that Christine had taught her how to cure those that had been poisoned saying three times whenever someone was presented to them having been poisoned in order to be cured : \u00ab Satan do you wish me to take this away from them that you have made take the poison ? \u00bb And this question asked, made held them up under the arms, made them turn one turn, and again said the same words as above whilst touching the hand of the empoisoned, saying that there was more assurance of recovery by making them turn around, and that she had cured the wife of L\u00e9onard JACQUE.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk 1621\n\nOf the 15th of April, 1621. \nHaving today have appear before us Jean de Chantraine father of the prisoner, To which he declared when his wife died, his daughter was 1 years old. After his wife died, he held livestock and that as his merchandise was confiscated by his creditors, he did not have the means to pay, nor to feed his daughter. And so he left the prisoner in the hospital of Saint-Jean the Baptist at Li\u00e8ge, he entrusted his daughter in the care of kindly nuns. When asked if upon the return of the prisoner to Waret, he had noticed anything about her or her behaviour? Said that several times she had fallen as if with a sickness, not really knowing what caused this in her, although he believed, that it was due to drink, to which she had taken to sometimes, or if the devil was tormenting her. Saying also that at no time had this happened upon her when she had not been drinking. And having, the witness, asked of his daughter from where this came upon her? Said nothing else, apart from this happened to her several times in two years, and that afterwards he pulled three hairs from his head, took salt and Holy Water and threw them over his head behind her. When asked also, if following this which we know having heard, as above, from the witness, the prisoner then did anything to him? He said that as she did not wish to obey, he beat her and struck her, after which she said, as she left the house, that she would do even worse. And at the same instant it seemed, to the witness, that he lost his sight or at least that it was blurred, and that instead of seeing one person he saw three or four of the same, and this not long after all this happened. \n\nHaving also had brought before us Marie Descry (the new) wife of Jean de Chantraine, She stated that she thought of Anne as her actual daughter, always spoke with her, got on very well with her. Told that on one day the prisoner having returned from milking her cows at work, she took a knife and afterwards gave it back to the witness, Marie saying if Anne had kept the knife she would have stabbed herself because she was in so much despair. Later that evening when Anne had gone to bed, Marie heard a moan coming from her room. Going in she surprised her by seeing Anne trying to strangle herself with the cords of her headdress. Fortunately they were not strong enough. Anne started crying, Marie rushed to her hugging her and reassuring her, she rocked Anne in her arms where she fell asleep with her tears. And being, the witness, asked if Anne had saved her from taken poison out of her drink, said yes and she confirmed what she had said that she had thrown it into the fire. She also said that Anne had told her that Catherine had poised the Marshal's child. To which her step-mother urged her to go to the child and hurry to cure it at once. Anne later on coming back home she assured her step-mother that she had saved the child, and the child was now fine. \nAnd after reading they both confirmed that above.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk That same day Anne was asked why she had given the poison to the girl who lives two leagues from Waret. To which right then the prisoner declared that she don't remember saying that she gave the poison to some girl.\n\nOn the 16th of the same month of April (1621), before LINCHAMPS, de LOFFE, GAIFFIER and BOYEMANS. Having seen, Anne de Chantraine prisoner, previously examined upon whether she had given the poison mentioned in the two articles of this instruction of the said Master advisor to the girl therein mentioned: said she has no memory of this, to which she insisted.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621 \n\nSince then and at the time has confessed to it being veritable, that after having taken the poison from the child of the new marshal of the said Waret, in the presence of and assisted by the devil her gallant called Green-Bonnet, she had given the said poison, that consisted of a black powder that came from a goat that was ordinarily burnt at the dances, to a girl who passed behind Waret along the main road that goes from Namur to Hannut ; \u2026\u2026 asked touching with the hand in which she held the powder upon the back of the skirts of the said girl with the intention of killing her. Not knowing who she is, or where she lives, other than that she had afterwards been told by her gallant, that she was the daughter of a censor residing two leagues from the said Waret, without naming the name, or her residence, but that her father had the good means to support her. This which occurred not long before her imprisonment saying that on the day after her so-called gallant told her that the said girl was dead and that since then he told her she was not and that the devil was a liar. Not knowing of any other thing. And examined as to why she had until the present been secretive and had denied that above : said that she feared that we would have her done to death.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621\n \nOf the 9th of June 1621 \nAnne de Chantraine prisoner was interrogated upon which houses the crimes were committed in of which she spoke in her deposition of the said day and that Christine, Laurent de CHAUMONT and herself had stolen away. Has replied that the most they had taken away had been at la Theraille, where they had taken and stole away much money, sheets of lace, cloths and napkins. Item, in the house of L\u00e9onard de VAULX, they stole away : money, all at once, many sacks of oats, skirts, coats and cloaks. Item, in the house of Chenseval they stole away sheets of lace, and many other things, and also much money. At Cigne, upon le Goffe at Li\u00e8ge : wine in a bottle, only once. And said that when they returned they came with demons and said that all these crimes were carried out when they returned from the dances. Said that otherwise, said that they had stripped a house on the bridge to the Isle, the house known to belong to the Lady de la Theraille, and they took from this house : sheets for a skirt, money and silk. And from a house in front of the Court they stole away a barrel of white wine. \nGuilame BODART \n\nOn June 15th 1621. \nfive witnesses came from Li\u00e8ge to testify on her morals. They were Conrad de Phencenal, from whom she had stolen many tin plates; , Anne de Chevron who had been robbed by her of linen and jewels; L\u00e9onard de Vaulx and his daughter, who brought a theft of 300 florins against her. A young merchant, Wautier Betoren, declared he had been her victim to the extent of a piece of linen, but that a friend of Anne, had given him twenty florins by way of indemnity.\n\nThe mayor of War\u00eat had a meeting at Namur, where the Provincial Council gave an authorisation for torture, in order to know if the accused might have any other accomplices in War\u00eat.\n\nJune 19th, 1621. \nThe torturer of Namur L\u00e9onard Balzat came to War\u00eat. It was decided that the accused should be submitted to the torture of water cure. \nTwo days later the torture was repeated, but this time the torturer poured very hot water through the funnel placed in her throat. It was a horrible scene, when the funnel was removed from her mouth, Anne was coughing, moaning, sobbing. However this still did not make her to reveal her accomplices, nothing more could be found out. She was in a very bad condition, she could not eat any food that evening. She refused to eat because of her throat. \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\nJuly 23rd, 1621. \nThe judges of Waret then turned to their superiors in Namur who opted for death. On July 23, the delegates of the Provincial Council condemned Anne de Chantraine to death, the sentence was made known to Anne on the 26th. She in a burst of despair, denied all her confessions.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\n===December 9, 1621===\nAnne de Chantraine was not executed. During the winter of 1621 the mayor made another visit to Namur. On December 9 he received an answer that \"in view of the inquiries held by a deputed commission since the sentence pronounced in the court of War\u00eat on July 26, the aldermen should see to it that the said sentence be carried into execution according to due form and tenor.\"  \n\n===December 14, 1621===\nThe undersigned clerk of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e certifies that on this day the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), at about six o\u2019clock in the morning, he has to be found at the gates of the prison, in which Anne de CHANTRAINE was imprisoned, where in the presence of Jacques de HERAUDE rag merchant, sentence was pronounced upon the prisoner obtained against her by the Mayor of Waret following the judgement made by My lords of the Council of Namur on the 9th of this month. After which announcement, the undersigned said to the prisoner that she should repent truly of all her sins so she would be able to properly give herself over to God. To which she made no reply. And that instantly father MONCEAU Jesuit and his companion came in, and after the sign of the cross having been made by MONCEAU he had asked of the prisoner how she fared, remonstrating with her, and that since she had been sentenced, that she should make a good and full confession. Upon which, the prisoner replied that she was happy to die for her sins but not for being a witch, which she twice reiterated to which father MONCEAU replied to her that a witch must die as a witch, a thief as a thief. Upon these words, the undersigned left to go and find the Lord Councillor BODART, leaving the Jesuits alone with the prisoner. Such was done the day and year above.  \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk to the Court \nOf the said Waret \n\nUpon this day, the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), Godefroid GAIFFIER, licensed in law and Jan de LOFFE magistrates of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e, were taken to the gaols of this town to Anne de CHANTRAINE prisoner, with effect to hear if she persists in her denials of events of witchcraft heretofore voluntarily confessed to by her, not only before those of the Court, but to the Lord Councillor BODART, and to question if the confessions made before, touching upon these events, were veritable. She replied no. And it was asked of her why she had accused herself as a witch for? To which Anne shouted that she does not know why she told people that she was a witch. And it was asked of her where she had learned of the events and that she could not have any knowledge of them if she was not truly a witch. Said she learned by hearsay, and that she dare not die upon the false confessions of these events. And was asked of her if she was resolved to die. Replied that yes, but only for her sins. And it was asked of her if her sins were other than those legally confessed to by her. Gave no reply apart from some ambiguous ones, not wanting to reply pertinently, even when pressed. This day, brother Jean Bartholom\u00e9, a religious of the order of Saint Francis, declared to us that he had heard the prisoner today in her confession. And that after this was ended, the prisoner told him that she wishes to restore the honor and good reputation that she had taken from all those she had accused in her legal confessions witches and that she doesn\u2019t know of badness in them and that they were good people like her and that she had decided to declare this in such a way publicly to the Judiciary. Outside the room, the clerk of the court was interested in the sanity of the prisoner, the jailer was asked if he had at anytime noticed anything abnormal about Anne, he said that \"the prisoner was stupid, did not understand what she said, though sometimes she seemed quite right in her mind\".\nBy ordonance. \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n\nAgain Anne de Chantraine was still not executed. She languished for sometime in the prison of Waret. In September 1622 on the 7th, the Council decided to re-examine the facts confessed by the accused. Two new councillors were appointed. Upon examining the said prisoner she acted like she was troubled in spirit. In order to facilitate the inquiry, it was decided to take the accused to Namur where she was imprisoned in the Tour de Bordial, on the bank of the Sambre, at the foot of the citadel.\nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n \n12th of September 1622. \nWas heard the commissioner\u2019s report upon what is required made law by them upon this day. Anne de Chantraine prisoner, has been advised that the first commissioner shall be informed by the jailer, his wife and others that the jailer shall name, upon whether during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner, they remarked that she was troubled in spirit and in judgement, as she demonstrated during the discourse held with the commissioners on this day, and on the 7th of the same month. They said that the prisoner was troubled in spirit. \n\nAnne was brought into the council at Namur, The jailer armed with scissors and razer cut Anne's hair and shaved her head. She was stripped of her shift, and dressed in a plain shift. Afterwards she had an exorcism performed on her by priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU.\nGuillaume BODART\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===28 September 1622===\nSummoned before us{{Who|date=March 2020}} is Jacques de HERAUD prison warder in this town, the same man heard and examined in conformity with the decree of the 12th of this month in order to know if during daily chats and conversations he, his wife or servants may have had with Anne de Chantraine, prisoner, if they noticed that she was troubled of spirit or in judgement ? Upon which, he replied to us under oath that he has not had any other conversation with the prisoner, apart from on the occasions when he checked up on her in prison and brought her something to eat or had it taken by his children, who he also accompanied, if then he had asked her at any time what she had done ? To which she had always responded well regarding this, never continuing on at any time from previous discourse, he remarked that he had not now noticed if she seemed troubled, or lacking in spirit, since the exorcism. Though by the hearsay of the priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU having visited her ; the prisoner was heavy-hearted and did not know what she was saying, and that going there to see her just after the witness, he found that she spoke and conversed as well as she had always been seen to do, saying \"if they make me say something enough I shall say it\", knowing that she is a witch, but that soon afterwards she revoked it. He told us also, that the prisoner's father came to see her. Where he made it heard that he blamed Anne his daughter for her actions, saying \"look well for yourselves, swear even that she has not done so\", and at that she replied, \"let us not speak of this at all father, if I have done something to you, I asked it of you\". The jailer also added that whilst she had been in prison, she had had a quarrel with two women (his) young nieces. Those who usually brought her something to eat, and this because they had not known soon enough, or well enough, what she desired upon which occasion, she menaced them and said they will pay for it. And in fact, sometimes having been near to the prisoner, they returned sick: spending water and foul stuff from their mouths, seeming to be ill enough to die. By which the jailer was overcame by emotion and trouble and accused the prisoner and harassed and menaced her, saying to her that if she did not cure them, there would be no other executioner than he to see her killed. Upon which she replied to him that she had not done anything to them, but that she could cure them fully, and having upon the instant brought the two girls towards her, he saw that she took them by the hand and started to say words which he cannot remember and that he began to run away, leaving behind with her the two girls, and forthwith and in an instant they returned to being all changed and healed just as they had been before, as was seen by several prisoners they were completely amazed and said, \"she must be a devil herself\". And as much the two girls have since been well, apart from one who seems to still feel the effects, as there may be no doubt. The hearsay of one of his nieces was, one time when she was taking Anne's food to her, she entered the room alone where Anne was languishing. Anne was sprawled on the straw. Her head in the corner made a light spot: the clarity was dull. when she gave the prisoner her food, Anne stared at her with a dead look. It was a terrible look. It seemed to the niece an accusation and a reproach. The niece was unable to bear it. She fled the room. The jailer states that the very first day the prisoner was brought to this prison, she had words and discourse with him pertaining to her doings and acts of witchcraft, circumstances and reasons and so surely that he was shocked and amazed by it all. Saying having had many witches on his hands, as many in Fernelmont as here, and that he has never heard any of them talk as much about witchcraft, nor none before, as does the prisoner. Upon which he insists. \nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\nOf the 5th of October 1622 before LINCHAMPS and de LOFFE. \nSummoned Marie de FODAU, wife of Jacques de HERAUDE (the jailer) aged seventy-two years. She after having sworn by oath, was examined upon whether if, during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner since she was in prison, had she noticed that she was troubled of spirit and judgement? Has stated not having any other conversation with the prisoner unless it was whilst bringing her food or having food brought to her by her two nieces, during which times they often conversed with her, not noticing in any way at all that she seemed troubled in spirit or in judgement. Given that she spoke and has always spoken and replied with assurance and good judgement, as she still does daily, without noticing any change from her since she has been in prison. Upon this she insists. \nNot having signed for not knowing how to write. \nB. de LINCHAMPS 1622  J. de LOFFE 1622 \n\nOctober 17, 1622, the definitive sentence was brought in: death by fire with preliminary strangulation. On that day Anne was brought back to War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, the place that would be fixed for her execution. During the following night L\u00e9onard Balzat and his assistant prepared the pyre, a huge heap of a hundred fagots bought in the village itself. In the centre, sheaves of straw were placed, and a hollow was made large enough in the straw to contain a stool. The prisoner had no idea that she was going to be executed the next day, nobody told her.\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===October 18, 1622===\nAt dawn Anne was awakened by the jailer, the clerk of the court, and a priest, who announced the fatal news to her. She said she was glad to die for her sins, but persisted in her denial of not being a witch. She was led out. The executioner was waiting with a cart, and the condemned girl climbed into it. When they reached the end of the village where the pyre was, L\u00e9onard Balzat took Anne out of the cart and walked her over to the stake. In a loud voice, Anne denied that she was a witch, admitted that she was a thief, and acknowledged that everything she did was wrong. Leonard Balzat helped her to climb the pyre, seated her on the stool among the straw, then with his own hands he abruptly strangled her. The executioner set fire to the stake. Smoke enveloped her, the crackling flames took her. The pyre burned for two days. On the third day the ashes were dispersed to the four winds. Anne de Chantraine was 21 years old when she was burned at the stake for being a witch.\nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n<ref>https://livres-mystiques.com/partieTEXTES/Etudes_satan/Satan.html#repression_appendice</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nAnne de Chantraine is a [[playable character]] in ''[[Nightmare (Atmosfear series)|Nightmare/Atmosfear]]'',<ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref><ref>[http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm Official Atmosfear website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308054916/http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm |date=March 8, 2008 }}</ref> a series of [[interactive]] [[board game]].

March 1473<ref>\"Alastair Armstrong, Henry VIII: Authority, Nation and Religion 1509\u20131540\"</ref> \u2013 29 November 1530) was an English [[archbishop]], [[Diplomat|statesman]] and a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. When [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the King's [[almoner]].<ref name=\"dictionary1\">\n''Oxford Dictionary National Biography'', Thomas Wolsey.\n</ref> Wolsey's affairs prospered, and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state. He also held important ecclesiastical appointments. These included the [[Archbishop of York|Archbishopric of York]] \u2013 the second most important role in the English church \u2013 and acting as [[Papal legate]]. His appointment as a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Leo X]] in 1515 gave him precedence over all other English clergy.\n\nThe highest political position Wolsey attained was [[Lord Chancellor]], the King's chief adviser (formally, as his successor and disciple [[Thomas Cromwell]] was not). In that position, he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as an ''alter rex'' (other king). After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles. He retreated to York to fulfil his ecclesiastical duties as Archbishop of York, a position he nominally held but had neglected during his years in government. He was recalled to London to answer to charges of treason\u2014a common charge used by Henry against ministers who simply fell out of favour and did not necessarily commit actual treason\u2014but died on the way from natural causes.\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Wolsey was born about 1473, the son of Robert Wolsey of [[Ipswich]] and his wife Joan Daundy.<ref name=\"dictionary1\"/> Widespread traditions identify his father as a butcher; his modest origin became a topic of criticism later, when he rose to amass wealth and power thought (by the critics) more befitting a member of the high nobility. Wolsey attended [[Ipswich School]]<ref>''Thomas Wolsey (1473\u20131530), royal minister, archbishop of York, and cardinal'' by Sybil M. Jack in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.</ref> and [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]] before studying theology at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. On 10 March 1498 he was ordained as a priest in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]], Wiltshire,<ref>{{openplaque|2710}}</ref> and remained in Oxford, first as the Master of Magdalen College School, before quickly being appointed the dean of divinity. Between 1500 and 1509 he held a  living as rector of [[Church of Saint Mary, Limington|St Mary's church]], [[Limington]], in [[Somerset]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1056844 |desc=Church of Saint Mary |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}</ref> In 1502, he became a chaplain to [[Henry Deane (archbishop of Canterbury)|Henry Deane]], archbishop of Canterbury, who died the following year.<ref name=\"dictionary1\"/> He was then taken into the household of Sir Richard Nanfan, who made Wolsey executor of his estate. After Nanfan's death in 1507, Wolsey entered the service of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].\n\nWolsey benefitted from Henry VII's introduction of measures to curb the power of the [[nobility]] \u2013 the king was willing  to favour those from more humble backgrounds.<ref>Oxford Dictionary National Biography, Henry VII.</ref> Henry VII appointed Wolsey [[Ecclesiastical Household|royal chaplain]].<ref>Williams p.26</ref> In this position Wolsey served as secretary to [[Richard Foxe]], who recognised Wolsey's innate ability and dedication and appreciated his industry and willingness to take on tedious tasks.<ref>Oxford Dictionary National Biography, Richard Fox</ref> Thomas Wolsey's remarkable rise to power from humble origins testifies to his intelligence, administrative ability, industriousness, ambition for power, and rapport with the King. In April 1508, Wolsey was sent to Scotland to discuss with [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] rumours of the renewal of the [[Auld Alliance]].<ref>Macdougall, Norman, ''James IV'', Tuckwell (1997), p.254: ''Letters of James IV'', Scottish History Society (1953) pp. xlii, 107\u2013111</ref>\n\nWolsey's rise coincided with the accession in April 1509 of Henry VIII, whose character, policies and attitude to diplomacy differed significantly from those of his father. In 1509 Henry appointed Wolsey to the post of [[Almoner]]<nowiki/>, a position that gave him a seat on the [[Privy Council]] and gave him an opportunity for greater prominence and for establishing a personal rapport with the King.<ref>Williams, p. 26</ref> A factor in Wolsey's rise was the young Henry VIII's relative lack of interest in the details of government during his early years.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', \"Henry VIII\"; 2004</ref>\n\n===Rise to prominence===\n[[File:Wolsey banner.jpg|thumb|Heraldic [[banner]] of Cardinal Wolsey as [[Archbishop of York]], showing the arms of the [[See of York]] [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] his personal [[coat of arms|arms]], with a [[cardinal's hat]] above. The [[griffin]] [[Supporter (heraldry)|supporter]] holds the Lord Chancellor's [[Ceremonial mace|Mace]]]] \nThe primary counsellors whom King Henry VIII inherited from his father were [[Richard Foxe]] ({{circa}} 1448\u20131528, Bishop of Winchester 1501\u20131528) and [[William Warham]] ({{circa}} 1450\u20131532, Archbishop of Canterbury 1503\u20131532). These were cautious and conservative, advising the King to act as a careful administrator like his father. Henry soon appointed to his Privy Council individuals more sympathetic to his own views and inclinations. Until 1511, Wolsey was adamantly anti-war. However, when the King expressed his enthusiasm for an invasion of France, Wolsey adapted his views to those of the King and gave persuasive speeches to the Privy Council in favour of war. Warham and Foxe, who failed to share the King's enthusiasm for the [[Anglo-French War (1512\u201314)|French war]] which started in 1512, fell from power (1515/1516), and Wolsey took over as the King's most trusted advisor and administrator. When Warham resigned as [[Lord Chancellor]] in 1515, probably under pressure from the King and from Wolsey, Henry appointed Wolsey in his place.<ref>\n''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', \"William Warham\"; 2004.\n</ref>\n\nWolsey made careful moves to destroy or neutralise the influence of other courtiers. He helped cause the fall of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]], in 1521; and in 1527 he prosecuted Henry's close friend [[William Compton (courtier)|William Compton]] and Henry's ex-mistress [[Anne Stafford, Countess of Huntingdon]], through the ecclesiastical courts for adultery. In the case of [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk]], Wolsey adopted a different strategy, attempting to win Suffolk's favour by his actions after the Duke secretly married Henry's sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France]], much to the King's displeasure. Wolsey advised the King not to execute the newlyweds, but to embrace them; whether this was through care for the couple or on account of the threat they represented for his own safety remains unclear. The bride, both as sister to Henry and as Dowager Queen of France, had high royal status that could have potentially meant a threat to Wolsey should she have so chosen.\n\nWolsey's rise to a position of great secular power paralleled his increasing status in the Church. He became a [[Canon of Windsor]] in 1511. In 1514 he was made [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and then Archbishop of York in the same year. [[Pope Leo X]] made him a cardinal in 1515, with the titular church of [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere|St Cecilia in Trastevere]]. Following the success of the English campaign in France and the peace negotiations that followed, Wolsey's ecclesiastical career advanced further: in 1523 he became additionally [[Bishop of Durham]], a post with wide political powers, and thus became known as Prince-Bishop of Durham.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n[[File:Wolsey.jpg|thumb|right|\"Cardinal Woolsey\" (an archaic spelling<ref>{{cite book| author = Sir Egerton Brydges| title = Censura literaria: Containing titles, abstracts, and opinions of old English books, with original disquisitions, articles of biography, and other literary antiquities| year = 1815| url = https://archive.org/details/censuraliterari21brydgoog| accessdate = 25 June 2009| publisher = Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown }}</ref>) by an unknown artist c.1520. Detail from an oil on panel in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], London.]]\n\n===War with France===\nThe war against France in 1512\u20131514 was the most significant opportunity for Wolsey to demonstrate his talents in the foreign policy arena. A convenient justification for going to war came in 1511 in the form of a plea for help from [[Pope Julius II]], who was beginning to feel threatened by France. England formed an alliance with the Pope, [[Ferdinand V of Spain]], and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] against [[Louis XII of France]].<ref name=\"Scarisbrick, pp 31-36\">Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' pp 31-36.</ref>\n\nThe first campaign against France was not a success, partly due to the unreliability of the alliance with Ferdinand. Henry learned from the mistakes of the campaign and in 1513, still with papal support, launched a joint attack on France with Maximilian, successfully [[battle of Guinegate (1513)|capturing two French cities]] and causing the French to retreat. Wolsey's ability to keep a large number of troops supplied and equipped for the duration of the war was a major factor in its success. Wolsey also had a key role in negotiating the Anglo-French treaty of 1514, which secured a temporary peace between the two nations. Under this treaty, the French king, [[Louis XII]], would marry Henry's young sister, Mary. In addition England was able to keep the captured city of [[Tournai]] and to secure an increase in the annual pension paid by France.<ref>J.D. Mackie,  ''The Earlier Tudors, 1485\u20131558'' (1952), pp. 271\u201377</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a turnover of rulers in Europe threatened to diminish England's influence. Peace with France in 1514 had been a true achievement for Wolsey and the King. With Henry's sister, Mary, married to the French King, Louis XII, an alliance was formed, but Louis was not in good health. Less than three months later, Louis died and was replaced by the young and ambitious [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].\n\nQueen Mary had allegedly secured a promise from Henry that if Louis died, she could marry whomever she pleased.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Barbara|year=1989|title=Power, Profit, and Passion: Mary Tudor, Charles Brandon, and the Arranged Marriage in Early Tudor England|url=|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=15|pages=59\u201388|doi=10.2307/3177818|jstor=3177818}}</ref> On Louis' death, she secretly married [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], with Francis I's assistance, which prevented another marriage alliance. As Mary was the only princess Henry could use to secure marriage alliances, this was a bitter blow. Wolsey then proposed an alliance with Spain and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against France.\n\n===Papal legate===\n[[File:Thomas Wolsey (1473-1530).jpg|alt=Thomas Wolsey (1473-1530), Lord High Chancellor of England (1515-1529), Archbishop of York (1514-1530), Cardinal (1515), the King's chief adviser|thumb|Thomas Wolsey (1473-1530), Lord High Chancellor of England (1515-1529), Archbishop of York (1514-1530), Cardinal (1515), the King's chief adviser]]\nThe death in 1516 of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand of Spain]], the father-in-law of Henry VIII, and England's closest ally, was a further blow. Ferdinand was succeeded by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who immediately proposed peace with France. On the death of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], in 1519, Charles was elected in his stead; thus Charles ruled a substantial portion of Europe and English influence became limited on the continent.\n\nWolsey, however, managed to assert English influence through another means. In 1517, [[Pope Leo X]] sought peace in Europe to form a crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1518 Wolsey was made [[Papal Legate]] in England, enabling him to work for the Pope's desire for peace by organising the [[Treaty of London (1518)|Treaty of London]]. The Treaty showed Wolsey as the arbiter of Europe, organising a massive peace summit involving twenty nations. This put England at the forefront of European diplomacy and drew her out of isolation, making her a desirable ally. This is well illustrated by the Anglo-French treaty signed two days afterwards. It was partly this peace treaty that caused conflict between France and Spain. In 1519, when Charles V ascended to the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], the King of France, was infuriated. He had invested enormous sums in bribing the electorate to elect him as emperor, and thus, he used the Treaty of London as a justification for the Habsburg-Valois conflict. Wolsey appeared to act as mediator between the two powers, both of whom were vying for England's support.<ref>Gwyn, ''The King's Cardinal'' pp 58-103.</ref>\n\n===Field of the Cloth of Gold===\nAnother of his diplomatic triumphs was the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]], in 1520.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' pp 74-80.</ref> Wolsey organised much of this grandiose meeting between [[Francis I of France]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], accompanied by some five thousand followers and involving court activities more than military discussion. Though it seemed to open the door to peaceful negotiations with France, if that was the direction the King wished to go, it was also a chance for a lavish display of English wealth and power before the rest of Europe, through flamboyant celebrations and events such as jousting, where the two Kings personally competed against each other. With both France and Spain vying for England's allegiance, Wolsey could choose the ally that better suited his policies. Wolsey chose Charles mainly because England's economy would suffer from the loss of the lucrative cloth trade industry between England and the Netherlands had France been chosen instead.<ref>Mackie, ''Earlier Tudors'' pp 310-12.</ref>\n\nUnder Wolsey's guidance, the chief nations of Europe sought to outlaw war forever among Christian nations. Garret Mattingly studied the causes of wars in that era, finding that treaties of nonaggression such as this one could never be stronger than the armies of their sponsors. When those forces were about equal, these treaties typically widened the conflict. That is, diplomacy could sometimes postpone war, but could not prevent wars based on irreconcilable interests and ambitions. What was lacking, Mattingly concludes, was a neutral power whose judgements were generally accepted either by impartial justice or by overwhelming force.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1898719|last1 = Mattingly|first1 = Garrett|title = An Early Nonaggression Pact|journal = The Journal of Modern History|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 1\u201330|year = 1938|doi = 10.1086/243493}}</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Spain===\nThe Treaty of London is often regarded as Wolsey's finest moment, but it was abandoned within a year. Wolsey developed links with Charles in 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Later at the Calais Conference (1521) Wolsey signed the Secret [[Italian War of 1521\u20131526|Treaty of Bruges (1521)]] with Charles, stating that they would join Spain in a war against France if France refused to sign the peace treaty; ignoring the Anglo-French treaty of 1518. Wolsey's relationship with Rome was also ambivalent. Despite his links to the papacy, Wolsey was strictly Henry's servant. Though the Treaty of London was an elaboration on Pope Leo's ambitions for European peace, it was seen in Rome as a vain attempt by England to assert her influence over Europe and steal some papal thunder. Furthermore, Wolsey's peace initiatives prevented a crusade to the [[Holy Land]], which was the catalyst for the Pope's desire for European peace.<ref name=\"Scarisbrick, pp 31-36\"/>\n\nCardinal [[Lorenzo Campeggio]], who represented the Pope at the Treaty of London, was kept waiting for many months in Calais before being allowed to cross the Channel and join the festivities in London; thereby, Wolsey was asserting his independence of Rome. An alternative hypothesis is that Campeggio was kept waiting until Wolsey received his legacy, thus asserting Wolsey's attachment to Rome.\n\nThough the English gain from the wars of 1522\u201323 was minimal, their contribution certainly aided Charles in his defeat of the French, particularly in 1525 at the [[Battle of Pavia]], where Charles' army captured the French king, Francis I. Henry then felt there was a realistic opportunity for him to seize the French crown, to which the kings of England had long laid claim. Parliament, however, refused to raise taxes. This led Wolsey to devise the [[Amicable Grant]], which was met with even more hostility, and ultimately led to his downfall. In 1525, after Charles had abandoned England as an ally, Wolsey began to negotiate with France, and the [[Treaty of the More]] was signed, during Francis' captivity, with the Regent of France \u2013 his mother, [[Louise of Savoy]].<ref>G.W. Bernard, ''War, Taxation, and Rebellion in Early Tudor England: Henry VIII, Wolsey, and the Amicable Grant of 1525'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1986).</ref>\n\nThe closeness between England and Rome can be seen in the formulation of the [[League of Cognac]] in 1526. Though England was not a part of it, the League was organised in part by Wolsey with papal support. Wolsey's plan was that the League of Cognac, composed of an alliance between France and some Italian states, would challenge Charles' [[League of Cambrai]]. This initiative was both a gesture of allegiance to Rome and an answer to growing concerns about Charles V's dominance over Europe.\n\nThe final blow to this policy came in 1529, when the French made peace with Charles. Meanwhile, the French also continued to honour the \"[[Auld Alliance]]\" with Scotland, stirring up hostility on England's border. With peace between France and the Emperor, there was no-one to free the Pope from Charles, who had effectively held Clement VII captive since the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527. Therefore, there was little hope of securing Henry an annulment from his marriage to Charles\u2019 aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]]. Since 1527, Wolsey's foreign policy had been dominated by his attempts to secure an annulment for his master, and by 1529, none of his endeavours had succeeded.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' pp 140-62.</ref>\n\n===The Annulment===\nHenry's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] had produced no sons who survived infancy; the [[Wars of the Roses]] were still within living memory, leading to the fear of a power struggle after Henry's death.  Henry felt the people would accept only a male sovereign, and not his daughter Mary.  Henry believed God had cursed him for the sin of marrying the widow of his elder brother.  He also believed that the papal dispensation for his marriage to Catherine was invalid because it was based upon the claim that Catherine was still a virgin after her first husband's death. Henry argued that Catherine's claim was not credible, and thus, the original papal dispensation must be withdrawn and their marriage annulled. Henry's motivation has been attributed to his determination to have a son and heir, and to his desire for [[Anne Boleyn]], one of his wife's [[Maids-of-Honour|maids-of-honour]]. Catherine had no further pregnancies after 1519; Henry began annulment proceedings in 1527.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' pp 149-59.</ref>\n\nCatherine, however, maintained that she had been a virgin when she married King Henry. Because Catherine was opposed to the annulment and a return to her previous status as Dowager Princess of Wales, the annulment request became a matter of international diplomacy, with Catherine's nephew, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], pressuring the Pope to not annul his aunt's marriage. [[Pope Clement VII]] was presented with a problem: he could either anger Charles or else anger Henry. He delayed announcing a decision for as long as possible; this infuriated Henry and Anne Boleyn, who began to doubt Wolsey's loyalty to the Crown over the Church.\n\nWolsey appealed to the Pope for an annulment on three fronts. Firstly, he tried to convince the Pope that the original papal dispensation was void as the marriage clearly went against instructions in the Bible, found in the book of [[Leviticus]]. Secondly, Wolsey objected to the original dispensation on technical grounds, and claimed it was incorrectly worded. (However, shortly afterwards, a correctly worded version was found in Spain.) Thirdly, Wolsey wanted the Pope to allow the final decision to be made in England, which of course, as papal legate, he would supervise.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' ch 7, 8.</ref>\n\nIn 1528 the Pope decided to allow two papal legates to decide the outcome in England: Wolsey and [[Lorenzo Campeggio|Cardinal Campeggio]]. Wolsey was confident of the decision. However, Campeggio took a long time to arrive, and when he finally did arrive he delayed proceedings so much, the case had to be suspended in July 1529, effectively sealing Wolsey's fate.\n\n==Domestic achievements==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--none of the sub-sections have references-->\nDuring his fourteen years of chancellorship, Cardinal Wolsey had more power than any other Crown servant in English history. However, this led to him being hated by much of the nobility who thought they should have the power. The King protected him from being attacked. Professor Sara Nair James says that in 1515\u20131529 Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, \"would be the most powerful man in England except, possibly, for the king\".<ref>Sara Nair James, \"Cardinal Wolsey: The English Cardinal Italianate\" in {{cite book|author=Christopher Cobb, ed. |title=Renaissance Papers 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K04ldsy8dHEC&pg=PA1|year=2009|publisher=Camden House|page=1|isbn=9781571133977}}</ref> As long as he was in the King's favour, Wolsey had a large amount of freedom within the domestic sphere, and had his hand in nearly every aspect of its ruling. For much of the time, Henry VIII had complete confidence in him, and as Henry's interests inclined more towards foreign policy, he was willing to give Wolsey a free hand in reforming the management of domestic affairs, for which Wolsey had grand plans. Historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] explains Wolsey's methods:\n\n{{quote|Only in the broadest respects was he [the king] taking independent decisions. ... It was Wolsey who almost invariably calculated the available options and ranked them for royal consideration; who established the parameters of each successive debate; who controlled the flow of official information; who selected the king's secretaries, middle-ranked officials, and JPs; and who promulgated decisions himself had largely shaped, if not strictly taken.<ref>John Guy, ''Tudor England'' (1988) p 87.</ref>}}\n\nOperating with the firm support of the king, and with special powers over the church given by the Pope as legate, Wolsey dominated civic affairs, administration, the law, the church, and foreign-policy. He was amazingly energetic and far-reaching. In terms of achievements, he built a great fortune for himself, and was a major benefactor of arts, humanities and education. He projected numerous reforms, with some success in areas such as finance, taxation educational provision and justice. However, from the king's perspective, his greatest failure was an inability to get a divorce when Henry VIII needed a new wife to give him a son who would be the undisputed heir to the throne. Historians agree that Wolsey was a man dogged by other men's failures and his own ambition. In the end, abandoned by the king, his enemies conspired against him and he died of natural causes before he could be beheaded.<ref>S. T. Bindoff, ''Tudor England'' (1950), p. 78.</ref><ref>J. D. Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors 1485\u20131558'' (1952), pp. 286\u2013334.</ref>\n\n===Taxation===\nWolsey made significant changes to the taxation system, devising, with the treasurer of the Chamber, John Heron, the \"Subsidy\". This revolutionary form of tax was based upon accurate valuations of the taxpayer's wealth, where one shilling was taken per pound from the income. The old fixed tax of 15ths and 10ths had meant that those who earned very little money had to pay almost as much in tax as the wealthy. With the new income tax the poorer members of society paid much less. This more efficient form of taxation enabled Wolsey to raise enough money for the King's foreign expeditions, bringing in over \u00a3300,000. Wolsey was also able to raise considerable amounts of capital through other means, such as through \"[[benevolence (tax)|benevolences]]\" and enforced loans from the nobility, which raised \u00a3200,000 in 1522.\n\n===Justice===\nAs a legal administrator Wolsey reinvented the equity court, where the verdict was decided by the judge on the principle of \"fairness\". As an alternative to the Common Law courts, Wolsey re-established the position of the prerogative courts of the [[Star Chamber]] and the [[Court of Chancery]]. The system in both courts concentrated on simple, inexpensive cases, and promised impartial justice. He also established the [[Court of Requests]] (although this court was only given this name later on) for the poor, where no fees were required. Wolsey's legal reforms were popular, and overflow courts were required to attend to all the cases. Many powerful individuals who had felt themselves invincible under the law found themselves convicted; for example, in 1515, the [[Earl of Northumberland]] was sent to [[Fleet Prison]] and in 1516 Lord Abergavenny was accused of illegal retaining.\n\nWolsey also used his courts to tackle national controversies, such as the pressing issue of [[enclosure]]s. The countryside had been thrown into discord by the entrepreneurial actions of landlords enclosing areas of land and converting from arable farming to pastoral farming, requiring fewer workers. The Tudors valued stability, and this mass urban migration represented a serious crisis. Wolsey conducted national enquires in 1517, 1518 and 1527 into the presence of enclosures. In the course of his administration he used the court of Chancery to prosecute two hundred and sixty-four landowners, including peers, bishops, knights, religious heads, and Oxford colleges. Enclosures were seen as directly linked to rural unemployment and depopulation, vagrancy, food shortages and, accordingly, inflation. This pattern was repeated with many of Wolsey's other initiatives, particularly his quest to abolish enclosure. Despite spending significant time and effort in investigating the state of the countryside and prosecuting numerous offenders, Wolsey freely surrendered his policy during the parliament of 1523 to ensure that Parliament passed his proposed taxes for Henry's war in France. Enclosures remained a problem for many years.\n\nWolsey used the Star Chamber to enforce his 1518 policy of ''Just Price'', which attempted to regulate the price of meat in London and other major cities. Those found to be charging excessive amounts were prosecuted by the Chamber. After the bad harvest of 1527, Wolsey took the initiative of buying up surplus grain and selling it off cheaply to the needy. This act of generosity greatly eased disorder and became common practice after a disappointing harvest.\n\n===Church reforms===\nIn 1524 and 1527 Wolsey used his powers as papal legate to dissolve thirty decayed monasteries where monastic life had virtually ceased in practice, including monasteries in Ipswich and Oxford. However, he then used the income to found a [[grammar school]] in [[Ipswich]] ([[The King's School, Ipswich]]) and [[Christ Church, Oxford#History|Cardinal College]] in [[Oxford]] (in 1532, after Wolsey's fall, the college was refounded as King Henry VIII's College by [[Henry VIII]]; it is now known as [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]). In 1528 he began to limit the [[benefit of clergy]]. He also attempted, as legate, to force reform on monastic orders like the Augustinian canons.\n\nWolsey died five years before Henry's [[dissolution of the monasteries]] began.\n\n===Relationships===\nWolsey's position in power relied solely on maintaining good relations with Henry. He grew increasingly suspicious of the \"minions\" \u2013 young, influential members of the [[Privy chamber]] \u2013 particularly after infiltrating one of his own men into the group. He attempted many times to disperse them from court, giving them jobs that took them to the Continent and far from the King. After the [[Amicable Grant]] failed, the minions began to undermine him once again. Consequently, Wolsey devised a grand plan of administrative reforms, incorporating the notorious [[Eltham ordinances|Eltham Ordinances]] of 1526. This reduced the members of the [[Privy Council]] from twelve to six, removing Henry's friends such as [[William Compton (courtier)|Sir William Compton]] and [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]].\n\nOne of Wolsey's greatest impediments was his lack of popularity amongst the nobles at court and in Parliament. Their dislikes and mistrusts partly stemmed from Wolsey's excessive demands for money in the form of the Subsidy or through Benevolences. They also resented the Act of Resumption of 1486, by which Henry VII had resumed possession of all lands granted by the crown since 1455.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/henryvii_ordinary_revenue.htm |title=History Learning Site |publisher=History Learning Site |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> These lands had passed onto his heir, Henry VIII. Many nobles resented the rise to power of a low-born man, whilst others simply disliked that he monopolised the court and concealed information from the Privy Council.\n\nWhen mass riots broke out in [[East Anglia]], which should have been under the control of the Dukes of [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Norfolk]] and [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Suffolk]], Henry was quick to denounce the Amicable Grant, and began to lose faith in his chief minister. During the relatively peaceful period in England after the War of the Roses, the population of the nation increased. With more demand for food and no additional supply, prices increased. Landowners were forced to enclose land and convert to pastoral farming, which brought in more profit. Wolsey's quest against enclosure was fruitless in terms of restoring the stability of the economy.\n\nThe same can be said for Wolsey's legal reforms. By making justice accessible to all and encouraging more people to bring their cases to court, the system was ultimately abused. The courts became overloaded with incoherent, tenuous cases, which would have been far too expensive to have rambled on in the Common Law courts. Wolsey eventually ordered all minor cases out of the Star Chamber in 1528. The result of this venture was further resentment from the nobility and the gentry.\n\n===Art patronage ===\nFrom 1515, when he became cardinal, until his death, Wolsey used art and architecture to underpin his positions. In fact, he initiated a building campaign on a scale that was not only unprecedented for an English churchman and Lord Chancellor, but also one that few English kings had exceeded.  In so doing, he brought Italian Renaissance ideas, classical embellishments, and architectural models into the English architectural mindset. Scholars generally cite Somerset House in London (1547\u201352) as the first classical building in England \u2013 built for Edward Seymour, the first Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector to King Edward VI. Wolsey, however, embraced Italian-inspired classicism nearly a half century before Seymour, but in a manner more theoretical than visual. Wolsey's subsequent disgrace over his failure to garner papal approval of an annulment of Henry VIII's marriage to Katherine of Aragon has clouded the fact that he was not only the first high-profile patron in England to seek out and promote Italian classicism in art, architecture, and magnificence, but also that his contributions endured.\n\nAmong Wolsey's projects were lavish, classically-inspired additions to York Palace in London, the residence of the Archbishop of York. He supervised the grandiose temporary buildings at the Field of Cloth of Gold; and he renovated Hampton Court, which he later relinquished to the king. Wolsey's use of architecture as a symbol of power, along with his introduction of Italian classical ornamentation, set a trend continued by Henry VIII and others.  Wolsey oversaw tombs for Henry's VIII's parents at Westminster Abbey and negotiated contracts for Henry VIII's tomb as well as one for himself.  If these works had been completed as planned, they would be among the largest, most elaborate, and grandest tombs in Europe.\n\n===Failures with the Church===\nAs well as his State duties, Wolsey simultaneously attempted to exert his influence over the Church in England. As cardinal and, from 1524, lifetime papal legate, Wolsey was continually vying for control over others in the Church. His principal rival was [[William Warham]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who made it more difficult for Wolsey to follow through with his plans for reform. Despite making promises to reform the bishoprics of England and Ireland, and, in 1519, encouraging monasteries to embark on a programme of reform, he did nothing to bring about these changes.\n\n==Downfall and death==\nIn spite of having many enemies, Cardinal Wolsey retained [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s confidence until Henry decided to seek an [[annulment]] of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], so that he could marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. Wolsey's failure to secure the annulment directly caused his downfall and arrest.\n\nIt was rumoured that Anne Boleyn and her [[Political faction|faction]] convinced Henry that Wolsey was deliberately slowing proceedings; as a result, he was arrested in 1529, and the Pope decided that the official decision should be made in Rome, not England.\n\nIn 1529 Wolsey was stripped of his government office and property, including his magnificently expanded residence of [[Hampton Court]], which Henry took to replace the [[Palace of Westminster]] as his own main London residence. However, Wolsey was permitted to remain Archbishop of York. He travelled to Yorkshire for the first time in his career, but at [[Cawood]] in [[North Yorkshire]], he was accused of [[treason]] and ordered to London by [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland]]. In great distress, he set out for the capital with his personal chaplain, [[Edmund Bonner]]. He fell ill on the journey, and died at [[Leicester]] on 29 November 1530, around the age of 57. Just before his death he reputedly spoke these words: <blockquote>I see the matter against me how it is framed. But if I had served God as diligently as I have done the King, he would not have given me over in my grey hairs.</blockquote>\n\nIn keeping with his practice of erecting magnificent buildings at Hampton Court, Westminster and Oxford, Wolsey had planned a magnificent tomb at Windsor by [[Benedetto da Rovezzano]] and [[Giovanni da Maiano]], but he was buried in [[Leicester Abbey]] (now [[Abbey Park, Leicester|Abbey Park]]) without a monument. Henry VIII contemplated using the impressive black sarcophagus for himself, but [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] now lies in it, in the crypt of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Henry often receives credit for artistic patronage that properly belongs to Wolsey.<ref>''Early Tudor Tombs'' by [[Edward Chaney]]</ref>\n\n==Mistress and issue==\nWolsey lived in a \"non-canonical\" marriage for around a decade with a woman called [[Joan Larke]] (born circa 1490) of [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], Norfolk. The edict that priests, regardless of their functions or the character of their work, should remain celibate had not been wholeheartedly accepted in England.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=skkTDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT74&pg=PT74#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Wolsey: The Life of King Henry VIII's Cardinal|last=Matusiak|first=John|date=1 September 2014|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780750957762|language=en}}</ref> Wolsey subsequently had two children, both born before he was made bishop. These were a son, [[Thomas Wynter]] (born circa 1510)<ref name=\"renaissance1\">''Cardinal Wolsey: A Life in Renaissance Europe'' by Stella Fletcher</ref> and a daughter, Dorothy (born circa 1512),<ref>''The Cardinal and the Secretary'' by Neville Williams</ref> both of whom lived to adulthood. The son was sent to live with a family in [[Willesden]] and was tutored in his early years by Maurice Birchinshaw. He later married and had children of his own. Dorothy was adopted by John Clansey, and was in due course placed in the convent at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]]. Following the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] (under [[Thomas Cromwell]]) she was awarded a pension.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary National Biography'', Thomas [Winter] Wynter.</ref> Following his rapid promotion, Larke became a source of embarrassment to Wolsey who arranged for her marriage to George Legh of Adlington, in Cheshire, circa 1519.

March 1473<ref>\"Alastair Armstrong, Henry VIII: Authority, Nation and Religion 1509\u20131540\"</ref> \u2013 29 November 1530) was an English [[archbishop]], [[Diplomat|statesman]] and a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. When [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the King's [[almoner]].<ref name=\"dictionary1\">\n''Oxford Dictionary National Biography'', Thomas Wolsey.\n</ref> Wolsey's affairs prospered, and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state. He also held important ecclesiastical appointments. These included the [[Archbishop of York|Archbishopric of York]] \u2013 the second most important role in the English church \u2013 and acting as [[Papal legate]]. His appointment as a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] by [[Pope Leo X]] in 1515 gave him precedence over all other English clergy.\n\nThe highest political position Wolsey attained was [[Lord Chancellor]], the King's chief adviser (formally, as his successor and disciple [[Thomas Cromwell]] was not). In that position, he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as an ''alter rex'' (other king). After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles. He retreated to York to fulfil his ecclesiastical duties as Archbishop of York, a position he nominally held but had neglected during his years in government. He was recalled to London to answer to charges of treason\u2014a common charge used by Henry against ministers who simply fell out of favour and did not necessarily commit actual treason\u2014but died on the way from natural causes.\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Wolsey was born about 1473, the son of Robert Wolsey of [[Ipswich]] and his wife Joan Daundy.<ref name=\"dictionary1\"/> Widespread traditions identify his father as a butcher; his modest origin became a topic of criticism later, when he rose to amass wealth and power thought (by the critics) more befitting a member of the high nobility. Wolsey attended [[Ipswich School]]<ref>''Thomas Wolsey (1473\u20131530), royal minister, archbishop of York, and cardinal'' by Sybil M. Jack in ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.</ref> and [[Magdalen College School, Oxford|Magdalen College School]] before studying theology at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. On 10 March 1498 he was ordained as a priest in [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]], Wiltshire,<ref>{{openplaque|2710}}</ref> and remained in Oxford, first as the Master of Magdalen College School, before quickly being appointed the dean of divinity. Between 1500 and 1509 he held a  living as rector of [[Church of Saint Mary, Limington|St Mary's church]], [[Limington]], in [[Somerset]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1056844 |desc=Church of Saint Mary |accessdate=12 October 2008 }}</ref> In 1502, he became a chaplain to [[Henry Deane (archbishop of Canterbury)|Henry Deane]], archbishop of Canterbury, who died the following year.<ref name=\"dictionary1\"/> He was then taken into the household of Sir Richard Nanfan, who made Wolsey executor of his estate. After Nanfan's death in 1507, Wolsey entered the service of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].\n\nWolsey benefitted from Henry VII's introduction of measures to curb the power of the [[nobility]] \u2013 the king was willing  to favour those from more humble backgrounds.<ref>Oxford Dictionary National Biography, Henry VII.</ref> Henry VII appointed Wolsey [[Ecclesiastical Household|royal chaplain]].<ref>Williams p.26</ref> In this position Wolsey served as secretary to [[Richard Foxe]], who recognised Wolsey's innate ability and dedication and appreciated his industry and willingness to take on tedious tasks.<ref>Oxford Dictionary National Biography, Richard Fox</ref> Thomas Wolsey's remarkable rise to power from humble origins testifies to his intelligence, administrative ability, industriousness, ambition for power, and rapport with the King. In April 1508, Wolsey was sent to Scotland to discuss with [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] rumours of the renewal of the [[Auld Alliance]].<ref>Macdougall, Norman, ''James IV'', Tuckwell (1997), p.254: ''Letters of James IV'', Scottish History Society (1953) pp. xlii, 107\u2013111</ref>\n\nWolsey's rise coincided with the accession in April 1509 of Henry VIII, whose character, policies and attitude to diplomacy differed significantly from those of his father. In 1509 Henry appointed Wolsey to the post of [[Almoner]]<nowiki/>, a position that gave him a seat on the [[Privy Council]] and gave him an opportunity for greater prominence and for establishing a personal rapport with the King.<ref>Williams, p. 26</ref> A factor in Wolsey's rise was the young Henry VIII's relative lack of interest in the details of government during his early years.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', \"Henry VIII\"; 2004</ref>\n\n===Rise to prominence===\n[[File:Wolsey banner.jpg|thumb|Heraldic [[banner]] of Cardinal Wolsey as [[Archbishop of York]], showing the arms of the [[See of York]] [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaling]] his personal [[coat of arms|arms]], with a [[cardinal's hat]] above. The [[griffin]] [[Supporter (heraldry)|supporter]] holds the Lord Chancellor's [[Ceremonial mace|Mace]]]] \nThe primary counsellors whom King Henry VIII inherited from his father were [[Richard Foxe]] ({{circa}} 1448\u20131528, Bishop of Winchester 1501\u20131528) and [[William Warham]] ({{circa}} 1450\u20131532, Archbishop of Canterbury 1503\u20131532). These were cautious and conservative, advising the King to act as a careful administrator like his father. Henry soon appointed to his Privy Council individuals more sympathetic to his own views and inclinations. Until 1511, Wolsey was adamantly anti-war. However, when the King expressed his enthusiasm for an invasion of France, Wolsey adapted his views to those of the King and gave persuasive speeches to the Privy Council in favour of war. Warham and Foxe, who failed to share the King's enthusiasm for the [[Anglo-French War (1512\u201314)|French war]] which started in 1512, fell from power (1515/1516), and Wolsey took over as the King's most trusted advisor and administrator. When Warham resigned as [[Lord Chancellor]] in 1515, probably under pressure from the King and from Wolsey, Henry appointed Wolsey in his place.<ref>\n''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', \"William Warham\"; 2004.\n</ref>\n\nWolsey made careful moves to destroy or neutralise the influence of other courtiers. He helped cause the fall of [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham]], in 1521; and in 1527 he prosecuted Henry's close friend [[William Compton (courtier)|William Compton]] and Henry's ex-mistress [[Anne Stafford, Countess of Huntingdon]], through the ecclesiastical courts for adultery. In the case of [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk]], Wolsey adopted a different strategy, attempting to win Suffolk's favour by his actions after the Duke secretly married Henry's sister [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor, Dowager Queen of France]], much to the King's displeasure. Wolsey advised the King not to execute the newlyweds, but to embrace them; whether this was through care for the couple or on account of the threat they represented for his own safety remains unclear. The bride, both as sister to Henry and as Dowager Queen of France, had high royal status that could have potentially meant a threat to Wolsey should she have so chosen.\n\nWolsey's rise to a position of great secular power paralleled his increasing status in the Church. He became a [[Canon of Windsor]] in 1511. In 1514 he was made [[Bishop of Lincoln]], and then Archbishop of York in the same year. [[Pope Leo X]] made him a cardinal in 1515, with the titular church of [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere|St Cecilia in Trastevere]]. Following the success of the English campaign in France and the peace negotiations that followed, Wolsey's ecclesiastical career advanced further: in 1523 he became additionally [[Bishop of Durham]], a post with wide political powers, and thus became known as Prince-Bishop of Durham.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n[[File:Wolsey.jpg|thumb|right|\"Cardinal Woolsey\" (an archaic spelling<ref>{{cite book| author = Sir Egerton Brydges| title = Censura literaria: Containing titles, abstracts, and opinions of old English books, with original disquisitions, articles of biography, and other literary antiquities| year = 1815| url = https://archive.org/details/censuraliterari21brydgoog| accessdate = 25 June 2009| publisher = Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown }}</ref>) by an unknown artist c.1520. Detail from an oil on panel in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]], London.]]\n\n===War with France===\nThe war against France in 1512\u20131514 was the most significant opportunity for Wolsey to demonstrate his talents in the foreign policy arena. A convenient justification for going to war came in 1511 in the form of a plea for help from [[Pope Julius II]], who was beginning to feel threatened by France. England formed an alliance with the Pope, [[Ferdinand V of Spain]], and [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] against [[Louis XII of France]].<ref name=\"Scarisbrick, pp 31-36\">Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' pp 31-36.</ref>\n\nThe first campaign against France was not a success, partly due to the unreliability of the alliance with Ferdinand. Henry learned from the mistakes of the campaign and in 1513, still with papal support, launched a joint attack on France with Maximilian, successfully [[battle of Guinegate (1513)|capturing two French cities]] and causing the French to retreat. Wolsey's ability to keep a large number of troops supplied and equipped for the duration of the war was a major factor in its success. Wolsey also had a key role in negotiating the Anglo-French treaty of 1514, which secured a temporary peace between the two nations. Under this treaty, the French king, [[Louis XII]], would marry Henry's young sister, Mary. In addition England was able to keep the captured city of [[Tournai]] and to secure an increase in the annual pension paid by France.<ref>J.D. Mackie,  ''The Earlier Tudors, 1485\u20131558'' (1952), pp. 271\u201377</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a turnover of rulers in Europe threatened to diminish England's influence. Peace with France in 1514 had been a true achievement for Wolsey and the King. With Henry's sister, Mary, married to the French King, Louis XII, an alliance was formed, but Louis was not in good health. Less than three months later, Louis died and was replaced by the young and ambitious [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].\n\nQueen Mary had allegedly secured a promise from Henry that if Louis died, she could marry whomever she pleased.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Barbara|year=1989|title=Power, Profit, and Passion: Mary Tudor, Charles Brandon, and the Arranged Marriage in Early Tudor England|url=|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=15|pages=59\u201388|doi=10.2307/3177818|jstor=3177818}}</ref> On Louis' death, she secretly married [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], with Francis I's assistance, which prevented another marriage alliance. As Mary was the only princess Henry could use to secure marriage alliances, this was a bitter blow. Wolsey then proposed an alliance with Spain and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] against France.\n\n===Papal legate===\n[[File:Thomas Wolsey (1473-1530).jpg|alt=Thomas Wolsey (1473-1530), Lord High Chancellor of England (1515-1529), Archbishop of York (1514-1530), Cardinal (1515), the King's chief adviser|thumb|Thomas Wolsey (1473-1530), Lord High Chancellor of England (1515-1529), Archbishop of York (1514-1530), Cardinal (1515), the King's chief adviser]]\nThe death in 1516 of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand of Spain]], the father-in-law of Henry VIII, and England's closest ally, was a further blow. Ferdinand was succeeded by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who immediately proposed peace with France. On the death of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], in 1519, Charles was elected in his stead; thus Charles ruled a substantial portion of Europe and English influence became limited on the continent.\n\nWolsey, however, managed to assert English influence through another means. In 1517, [[Pope Leo X]] sought peace in Europe to form a crusade against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1518 Wolsey was made [[Papal Legate]] in England, enabling him to work for the Pope's desire for peace by organising the [[Treaty of London (1518)|Treaty of London]]. The Treaty showed Wolsey as the arbiter of Europe, organising a massive peace summit involving twenty nations. This put England at the forefront of European diplomacy and drew her out of isolation, making her a desirable ally. This is well illustrated by the Anglo-French treaty signed two days afterwards. It was partly this peace treaty that caused conflict between France and Spain. In 1519, when Charles V ascended to the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], the King of France, was infuriated. He had invested enormous sums in bribing the electorate to elect him as emperor, and thus, he used the Treaty of London as a justification for the Habsburg-Valois conflict. Wolsey appeared to act as mediator between the two powers, both of whom were vying for England's support.<ref>Gwyn, ''The King's Cardinal'' pp 58-103.</ref>\n\n===Field of the Cloth of Gold===\nAnother of his diplomatic triumphs was the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]], in 1520.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' pp 74-80.</ref> Wolsey organised much of this grandiose meeting between [[Francis I of France]] and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], accompanied by some five thousand followers and involving court activities more than military discussion. Though it seemed to open the door to peaceful negotiations with France, if that was the direction the King wished to go, it was also a chance for a lavish display of English wealth and power before the rest of Europe, through flamboyant celebrations and events such as jousting, where the two Kings personally competed against each other. With both France and Spain vying for England's allegiance, Wolsey could choose the ally that better suited his policies. Wolsey chose Charles mainly because England's economy would suffer from the loss of the lucrative cloth trade industry between England and the Netherlands had France been chosen instead.<ref>Mackie, ''Earlier Tudors'' pp 310-12.</ref>\n\nUnder Wolsey's guidance, the chief nations of Europe sought to outlaw war forever among Christian nations. Garret Mattingly studied the causes of wars in that era, finding that treaties of nonaggression such as this one could never be stronger than the armies of their sponsors. When those forces were about equal, these treaties typically widened the conflict. That is, diplomacy could sometimes postpone war, but could not prevent wars based on irreconcilable interests and ambitions. What was lacking, Mattingly concludes, was a neutral power whose judgements were generally accepted either by impartial justice or by overwhelming force.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1898719|last1 = Mattingly|first1 = Garrett|title = An Early Nonaggression Pact|journal = The Journal of Modern History|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 1\u201330|year = 1938|doi = 10.1086/243493}}</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Spain===\nThe Treaty of London is often regarded as Wolsey's finest moment, but it was abandoned within a year. Wolsey developed links with Charles in 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Later at the Calais Conference (1521) Wolsey signed the Secret [[Italian War of 1521\u20131526|Treaty of Bruges (1521)]] with Charles, stating that they would join Spain in a war against France if France refused to sign the peace treaty; ignoring the Anglo-French treaty of 1518. Wolsey's relationship with Rome was also ambivalent. Despite his links to the papacy, Wolsey was strictly Henry's servant. Though the Treaty of London was an elaboration on Pope Leo's ambitions for European peace, it was seen in Rome as a vain attempt by England to assert her influence over Europe and steal some papal thunder. Furthermore, Wolsey's peace initiatives prevented a crusade to the [[Holy Land]], which was the catalyst for the Pope's desire for European peace.<ref name=\"Scarisbrick, pp 31-36\"/>\n\nCardinal [[Lorenzo Campeggio]], who represented the Pope at the Treaty of London, was kept waiting for many months in Calais before being allowed to cross the Channel and join the festivities in London; thereby, Wolsey was asserting his independence of Rome. An alternative hypothesis is that Campeggio was kept waiting until Wolsey received his legacy, thus asserting Wolsey's attachment to Rome.\n\nThough the English gain from the wars of 1522\u201323 was minimal, their contribution certainly aided Charles in his defeat of the French, particularly in 1525 at the [[Battle of Pavia]], where Charles' army captured the French king, Francis I. Henry then felt there was a realistic opportunity for him to seize the French crown, to which the kings of England had long laid claim. Parliament, however, refused to raise taxes. This led Wolsey to devise the [[Amicable Grant]], which was met with even more hostility, and ultimately led to his downfall. In 1525, after Charles had abandoned England as an ally, Wolsey began to negotiate with France, and the [[Treaty of the More]] was signed, during Francis' captivity, with the Regent of France \u2013 his mother, [[Louise of Savoy]].<ref>G.W. Bernard, ''War, Taxation, and Rebellion in Early Tudor England: Henry VIII, Wolsey, and the Amicable Grant of 1525'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 1986).</ref>\n\nThe closeness between England and Rome can be seen in the formulation of the [[League of Cognac]] in 1526. Though England was not a part of it, the League was organised in part by Wolsey with papal support. Wolsey's plan was that the League of Cognac, composed of an alliance between France and some Italian states, would challenge Charles' [[League of Cambrai]]. This initiative was both a gesture of allegiance to Rome and an answer to growing concerns about Charles V's dominance over Europe.\n\nThe final blow to this policy came in 1529, when the French made peace with Charles. Meanwhile, the French also continued to honour the \"[[Auld Alliance]]\" with Scotland, stirring up hostility on England's border. With peace between France and the Emperor, there was no-one to free the Pope from Charles, who had effectively held Clement VII captive since the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527. Therefore, there was little hope of securing Henry an annulment from his marriage to Charles\u2019 aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]]. Since 1527, Wolsey's foreign policy had been dominated by his attempts to secure an annulment for his master, and by 1529, none of his endeavours had succeeded.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' pp 140-62.</ref>\n\n===The Annulment===\nHenry's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] had produced no sons who survived infancy; the [[Wars of the Roses]] were still within living memory, leading to the fear of a power struggle after Henry's death.  Henry felt the people would accept only a male sovereign, and not his daughter Mary.  Henry believed God had cursed him for the sin of marrying the widow of his elder brother.  He also believed that the papal dispensation for his marriage to Catherine was invalid because it was based upon the claim that Catherine was still a virgin after her first husband's death. Henry argued that Catherine's claim was not credible, and thus, the original papal dispensation must be withdrawn and their marriage annulled. Henry's motivation has been attributed to his determination to have a son and heir, and to his desire for [[Anne Boleyn]], one of his wife's [[Maids-of-Honour|maids-of-honour]]. Catherine had no further pregnancies after 1519; Henry began annulment proceedings in 1527.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' pp 149-59.</ref>\n\nCatherine, however, maintained that she had been a virgin when she married King Henry. Because Catherine was opposed to the annulment and a return to her previous status as Dowager Princess of Wales, the annulment request became a matter of international diplomacy, with Catherine's nephew, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], pressuring the Pope to not annul his aunt's marriage. [[Pope Clement VII]] was presented with a problem: he could either anger Charles or else anger Henry. He delayed announcing a decision for as long as possible; this infuriated Henry and Anne Boleyn, who began to doubt Wolsey's loyalty to the Crown over the Church.\n\nWolsey appealed to the Pope for an annulment on three fronts. Firstly, he tried to convince the Pope that the original papal dispensation was void as the marriage clearly went against instructions in the Bible, found in the book of [[Leviticus]]. Secondly, Wolsey objected to the original dispensation on technical grounds, and claimed it was incorrectly worded. (However, shortly afterwards, a correctly worded version was found in Spain.) Thirdly, Wolsey wanted the Pope to allow the final decision to be made in England, which of course, as papal legate, he would supervise.<ref>Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' ch 7, 8.</ref>\n\nIn 1528 the Pope decided to allow two papal legates to decide the outcome in England: Wolsey and [[Lorenzo Campeggio|Cardinal Campeggio]]. Wolsey was confident of the decision. However, Campeggio took a long time to arrive, and when he finally did arrive he delayed proceedings so much, the case had to be suspended in July 1529, effectively sealing Wolsey's fate.\n\n==Domestic achievements==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--none of the sub-sections have references-->\nDuring his fourteen years of chancellorship, Cardinal Wolsey had more power than any other Crown servant in English history. However, this led to him being hated by much of the nobility who thought they should have the power. The King protected him from being attacked. Professor Sara Nair James says that in 1515\u20131529 Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, \"would be the most powerful man in England except, possibly, for the king\".<ref>Sara Nair James, \"Cardinal Wolsey: The English Cardinal Italianate\" in {{cite book|author=Christopher Cobb, ed. |title=Renaissance Papers 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K04ldsy8dHEC&pg=PA1|year=2009|publisher=Camden House|page=1|isbn=9781571133977}}</ref> As long as he was in the King's favour, Wolsey had a large amount of freedom within the domestic sphere, and had his hand in nearly every aspect of its ruling. For much of the time, Henry VIII had complete confidence in him, and as Henry's interests inclined more towards foreign policy, he was willing to give Wolsey a free hand in reforming the management of domestic affairs, for which Wolsey had grand plans. Historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] explains Wolsey's methods:\n\n{{quote|Only in the broadest respects was he [the king] taking independent decisions. ... It was Wolsey who almost invariably calculated the available options and ranked them for royal consideration; who established the parameters of each successive debate; who controlled the flow of official information; who selected the king's secretaries, middle-ranked officials, and JPs; and who promulgated decisions himself had largely shaped, if not strictly taken.<ref>John Guy, ''Tudor England'' (1988) p 87.</ref>}}\n\nOperating with the firm support of the king, and with special powers over the church given by the Pope as legate, Wolsey dominated civic affairs, administration, the law, the church, and foreign-policy. He was amazingly energetic and far-reaching. In terms of achievements, he built a great fortune for himself, and was a major benefactor of arts, humanities and education. He projected numerous reforms, with some success in areas such as finance, taxation educational provision and justice. However, from the king's perspective, his greatest failure was an inability to get a divorce when Henry VIII needed a new wife to give him a son who would be the undisputed heir to the throne. Historians agree that Wolsey was a man dogged by other men's failures and his own ambition. In the end, abandoned by the king, his enemies conspired against him and he died of natural causes before he could be beheaded.<ref>S. T. Bindoff, ''Tudor England'' (1950), p. 78.</ref><ref>J. D. Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors 1485\u20131558'' (1952), pp. 286\u2013334.</ref>\n\n===Taxation===\nWolsey made significant changes to the taxation system, devising, with the treasurer of the Chamber, John Heron, the \"Subsidy\". This revolutionary form of tax was based upon accurate valuations of the taxpayer's wealth, where one shilling was taken per pound from the income. The old fixed tax of 15ths and 10ths had meant that those who earned very little money had to pay almost as much in tax as the wealthy. With the new income tax the poorer members of society paid much less. This more efficient form of taxation enabled Wolsey to raise enough money for the King's foreign expeditions, bringing in over \u00a3300,000. Wolsey was also able to raise considerable amounts of capital through other means, such as through \"[[benevolence (tax)|benevolences]]\" and enforced loans from the nobility, which raised \u00a3200,000 in 1522.\n\n===Justice===\nAs a legal administrator Wolsey reinvented the equity court, where the verdict was decided by the judge on the principle of \"fairness\". As an alternative to the Common Law courts, Wolsey re-established the position of the prerogative courts of the [[Star Chamber]] and the [[Court of Chancery]]. The system in both courts concentrated on simple, inexpensive cases, and promised impartial justice. He also established the [[Court of Requests]] (although this court was only given this name later on) for the poor, where no fees were required. Wolsey's legal reforms were popular, and overflow courts were required to attend to all the cases. Many powerful individuals who had felt themselves invincible under the law found themselves convicted; for example, in 1515, the [[Earl of Northumberland]] was sent to [[Fleet Prison]] and in 1516 Lord Abergavenny was accused of illegal retaining.\n\nWolsey also used his courts to tackle national controversies, such as the pressing issue of [[enclosure]]s. The countryside had been thrown into discord by the entrepreneurial actions of landlords enclosing areas of land and converting from arable farming to pastoral farming, requiring fewer workers. The Tudors valued stability, and this mass urban migration represented a serious crisis. Wolsey conducted national enquires in 1517, 1518 and 1527 into the presence of enclosures. In the course of his administration he used the court of Chancery to prosecute two hundred and sixty-four landowners, including peers, bishops, knights, religious heads, and Oxford colleges. Enclosures were seen as directly linked to rural unemployment and depopulation, vagrancy, food shortages and, accordingly, inflation. This pattern was repeated with many of Wolsey's other initiatives, particularly his quest to abolish enclosure. Despite spending significant time and effort in investigating the state of the countryside and prosecuting numerous offenders, Wolsey freely surrendered his policy during the parliament of 1523 to ensure that Parliament passed his proposed taxes for Henry's war in France. Enclosures remained a problem for many years.\n\nWolsey used the Star Chamber to enforce his 1518 policy of ''Just Price'', which attempted to regulate the price of meat in London and other major cities. Those found to be charging excessive amounts were prosecuted by the Chamber. After the bad harvest of 1527, Wolsey took the initiative of buying up surplus grain and selling it off cheaply to the needy. This act of generosity greatly eased disorder and became common practice after a disappointing harvest.\n\n===Church reforms===\nIn 1524 and 1527 Wolsey used his powers as papal legate to dissolve thirty decayed monasteries where monastic life had virtually ceased in practice, including monasteries in Ipswich and Oxford. However, he then used the income to found a [[grammar school]] in [[Ipswich]] ([[The King's School, Ipswich]]) and [[Cardinal College]] in [[Oxford]] (in 1532, after Wolsey's fall, the college was refounded as King Henry VIII's College by [[Henry VIII]]; it is now known as [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]). In 1528 he began to limit the [[benefit of clergy]]. He also attempted, as legate, to force reform on monastic orders like the Augustinian canons.\n\nWolsey died five years before Henry's [[dissolution of the monasteries]] began.\n\n===Relationships===\nWolsey's position in power relied solely on maintaining good relations with Henry. He grew increasingly suspicious of the \"minions\" \u2013 young, influential members of the [[Privy chamber]] \u2013 particularly after infiltrating one of his own men into the group. He attempted many times to disperse them from court, giving them jobs that took them to the Continent and far from the King. After the [[Amicable Grant]] failed, the minions began to undermine him once again. Consequently, Wolsey devised a grand plan of administrative reforms, incorporating the notorious [[Eltham ordinances|Eltham Ordinances]] of 1526. This reduced the members of the [[Privy Council]] from twelve to six, removing Henry's friends such as [[William Compton (courtier)|Sir William Compton]] and [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]].\n\nOne of Wolsey's greatest impediments was his lack of popularity amongst the nobles at court and in Parliament. Their dislikes and mistrusts partly stemmed from Wolsey's excessive demands for money in the form of the Subsidy or through Benevolences. They also resented the Act of Resumption of 1486, by which Henry VII had resumed possession of all lands granted by the crown since 1455.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/henryvii_ordinary_revenue.htm |title=History Learning Site |publisher=History Learning Site |date=30 March 2007 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}</ref> These lands had passed onto his heir, Henry VIII. Many nobles resented the rise to power of a low-born man, whilst others simply disliked that he monopolised the court and concealed information from the Privy Council.\n\nWhen mass riots broke out in [[East Anglia]], which should have been under the control of the Dukes of [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Norfolk]] and [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Suffolk]], Henry was quick to denounce the Amicable Grant, and began to lose faith in his chief minister. During the relatively peaceful period in England after the War of the Roses, the population of the nation increased. With more demand for food and no additional supply, prices increased. Landowners were forced to enclose land and convert to pastoral farming, which brought in more profit. Wolsey's quest against enclosure was fruitless in terms of restoring the stability of the economy.\n\nThe same can be said for Wolsey's legal reforms. By making justice accessible to all and encouraging more people to bring their cases to court, the system was ultimately abused. The courts became overloaded with incoherent, tenuous cases, which would have been far too expensive to have rambled on in the Common Law courts. Wolsey eventually ordered all minor cases out of the Star Chamber in 1528. The result of this venture was further resentment from the nobility and the gentry.\n\n===Art patronage ===\nFrom 1515, when he became cardinal, until his death, Wolsey used art and architecture to underpin his positions. In fact, he initiated a building campaign on a scale that was not only unprecedented for an English churchman and Lord Chancellor, but also one that few English kings had exceeded.  In so doing, he brought Italian Renaissance ideas, classical embellishments, and architectural models into the English architectural mindset. Scholars generally cite Somerset House in London (1547\u201352) as the first classical building in England \u2013 built for Edward Seymour, the first Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector to King Edward VI. Wolsey, however, embraced Italian-inspired classicism nearly a half century before Seymour, but in a manner more theoretical than visual. Wolsey's subsequent disgrace over his failure to garner papal approval of an annulment of Henry VIII's marriage to Katherine of Aragon has clouded the fact that he was not only the first high-profile patron in England to seek out and promote Italian classicism in art, architecture, and magnificence, but also that his contributions endured.\n\nAmong Wolsey's projects were lavish, classically-inspired additions to York Palace in London, the residence of the Archbishop of York. He supervised the grandiose temporary buildings at the Field of Cloth of Gold; and he renovated Hampton Court, which he later relinquished to the king. Wolsey's use of architecture as a symbol of power, along with his introduction of Italian classical ornamentation, set a trend continued by Henry VIII and others.  Wolsey oversaw tombs for Henry's VIII's parents at Westminster Abbey and negotiated contracts for Henry VIII's tomb as well as one for himself.  If these works had been completed as planned, they would be among the largest, most elaborate, and grandest tombs in Europe.\n\n===Failures with the Church===\nAs well as his State duties, Wolsey simultaneously attempted to exert his influence over the Church in England. As cardinal and, from 1524, lifetime papal legate, Wolsey was continually vying for control over others in the Church. His principal rival was [[William Warham]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], who made it more difficult for Wolsey to follow through with his plans for reform. Despite making promises to reform the bishoprics of England and Ireland, and, in 1519, encouraging monasteries to embark on a programme of reform, he did nothing to bring about these changes.\n\n==Downfall and death==\nIn spite of having many enemies, Cardinal Wolsey retained [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s confidence until Henry decided to seek an [[annulment]] of his marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]], so that he could marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. Wolsey's failure to secure the annulment directly caused his downfall and arrest.\n\nIt was rumoured that Anne Boleyn and her [[Political faction|faction]] convinced Henry that Wolsey was deliberately slowing proceedings; as a result, he was arrested in 1529, and the Pope decided that the official decision should be made in Rome, not England.\n\nIn 1529 Wolsey was stripped of his government office and property, including his magnificently expanded residence of [[Hampton Court]], which Henry took to replace the [[Palace of Westminster]] as his own main London residence. However, Wolsey was permitted to remain Archbishop of York. He travelled to Yorkshire for the first time in his career, but at [[Cawood]] in [[North Yorkshire]], he was accused of [[treason]] and ordered to London by [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland]]. In great distress, he set out for the capital with his personal chaplain, [[Edmund Bonner]]. He fell ill on the journey, and died at [[Leicester]] on 29 November 1530, around the age of 57. Just before his death he reputedly spoke these words: <blockquote>I see the matter against me how it is framed. But if I had served God as diligently as I have done the King, he would not have given me over in my grey hairs.</blockquote>\n\nIn keeping with his practice of erecting magnificent buildings at Hampton Court, Westminster and Oxford, Wolsey had planned a magnificent tomb at Windsor by [[Benedetto da Rovezzano]] and [[Giovanni da Maiano]], but he was buried in [[Leicester Abbey]] (now [[Abbey Park, Leicester|Abbey Park]]) without a monument. Henry VIII contemplated using the impressive black sarcophagus for himself, but [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] now lies in it, in the crypt of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Henry often receives credit for artistic patronage that properly belongs to Wolsey.<ref>''Early Tudor Tombs'' by [[Edward Chaney]]</ref>\n\n==Mistress and issue==\nWolsey lived in a \"non-canonical\" marriage for around a decade with a woman called [[Joan Larke]] (born circa 1490) of [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], Norfolk. The edict that priests, regardless of their functions or the character of their work, should remain celibate had not been wholeheartedly accepted in England.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=skkTDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT74&pg=PT74#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Wolsey: The Life of King Henry VIII's Cardinal|last=Matusiak|first=John|date=1 September 2014|publisher=The History Press|isbn=9780750957762|language=en}}</ref> Wolsey subsequently had two children, both born before he was made bishop. These were a son, [[Thomas Wynter]] (born circa 1510)<ref name=\"renaissance1\">''Cardinal Wolsey: A Life in Renaissance Europe'' by Stella Fletcher</ref> and a daughter, Dorothy (born circa 1512),<ref>''The Cardinal and the Secretary'' by Neville Williams</ref> both of whom lived to adulthood. The son was sent to live with a family in [[Willesden]] and was tutored in his early years by Maurice Birchinshaw. He later married and had children of his own. Dorothy was adopted by John Clansey, and was in due course placed in the convent at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]]. Following the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] (under [[Thomas Cromwell]]) she was awarded a pension.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary National Biography'', Thomas [Winter] Wynter.</ref> Following his rapid promotion, Larke became a source of embarrassment to Wolsey who arranged for her marriage to George Legh of Adlington, in Cheshire, circa 1519.

[[Henry Irving]], [[Walter Hampden]] and [[John Gielgud]] were well known for their stage performances of the role, and [[Timothy West]] played him in the 1979 [[BBC Television Shakespeare]] production of that play. Henry Irving's reading of Wolsey's Farewell survives on a rare wax cylinder recording.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/phono.htm |title=HENRY IRVING and the PHONOGRAPH: BENNETT MAXWELL |first=Michael |last=Kilgarriff |publisher=Theirvingsociety.org.uk |accessdate=14 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308020954/http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/phono.htm |archivedate=8 March 2012  }}</ref>\n* Wolsey is a minor but important character in [[Robert Bolt]]'s play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]''; he was played in the two film versions of the play by [[Orson Welles]] ([[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|1966]]) and [[John Gielgud]] ([[A Man for All Seasons (1988 film)|1988]]), respectively.\n* Wolsey was portrayed somewhat more sympathetically in the film ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days]]'' (1969) \u2013 a performance that earned [[Anthony Quayle]] an [[Academy Award]] nomination.\n* Wolsey was played by [[John Baskcomb]] in ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (BBC TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' (1970) and by [[John Bryans]] when this series was made into the film ''[[Henry VIII and His Six Wives]]'' (1972).\n* [[David Suchet]] plays him in ''Henry VIII'' with [[Ray Winstone]].\n* [[Terry Scott]] portrayed a rather comical Wolsey in ''[[Carry On Henry]]'' (1970).\n* [[William Griffis]] played Wolsey in the Broadway musical ''[[Rex (musical)|Rex]]'', which starred [[Nicol Williamson]] as King Henry.

For clarity, the graphs are shown displaced from integer {{var|y}} values. In&nbsp;[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Comparison_rounding_graphs_SMIL.svg the&nbsp;SVG&nbsp;file], hover over a method to highlight it and, in [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]]-enabled browsers, click to select or deselect it.]]\n'''Rounding''' a [[number]] means replacing it with a different number that is [[approximation|approximately]] [[equality (mathematics)|equal]] to the original, but has a [[concision|shorter]], [[simplicity|simpler]], or more explicit representation; for example, replacing ${{formatnum:23.4476}} with ${{formatnum:23.45}}, or the fraction 312/937 with 1/3, or the expression {{radic|2}} with {{formatnum:1.414}}.\n\nRounding is often done to obtain a value that is easier to [[report]] and [[communication|communicate]] than the original. Rounding can also be important to avoid [[false precision|misleadingly precise]] reporting of a computed number, [[measurement]] or [[estimation|estimate]]; for example, a quantity that was computed as {{formatnum:123456}} but is known to be [[accuracy and precision|accurate]] only to within a few hundred units is usually better stated as \"about {{formatnum:123500}}\".\n\nOn the other hand, rounding of exact numbers will introduce some [[round-off error]] in the reported result. Rounding is almost unavoidable when reporting many computations \u2013 especially when dividing two numbers in [[integer]] or [[fixed-point arithmetic]]; when computing mathematical functions such as [[square root]]s, [[logarithm]]s, and [[sine]]s; or when using a [[floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] representation with a fixed number of [[significant digit]]s. In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally [[propagation of uncertainty|accumulate]], and in certain [[ill-conditioned]] cases they may make the result meaningless.\n\nAccurate rounding of [[transcendental function|transcendental mathematical functions]] is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as \"[[#Table-maker's dilemma|the table-maker's dilemma]]\".\n\nRounding has many similarities to the [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] that occurs when [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] must be encoded by numbers or [[digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s.\n\nA [[approximately equals sign|wavy equals sign]] (<big>'''[[\u2248]]'''</big><!-- unicode U+2248 -->: ''approximately equal to'') is sometimes used to indicate rounding of exact numbers, e.g., 9.98 \u2248 10. This sign was introduced by [[Alfred George Greenhill]] in 1892.<ref>Isaiah Lankham, [[Bruno Nachtergaele]], [[Anne Schilling]]: ''Linear Algebra as an Introduction to Abstract Mathematics.'' World Scientific, Singapur 2016, {{ISBN|978-981-4730-35-8}}, p. 186.</ref>\n\nIdeal characteristics of rounding methods include:\n\n# Rounding should be done by a [[function (mathematics)|function]]. This way, when the same input is rounded in different instances, the output is unchanged.\n# Calculations done with rounding should be close to those done without rounding.\n#* As a result of (1) and (2), the output from rounding should be close to its input, often as close as possible by some [[metric (mathematics)|metric]].\n# To be considered rounding, the [[range of a function|range]] will be a subset of the [[domain of a function|domain]]. A classical range is the integers, '''[[Integer|Z]]'''.\n# Rounding should preserve [[symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] that already exist between the domain and range. With finite precision (or a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] domain), this translates to removing [[bias (statistics)|bias]].\n# A rounding method should have utility in computer science or human arithmetic where finite precision is used, and speed is a consideration.\n\nBut, because it is not usually possible for a method to satisfy all ideal characteristics, many methods exist.\n\nAs a general rule, rounding is [[idempotence|idempotent]];<ref>{{cite journal|author-last=Kulisch||author-first=Ulrich W.|author-link=Ulrich W. Kulisch|date=July 1977|title=Mathematical foundation of computer arithmetic|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=C-26|pages=610\u2013621|doi=10.1109/TC.1977.1674893|number=7}}</ref> i.e., once a number has been rounded, rounding it again will not change its value. Rounding functions are also [[monotonic function|monotonic]]; i.e., rounding a larger number results in the same or larger result than rounding the smaller number.\n\n==Types of rounding==\nTypical rounding problems include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rounding problem\n!Example input\n!Result\n!Rounding criteria\n|-\n|approximating an irrational number by a fraction\n| [[pi|{{pi}}]]\n| 22&#8239;/&#8239;7\n| 1-digit-denominator\n|-\n|approximating a [[rational number]] by another fraction with smaller numerator and denominator\n| 399&#8239;/&#8239;941\n| 3&#8239;/&#8239;7\n| 1-digit-denominator\n|-\n|approximating a fraction, which have periodic decimal expansion, by a finite decimal fraction\n|5&#8239;/&#8239;3\n|{{formatnum:1.6667}}\n|4 trailing digits\n|-\n|approximating a fractional [[decimal number]] by one with fewer digits\n|{{formatnum:2.1784}}\n|2.18\n|2 trailing digits\n|-\n|approximating a decimal [[integer]] by an integer with more trailing zeros\n|{{formatnum:23217}}\n|{{formatnum:23200}}\n|2 trailing zeros\n|-\n|approximating a large decimal [[integer]] using scientific notation\n|{{formatnum:300,999,999}}\n|{{formatnum:3.01}}&#8239;\u00d7&#8239;{{formatnum:10}}<sup>8</sup>\n|2 trailing digits\n|-\n|approximating a value by a multiple of a specified amount\n|48.2\n|45\n|multiple of 15\n|}\n\n==Rounding to integer==\nThe most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of an abstract single-argument \"round()\" procedure. These are true functions (with the exception of those that use randomness).\n\n===Directed rounding to an integer===\nThese four methods are called '''directed rounding''', as the displacements from the original number {{var|x}} to the rounded value {{var|y}} are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, [[extended real number line|+\u221e]], or \u2212\u221e). Directed rounding is used in [[interval arithmetic]] and is often required in financial calculations.\n\nIf {{var|x}} is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero. If {{var|x}} is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if {{var|x}} is an integer, {{var|y}} is just {{var|x}}.\n\nWhere many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new [[stock index|index]] set up by the [[Vancouver Stock Exchange]] in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000 (three decimal places of accuracy), and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 \u2014 whereas [[stock price]]s had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.<ref>{{cite book|title=Accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms|author-first=Nicholas John |author-last=Higham|author-link=Nicholas Higham|page=54|isbn=978-0-89871-521-7|date=2002}}</ref>\n\nFor the examples below, {{math|sgn(''x'')}} refers to the [[sign function]] applied to the original number, {{math|''x''}}.\n\n====Rounding down====\n*'''round down''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|floor]]''', or '''round towards minus infinity'''): {{var|y}} is the largest integer that does not exceed {{var|x}}.\n*:<math>y = \\mathrm{floor}(x) = \\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor = -\\left\\lceil -x \\right\\rceil</math>\n\n====Rounding up====\n*'''round up''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]]''', or '''round towards plus infinity'''): {{var|y}} is the smallest integer that is not less than {{var|x}}.\n*:<math>y = \\operatorname{ceil}(x) = \\left\\lceil x \\right\\rceil = -\\left\\lfloor -x \\right\\rfloor</math>\n\n====Rounding towards zero====\n*'''round towards zero''' (or '''[[truncation|truncate]]''', or '''round away from infinity'''): {{var|y}} is the integer part of {{var|x}}, without its fraction digits.\n*:<math>y = \\operatorname{truncate}(x) = \\sgn(x) \\left\\lfloor \\left| x \\right| \\right\\rfloor = -\\sgn(x) \\left\\lceil -\\left| x \\right| \\right\\rceil</math>\n\n====Rounding away from zero====\n*'''round away from zero''' (or '''round towards infinity'''): if {{var|x}} is an integer, {{var|y}} is {{var|x}}; else {{var|y}} is the integer that is closest to 0 and is such that {{var|x}} is between 0 and {{var|y}}.\n*:<math>y = \\sgn(x) \\left\\lceil \\left| x \\right| \\right\\rceil = -\\sgn(x) \\left\\lfloor -\\left| x \\right| \\right\\rfloor</math>\n\n===Rounding to the nearest integer===\nRounding a number {{var|x}} to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when {{var|x}} is exactly half-way between two integers \u2014 that is, when the fraction part of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5.\n\nIf it were not for the 0.5 fractional parts, the round-off errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded down (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded up by the same amount.\n\nWhen rounding a large set of [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] numbers with [[discrete uniform distribution|uniformly distributed]] fractional parts, the rounding errors by all values, with the omission of those having 0.5 fractional part, would statistically compensate each other. This means that the [[expected value|expected (average) value]] of the rounded numbers is equal to the expected value of the original numbers when we remove numbers with fractional part 0.5 from the set.\n\nIn practice, [[floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] numbers are typically used, which have even more computational nuances because they are not equally spaced.\n\n====Round half up====\nThe following tie-breaking rule, called '''round half up''' (or '''round half towards positive infinity'''), is widely used in many disciplines.{{citation needed|reason=This is surprising. A confusion with ''round half away from zero''?|date=June 2017}} That is, half-way values of {{var|x}} are always rounded up.\n*If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.5\n*:<math>y = \\left\\lfloor x + 0.5 \\right\\rfloor = -\\left\\lceil -x - 0.5 \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor}{2} \\right\\rceil</math>\n\nFor example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221223.\n\nHowever, some programming languages (such as Java, Python) define their ''half up'' as ''[[#Round half away from zero|round half away from zero]]'' here.<ref>{{cite web|title=java.math.RoundingMode|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html#HALF_UP|publisher=Oracle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#rounding-modes|publisher=Python Software Foundation}}</ref>\n\nThis method only requires checking one digit to determine rounding direction in [[two's complement]] and similar representations.\n\n====Round half down====\nOne may also use '''round half down''' (or '''round half towards negative infinity''') as opposed to the more common ''round half up''.\n*If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;0.5\n*:<math>y = \\left\\lceil x - 0.5 \\right\\rceil = -\\left\\lfloor -x + 0.5 \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\lceil 2x \\rceil}{2} \\right\\rfloor</math>\n\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221224.\n\n====Round half towards zero====\nOne may also '''round half towards zero''' (or '''round half away from infinity''') as opposed to the conventional ''round half away from zero''.\n*If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.\n*:<math>y = \\sgn(x) \\left\\lceil \\left| x \\right| - 0.5 \\right\\rceil = -\\sgn(x) \\left\\lfloor -\\left| x \\right| + 0.5 \\right\\rfloor </math>\n\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221223.\n\nThis method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias towards zero.\n\n====Round half away from zero====\nThe other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the '''round half away from zero''' (or '''round half towards infinity'''), namely:\n*If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.\n*:<math>y = \\sgn(x) \\left\\lfloor \\left| x \\right| + 0.5 \\right\\rfloor = -\\sgn(x) \\left\\lceil -\\left| x \\right| - 0.5 \\right\\rceil </math>\n\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221224.\n\nThis can be more efficient on binary computers because only the first omitted bit needs to be considered to determine if it rounds up (on a 1) or down (on a 0). This is one method used when rounding to [[significant figures]] due to its simplicity.\n\nThis method, also known as '''commercial rounding''', treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias away from zero.\n\nIt is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).\n\n====Round half to even====\nA tie-breaking rule without positive/negative bias ''and'' without bias toward/away from zero is '''round half to even'''. By this convention, if the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the even integer nearest to {{var|x}}. Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, as does +24.5; while \u221223.5 becomes \u221224, as does \u221224.5. This function minimizes the expected error when summing over rounded figures, even when the inputs are mostly positive or mostly negative.\n\nThis variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called '''convergent rounding''', '''statistician's rounding''', '''Dutch rounding''', '''Gaussian rounding''', '''odd\u2013even rounding''',<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150603082624/http://mscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/543web/files/GSFC-X-673-64-1F.pdf Engineering Drafting Standards Manual] (NASA), X-673-64-1F, p90</ref> or '''bankers' rounding'''.\n\nThis is the default rounding mode used in [[IEEE 754]] floating-point operations (see also [[Nearest integer function]]), and {{clarify|text=the more sophisticated mode|date=December 2018}} used when rounding to significant figures.\n\nBy eliminating bias, repeated rounded addition or subtraction of independent numbers will give a result with an error that tends to grow in proportion to the square root of the number of operations rather than linearly. See [[Random walk#One-dimensional random walk|random walk]] for more.\n\nHowever, this rule distorts the distribution by increasing the probability of evens relative to odds. Typically this is less important than the biases that are eliminated by this method.\n\n====Round half to odd====\nA similar tie-breaking rule is '''round half to odd'''. In this approach, if the fraction of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the odd integer nearest to {{var|x}}. Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +23, as does +22.5; while \u221223.5 becomes \u221223, as does \u221222.5.\n\nThis method is also free from positive/negative bias and bias toward/away from zero.\n\nThis variant is almost never used in computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid increasing the scale of floating-point numbers, which have a limited exponent range. With ''round half to even'', a non-infinite number would round to infinity, and a small {{em|denormal}} value would round to a normal non-zero value. Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out-of-range results when possible for numeral systems of even [[radix]] (such as binary and decimal).{{clarify|reason=The ''problem'' would be avoided only for halfway numbers. So, how can this be useful in practice? Any practical example?|post-text=(see [[Talk:Rounding#Round half to odd|talk]])|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Randomized rounding to an integer===\n\n====Alternating tie-breaking====\nOne method, more obscure than most, is to alternate direction when rounding a number with 0.5 fractional part. All others are rounded to the closest integer.\n\n*Whenever the fractional part is 0.5, alternate rounding up or down: for the first occurrence of a 0.5 fractional part, round up; for the second occurrence, round down; and so on. (Alternatively the first 0.5 fractional part rounding can be determined by a [[random seed]].)\n\nIf occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts occur significantly more than a restart of the occurrence \"counting\", then it is effectively bias free. With guaranteed zero bias, it is useful if the numbers are to be summed or averaged.\n\n====Random tie-breaking====\n\n*If the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, choose {{var|y}} randomly among {{nowrap|{{var|x}} + 0.5}} and {{nowrap|{{var|x}} \u2212 0.5}}, with equal probability. All others are rounded to the closest integer.\n\nLike round-half-to-even and round-half-to-odd, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd {{var|y}} values. The advantage over alternate tie-breaking is that the last direction of rounding on 0.5 fractional part does not have to be \"remembered\".\n\n====Stochastic rounding====\nRounding as follows to one of the closest straddling integers with a probability dependent on the proximity is called [[stochastic]] rounding and will give an unbiased result on average.<ref name=\"stochastic\">{{cite arXiv|title=Deep Learning with Limited Numerical Precision|eprint=1502.02551|first1=Suyog|last1=Gupta|first2=Ankur|last2=Angrawl|first3=Kailash|last3=Gopalakrishnan|first4=Pritish|last4=Narayanan|page=3|date=9 February 2016 |class=cs.LG}}</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname {Round} (x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\lfloor x \\rfloor & \\text { with probability } 1 - (x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor) \\\\\n\\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1 & \\text { with probability } {x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor}\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nFor example, 1.6 would be rounded to 1 with probability 0.4 and to 2 with probability 0.6.\n\nStochastic rounding is accurate in a way that a rounding [[function (mathematics)|function]] can never be. For example, say you started with 0 and added 0.3 to that one hundred times while rounding the running total between every addition. The result would be 0 with regular rounding, but with stochastic rounding, the expected result would be 30, which is the same value obtained without rounding. This can be useful in [[machine learning]] where the training may use low precision arithmetic iteratively.<ref name=\"stochastic\"/> Stochastic rounding is a way to achieve 1-dimensional dithering.\n\n===Comparison of approaches for rounding to an integer===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border-width:0;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Value\n! rowspan=\"15\" style=\"border-width:0; background:#FFFFFF; padding:0;\" | &#8239;\n! colspan=\"10\"| Functional methods\n! rowspan=\"15\" style=\"border-width:0; background:#FFFFFF; padding:0;\" | &#8239;\n! colspan=\"6\" | Randomized methods (average of 99 roundings)\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Directed rounding\n! colspan=\"6\" | Round to nearest\n! colspan=\"2\" | Alternating tie-break\n! colspan=\"2\" | Random tie-break\n! colspan=\"2\" | Stochastic\n|- style=\"line-height:110%;\"\n!

For display to humans, that usually means the [[decimal|decimal numeral system]] (that is, {{var|m}} is an integer times a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the [[binary number|binary numeral system]] ({{var|m}} is an integer times a power of 2).\n\nThe abstract single-argument \"round()\" function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the [[#Rounding to integer|rounding to integer]] section. The abstract two-argument \"roundToMultiple()\" function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value {{var|m}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.\n\n===Logarithmic rounding===\n====Rounding to a specified power====\nRounding to a specified ''power'' is very different from rounding to a specified ''multiple''; for example, it is common in computing to need to round a number to a whole power of 2. The steps, in general, to round a positive number {{var|x}} to a power of some specified integer {{var|b}} greater than 1, are:\n:<math>\\mathrm{roundToPower}(x, b) = b^{\\mathrm{round}(\\log_b x)}</math>\n\nMany of the caveats applicable to rounding to a multiple are applicable to rounding to a power.\n\n====Scaled rounding====\nThis type of rounding, which is also named '''rounding to a logarithmic scale''', is a variant of [[#Rounding to a specified power|rounding to a specified power]]. Rounding on a logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale.\n\nFor example, resistors are supplied with [[preferred number]]s on a logarithmic scale. For example, for resistors with 10 % accuracy they are supplied with nominal values 100, 121, 147, 178, 215 etc. If a calculation indicates a resistor of 165 ohms is required then log(147)&#8239;=&#8239;2.167, log(165)&#8239;=&#8239;2.217 and log(178)&#8239;=&#8239;2.250. The logarithm of 165 is closer to the logarithm of 178 therefore a 178 ohm resistor would be the first choice if there are no other considerations.\n\nWhether a value {{math|''x'' \u2208 (''a'', ''b'')}} rounds to {{var|a}} or {{var|b}} depends upon whether the squared value {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is greater than or less than the product {{math|''ab''}}. The value 165 rounds to 178 in the resistors example because {{math|1=165<sup>2</sup> = 27225}} is greater than {{math|1=147 \u00d7 178 = 26166}}.\n\n===Floating-point rounding===\nIn floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value {{var|x}} into a value {{var|y}} with a specified number of {{em|significant}} digits. In other words, {{var|y}} should be a multiple of a number {{var|m}} that depends on the magnitude of {{var|x}}. The number {{var|m}} is a power of the [[radix|base]] (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point representation.\n\nApart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the [[#Scaled rounding|Scaled rounding]] section above, but with a constant scaling factor {{var|s}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and an integer base {{var|b}}&nbsp;>&nbsp;1.\n\nWhere the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity when \"rounding away from zero\", or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if {{var|x}} is negative), when \"rounding towards zero\". The result of an overflow for the usual case of ''round to nearest'' is always the appropriate infinity.\n\n===Rounding to a simple fraction===\nIn some contexts it is desirable to round a given number {{var|x}} to a \"neat\" fraction \u2014 that is, the nearest fraction {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|m}}/{{var|n}} whose numerator {{var|m}} and denominator {{var|n}} do not exceed a given maximum. This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit {{var|m}}. This problem is related to [[Farey sequence]]s, the [[Stern\u2013Brocot tree]], and [[continued fraction#Best rational approximations|continued fractions]].\n\n===Rounding to an available value===\nFinished [[lumber]], writing paper, capacitors, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.\n\nMany design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then \"round\" to some standard size using phrases such as \"round down to nearest standard value\", \"round up to nearest standard value\", or \"round to nearest standard value\".<ref>\n[http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/ee431/text/voltage_regulators_zeners.pdf \"Zener Diode Voltage Regulators\"]</ref><ref>\n[https://stellafane.org/tm/atm/test/tester-3.html \"Build a Mirror Tester\"]</ref>\n\nWhen a set of [[preferred value]]s is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale, choosing the closest [[preferred value]] to any given value can be seen as a form of [[#Scaled rounding|scaled rounding]]. Such rounded values can be directly calculated.<ref>Bruce Trump, Christine Schneider.\n\"Excel Formula Calculates Standard 1%-Resistor Values\".\n[[Electronic Design]], 2002-01-21.\n[https://www.electronicdesign.com/components/excel-formula-calculates-standard-1-resistor-values]\n</ref>\n\n==Rounding in other contexts==\n\n===Dithering and error diffusion===\nWhen digitizing [[continuous signal]]s, such as sound waves, the overall effect of a number of measurements is more important than the accuracy of each individual measurement. In these circumstances, [[dithering]], and a related technique, [[error diffusion]], are normally used. A related technique called [[pulse-width modulation]] is used to achieve analog type output from an inertial device by rapidly pulsing the power with a variable duty cycle.\n\nError diffusion tries to ensure the error, on average, is minimized. When dealing with a gentle slope from one to zero, the output would be zero for the first few terms until the sum of the error and the current value becomes greater than 0.5, in which case a 1 is output and the difference subtracted from the error so far. [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering]] is a popular error diffusion procedure when digitizing images.\n\nAs a one-dimensional example, suppose the numbers {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|0.9204}}, {{math|0.7451}}, and {{math|0.3091}} occur in order and each is to be rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}. In this case the cumulative sums, {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|1=1.8881 = 0.9677 + 0.9204}}, {{math|1=2.6332 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451}}, and {{math|1=2.9423 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451 + 0.3091}}, are each rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1.89}}, {{math|2.63}}, and {{math|2.94}}. The first of these and the differences of adjacent values give the desired rounded values: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1=0.92 = 1.89 \u2212 0.97}}, {{math|1=0.74 = 2.63 \u2212 1.89}}, and {{math|1=0.31 = 2.94 \u2212 2.63}}.\n\n===Monte Carlo arithmetic===\nMonte Carlo arithmetic is a technique in [[Monte Carlo method]]s where the rounding is randomly up or down. Stochastic rounding can be used for Monte Carlo arithmetic, but in general, just rounding up or down with equal probability is more often used. Repeated runs will give a random distribution of results which can indicate the stability of the computation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~stott/mca/CSD-970014.ps.gz|title=Monte Carlo Arithmetic: a framework for the statistical analysis of roundoff errors|last1=Parker|first1=D.

For example, if we know that an integer {{var|n}} is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting {{var|n}} to a floating-point value {{var|z}}, computing the approximate square root {{var|x}} of {{var|z}} with floating point, and then rounding {{var|x}} to the nearest integer {{var|y}}. If {{var|n}} is not too big, the floating-point round-off error in {{var|x}} will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value {{var|y}} will be the exact square root of {{var|n}}. This is essentially why [[slide rule]]s could be used for exact arithmetic.\n\n===Double rounding===\n{{Anchor|Sticky rounding|Rounding to odd}}\nRounding a number twice in succession to different levels of precision, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Double\"/> For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly.

Allstate'' and ''Sendejo v. Farmers'', litigated between 1995 and 1997, the insurance companies argued that double rounding premiums was permissible and in fact required. The US courts ruled against the insurance companies and ordered them to adopt rules to ensure single rounding.<ref>{{cite book|title=Class Action Dilemmas: Pursuing Public Goals for Private Gain|url=https://archive.org/details/classactiondilem00debo|url-access=registration|author=Deborah R.

Double rounding can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding for the intermediate computation. This consists in avoiding to round to midpoints for the final rounding (except when the midpoint is exact). In binary arithmetic, the idea is to round the result toward zero, and set the least significant bit to 1 if the rounded result is inexact; this rounding is called ''sticky rounding''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=J.

Kahan]] coined the term \"The Table-Maker's Dilemma\" for the unknown cost of rounding [[transcendental function]]s:\n<blockquote>\"Nobody knows how much it would cost to compute {{var|y<sup>w</sup>}} correctly rounded for {{em|every}} two floating-point arguments at which it does not over/underflow. Instead, reputable math libraries compute elementary [[transcendental function]]s mostly within slightly more than half an [[Unit in the last place|ulp]] and almost always well within one ulp. Why can't {{var|y<sup>w</sup>}} be rounded within half an ulp like SQRT? Because nobody knows how much computation it would cost... No general way exists to predict how many extra digits will have to be carried to compute a transcendental expression and round it {{em|correctly}} to some preassigned number of digits. Even the fact (if true) that a finite number of extra digits will ultimately suffice may be a deep theorem.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kahan|first=William Morton|author-link=William Morton Kahan|title=A Logarithm Too Clever by Half|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/LOG10HAF.TXT|accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[IEEE 754]] floating-point standard guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, [[fused multiply\u2013add]], square root, and floating-point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite-precision operation. No such guarantee was given in the 1985 standard for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best. However, the 2008 standard guarantees that conforming implementations will give correctly rounded results which respect the active rounding mode; implementation of the functions, however, is optional.\n\nUsing the [[Gelfond\u2013Schneider theorem]] and [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]] many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return [[transcendental number|transcendental]] results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However, determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results need to be computed, before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed, may demand a lot of computation time or may be out of reach.<ref name=\"Muller_2010\">{{cite book|author-last1=Muller|author-first1=Jean-Michel|author-last2=Brisebarre|author-first2=Nicolas|author-last3=de Dinechin|author-first3=Florent|author-last4=Jeannerod|author-first4=Claude-Pierre|author-last5=Lef\u00e8vre|author-first5=Vincent|author-last6=Melquiond|author-first6=Guillaume|author-last7=Revol|author-first7=Nathalie|author-last8=Stehl\u00e9|author-first8=Damien|author-last9=Torres|author-first9=Serge|title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic|date=2010|publisher=[[Birkh\u00e4user]]|edition=1|isbn=978-0-8176-4704-9<!-- print -->|doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6|lccn=2009939668<!--|id={{isbn|978-0-8176-4705-6}} (online), {{isbn|0-8176-4704-X}} (print) -->|chapter=Chapter 12: Solving the Table Maker's Dilemma|chapter-url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1315760}}</ref> In practice, when this limit is not known or too large, some decision has to be made in the implementation (see below), but according to a probabilistic model, correct rounding can be satisfied with a very high probability.\n\nSome programming packages offer correct rounding. The [[MPFR|GNU MPFR]] package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. Some other libraries implement elementary functions with correct rounding in double precision:\n*[[IBM]]'s libultim, in rounding to nearest only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libultim.3|title=libultim \u2013 ultimate correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}</ref> This library uses up to 768 bits of working precision.\n*[[Sun Microsystems]]'s libmcr, in the 4 rounding modes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libmcr.3|title=libmcr \u2013 correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}</ref> For the difficult cases, this library also uses multiple precision, and the number of words is increased by 2 each time the Table-maker's dilemma occurs (with undefined behavior in the very unlikely event that some limit of the machine is reached).<!-- in the sources: \"nw += 2;\" in a loop -->\n*CRlibm, written in the old Ar\u00e9naire team (LIP, [[ENS Lyon]]).

Specific instances cannot be given but this follows from the undecidability of the [[halting problem]]. For instance, if [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true but [[unprovable]], then the result of rounding the following value up to the next integer cannot be determined: 1+10<sup>\u2212{{var|n}}</sup> where {{var|n}} is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 1 if there is no such number. The rounded result is 2 if such a number {{var|n}} exists and 1 otherwise. The value before rounding can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.\n\n===Interaction with string searches===\nRounding can adversely affect a string search for a number. For example, {{pi}} rounded to four digits is \"3.1416\" but a simple search for this string will not discover \"3.14159\" or any other value of {{pi}} rounded to more than four digits. In contrast, truncation does not suffer from this problem; for example, a simple string search for \"3.1415\", which is {{pi}} truncated to four digits, will discover values of {{pi}} truncated to more than four digits.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division. Some ancient [[clay tablet]]s found in [[Mesopotamia]] contain tables with rounded values of [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] and square roots in base 60.<ref>\n[http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html Duncan J. Melville. \"YBC 7289 clay tablet\". 2006]</ref>\nRounded approximations to [[pi|{{pi}}]], the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient\u2014see [[sexagesimal #Examples|base 60 examples]].\n\nThe ''round-to-even'' method has served as the [[ASTM]] (E-29) standard since 1940. The origin of the terms ''unbiased rounding'' and ''statistician's rounding'' are fairly self-explanatory. In the 1906 fourth edition of ''Probability and Theory of Errors''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=05170001|title=Probability and theory of errors|author=|date=|website=historical.library.cornell.edu}}</ref> [[Robert Simpson Woodward]] called this \"the computer's rule\" indicating that it was then in common use by [[human computer]]s who calculated mathematical tables. [[Churchill Eisenhart]] indicated the practice was already \"well established\" in data analysis by the 1940s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis for Scientific and Industrial Research, and Production and Management Engineering|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=187\u2013223|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/selectedtechniqu00colu|author=Churchill Eisenhart|editors=Eisenhart, Hastay and Wallis|accessdate=30 January 2014|chapter=Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data|date=1947}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of the term ''bankers' rounding'' remains more obscure. If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find. To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report ''The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts''<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication1224_en.pdf</ref> suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that \"half-way\" amounts should be rounded up.\n\nUntil the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating-point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of [[interval arithmetic]].\n\nCurrently, much research tends to round to multiples of 5 or 2. For example, [[J\u00f6rg Baten]] used [[age heaping]] in many studies, to evaluate the numeracy level of ancient populations. He came up with the [[Whipple's index#ABCC Index|ABCC Index]], which enables the comparison of the [[numeracy]] among regions possible without any historical sources where the population [[literacy]] was measured.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baten|first1=J\u00f6rg|title=Quantifying Quantitative Literacy: Age Heaping and the History of Human Capita|journal=Journal of Economic History|date=2009|volume=69|issue=3|pages=783\u2013808|doi=10.1017/S0022050709001120|hdl=10230/481|url=http://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/10230/481/1/996.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Rounding functions in programming languages==\nMost [[programming language]]s provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways. The earliest numeric languages, such as [[FORTRAN]] and [[C (programming language)|C]], would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero). This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an [[integer (computer science)|integer]] [[variable (programming)|variable]], or using a fractional number as an index of an [[array data type|array]]. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.\n\nIn the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard [[library (computing)|libraries]] of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up, down, to nearest, and towards zero). The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer. Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a [[double precision floating-point format|double precision float]] argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary. This approach may avoid spurious [[integer overflow|overflows]] because floating-point types have a larger range than integer types. Some languages, such as [[PHP]], provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300. In addition, many languages provide a [[printf]] or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the ''precision''). On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.\n\nOn the opposite, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their [[Document Object Model|DOM]] and in their [[interface description language|IDL]] interface as strings as if they had [[real RAM|infinite precision]], and do not discriminate between integers and floating-point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point values before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard [[JavaScript]] or [[ECMAScript]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf|title=ECMA-262 ECMAScript Language Specification|author=|date=|website=ecma-international.org}}</ref> interface bindings).\n\n==Other rounding standards==\nSome disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.\n\n===US weather observations===\nIn a guideline issued in mid-1966,<ref>OFCM, 2005: [http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420051036/http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm|date=1999-04-20 }}, Washington, DC., 104 pp.</ref> the [[United States|U.S.]] Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the \"round half up\" tie-breaking rule. For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and \u22121.5 should become \u22121. Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was \"round half away from zero\".\n\n===Negative zero in meteorology===\n{{Main|Signed zero#Scientific uses}}\n\nSome [[meteorology|meteorologist]]s may write \"&minus;0\" to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and &minus;0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to an integer.

Rounding can also be important to avoid [[false precision|misleadingly precise]] reporting of a computed number, [[measurement]] or [[estimation|estimate]]; for example, a quantity that was computed as {{formatnum:123456}} but is known to be [[accuracy and precision|accurate]] only to within a few hundred units is usually better stated as \"about {{formatnum:123500}}\".\n\nOn the other hand, rounding of exact numbers will introduce some [[round-off error]] in the reported result. Rounding is almost unavoidable when reporting many computations \u2013 especially when dividing two numbers in [[integer]] or [[fixed-point arithmetic]]; when computing mathematical functions such as [[square root]]s, [[logarithm]]s, and [[sine]]s; or when using a [[floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] representation with a fixed number of [[significant digit]]s. In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally [[propagation of uncertainty|accumulate]], and in certain [[ill-conditioned]] cases they may make the result meaningless.\n\nAccurate rounding of [[transcendental function|transcendental mathematical functions]] is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as \"[[#Table-maker's dilemma|the table-maker's dilemma]]\".\n\nRounding has many similarities to the [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] that occurs when [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] must be encoded by numbers or [[digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s.\n\nA [[approximately equals sign|wavy equals sign]] (<big>'''[[\u2248]]'''</big><!-- unicode U+2248 -->: ''approximately equal to'') is sometimes used to indicate rounding of exact numbers, e.g., 9.98 \u2248 10.

This way, when the same input is rounded in different instances, the output is unchanged.\n# Calculations done with rounding should be close to those done without rounding.\n#* As a result of (1) and (2), the output from rounding should be close to its input, often as close as possible by some [[metric (mathematics)|metric]].\n# To be considered rounding, the [[range (mathematics)|range]] will be a subset of the [[domain of a function|domain]]. A classical range is the integers, '''[[Integer|Z]]'''.\n# Rounding should preserve [[symmetry in mathematics|symmetries]] that already exist between the domain and range. With finite precision (or a [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] domain), this translates to removing [[bias (statistics)|bias]].\n# A rounding method should have utility in computer science or human arithmetic where finite precision is used, and speed is a consideration.\n\nBut, because it is not usually possible for a method to satisfy all ideal characteristics, many methods exist.\n\nAs a general rule, rounding is [[idempotence|idempotent]];<ref>{{cite journal|author-last=Kulisch||author-first=Ulrich W.|author-link=Ulrich W.

Rounding functions are also [[monotonic function|monotonic]]; i.e., rounding a larger number results in the same or larger result than rounding the smaller number.\n\n==Types of rounding==\nTypical rounding problems include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rounding problem\n!Example input\n!Result\n!Rounding criteria\n|-\n|approximating an irrational number by a fraction\n| [[pi|{{pi}}]]\n| 22&#8239;/&#8239;7\n| 1-digit-denominator\n|-\n|approximating a [[rational number]] by another fraction with smaller numerator and denominator\n| 399&#8239;/&#8239;941\n| 3&#8239;/&#8239;7\n| 1-digit-denominator\n|-\n|approximating a fraction, which have periodic decimal expansion, by a finite decimal fraction\n|5&#8239;/&#8239;3\n|{{formatnum:1.6667}}\n|4 trailing digits\n|-\n|approximating a fractional [[decimal number]] by one with fewer digits\n|{{formatnum:2.1784}}\n|2.18\n|2 trailing digits\n|-\n|approximating a decimal [[integer]] by an integer with more trailing zeros\n|{{formatnum:23217}}\n|{{formatnum:23200}}\n|2 trailing zeros\n|-\n|approximating a large decimal [[integer]] using scientific notation\n|{{formatnum:300,999,999}}\n|{{formatnum:3.01}}&#8239;\u00d7&#8239;{{formatnum:10}}<sup>8</sup>\n|2 trailing digits\n|-\n|approximating a value by a multiple of a specified amount\n|48.2\n|45\n|multiple of 15\n|}\n\n==Rounding to integer==\nThe most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of an abstract single-argument \"round()\" procedure. These are true functions (with the exception of those that use randomness).\n\n===Directed rounding to an integer===\nThese four methods are called '''directed rounding''', as the displacements from the original number {{var|x}} to the rounded value {{var|y}} are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, [[extended real number line|+\u221e]], or \u2212\u221e). Directed rounding is used in [[interval arithmetic]] and is often required in financial calculations.\n\nIf {{var|x}} is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero. If {{var|x}} is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if {{var|x}} is an integer, {{var|y}} is just {{var|x}}.\n\nWhere many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new [[stock index|index]] set up by the [[Vancouver Stock Exchange]] in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000 (three decimal places of accuracy), and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 \u2014 whereas [[stock price]]s had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.<ref>{{cite book|title=Accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms|author-first=Nicholas John |author-last=Higham|author-link=Nicholas Higham|page=54|isbn=978-0-89871-521-7|date=2002}}</ref>\n\nFor the examples below, {{math|sgn(''x'')}} refers to the [[sign function]] applied to the original number, {{math|''x''}}.\n\n====Rounding down====\n*'''round down''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|floor]]''', or '''round towards minus infinity'''): {{var|y}} is the largest integer that does not exceed {{var|x}}.\n*:<math>y = \\mathrm{floor}(x) = \\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor = -\\left\\lceil -x \\right\\rceil</math>\n\n====Rounding up====\n*'''round up''' (or take the '''[[floor and ceiling functions|ceiling]]''', or '''round towards plus infinity'''): {{var|y}} is the smallest integer that is not less than {{var|x}}.\n*:<math>y = \\operatorname{ceil}(x) = \\left\\lceil x \\right\\rceil = -\\left\\lfloor -x \\right\\rfloor</math>\n\n====Rounding towards zero====\n*'''round towards zero''' (or '''[[truncation|truncate]]''', or '''round away from infinity'''): {{var|y}} is the integer part of {{var|x}}, without its fraction digits.\n*:<math>y = \\operatorname{truncate}(x) = \\sgn(x) \\left\\lfloor \\left| x \\right| \\right\\rfloor = -\\sgn(x) \\left\\lceil -\\left| x \\right| \\right\\rceil</math>\n\n====Rounding away from zero====\n*'''round away from zero''' (or '''round towards infinity'''): if {{var|x}} is an integer, {{var|y}} is {{var|x}}; else {{var|y}} is the integer that is closest to 0 and is such that {{var|x}} is between 0 and {{var|y}}.\n*:<math>y = \\sgn(x) \\left\\lceil \\left| x \\right| \\right\\rceil = -\\sgn(x) \\left\\lfloor -\\left| x \\right| \\right\\rfloor</math>\n\n===Rounding to the nearest integer===\nRounding a number {{var|x}} to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when {{var|x}} is exactly half-way between two integers \u2014 that is, when the fraction part of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5.\n\nIf it were not for the 0.5 fractional parts, the round-off errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded down (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded up by the same amount.\n\nWhen rounding a large set of [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] numbers with [[discrete uniform distribution|uniformly distributed]] fractional parts, the rounding errors by all values, with the omission of those having 0.5 fractional part, would statistically compensate each other. This means that the [[expected value|expected (average) value]] of the rounded numbers is equal to the expected value of the original numbers when we remove numbers with fractional part 0.5 from the set.\n\nIn practice, [[floating-point arithmetic|floating-point]] numbers are typically used, which have even more computational nuances because they are not equally spaced.\n\n====Round half up====\nThe following tie-breaking rule, called '''round half up''' (or '''round half towards positive infinity'''), is widely used in many disciplines.{{citation needed|reason=This is surprising. A confusion with ''round half away from zero''?|date=June 2017}} That is, half-way values of {{var|x}} are always rounded up.\n*If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.5\n*:<math>y = \\left\\lfloor x + 0.5 \\right\\rfloor = -\\left\\lceil -x - 0.5 \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\lfloor 2x \\rfloor}{2} \\right\\rceil</math>\n\nFor example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221223.\n\nHowever, some programming languages (such as Java, Python) define their ''half up'' as ''[[#Round half away from zero|round half away from zero]]'' here.<ref>{{cite web|title=java.math.RoundingMode|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/RoundingMode.html#HALF_UP|publisher=Oracle}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=decimal \u2014 Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic|url=https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#rounding-modes|publisher=Python Software Foundation}}</ref>\n\nThis method only requires checking one digit to determine rounding direction in [[two's complement]] and similar representations.\n\n====Round half down====\nOne may also use '''round half down''' (or '''round half towards negative infinity''') as opposed to the more common ''round half up''.\n*If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;0.5\n*:<math>y = \\left\\lceil x - 0.5 \\right\\rceil = -\\left\\lfloor -x + 0.5 \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\lceil 2x \\rceil}{2} \\right\\rfloor</math>\n\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221224.\n\n====Round half towards zero====\nOne may also '''round half towards zero''' (or '''round half away from infinity''') as opposed to the conventional ''round half away from zero''.\n*If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.\n*:<math>y = \\sgn(x) \\left\\lceil \\left| x \\right| - 0.5 \\right\\rceil = -\\sgn(x) \\left\\lfloor -\\left| x \\right| + 0.5 \\right\\rfloor </math>\n\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221223.\n\nThis method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias towards zero.\n\n====Round half away from zero====\nThe other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the '''round half away from zero''' (or '''round half towards infinity'''), namely:\n*If the fraction of {{var|x}} is exactly 0.5, then {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is positive, and {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|x}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;0.5 if {{var|x}} is negative.\n*:<math>y = \\sgn(x) \\left\\lfloor \\left| x \\right| + 0.5 \\right\\rfloor = -\\sgn(x) \\left\\lceil -\\left| x \\right| - 0.5 \\right\\rceil </math>\n\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221224.\n\nThis can be more efficient on binary computers because only the first omitted bit needs to be considered to determine if it rounds up (on a 1) or down (on a 0). This is one method used when rounding to [[significant figures]] due to its simplicity.\n\nThis method, also known as '''commercial rounding''', treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall positive/negative bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. It does, however, still have bias away from zero.\n\nIt is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).\n\n====Round half to even====\nA tie-breaking rule without positive/negative bias ''and'' without bias toward/away from zero is '''round half to even'''. By this convention, if the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the even integer nearest to {{var|x}}. Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, as does +24.5; while \u221223.5 becomes \u221224, as does \u221224.5. This function minimizes the expected error when summing over rounded figures, even when the inputs are mostly positive or mostly negative.\n\nThis variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called '''convergent rounding''', '''statistician's rounding''', '''Dutch rounding''', '''Gaussian rounding''', '''odd\u2013even rounding''',<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150603082624/http://mscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/543web/files/GSFC-X-673-64-1F.pdf Engineering Drafting Standards Manual] (NASA), X-673-64-1F, p90</ref> or '''bankers' rounding'''.\n\nThis is the default rounding mode used in [[IEEE 754]] floating-point operations (see also [[Nearest integer function]]), and {{clarify|text=the more sophisticated mode|date=December 2018}} used when rounding to significant figures.\n\nBy eliminating bias, repeated rounded addition or subtraction of independent numbers will give a result with an error that tends to grow in proportion to the square root of the number of operations rather than linearly. See [[Random walk#One-dimensional random walk|random walk]] for more.\n\nHowever, this rule distorts the distribution by increasing the probability of evens relative to odds. Typically this is less important than the biases that are eliminated by this method.\n\n====Round half to odd====\nA similar tie-breaking rule is '''round half to odd'''. In this approach, if the fraction of {{var|x}} is 0.5, then {{var|y}} is the odd integer nearest to {{var|x}}. Thus, for example, +23.5 becomes +23, as does +22.5; while \u221223.5 becomes \u221223, as does \u221222.5.\n\nThis method is also free from positive/negative bias and bias toward/away from zero.\n\nThis variant is almost never used in computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid increasing the scale of floating-point numbers, which have a limited exponent range. With ''round half to even'', a non-infinite number would round to infinity, and a small {{em|denormal}} value would round to a normal non-zero value. Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out-of-range results when possible for numeral systems of even [[radix]] (such as binary and decimal).{{clarify|reason=The ''problem'' would be avoided only for halfway numbers. So, how can this be useful in practice? Any practical example?|post-text=(see [[Talk:Rounding#Round half to odd|talk]])|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Randomized rounding to an integer===\n\n====Alternating tie-breaking====\nOne method, more obscure than most, is to alternate direction when rounding a number with 0.5 fractional part. All others are rounded to the closest integer.\n\n*Whenever the fractional part is 0.5, alternate rounding up or down: for the first occurrence of a 0.5 fractional part, round up; for the second occurrence, round down; and so on. (Alternatively the first 0.5 fractional part rounding can be determined by a [[random seed]].)\n\nIf occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts occur significantly more than a restart of the occurrence \"counting\", then it is effectively bias free. With guaranteed zero bias, it is useful if the numbers are to be summed or averaged.\n\n====Random tie-breaking====\n\n*If the fractional part of {{var|x}} is 0.5, choose {{var|y}} randomly among {{nowrap|{{var|x}} + 0.5}} and {{nowrap|{{var|x}} \u2212 0.5}}, with equal probability. All others are rounded to the closest integer.\n\nLike round-half-to-even and round-half-to-odd, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd {{var|y}} values. The advantage over alternate tie-breaking is that the last direction of rounding on 0.5 fractional part does not have to be \"remembered\".\n\n====Stochastic rounding====\nRounding as follows to one of the closest straddling integers with a probability dependent on the proximity is called [[stochastic]] rounding and will give an unbiased result on average.<ref name=\"stochastic\">{{cite arXiv|title=Deep Learning with Limited Numerical Precision|eprint=1502.02551|first1=Suyog|last1=Gupta|first2=Ankur|last2=Angrawl|first3=Kailash|last3=Gopalakrishnan|first4=Pritish|last4=Narayanan|page=3|date=9 February 2016 |class=cs.LG}}</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname {Round} (x) = \\begin{cases}\n\\lfloor x \\rfloor & \\text { with probability } 1 - (x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor) \\\\\n\\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1 & \\text { with probability } {x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor}\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nFor example, 1.6 would be rounded to 1 with probability 0.4 and to 2 with probability 0.6.\n\nStochastic rounding is accurate in a way that a rounding [[function (mathematics)|function]] can never be. For example, say you started with 0 and added 0.3 to that one hundred times while rounding the running total between every addition. The result would be 0 with regular rounding, but with stochastic rounding, the expected result would be 30, which is the same value obtained without rounding. This can be useful in [[machine learning]] where the training may use low precision arithmetic iteratively.<ref name=\"stochastic\"/> Stochastic rounding is a way to achieve 1-dimensional dithering.\n\n===Comparison of approaches for rounding to an integer===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; border-width:0;\"\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Value\n! rowspan=\"15\" style=\"border-width:0; background:#FFFFFF; padding:0;\" | &#8239;\n! colspan=\"10\"| Functional methods\n! rowspan=\"15\" style=\"border-width:0; background:#FFFFFF; padding:0;\" | &#8239;\n! colspan=\"6\" | Randomized methods (average of 99 roundings)\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Directed rounding\n! colspan=\"6\" | Round to nearest\n! colspan=\"2\" | Alternating tie-break\n! colspan=\"2\" | Random tie-break\n! colspan=\"2\" | Stochastic\n|- style=\"line-height:110%;\"\n!

For display to humans, that usually means the [[decimal|decimal numeral system]] (that is, {{var|m}} is an integer times a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the [[binary number|binary numeral system]] ({{var|m}} is an integer times a power of 2).\n\nThe abstract single-argument \"round()\" function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the [[#Rounding to integer|rounding to integer]] section. The abstract two-argument \"roundToMultiple()\" function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value {{var|m}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.\n\n===Logarithmic rounding===\n====Rounding to a specified power====\nRounding to a specified ''power'' is very different from rounding to a specified ''multiple''; for example, it is common in computing to need to round a number to a whole power of 2. The steps, in general, to round a positive number {{var|x}} to a power of some specified integer {{var|b}} greater than 1, are:\n:<math>\\mathrm{roundToPower}(x, b) = b^{\\mathrm{round}(\\log_b x)}</math>\n\nMany of the caveats applicable to rounding to a multiple are applicable to rounding to a power.\n\n====Scaled rounding====\nThis type of rounding, which is also named '''rounding to a logarithmic scale''', is a variant of [[#Rounding to a specified power|rounding to a specified power]]. Rounding on a logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale.\n\nFor example, resistors are supplied with [[preferred number]]s on a logarithmic scale. For example, for resistors with 10 % accuracy they are supplied with nominal values 100, 121, 147, 178, 215 etc. If a calculation indicates a resistor of 165 ohms is required then log(147)&#8239;=&#8239;2.167, log(165)&#8239;=&#8239;2.217 and log(178)&#8239;=&#8239;2.250. The logarithm of 165 is closer to the logarithm of 178 therefore a 178 ohm resistor would be the first choice if there are no other considerations.\n\nWhether a value {{math|''x'' \u2208 (''a'', ''b'')}} rounds to {{var|a}} or {{var|b}} depends upon whether the squared value {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup>}} is greater than or less than the product {{math|''ab''}}. The value 165 rounds to 178 in the resistors example because {{math|1=165<sup>2</sup> = 27225}} is greater than {{math|1=147 \u00d7 178 = 26166}}.\n\n===Floating-point rounding===\nIn floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value {{var|x}} into a value {{var|y}} with a specified number of {{em|significant}} digits. In other words, {{var|y}} should be a multiple of a number {{var|m}} that depends on the magnitude of {{var|x}}. The number {{var|m}} is a power of the [[radix|base]] (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point representation.\n\nApart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the [[#Scaled rounding|Scaled rounding]] section above, but with a constant scaling factor {{var|s}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, and an integer base {{var|b}}&nbsp;>&nbsp;1.\n\nWhere the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity when \"rounding away from zero\", or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if {{var|x}} is negative), when \"rounding towards zero\". The result of an overflow for the usual case of ''round to nearest'' is always the appropriate infinity.\n\n===Rounding to a simple fraction===\nIn some contexts it is desirable to round a given number {{var|x}} to a \"neat\" fraction \u2014 that is, the nearest fraction {{var|y}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{var|m}}/{{var|n}} whose numerator {{var|m}} and denominator {{var|n}} do not exceed a given maximum. This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit {{var|m}}. This problem is related to [[Farey sequence]]s, the [[Stern\u2013Brocot tree]], and [[continued fraction#Best rational approximations|continued fractions]].\n\n===Rounding to an available value===\nFinished [[lumber]], writing paper, capacitors, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.\n\nMany design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then \"round\" to some standard size using phrases such as \"round down to nearest standard value\", \"round up to nearest standard value\", or \"round to nearest standard value\".<ref>\n[http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/ee431/text/voltage_regulators_zeners.pdf \"Zener Diode Voltage Regulators\"]</ref><ref>\n[https://stellafane.org/tm/atm/test/tester-3.html \"Build a Mirror Tester\"]</ref>\n\nWhen a set of [[preferred value]]s is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale, choosing the closest [[preferred value]] to any given value can be seen as a form of [[#Scaled rounding|scaled rounding]]. Such rounded values can be directly calculated.<ref>Bruce Trump, Christine Schneider.\n\"Excel Formula Calculates Standard 1%-Resistor Values\".\n[[Electronic Design]], 2002-01-21.\n[https://www.electronicdesign.com/components/excel-formula-calculates-standard-1-resistor-values]\n</ref>\n\n==Rounding in other contexts==\n\n===Dithering and error diffusion===\nWhen digitizing [[continuous signal]]s, such as sound waves, the overall effect of a number of measurements is more important than the accuracy of each individual measurement. In these circumstances, [[dithering]], and a related technique, [[error diffusion]], are normally used. A related technique called [[pulse-width modulation]] is used to achieve analog type output from an inertial device by rapidly pulsing the power with a variable duty cycle.\n\nError diffusion tries to ensure the error, on average, is minimized. When dealing with a gentle slope from one to zero, the output would be zero for the first few terms until the sum of the error and the current value becomes greater than 0.5, in which case a 1 is output and the difference subtracted from the error so far. [[Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering]] is a popular error diffusion procedure when digitizing images.\n\nAs a one-dimensional example, suppose the numbers {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|0.9204}}, {{math|0.7451}}, and {{math|0.3091}} occur in order and each is to be rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}. In this case the cumulative sums, {{math|0.9677}}, {{math|1=1.8881 = 0.9677 + 0.9204}}, {{math|1=2.6332 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451}}, and {{math|1=2.9423 = 0.9677 + 0.9204 + 0.7451 + 0.3091}}, are each rounded to a multiple of {{math|0.01}}: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1.89}}, {{math|2.63}}, and {{math|2.94}}. The first of these and the differences of adjacent values give the desired rounded values: {{math|0.97}}, {{math|1=0.92 = 1.89 \u2212 0.97}}, {{math|1=0.74 = 2.63 \u2212 1.89}}, and {{math|1=0.31 = 2.94 \u2212 2.63}}.\n\n===Monte Carlo arithmetic===\nMonte Carlo arithmetic is a technique in [[Monte Carlo method]]s where the rounding is randomly up or down. Stochastic rounding can be used for Monte Carlo arithmetic, but in general, just rounding up or down with equal probability is more often used. Repeated runs will give a random distribution of results which can indicate the stability of the computation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~stott/mca/CSD-970014.ps.gz|title=Monte Carlo Arithmetic: a framework for the statistical analysis of roundoff errors|last1=Parker|first1=D.

For example, if we know that an integer {{var|n}} is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting {{var|n}} to a floating-point value {{var|z}}, computing the approximate square root {{var|x}} of {{var|z}} with floating point, and then rounding {{var|x}} to the nearest integer {{var|y}}. If {{var|n}} is not too big, the floating-point round-off error in {{var|x}} will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value {{var|y}} will be the exact square root of {{var|n}}. This is essentially why [[slide rule]]s could be used for exact arithmetic.\n\n===Double rounding===\n{{Anchor|Sticky rounding|Rounding to odd}}\nRounding a number twice in succession to different levels of precision, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding.<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"NB_Double\"/> For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly. Borman and Chatfield<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Borman|first1=Phil|last2=Chatfield|first2=Marion|title=Avoid the perils of using rounded data|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis|date=10 November 2015|volume=115|pages=506\u2013507|doi=10.1016/j.jpba.2015.07.021|pmid=26299526|url=}}</ref> discuss the implications of double rounding when comparing data rounded to one decimal place to specification limits expressed using integers.\n\nIn ''Martinez v. Allstate'' and ''Sendejo v. Farmers'', litigated between 1995 and 1997, the insurance companies argued that double rounding premiums was permissible and in fact required. The US courts ruled against the insurance companies and ordered them to adopt rules to ensure single rounding.<ref>{{cite book|title=Class Action Dilemmas: Pursuing Public Goals for Private Gain|url=https://archive.org/details/classactiondilem00debo|url-access=registration|author=Deborah R.

Double rounding can be avoided by choosing an adequate rounding for the intermediate computation. This consists in avoiding to round to midpoints for the final rounding (except when the midpoint is exact). In binary arithmetic, the idea is to round the result toward zero, and set the least significant bit to 1 if the rounded result is inexact; this rounding is called ''sticky rounding''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=J.

Kahan]] coined the term \"The Table-Maker's Dilemma\" for the unknown cost of rounding [[transcendental function]]s:\n<blockquote>\"Nobody knows how much it would cost to compute {{var|y<sup>w</sup>}} correctly rounded for {{em|every}} two floating-point arguments at which it does not over/underflow. Instead, reputable math libraries compute elementary [[transcendental function]]s mostly within slightly more than half an [[Unit in the last place|ulp]] and almost always well within one ulp. Why can't {{var|y<sup>w</sup>}} be rounded within half an ulp like SQRT? Because nobody knows how much computation it would cost... No general way exists to predict how many extra digits will have to be carried to compute a transcendental expression and round it {{em|correctly}} to some preassigned number of digits. Even the fact (if true) that a finite number of extra digits will ultimately suffice may be a deep theorem.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Kahan|first=William Morton|author-link=William Morton Kahan|title=A Logarithm Too Clever by Half|url=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/LOG10HAF.TXT|accessdate=2008-11-14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[IEEE 754]] floating-point standard guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, [[fused multiply\u2013add]], square root, and floating-point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite-precision operation. No such guarantee was given in the 1985 standard for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best. However, the 2008 standard guarantees that conforming implementations will give correctly rounded results which respect the active rounding mode; implementation of the functions, however, is optional.\n\nUsing the [[Gelfond\u2013Schneider theorem]] and [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]] many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return [[transcendental number|transcendental]] results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However, determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results need to be computed, before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed, may demand a lot of computation time or may be out of reach.<ref name=\"Muller_2010\">{{cite book|author-last1=Muller|author-first1=Jean-Michel|author-last2=Brisebarre|author-first2=Nicolas|author-last3=de Dinechin|author-first3=Florent|author-last4=Jeannerod|author-first4=Claude-Pierre|author-last5=Lef\u00e8vre|author-first5=Vincent|author-last6=Melquiond|author-first6=Guillaume|author-last7=Revol|author-first7=Nathalie|author-last8=Stehl\u00e9|author-first8=Damien|author-last9=Torres|author-first9=Serge|title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic|date=2010|publisher=[[Birkh\u00e4user]]|edition=1|isbn=978-0-8176-4704-9<!-- print -->|doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6|lccn=2009939668<!--|id={{isbn|978-0-8176-4705-6}} (online), {{isbn|0-8176-4704-X}} (print) -->|chapter=Chapter 12: Solving the Table Maker's Dilemma|chapter-url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/1315760}}</ref> In practice, when this limit is not known or too large, some decision has to be made in the implementation (see below), but according to a probabilistic model, correct rounding can be satisfied with a very high probability.\n\nSome programming packages offer correct rounding. The [[MPFR|GNU MPFR]] package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. Some other libraries implement elementary functions with correct rounding in double precision:\n*[[IBM]]'s libultim, in rounding to nearest only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libultim.3|title=libultim \u2013 ultimate correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}</ref> This library uses up to 768 bits of working precision.\n*[[Sun Microsystems]]'s libmcr, in the 4 rounding modes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.utah.edu/cgi-bin/man2html.cgi?/usr/local/man/man3/libmcr.3|title=libmcr \u2013 correctly-rounded elementary-function library}}</ref> For the difficult cases, this library also uses multiple precision, and the number of words is increased by 2 each time the Table-maker's dilemma occurs (with undefined behavior in the very unlikely event that some limit of the machine is reached).<!-- in the sources: \"nw += 2;\" in a loop -->\n*CRlibm, written in the old Ar\u00e9naire team (LIP, [[ENS Lyon]]).

Specific instances cannot be given but this follows from the undecidability of the [[halting problem]]. For instance, if [[Goldbach's conjecture]] is true but [[unprovable]], then the result of rounding the following value up to the next integer cannot be determined: 1+10<sup>\u2212{{var|n}}</sup> where {{var|n}} is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 1 if there is no such number. The rounded result is 2 if such a number {{var|n}} exists and 1 otherwise. The value before rounding can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.\n\n===Interaction with string searches===\nRounding can adversely affect a string search for a number. For example, {{pi}} rounded to four digits is \"3.1416\" but a simple search for this string will not discover \"3.14159\" or any other value of {{pi}} rounded to more than four digits. In contrast, truncation does not suffer from this problem; for example, a simple string search for \"3.1415\", which is {{pi}} truncated to four digits, will discover values of {{pi}} truncated to more than four digits.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division. Some ancient [[clay tablet]]s found in [[Mesopotamia]] contain tables with rounded values of [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] and square roots in base 60.<ref>\n[http://it.stlawu.edu/~dmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html Duncan J. Melville. \"YBC 7289 clay tablet\". 2006]</ref>\nRounded approximations to [[pi|{{pi}}]], the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient\u2014see [[sexagesimal #Examples|base 60 examples]].\n\nThe ''round-to-even'' method has served as the [[ASTM]] (E-29) standard since 1940. The origin of the terms ''unbiased rounding'' and ''statistician's rounding'' are fairly self-explanatory. In the 1906 fourth edition of ''Probability and Theory of Errors''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=math;cc=math;view=toc;subview=short;idno=05170001|title=Probability and theory of errors|author=|date=|website=historical.library.cornell.edu}}</ref> [[Robert Simpson Woodward]] called this \"the computer's rule\" indicating that it was then in common use by [[human computer]]s who calculated mathematical tables. [[Churchill Eisenhart]] indicated the practice was already \"well established\" in data analysis by the 1940s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis for Scientific and Industrial Research, and Production and Management Engineering|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=187\u2013223|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/selectedtechniqu00colu|author=Churchill Eisenhart|editors=Eisenhart, Hastay and Wallis|accessdate=30 January 2014|chapter=Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data|date=1947}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of the term ''bankers' rounding'' remains more obscure. If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find. To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report ''The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts''<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication1224_en.pdf</ref> suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that \"half-way\" amounts should be rounded up.\n\nUntil the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating-point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of [[interval arithmetic]].\n\nCurrently, much research tends to round to multiples of 5 or 2. For example, [[J\u00f6rg Baten]] used [[age heaping]] in many studies, to evaluate the numeracy level of ancient populations. He came up with the [[Whipple's index#ABCC Index|ABCC Index]], which enables the comparison of the [[numeracy]] among regions possible without any historical sources where the population [[literacy]] was measured.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baten|first1=J\u00f6rg|title=Quantifying Quantitative Literacy: Age Heaping and the History of Human Capita|journal=Journal of Economic History|date=2009|volume=69|issue=3|pages=783\u2013808|doi=10.1017/S0022050709001120|hdl=10230/481|url=http://repositori.upf.edu/bitstream/10230/481/1/996.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Rounding functions in programming languages==\nMost [[programming language]]s provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways. The earliest numeric languages, such as [[FORTRAN]] and [[C (programming language)|C]], would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero). This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an [[integer (computer science)|integer]] [[variable (programming)|variable]], or using a fractional number as an index of an [[array data type|array]]. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.\n\nIn the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard [[library (computing)|libraries]] of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up, down, to nearest, and towards zero). The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer. Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a [[double precision floating-point format|double precision float]] argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary. This approach may avoid spurious [[integer overflow|overflows]] because floating-point types have a larger range than integer types. Some languages, such as [[PHP]], provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300. In addition, many languages provide a [[printf]] or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the ''precision''). On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.\n\nOn the opposite, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their [[Document Object Model|DOM]] and in their [[interface description language|IDL]] interface as strings as if they had [[real RAM|infinite precision]], and do not discriminate between integers and floating-point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point values before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard [[JavaScript]] or [[ECMAScript]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf|title=ECMA-262 ECMAScript Language Specification|author=|date=|website=ecma-international.org}}</ref> interface bindings).\n\n==Other rounding standards==\nSome disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.\n\n===US weather observations===\nIn a guideline issued in mid-1966,<ref>OFCM, 2005: [http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420051036/http://www.ofcm.gov/fmh-1/fmh1.htm|date=1999-04-20 }}, Washington, DC., 104 pp.</ref> the [[United States|U.S.]] Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the \"round half up\" tie-breaking rule. For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and \u22121.5 should become \u22121. Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was \"round half away from zero\".\n\n===Negative zero in meteorology===\n{{Main|Signed zero#Scientific uses}}\n\nSome [[meteorology|meteorologist]]s may write \"&minus;0\" to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and &minus;0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to an integer.
