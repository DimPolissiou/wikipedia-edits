Brookline borders six of [[Boston]]'s neighborhoods: [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], [[Allston]], [[Fenway\u2013Kenmore]], [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]], [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[West Roxbury]]. The city of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] lies to the west of Brookline.\n\nAt the 2010 census, the population of the town was 58,732. It is the most populous municipality in Massachusetts to have a [[New England town|town]] (rather than city) form of government.\n\nBrookline was first settled in 1638 as a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in Boston; it was incorporated as a separate town in 1705.\n\nBrookline was the birthplace and hometown of [[John F. Kennedy]], 35th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dorchester 1858.jpg|thumb|right|1858 map of north-central Norfolk County, showing Brookline (upper left) along with Dorchester, Roxbury and West Roxbury, all three of which were later annexed by Boston]]\n\nOnce part of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] territory, Brookline was first settled by [[White people|European]] colonists in the early 17th century. The area was an outlying part of the colonial settlement of Boston and known as the hamlet of Muddy River. In 1705, it was incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The northern and southern borders of the town were marked by two small rivers or brooks, hence the name. The northern border with Brighton (which was itself part of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] until 1807) was Smelt Brook. (That name appears on maps starting at least as early as 1852, but sometime between 1888 and 1925 the brook was covered over.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html Packard's Corner: Once and Future City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725072914/http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html |date=July 25, 2009 }}</ref>) The southern boundary, abutting Boston, was the [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]].\n\nThe Town of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline border was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. This merger created a narrow strip of land along the [[Charles River]] belonging to Boston, cutting Brookline off from the shoreline. It also put certain lands north of the Muddy River on the Boston side, including what are now [[Kenmore Square]] and [[Packard's Corner]]. The current northern border follows Commonwealth Avenue, and on the northeast, St. Mary's Street. When [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] designed the [[Emerald Necklace]] of parks and parkways for Boston in the 1890s, the Muddy River was integrated into the [[Riverway]] and [[Olmsted Park]], creating parkland accessible by both Boston and Brookline residents.\n\nThroughout its history, Brookline has resisted being annexed by Boston, in particular during the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]]. The neighboring towns of [[West Roxbury]] and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]] connected Brookline to the rest of Norfolk County until they were annexed by Boston in 1874 and 1912, respectively, putting them in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]. Brookline is now separated from the remainder of Norfolk County.\n\nBrookline has long been regarded as a pleasant and verdant environment. In the 1841 edition of the ''Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening'', Andrew Jackson Downing described the area this way:\n{{quote|The whole of this neighborhood of Brookline is a kind of landscape garden, and there is nothing in America of the sort, so inexpressibly charming as the lanes which lead from one cottage, or villa, to another. No animals are allowed to run at large, and the open gates, with tempting vistas and glimpses under the pendent boughs, give it quite an Arcadian air of rural freedom and enjoyment. These lanes are clothed with a profusion of trees and wild shrubbery, often almost to the carriage tracks, and curve and wind about, in a manner quite bewildering to the stranger who attempts to thread them alone; and there are more hints here for the lover of the picturesque in lanes than we ever saw assembled together in so small a compass.<ref>[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html Arnold Arboretum Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202082944/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html |date=February 2, 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nBrookline residents were among the first in the country to propose extending the vote to women. [[Benjamin F. Butler]], in his 1882 campaign for Governor, advocated the idea.<ref>John Gould Curtis, History of the Town of Brookline Massachusetts, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York, 1933, pg.305</ref>\n\n===Transportation history===\nTwo branches of upper [[Boston Post Road]], established in the 1670s, passed through Brookline. Brookline Village was the original center of retail activity.<ref>[http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html Brookline Village] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008104829/http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}</ref> In 1810, the Boston and Worcester Turnpike, now [[Massachusetts Route 9]], was laid out, starting on [[Huntington Avenue]] in Boston and passing through the village center on its way west.\n\nSteam railroads came to Brookline in the middle of the 19th century. The [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] was constructed in the early 1830s, and passed through Brookline near the Charles River. The rail line is still in active use, now paralleled by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. The Highland Branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] was built from Kenmore Square to Brookline Village in 1847, and was extended into Newton in 1852. In the late 1950s, this would become the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]].\n\nThe portion of Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square was laid out in 1850.  [[Streetcar]] tracks were laid above ground on Beacon Street in 1888, from [[Coolidge Corner]] to [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in Boston, via Kenmore Square.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org/history/presComm/beaconSt.asp|title=History of Beacon St.|website=www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  In 1889, they were electrified and extended over the Brighton border at [[Cleveland Circle]]. They would eventually become the [[Green Line \"C\" Branch]].\n\nThanks to the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] system, this upgrade from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to electric trolleys occurred on many major streets all over the region, and made transportation into downtown Boston faster and cheaper. Much of Brookline was developed into a [[streetcar suburb]], with large brick apartment buildings sprouting up along the new streetcar lines.\n\n===Etymology===\nBrookline was known as the hamlet of '''Muddy River''' and was considered part of Boston until the Town of Brookline was independently incorporated in 1705.  (The [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]] was used as the Brookline\u2013Boston border at incorporation.) It is said that the name derives from a farm therein once owned by Judge [[Samuel Sewall]].<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Dudley, Dean (1871)\n| title =Brookline, Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury Directory for 1871; Containing a General Directory of the Residents, Town Registers, Business Directory, Map, &c., &c.\n| year = 1871\n| publisher=Dean Dudley & Co.\n| location =  Boston\n| isbn =\n| pages = 15\u201316\n| quote = The name of Brookline came, as the late Rev. Samuel Sewall (great grandson of Judge Samuel Sewall) conjectures, from one of the farms within its bounds, namely the Gates' farm, hired of Judge Sewall, which was probably called Brookline because Smelt-brook, running through it, formed the line between that and one of the neighboring farms, and this brook also separated that farm from Cambridge.  Judge Sewall, in his journal, often mentions the name \"Brookline\" before the town was incorporated.  Rev. Mr. S. also thinks it was Judge Sewall that suggested that name for the town.}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Brookline has a total area of {{convert|17.7|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, all but {{convert|0.1|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} (0.44%) of which is land.\n\nThe northern part of Brookline, roughly north of the D-line tracks, is urban in character, as highly walkable and transit rich. The population density of this part of town is nearly {{convert|20,000|PD/sqmi|-3}}, on a par with the densest neighborhoods in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], Massachusetts (the densest cities in New England), and just below that of central Boston's residential districts (Back Bay, South End, Fenway, etc.).  The overall density of Brookline, which also includes suburban districts and grand estates south of the D-line, is still higher than that of many of the largest cities in the United States, especially in the South and West.  Brookline borders [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] (part of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]) to the west and [[Boston]] (part of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) in all other directions; it is therefore non-contiguous with any other part of Norfolk County.  Brookline became an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] in 1873, when the neighboring town of [[West Roxbury]] was annexed by Boston (and left Norfolk County to join [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]), and Brookline refused to be annexed by Boston after the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]].\n\nBrookline separates the bulk of the city of Boston (except for a narrow neck or corridor near the [[Charles River]]) from its westernmost neighborhoods of [[Allston\u2013Brighton]], which had been the separate town of Brighton until annexed by Boston in 1873.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\nThere are many neighborhood associations, some of which overlap.<ref>{{cite web |title=Map - Brookline Neighborhood Alliance

Brookline borders six of [[Boston]]'s neighborhoods: [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], [[Allston]], [[Fenway\u2013Kenmore]], [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]], [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[West Roxbury]]. The city of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] lies to the west of Brookline.\n\nAt the 2010 census, the population of the town was 58,732. It is the most populous municipality in Massachusetts to have a [[New England town|town]] (rather than city) form of government.\n\nBrookline was first settled in 1638 as a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in Boston, but was incorporated as a separate town in 1705.\n\nBrookline was the birthplace and hometown of [[John F. Kennedy]], 35th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dorchester 1858.jpg|thumb|right|1858 map of north-central Norfolk County, showing Brookline (upper left) along with Dorchester, Roxbury and West Roxbury, all three of which were later annexed by Boston]]\n\nOnce part of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] territory, Brookline was first settled by [[White people|European]] colonists in the early 17th century. The area was an outlying part of the colonial settlement of Boston and known as the hamlet of Muddy River. In 1705, it was incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The northern and southern borders of the town were marked by two small rivers or brooks, hence the name. The northern border with Brighton (which was itself part of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] until 1807) was Smelt Brook. (That name appears on maps starting at least as early as 1852, but sometime between 1888 and 1925 the brook was covered over.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html Packard's Corner: Once and Future City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725072914/http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html |date=July 25, 2009 }}</ref>) The southern boundary, abutting Boston, was the [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]].\n\nThe Town of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline border was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. This merger created a narrow strip of land along the [[Charles River]] belonging to Boston, cutting Brookline off from the shoreline. It also put certain lands north of the Muddy River on the Boston side, including what are now [[Kenmore Square]] and [[Packard's Corner]]. The current northern border follows Commonwealth Avenue, and on the northeast, St. Mary's Street. When [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] designed the [[Emerald Necklace]] of parks and parkways for Boston in the 1890s, the Muddy River was integrated into the [[Riverway]] and [[Olmsted Park]], creating parkland accessible by both Boston and Brookline residents.\n\nThroughout its history, Brookline has resisted being annexed by Boston, in particular during the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]]. The neighboring towns of [[West Roxbury]] and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]] connected Brookline to the rest of Norfolk County until they were annexed by Boston in 1874 and 1912, respectively, putting them in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]. Brookline is now separated from the remainder of Norfolk County.\n\nBrookline has long been regarded as a pleasant and verdant environment. In the 1841 edition of the ''Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening'', Andrew Jackson Downing described the area this way:\n{{quote|The whole of this neighborhood of Brookline is a kind of landscape garden, and there is nothing in America of the sort, so inexpressibly charming as the lanes which lead from one cottage, or villa, to another. No animals are allowed to run at large, and the open gates, with tempting vistas and glimpses under the pendent boughs, give it quite an Arcadian air of rural freedom and enjoyment. These lanes are clothed with a profusion of trees and wild shrubbery, often almost to the carriage tracks, and curve and wind about, in a manner quite bewildering to the stranger who attempts to thread them alone; and there are more hints here for the lover of the picturesque in lanes than we ever saw assembled together in so small a compass.<ref>[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html Arnold Arboretum Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202082944/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html |date=February 2, 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nBrookline residents were among the first in the country to propose extending the vote to women. [[Benjamin F. Butler]], in his 1882 campaign for Governor, advocated the idea.<ref>John Gould Curtis, History of the Town of Brookline Massachusetts, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York, 1933, pg.305</ref>\n\n===Transportation history===\nTwo branches of upper [[Boston Post Road]], established in the 1670s, passed through Brookline. Brookline Village was the original center of retail activity.<ref>[http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html Brookline Village] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008104829/http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}</ref> In 1810, the Boston and Worcester Turnpike, now [[Massachusetts Route 9]], was laid out, starting on [[Huntington Avenue]] in Boston and passing through the village center on its way west.\n\nSteam railroads came to Brookline in the middle of the 19th century. The [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] was constructed in the early 1830s, and passed through Brookline near the Charles River. The rail line is still in active use, now paralleled by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. The Highland Branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] was built from Kenmore Square to Brookline Village in 1847, and was extended into Newton in 1852. In the late 1950s, this would become the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]].\n\nThe portion of Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square was laid out in 1850.  [[Streetcar]] tracks were laid above ground on Beacon Street in 1888, from [[Coolidge Corner]] to [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in Boston, via Kenmore Square.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org/history/presComm/beaconSt.asp|title=History of Beacon St.|website=www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  In 1889, they were electrified and extended over the Brighton border at [[Cleveland Circle]]. They would eventually become the [[Green Line \"C\" Branch]].\n\nThanks to the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] system, this upgrade from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to electric trolleys occurred on many major streets all over the region, and made transportation into downtown Boston faster and cheaper. Much of Brookline was developed into a [[streetcar suburb]], with large brick apartment buildings sprouting up along the new streetcar lines.\n\n===Etymology===\nBrookline was known as the hamlet of '''Muddy River''' and was considered part of Boston until the Town of Brookline was independently incorporated in 1705.  (The [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]] was used as the Brookline\u2013Boston border at incorporation.) It is said that the name derives from a farm therein once owned by Judge [[Samuel Sewall]].<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Dudley, Dean (1871)\n| title =Brookline, Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury Directory for 1871; Containing a General Directory of the Residents, Town Registers, Business Directory, Map, &c., &c.\n| year = 1871\n| publisher=Dean Dudley & Co.\n| location =  Boston\n| isbn =\n| pages = 15\u201316\n| quote = The name of Brookline came, as the late Rev. Samuel Sewall (great grandson of Judge Samuel Sewall) conjectures, from one of the farms within its bounds, namely the Gates' farm, hired of Judge Sewall, which was probably called Brookline because Smelt-brook, running through it, formed the line between that and one of the neighboring farms, and this brook also separated that farm from Cambridge.  Judge Sewall, in his journal, often mentions the name \"Brookline\" before the town was incorporated.  Rev. Mr. S. also thinks it was Judge Sewall that suggested that name for the town.}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Brookline has a total area of {{convert|17.7|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, all but {{convert|0.1|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} (0.44%) of which is land.\n\nThe northern part of Brookline, roughly north of the D-line tracks, is urban in character, as highly walkable and transit rich. The population density of this part of town is nearly {{convert|20,000|PD/sqmi|-3}}, on a par with the densest neighborhoods in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], Massachusetts (the densest cities in New England), and just below that of central Boston's residential districts (Back Bay, South End, Fenway, etc.).  The overall density of Brookline, which also includes suburban districts and grand estates south of the D-line, is still higher than that of many of the largest cities in the United States, especially in the South and West.  Brookline borders [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] (part of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]) to the west and [[Boston]] (part of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) in all other directions; it is therefore non-contiguous with any other part of Norfolk County.  Brookline became an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] in 1873, when the neighboring town of [[West Roxbury]] was annexed by Boston (and left Norfolk County to join [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]), and Brookline refused to be annexed by Boston after the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]].\n\nBrookline separates the bulk of the city of Boston (except for a narrow neck or corridor near the [[Charles River]]) from its westernmost neighborhoods of [[Allston\u2013Brighton]], which had been the separate town of Brighton until annexed by Boston in 1873.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\nThere are many neighborhood associations, some of which overlap.<ref>{{cite web |title=Map - Brookline Neighborhood Alliance

The Royal Engineers also used Shed No.1 for its rehearsals for the 1987 Royal Tournament.\n\nHangar 1 was used by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) to operate balloons on behalf of the [[Met Office]] carrying instruments to measure conditions in the atmosphere. The balloons were also used in [[parachute]] development (although they were unmanned \u2013 using a heavy dead weight); much of this work was carried out in secret.\n\nFor both airships and barrage balloons, Cardington manufactured its own [[hydrogen]], in the '''Gas Factory''', using the [[steam reforming]] process.  In 1948 the Gas Factory became 279 MU (Maintenance Unit), RAF Cardington; and then, in 1955, 217 MU.\n\n217 MU, RAF Cardington, produced all the gases used by the Royal Air Force until its closure in April 2000; including [[gas cylinder]] filling and maintenance.\n\n==Post military use==\n===Driving Standards Agency (DSA)===\nThe northern part of the site has for many years been used by the UK Government [[Driving Standards Agency]] Training and Development Centre to train Driving Examiners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsa.gov.uk/Category.asp?cat=728/ |title=DSA Training and Development Centre (website accessed: 28 July 2010) |publisher=Dsa.gov.uk |accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Building Research Establishment===\nIn 1971 Hangar 2 became the Fire Research Station (part of the Home Office) which conducted gas explosion experiments and for investigating fires.

The details of his life are not well recorded, but it is known that he was a prominent member of the [[Irish Confederacy]] which governed much of Ireland between 1642 and 1649.\n\nHe was a member of a leading Dublin landowning family,  who lost most of their  their possessions after the failure of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. He is now remembered mainly as the author of ''Landgartha'', the first play by an Irish playwright to be produced in an Irish [[theatre]],  and as the father of the poet Eleanor Burnell.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Burnell, Henry |first=John Thomas|last=Gilbert|volume=7}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nHe was the son of Christopher Burnell of [[Balgriffin]], and grandson of [[Henry Burnell]], [[Recorder of Dublin]], who died in 1614.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.223</ref> The [[Burnell family]] had been landowners in [[Dublin]] since the late fourteenth century and were Lords of the Manors of Balgriffin and [[Castleknock]]. They had a long tradition of serving as judges, especially on the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]]; but most of them were stubbornly [[Roman Catholic]] in their religious beliefs and as a result. after the [[Protestant Reformation]] their loyalty to the Crown was often suspect. Little is known of Henry's personal life, except that he was  rich and eligible  enough to marry one of  the Earl of Roscommon's daughters.  He probably inherited his  money from his grandfather, who made a fortune at the [[Irish Bar]].\n\n==Landgartha==\n''Landgartha'', Burnell's only surviving play,<ref>We know of at least one earlier play, now lost.</ref> was produced at the [[Werburgh Street Theatre]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]] 1640. it was the first work by an Irish playwright to be produced on the Irish stage<ref>There is reason to think  that Burnell had tried, but failed to have an earlier play produced in Dublin.</ref> and one of the last productions  before the theatre closed in 1641.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> The text of the play was published in Dublin in 1641 under the title \"Landgartha, a tragi-comedy as it was presented in the new theatre in Dublin with good applause\". The foreword contains evidence that Burnell wrote other plays which have not survived.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> He is thought to have collaborated with the leading English dramatist [[James Shirley]], who was working in Dublin  between 1635 and 1640.   The creation of a distinctive Irish theatre was a personal project of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], and Burnell benefitted from his patronage, despite Strafford's generally poor relations with the [[Anglo-Irish]] gentry.<ref>Wedgwood, C.

They are victorious in battle and Landgartha kills Frollo herself. She and Reyner marry and have children but her happiness is short-lived. Reyner abandons her and contemplates remarrying Uraca, but when Reyner is threatened with destruction by his rival Harald, Landgartha loyally comes to his aid and defeats Harald. The play ends on a note of reconciliation: it is agreed that the children of Landgartha and Reyner will rule both Denmark and Norway, while Uraca gives up her hope of marrying Reyner. Whether Landgartha and Reyner will live together once more as man and wife is left unclear. Burnell later defended the inconclusive ending, pointing out that his play was neither a comedy or a tragedy, but something in between (as he himself described it,  a \"[[tragicomedy]]\"). This was a  valid point since the tragicomedy was by the seventeen century familiar  to English audiences.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\n===Possible political themes===\nBecause of  the troubled period it was written in, and because of  Burnell's later political career, some scholars have looked for political themes in the play.<ref>Pilkington, Lionel \"Theatre and Ireland\"  Red Globe Press 2010 p.28</ref> It has been suggested that Landgartha symbolises the old [[Anglo-Irish]] ruling class to which Burnell belonged, and that Reyner represents the New English aristocracy who, by denying the Anglo-Irish their full share in public life, abandoned them. In the alternative, it can be read as a straightforward  defence of England's colonizing role in Ireland.<ref>Pilkington p.28</ref> A more elaborate parallel suggests that Reyner represents [[King Charles I of England]] and that the plot reflects the political turbulence which led to the [[English Civil War]].\n\n===Reputation as a playwright===\nBurnell refers to the \"good applause\" his play received, and quotes an English writer who called him \"the true heir of [[Ben Jonson]]\", an opinion which few critics either then or later have shared.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref> In more recent times, the biographer of his patron the Earl of Strafford gave her frank view that while ''Landgartha'' was an important milestone in the development of the Irish theatre, it has no merits whatsoever as a play.<ref>Wedgwood p.22</ref> That this view was widely shared in Burnell's own time is suggested by his bitter reference to \"the other babblers\"  (i.e. critics) who had apparently ridiculed his play, and whom he in turn regarded with contempt.  His efforts to have an earlier play produced had apparently failed, due in his opinion to the hostility of his critics.<ref>Gilbert p.386</ref>\n\n==Irish Confederacy==\nGiven his status as a leading Catholic landowner of [[the Pale]], with a long family tradition of opposition to the Crown, it was natural that Burnell should be a prominent member of the Irish Confederacy. However little is known of his role in the events of 1641\u20139, except that he lost his estates at Balgriffin and Castleknock almost at once, and that his family never recovered them.

Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].  She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Phoenix, [[Calvin Charles Gallery]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and \"The Gallery\" in [[Cabo

to paint.

As a member of the Board, she promoted the involvement of marginalized Latino communities to arts-related tasks. She is the founder of [[Essant\u00e9 Corporation]], a multinational entity established specifically for people seeking better health and greater opportunities in their lives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}}\n\nFalcone exhibited her work in [[La Paz]] (Nota Gallery) in July 2010{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]] (Lorca Gallery) in September 2010{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} - [[Bolivia]], in PINTA [[New York City]] (December 2010), [[Miami International Art Fair]] <ref>[http://mia-artfair.com/press_articles/releases/print/mia_release_features.pdf Press Article in mia-artfair.com ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821212926/http://mia-artfair.com/press_articles/releases/print/mia_release_features.pdf |date=2011-08-21 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/best-art-from-miami-international-art-fair-6489236|title=Best Art From Miami International Art Fair|last=McCorquodale|first=Amanda|date=2011-01-14|website=Miami New Times|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> (January 2011) and from June 6, in PINTA <ref>[http://www.undo.net/it/mostra/121216 Article in www.undu.net]</ref>[[London]] (June 2011).\n\nIn these exhibitions, Falcone manifests another phase of her personality with her most well-known work \"Windows of the Soul\", revealing elements that reflect her life experience. Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].  She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Phoenix, [[Calvin Charles Gallery]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and \"The Gallery\" in [[Cabo

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and later a [[Progressive Party 1912 (United States)|Progressive]], he served as a [[United States Representative]] and [[United States Senator]] from the state of [[Washington (State)|Washington]].  Poindexter also served as [[United States Ambassador to Peru]] during the presidential administrations of [[Warren Harding]] and [[Calvin Coolidge]].\n\nA native of [[Memphis, Tennessee]], Poindexter was raised in Virginia, received a law degree from [[Washington and Lee University]] in 1891 and moved to [[Walla Walla, Washington]], where he practiced law and entered politics as a Republican.  He served as prosecuting attorney in Walla Walla, and then moved to Spokane, where he was assistant prosecuting attorney and a superior court judge.\n\nIn 1908, Poindexter was elected to the U.S. House.  He served one term (1909-1911), and was reelected in 1910.  He resigned before his new term began in March 1911 because the state legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate.  He was reelected in 1916, and served from 1911 to 1923.  Poindexter became a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] member in 1913, but returned to the Republicans in 1915.  Poindexter was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 1920, and for reelection to the Senate in 1922.  In 1923, Poindexter was appointed Ambassador to Peru.  He served until 1928, when he returned to Washington and waged an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate.\n\nAfter losing the 1928 election, Poindexter moved to [[Natural Bridge Station, Virginia]].  He died there in 1946, and was buried at Fairmount Memorial Park in Spokane.\n\n==Early life==\nPoindexter was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the son of Josephine (Anderson) Poindexter and William B. Poindexter.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  His parents were residents of [[Malvern Hill]] in [[Henrico County, Virginia]], and his father was an [[American Civil War]] veteran of the [[Confederate States Army]].{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  Poindexter was raised in Virginia, and attended the [[Fancy Hill]] Academy in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]].{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  He then attended [[Washington and Lee University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], from which he graduated with an [[bachelor of laws|LL.B.]] degree in 1891.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}\n\n==Legal career==\nAfter he graduated, he settled in [[Walla Walla, Washington]], where he was admitted to the bar and began the practice of law.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  In 1892 he became the [[prosecuting attorney]] of [[Walla Walla County]].{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  He moved to [[Spokane, Washington]] in 1897 where he continued the practice of law.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  He served as the assistant prosecuting attorney for [[Spokane County]] from 1898 to 1904, and as a [[judge]] of the [[superior court]] from 1904 to 1908.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|pages=706-707}}\n\n==Political career==\nHe was elected as a Republican to the [[Sixty-first United States Congress|Sixty-first Congress]], and served from March 4, 1909 to March 3, 1911 representing Washington's newly created [[Washington's 3rd congressional district|3rd congressional district]].{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=707}}  He was reelected in 1910, but resigned in 1911 because the [[Washington State Legislature]] elected him to the U.S. Senate.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=707}}  He was reelected in 1916, and served from March 4, 1911 to March 3, 1923.{{sfn|''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-2005''|page=1747}} Poindexter left the Republican Party in 1913 to join the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]], rejoining the Republicans in 1915.{{sfn|\"Biographical Note, Miles Poindexter\"|page=1}}\n\nDuring World War I, Poindexter moved away from supporting progressive causes and led several efforts that questioned the patriotism of German-Americans and attempted to keep them wartime leadership positions in the military. In a highly-publicized instance, Poindexter accussed German-born Colonel Carl Reichmann (1859-1937), a distinguished Army officer who had served since 1881, of being pro-German and used the legislative process to block Reichmann's promotion to brigadier general. Reichmann had become a US citizen in 1887 and the promotion was supported by [[American Expeditionary Forces]] commander [[John J. Pershing]], [[Hugh L. Scott]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]], and [[Newton D.

As a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and later a [[Progressive Party 1912 (United States)|Progressive]], he served as a [[United States Representative]] and [[United States Senator]] from the state of [[Washington (State)|Washington]].  Poindexter also served as [[United States Ambassador to Peru]] during the presidential administrations of [[Warren Harding]] and [[Calvin Coolidge]].\n\nA native of [[Memphis, Tennessee]], Poindexter was raised in Virginia, received a law degree from [[Washington and Lee University]] in 1891 and moved to [[Walla Walla, Washington]], where he practiced law and entered politics as a Republican.  He served as prosecuting attorney in Walla Walla, and then moved to Spokane, where he was assistant prosecuting attorney and a superior court judge.\n\nIn 1908, Poindexter was elected to the U.S. House.  He served one term (1909-1911), and was reelected in 1910.  He resigned before his new term began in March 1911 because the state legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate.  He was reelected in 1916, and served from 1911 to 1923.  Poindexter became a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] member in 1913, but returned to the Republicans in 1915.  Poindexter was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 1920, and for reelection to the Senate in 1922.  In 1923, Poindexter was appointed Ambassador to Peru.  He served until 1928, when he returned to Washington and waged an unsuccessful campaign for the Senate.\n\nAfter losing the 1928 election, Poindexter moved to [[Natural Bridge Station, Virginia]].  He died there in 1946, and was buried at Fairmount Memorial Park in Spokane.\n\n==Early life==\nPoindexter was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the son of Josephine (Anderson) Poindexter and William B. Poindexter.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  His parents were residents of [[Malvern Hill]] in [[Henrico County, Virginia]], and his father was an [[American Civil War]] veteran of the [[Confederate States Army]].{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  Poindexter was raised in Virginia, and attended the [[Fancy Hill]] Academy in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]].{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  He then attended [[Washington and Lee University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], from which he graduated with an [[bachelor of laws|LL.B.]] degree in 1891.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}\n\n==Legal career==\nAfter he graduated, he settled in [[Walla Walla, Washington]], where he was admitted to the bar and began the practice of law.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  In 1892 he became the [[prosecuting attorney]] of [[Walla Walla County]].{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  He moved to [[Spokane, Washington]] in 1897 where he continued the practice of law.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=706}}  He served as the assistant prosecuting attorney for [[Spokane County]] from 1898 to 1904, and as a [[judge]] of the [[superior court]] from 1904 to 1908.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|pages=706-707}}\n\n==Political career==\nHe was elected as a Republican to the [[Sixty-first United States Congress|Sixty-first Congress]], and served from March 4, 1909 to March 3, 1911 representing Washington's newly created [[Washington's 3rd congressional district|3rd congressional district]].{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=707}}  He was reelected in 1910, but resigned in 1911 because the [[Washington State Legislature]] elected him to the U.S. Senate.{{sfn|''History of the City of Spokane and Spokane County, Washington''|page=707}}  He was reelected in 1916, and served from March 4, 1911 to March 3, 1923.{{sfn|''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-2005''|page=1747}} Poindexter left the Republican Party in 1913 to join the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]], rejoining the Republicans in 1915.{{sfn|\"Biographical Note, Miles Poindexter\"|page=1}}\n\nDuring World War I, Poindexter moved away from supporting progressive causes and led several efforts that questioned the patriotism of German-Americans and agttempted to keep them wartime leadership positions in the military. In a highly-publicized instance, Poindexter accussed German-born Colonel Carl Reichmann (1859-1937), a distinguished Army officer who had served since 1881, of being pro-German and used the legislative process to block Reichmann's promotion to brigadier general. Reichmann had become a US citizen in 1887 and the promotion was supported by [[American Expeditionary Forces]] commander [[John J. Pershing]], [[Hugh L. Scott]], the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]], and [[Newton D.
