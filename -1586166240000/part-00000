Some animals are displayed indoors in pavilions and outdoors in what would be their naturalistic environments, with viewing at many levels. It also has areas such as the Kids Zoo, Waterside Theatre, and Splash Island. It has one of the most taxonomically diverse collection of animals on display of any zoo; it is currently home to over 5,000 animals (including invertebrates and fish) representing over 500 [[species]]. The zoo is open to the public every day of the year except [[Christmas|December 25]].\n\nThe zoo is owned by the [[City of Toronto government]]. Founded by Hugh A. Crothers, an industrialist who became the first Chairman of the Metro Toronto Zoological Society in 1966, the zoo opened on August 15, 1974, as the '''Metropolitan Toronto Zoo'''. The word \"Metropolitan\" was dropped from its name when the [[Metropolitan Toronto|Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto]] was [[Amalgamation of Toronto|amalgamated into the current city]] in 1998. The zoo is located near the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] on the western border of [[Rouge National Urban Park|Rouge Park]] in the city's east end district of [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Predecessor ===\nAround 1880, businessman Harry L. Piper (1839\u20131921) established a Zoological and Acclimatization Society (also as Toronto Zoological Garden) and open a zoological gardens at Old Post Office Lane at Toronto Street north of King Street East, then in 1881 to a lot at Front Street and York Street next to the [[Queen's Hotel, Toronto|Queen's Hotel]] and finally to the eastern end of the Exhibition Grounds in 1885.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritagetoronto.org/torontos-first-zoo/|title=Toronto's First Zoo &#124;|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205115443/http://heritagetoronto.org/torontos-first-zoo/|archive-date=5 December 2013|access-date=}}</ref> Piper was also Alderman for St. John's Ward from 1877 to 1880 and 1883\u20131888.\n[[File:Women with goat.jpg|left|thumb|[[Stereoscope|Stereo card]] of a goat at the [[Riverdale Zoo]]. Opened in 1888, the Riverdale Zoo was the predecessor to the modern Toronto Zoo. Riverdale Zoo later became a [[livestock]] zoo.]]\nIn 1888, the [[Riverdale Farm|Riverdale Zoo]] opened in Toronto, as a typical example of a zoo during this time, with animals displayed as curiosities in dark cages and cramped enclosures. Animals for Piper's zoo moved to this site.\n\nIn 1963, a private citizen's brief to build a new zoo was introduced by Hugh Crothers to the Chairman of the Council of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, [[William Allen (Canadian politician)|William Allen]]. Allen asked Crothers to head up a committee to investigate the feasibility of a new zoo. By 1966, a group of eleven people became The Metro Toronto Zoological Society with Crothers as the first Chairman.\n\nOriginal plans were to have the park located at the Leaside area, but the site was later used to create the [[E.T. Seton Park]]. In 1966, Mr. Crothers and the 10 other citizens met at City Hall to form the ''Metropolitan Toronto Zoological Society''. In 1967, the [[Metropolitan Toronto|Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto]] approved the Rouge Park site in Scarborough for a new zoo. The following year, a feasibility study on the new zoo was produced by architect [[Raymond Moriyama]]. In 1969, a master plan was created by Johnson Sustronk Weinstein and Associates<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontozoo.com/AboutTheZoo/History.asp|title=History of the zoo|accessdate=August 15, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220230653/http://www.torontozoo.com/AboutTheZoo/History.asp|archivedate=February 20, 2007}}</ref> that was approved by the Zoological Society. Construction of the new zoo began in 1970. On August 15, 1974, the ''Metropolitan Toronto Zoo'' was open to the public. The zoo increased from the original Riverdale Zoo's {{Convert|3|ha}} to {{Convert|287|ha}}, and is now one of the largest zoos in the world. The Zoo introduced some designs to enhance the public's viewing experience and the animals' living comfort. Animals were displayed in naturalized environments and grouped according to their zoogeographic region. The old zoo was converted into an urban farm called [[Riverdale Farm]], which opened in 1978.\n\n=== Since opening ===\n[[File:Toronto zoo monorail.jpg|thumb|The [[Toronto Zoo Domain Ride]] a year after it opened in 1977. Operating from 1976 to 1994, the [[monorail]] transported guests to various sections in the zoo.]]\nIn 1976, the Zoo opened the ''[[Toronto Zoo Domain Ride|Canadian Domain Ride]]'', a monorail that traveled into the Zoo's Canadian Domain area, located in the Rouge Valley. The rides operations were placed on hold in July 1994 after an accident. The monorail has since been mothballed with many sections becoming [[Ecological succession|overgrown with vegetation]]. A 2009 study determined it would cost upwards of $800,000 to return the infrastructure to use and upgrade it to current standards. A fundraising drive was started in 2010 and has since raised $1.15 million. Plans are to have the monorail functional and running by 2018{{Citation needed|reason=Can't find any sources.|date=November 2018}}. In the interim, the current Zoomobile uses five (4-car set) [[Optima Bus Corporation|Chance Coach]] Sunliner trams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto-travel-guide.com/toronto-zoo.html|title=Toronto Zoo - Admission, Location, Cost, Hours, Maps and Events|publisher=|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1980 and 1984, several new exhibits were added to the zoo, including [[gaur]], a children's zoo (Littlefootland) that does not exist anymore, and a new indoor habitat for [[African elephant]]s, [[snow leopard]]s and the Indian Rhinoceros Pavilion, as well as, the official opening of the Zoomobile.\n\nIn 1985, ''Qing Qing'' and ''Quan Quan''<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/704835 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Donovan | last=Vincent | title=$28,000 Panda Trip Gets Okay From Zoo | date=October 3, 2009}}</ref> \u2013 a pair of [[giant panda]]s, on loan for three months from the [[People's Republic of China]], were displayed at the Zoo. The Zoo broke all previous attendance records as thousands of visitors came to see these rare animals. Over the years, the Zoo has presented other rare or unusual animals, including [[Snub-nosed monkey|golden monkeys]] (1986), [[koala]]s (1988, 1996, 2002), [[Tasmanian devil]]s (the late 1970s until 1998), [[white lion]]s (1995, 2012), and [[walruses]] (2020).\n\nIn 1987, the zoo opened the Maya Temple exhibit and Wolf Woods exhibit. In 1988, the zoo completed new reptile exhibits in the Australasia Pavilion and the Primate Wing in the Americas Pavilion. Caracal lynx exhibit opened in 1989, the year after the spotted-neck otter exhibit opened.\n\nIn 1993, the red panda exhibit re-opened and the Malayan Woods Pavilion opened. The sumatran [[tiger]]s arrived in 1994. [[Naked mole-rat]]s went on exhibit in 1996. Komodo dragons become a feature exhibit in 1997.\n\nIn 1997, zoo workers went on strike, for nine weeks, however, the zoo remained open.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cp24.com/news/toronto-zoo-closed-as-more-than-400-workers-walk-off-the-job-1.3408412|title=Toronto Zoo closed as more than 400 workers walk off the job|date=May 11, 2017|work=Codi Wilson|publisher=CP24|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}</ref> After the strike, they signed a minimum compliment contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://1989.cupe.ca/2017/05/16/cupe-1989-supports-striking-zoo-workers-and-you-should-too/|title=CUPE 1989 Supports Striking Zoo Workers, and You Should, Too|date=May 16, 2017|publisher=CUPE 1989|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:DSC00692 - Splash Island at the Toronto Zoo (7693742670).jpg|thumb|In 2001, the Toronto Zoo opened an educational [[water play area]] known as Splash Island.]]\nIn 1998, with the amalgamation of the individual municipalities that made up Metro Toronto, the Zoo was officially renamed the ''Toronto Zoo.'' That same year, the Zoo opened the Africa Savannah exhibits, the largest expansion in its history. In 2001, the zoo added eyelash vipers to its collection and opened the Gorilla Rainforest, the world's largest indoor habitat for [[western lowland gorilla]]. The zoo's Splash Island, an educationally-themed [[water play area]], opened in 2002. This was followed by an open-air amphitheatre in 2003 and the 'Kid's Zoo' in 2004 featuring exhibits geared to guests 10 years of age and under.\n\n==== 21st century ====\nWhile the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] crisis in 2003 had a devastating effect on the tourism industry in Toronto, the Zoo fared well with local residents supporting the zoo by visiting often. The Zoo's attendance has recovered well with many record-breaking annual attendance numbers since then.\n\nIn November 2006, the Toronto Zoo temporarily closed the Australasia Pavilion for redevelopment. The pavilion underwent two years of construction, resulting in new exhibits including a Great Barrier Reef area (where the former Edge of Night exhibit used to be). The Great Barrier Reef exhibit consists of a large seven-metre-long community tank featuring [[brownbanded bamboo shark]]s, [[damselfish]], and angel fish. There is also a lion fish, as well as enlarged seahorse tanks. Coral and moon jelly fish have also been added to the collection\u2014both firsts for the Toronto Zoo. This pavilion reopened on May 16, 2008.\n\nIn May 2007, ''Dinosaurs Alive'' opened, which featured 18 animated dinosaur models and life-size skeleton replicas. It featured the largest T-Rex model in North America. This exhibit was enjoyed by over 600,000 visitors and was included with zoo admission. The exhibit closed in October 2007. On August 21, 2007, the [[polar bear]], [[llama]], [[Dall sheep]] and [[Mara (mammal)|mara]] exhibits were closed for the construction of the new {{convert|10|acre|adj=on}} Tundra Trek area. This project was the first phase of the North Zoo Site Redevelopment Project. Tundra Trek features new exhibits for the popular [[polar bear]], [[reindeer]], [[Arctic fox]], [[Arctic wolf]] and [[snowy owl]]. Coming back to take up residence in the new polar bear exhibit were 3 orphaned polar bears initially raised at the zoo and named by the community: Aurora, Nikita, and Inukshuk. The Tundra Trek opened on August 1, 2009.\n\nOn May 16, 2008, ''Stingray Bay'' opened for the first time. This interactive exhibit allowed the public to touch, feel, and feed live stingrays.

All parties agreed to the transfer of existing donor funds to the Toronto Community Foundation.\n\nOn August 15, 2009, the Toronto Zoo celebrated its 35-year anniversary. During that weekend the public got to learn about some of the zoos oldest residents, including; Marg the [[demoiselle crane]] and Monty the West African [[dwarf crocodile]]. On September 9, 2009, the south side of the African Rainforest Pavilion was closed for construction. During construction, one of the [[mandrill]]s scheduled to move into the new area died, and the rest were moved to another zoo. The pavilion opened in early 2011, with new exhibits for [[pygmy hippopotamus|pygmy hippos]], [[red river hog]]s, Nile softshell turtle, and lemurs instead of the mandrills, as well as a variety of exhibits for fish and reptiles.\n[[File:Scholfield statue toronto.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of [[Frank Schofield]] at the Schofield Memorial/Asian Gardens.

This exhibit once was the old South African cape fur seal exhibit and it was closed in 2010 and modified to house black-footed penguins.

The African Savanna featured species include [[white lion]]s, [[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]s, [[olive baboon]]s, [[greater kudu]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[white rhinoceros]]es, river [[hippopotamus]]es, [[spotted hyena]]s, [[African penguin]]s and [[masai giraffe]]. The African Rainforest Pavilion holds the world's largest indoor [[Western Lowland Gorilla|gorilla]] exhibit, home to [[Charles the Gorilla|Charles]], as well as dozens of other more sensitive African species, including [[meerkat]]s, [[red river hog]]s, West African [[dwarf crocodile]]s, and [[pygmy hippopotamus]]es. The south side of the African Rainforest Pavilion underwent extensive renovations in 2009 and 2010, and opened in the spring of 2011. The south side of the pavilion is completely refurbished and showcases [[ring-tailed lemur]]s and [[Aldabra giant tortoise|Aldabra giant tortoises]].\n\nThe Toronto Zoo received three white African lion cubs in 2012 to replace the single white lioness the zoo had since 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/04/new-white-lion-cubs-make-toronto-zoo-debut/|title=New White lion cubs make Toronto Zoo debut|date=May 4, 2012|work=Vidya Kauri|publisher=National Post|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Canadian Domain===\n[[File:Canadian Wood bison Bison bison athabascae.JPG|thumb|Two [[bison]] located in the Canadian Domain of the Toronto Zoo.]]\nThe Canadian Domain is situated in the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge Valley]]. The animals in this area will all be regrouped onto the table land. The Canadian Domain was built in accompaniment with the [[Toronto Zoo Domain Ride|Canadian Domain Ride]], which exhibited North American animals in their native environment. Featured species in this area include [[wood bison]], [[moose]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[Canada lynx|lynxes]], [[raccoon]]s, and [[grizzly bears]]. The Toronto Zoo is currently participating in a breeding program for the Canadian bison. Canadian Domain is slated to be moved onto the zoo's tableland in coming years and renamed Canadian Wilderness.\n\n===Americas===\nThis area of the zoo houses animals from both North and South America. Animals include several species of [[New World monkey]]s. The Americas Pavilion displays a wide variety of amphibians, reptiles, fish, and insects. Some of its most popular residents are the [[common marmoset]]s, [[golden lion tamarin]]s, [[Linnaeus's two-toed sloth]]s, [[American alligator]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[North American river otter|river otter]]s and a [[Enteroctopus dofleini|giant Pacific octopus]]. The Mayan Temple Ruins features [[jaguar]]s, [[capybara]]s, [[blue-and-yellow macaw]]s, [[scarlet macaw]]s, [[spider monkey]]s, and [[American flamingo]]s. The Americas Pavilion houses the majority of the zoo's reptile and amphibian collection, as well as a large number of its invertebrates, and was the designated area for the 2008 Year of the Frog conservation project. In 2006, a [[two-toed sloth]] was born; this was the first birth of this species at the zoo. The Americas Pavilion will undergo a transition as per the North Zoo Site Redevelopment from the Americas Pavilion to the Tropical American Pavilion. Some Americas animals will be relocated with this redevelopment project.\n\n===Australasia===\n[[File:2 Western Grey Kangaroos.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[western grey kangaroo]]s located in the Australasia Domain of the Toronto Zoo.]]\nThe Australasian Pavilion features animals from the Australian mainland, as well as [[Oceania|surrounding islands]]. Featured species in this area include thorny devil [[Phasmatodea|stick insects]], a variety of small Australian [[reptile]]s, [[Western grey kangaroo]]s, [[wallaby|wallabies]], [[echidna]]s, [[southern hairy-nosed wombat]]s, [[kookaburra]]s, [[red-tailed black cockatoo]]s, [[Matschie's tree-kangaroo]]s, and [[Komodo dragon]]s.<ref name=\"zoo_australasia\"/> The Komodo dragons were donated to the zoo as a gift from the [[President of Indonesia]]. This pavilion once had an \"Edge of Night\" section to highlight [[Crepuscular animal|crepuscular]] and [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] [[marsupial]]s, but this was later converted into the [[Great Barrier Reef]] exhibit featuring [[seahorse]]s, a live coral and [[Aurelia aurita|jellyfish]] tank, [[Pterois|lionfish]], [[brownbanded bamboo shark]]s, and a {{Convert|7|m|adj=on}} long community tank. The exhibits inside the pavilion also received facelifts during the transition, including and outdoor area for the hairy-nosed [[wombat]]s and swamp [[wallaby|wallabies]].\n\n===Eurasia Wilds===\nOften regarded as the oldest part of the zoo, Eurasia received a large overhaul in 2014. The featured species in this section of the zoo are [[snow leopard]]s, [[west caucasian tur]], [[mouflon]], [[chamois]], [[red panda]]s, and [[Bactrian camel]]s. With the area's redesign to the Eurasia Wilds [[Steller's sea eagle]]s were added; while several other species are now only viewable from the Zoomobile, including [[lion-tailed macaques]], [[Domestic yak|yak]], and a [[demoiselle crane]], as well as the herd of [[Przewalski's horse]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontozoo.com/ExploreTheZoo/AnimalsOffDisplay.asp|title=Toronto Zoo - Toronto Zoo - Animals Off Display|last=|first=|date=|website=www.torontozoo.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630144114/http://www.torontozoo.com/ExploreTheZoo/AnimalsOffDisplay.asp|archive-date=30 June 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Caged (4079886616).jpg|thumb|left|A [[red panda]] in the Eurasia Wilds section of the zoo.]]\nFrom May 18, 2013 to March 18, 2018, the area included two [[giant panda]]s: Er Shun (female) and Da Mao (male). With the pandas' arrival, the zoo has refurbished its seasonal attraction area into an extensive educational centre \u2013 the Giant Panda Interpretive Centre. In 2014, after her first estrus, Er Shun was artificially inseminated \u2013 the first such procedure performed on a panda in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontozoo.com/press/releases.asp?pg=20140612|title=Toronto Zoo - Press Releases|work=Toronto Zoo|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> No baby was born in 2014 and it was believed that Er Shun experienced a [[pseudopregnancy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontozoo.com/press/releases.asp?pg=20141211|title=Toronto Zoo - Press Releases|website=www.torontozoo.com|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> a phenomenon common in giant pandas. In 2015, Er Shun was again artificially inseminated, resulting in the first birth of giant pandas in Canada.

This area became the sixth region of the zoo, and showcases a variety of Arctic animals including [[reindeer]], [[polar bear]]s, [[snowy owl]]s, [[snow goose|snow geese]], [[Arctic fox]]es, and [[Arctic wolf|Arctic wolves]]. The new state-of-the-art exhibits are larger in order to encourage breeding. Educational theming emphasizes the lives of the Inuit and the effects of climate change.\n\nIn November 2019, the zoo announced that two [[walruses]] would be loaned to the zoo from [[Aquarium du Qu\u00e9bec]] in 2020. They are to be housed in one of the polar bear exhibits.\n\n===Discovery Zone===\nThis area is geared towards children by featuring educational themes and exhibits. The most prominent area is a children's water park, Splash Island, which features landscaping and themed objects depicting the three states of water: solid (ice), liquid, and gas. Exhibits are grouped around variously themed groups of aquatic animals, including rivers, lakes, and oceans. Waterside Theatre is an open-air enclosure where live demonstrations of a variety of animals are shown, including [[alpaca]]s, [[goat]]s, [[marabou stork]]s, [[grey crowned crane]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[ferret]]s, and [[abyssinian ground hornbill]]s. A third area, the Kids Zoo, consists of a variety of animals that children can interact with, such as [[guinea pigs]], [[common raven]]s, and [[secretary bird]]s. The Discovery Zone also hosted Dinosaurs Alive and the Stingray Bay exhibit for their respective durations.\n\nIt was originally known as the Zellers Discovery Zone, named after [[Hudson's Bay Company]]-owned discount department store sponsor [[Zellers]], which later became defunct in 2013 upon [[Target Canada]]'s purchase of Zellers' leases.\n\n==Conservation==\nThe Toronto Zoo makes considerable effort to conserve endangered species from around the world with the help of other accredited zoos. Captive breeding is often considered one of the most difficult and elusive rewards of captive animal care, but the Toronto Zoo's efforts have been met with much success, and even resulted in the re-introduction of many species.\n\nSome of the conservation initiatives that the Toronto Zoo has participated in are as follows:\n*The Toronto Zoo was the first zoo to establish a captive-breeding program for [[black-footed ferret]]s with the goal of releasing them back into their wild habitat<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.org/2011/09/23/black-footed-ferret-the-comeback-kid-celebrates-30-years-of-rediscovery/|title=Black-footed Ferret: The Comeback Kid Celebrates 30 Years of Rediscovery|first1=Jordan Carlton|last1=Schaul|first2=Jordan Carlton|last2=Schaul|date=September 24, 2011|website=National Geographic Society (blogs)|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> and, after years of successful breeding, had released more than 120 animals by 2011.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} This included re-introducing the ferrets, which had been extinct in the wild, to Saskatchewan's Grasslands National Park beginning in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cwf-fcf.org/en/discover-wildlife/endangered-species/mammals/terrestrial/black-footed-ferret.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203162531/http://cwf-fcf.org/en/discover-wildlife/endangered-species/mammals/terrestrial/black-footed-ferret.html |archivedate=February 3, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Government-Canada-Marks-Third-iw-2967274159.html | title=Government of Canada Marks Third Release of Black-Footed Ferrets in Grasslands National Park}}</ref>\n*The zoo has rescued orphaned polar bears from the wild: two in 2001, later named Aurora and Nikita and one in 2003, later named Inukshuk.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n*In 2008, the Toronto Zoo participated in 2008 Year of the Frog, where researchers were sent to study a deadly fungus causing problems to amphibians and reptiles worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n*The Toronto Zoo has acted and continues to act in the captive breeding, and re-introduction into the wild of critically endangered and otherwise threatened Canadian species, including the [[Vancouver Island marmot]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marmots.org/rarest-marmot-in-the-world-in-our-backyard/|title=Captive Breeding Program Wins Prestigious CAZA Award!|date=January 25, 2012|website=Marmot Recovery Foundation|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> [[loggerhead shrike]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsc-eoc.org/losh.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402190803/http://www.bsc-eoc.org/losh.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}</ref> and [[Blanding's turtle]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150610082008/http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/4636360-blanding-s-turtles-hanging-on-in-rouge-park/;send=false http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/4636360-blanding-s-turtles-hanging-on-in-rouge-park/;send=false]</ref> as well as Great Lakes fishes.<ref>http://www.torontozoo.com/pdfs/FINAL%20-%20Atlantic%20Salmon%20Release-%20June%2018%202013.pdf</ref> The zoo also runs a program for habitat preservation within the Great Lakes Region, focusing on the protection of endemic species of freshwater mussels.

Later named Noru, it was sent to the Lincoln Zoo, and was paired with a mate named Milla who gave birth to twins \u2013 a first for this species.\n\nIn 2004, two female West African [[dwarf crocodile]]s successfully hatched on October 1, the first hatching of this species in Canada. In September 2009, a male [[Western lowland gorilla|gorilla]] was born to Ngozi and [[Charles the Gorilla|Charles]], later named Nassir.\n\nThree Sumatran tigers were born at the zoo to parents Brytne and Rengat in 2003, and two more (Kali and Indah, which mean \"River\" and \"Beautiful\" in the Indonesian language) in 2006. Also in 2006, three orangutans were born and named Jinnga, Kembali, and Budi through a [[TVOKids]] naming contest.\n\nOn June 5, 2007, two rare [[snow leopard]]s were born, the first birth in thirteen years. Another snow leopard was born in 2009.\n\nA mandrill named Mohawk was born at the Zoo in December 2008.

Some animals are displayed indoors in pavilions and outdoors in what would be their naturalistic environments, with viewing at many levels. It also has areas such as the Kids Zoo, Waterside Theatre, and Splash Island. It has one of the most taxonomically diverse collection of animals on display of any zoo; it is currently home to over 5,000 animals (including invertebrates and fish) representing over 500 [[species]]. The zoo is open to the public every day of the year except [[Christmas|December 25]].\n\nThe zoo is owned by the [[City of Toronto government]]. Founded by Hugh A. Crothers, an industrialist who became the first Chairman of the Metro Toronto Zoological Society in 1966, the zoo opened on August 15, 1974, as the '''Metropolitan Toronto Zoo'''. The word \"Metropolitan\" was dropped from its name when the [[Metropolitan Toronto|Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto]] was [[Amalgamation of Toronto|amalgamated into the current city]] in 1998. The zoo is located near the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]] on the western border of [[Rouge National Urban Park|Rouge Park]] in the city's east end district of [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Predecessor ===\nAround 1880, businessman Harry L. Piper (1839\u20131921) established a Zoological and Acclimatization Society (also as Toronto Zoological Garden) and open a zoological gardens at Old Post Office Lane at Toronto Street north of King Street East, then in 1881 to a lot at Front Street and York Street next to the [[Queen's Hotel, Toronto|Queen's Hotel]] and finally to the eastern end of the Exhibition Grounds in 1885.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritagetoronto.org/torontos-first-zoo/|title=Toronto's First Zoo &#124;|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205115443/http://heritagetoronto.org/torontos-first-zoo/|archive-date=5 December 2013|access-date=}}</ref> Piper was also Alderman for St. John's Ward from 1877 to 1880 and 1883\u20131888.\n[[File:Women with goat.jpg|left|thumb|[[Stereoscope|Stereo card]] of a goat at the [[Riverdale Zoo]]. Opened in 1888, the Riverdale Zoo was the predecessor to the modern Toronto Zoo. Riverdale Zoo later became a [[livestock]] zoo.]]\nIn 1888, the [[Riverdale Farm|Riverdale Zoo]] opened in Toronto, as a typical example of a zoo during this time, with animals displayed as curiosities in dark cages and cramped enclosures. Animals for Piper's zoo moved to this site.\n\nIn 1963, a private citizen's brief to build a new zoo was introduced by Hugh Crothers to the Chairman of the Council of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, [[William Allen (Canadian politician)|William Allen]]. Allen asked Crothers to head up a committee to investigate the feasibility of a new zoo. By 1966, a group of eleven people became The Metro Toronto Zoological Society with Crothers as the first Chairman.\n\nOriginal plans were to have the park located at the Leaside area, but the site was later used to create the [[E.T. Seton Park]]. In 1966, Mr. Crothers and the 10 other citizens met at City Hall to form the ''Metropolitan Toronto Zoological Society''. In 1967, the [[Metropolitan Toronto|Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto]] approved the Rouge Park site in Scarborough for a new zoo. The following year, a feasibility study on the new zoo was produced by architect [[Raymond Moriyama]]. In 1969, a master plan was created by Johnson Sustronk Weinstein and Associates<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontozoo.com/AboutTheZoo/History.asp|title=History of the zoo|accessdate=August 15, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220230653/http://www.torontozoo.com/AboutTheZoo/History.asp|archivedate=February 20, 2007}}</ref> that was approved by the Zoological Society. Construction of the new zoo began in 1970. On August 15, 1974, the ''Metropolitan Toronto Zoo'' was open to the public. The zoo increased from the original Riverdale Zoo's {{Convert|3|ha}} to {{Convert|287|ha}}, and is now one of the largest zoos in the world. The Zoo introduced some designs to enhance the public's viewing experience and the animals' living comfort. Animals were displayed in naturalized environments and grouped according to their zoogeographic region. The old zoo was converted into an urban farm called [[Riverdale Farm]], which opened in 1978.\n\n=== Since opening ===\n[[File:Toronto zoo monorail.jpg|thumb|The [[Toronto Zoo Domain Ride]] a year after it opened in 1977. Operating from 1976 to 1994, the [[monorail]] transported guests to various sections in the zoo.]]\nIn 1976, the Zoo opened the ''[[Toronto Zoo Domain Ride|Canadian Domain Ride]]'', a monorail that traveled into the Zoo's Canadian Domain area, located in the Rouge Valley. The rides operations were placed on hold in July 1994 after an accident. The monorail has since been mothballed with many sections becoming [[Ecological succession|overgrown with vegetation]]. A 2009 study determined it would cost upwards of $800,000 to return the infrastructure to use and upgrade it to current standards. A fundraising drive was started in 2010 and has since raised $1.15 million. Plans are to have the monorail functional and running by 2018{{Citation needed|reason=Can't find any sources.|date=November 2018}}. In the interim, the current Zoomobile uses five (4-car set) [[Optima Bus Corporation|Chance Coach]] Sunliner trams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto-travel-guide.com/toronto-zoo.html|title=Toronto Zoo - Admission, Location, Cost, Hours, Maps and Events|publisher=|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1980 and 1984, several new exhibits were added to the zoo, including [[gaur]], a children's zoo (Littlefootland) that does not exist anymore, and a new indoor habitat for [[African elephant]]s, [[snow leopard]]s and the Indian Rhinoceros Pavilion, as well as, the official opening of the Zoomobile.\n\nIn 1985, ''Qing Qing'' and ''Quan Quan''<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/704835 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Donovan | last=Vincent | title=$28,000 Panda Trip Gets Okay From Zoo | date=October 3, 2009}}</ref> \u2013 a pair of [[giant panda]]s, on loan for three months from the [[People's Republic of China]], were displayed at the Zoo. The Zoo broke all previous attendance records as thousands of visitors came to see these rare animals. Over the years, the Zoo has presented other rare or unusual animals, including [[Snub-nosed monkey|golden monkeys]] (1986), [[koala]]s (1988, 1996, 2002), [[Tasmanian devil]]s (the late 1970s until 1998), [[white lion]]s (1995, 2012), and [[walruses]] (2020).\n\nIn 1987, the zoo opened the Maya Temple exhibit and Wolf Woods exhibit. In 1988, the zoo completed new reptile exhibits in the Australasia Pavilion and the Primate Wing in the Americas Pavilion. Caracal lynx exhibit opened in 1989, the year after the spotted-neck otter exhibit opened.\n\nIn 1993, the red panda exhibit re-opened and the Malayan Woods Pavilion opened. The sumatran [[tiger]]s arrived in 1994. [[Naked mole-rat]]s went on exhibit in 1996.

That same year, the Zoo opened the Africa Savannah exhibits, the largest expansion in its history. In 2001, the zoo added eyelash vipers to its collection and opened the Gorilla Rainforest, the world's largest indoor habitat for [[western lowland gorilla]]. The zoo's Splash Island, an educationally-themed [[water play area]], opened in 2002.

The Zoo's attendance has recovered well with many record-breaking annual attendance numbers since then.\n\nIn November 2006, the Toronto Zoo temporarily closed the Australasia Pavilion for redevelopment. The pavilion underwent two years of construction, resulting in new exhibits including a Great Barrier Reef area (where the former Edge of Night exhibit used to be). The Great Barrier Reef exhibit consists of a large seven-metre-long community tank featuring [[brownbanded bamboo shark]]s, [[damselfish]], and angel fish. There is also a lion fish, as well as enlarged seahorse tanks. Coral and moon jelly fish have also been added to the collection\u2014both firsts for the Toronto Zoo. This pavilion reopened on May 16, 2008.\n\nIn May 2007, ''Dinosaurs Alive'' opened, which featured 18 animated dinosaur models and life-size skeleton replicas. It featured the largest T-Rex model in North America. This exhibit was enjoyed by over 600,000 visitors and was included with zoo admission. The exhibit closed in October 2007. On August 21, 2007, the [[polar bear]], [[llama]], [[Dall sheep]] and [[Mara (mammal)|mara]] exhibits were closed for the construction of the new {{convert|10|acre|adj=on}} Tundra Trek area. This project was the first phase of the North Zoo Site Redevelopment Project. Tundra Trek features new exhibits for the popular [[polar bear]], [[reindeer]], [[Arctic fox]], [[Arctic wolf]] and [[snowy owl]]. Coming back to take up residence in the new polar bear exhibit were 3 orphaned polar bears initially raised at the zoo and named by the community: Aurora, Nikita, and Inukshuk. The Tundra Trek opened on August 1, 2009.\n\nOn May 16, 2008, ''Stingray Bay'' opened for the first time. This interactive exhibit allowed the public to touch, feel, and feed live stingrays.

During that weekend the public got to learn about some of the zoos oldest residents, including; Marg the [[demoiselle crane]] and Monty the West African [[dwarf crocodile]]. On September 9, 2009, the south side of the African Rainforest Pavilion was closed for construction. During construction, one of the [[mandrill]]s scheduled to move into the new area died, and the rest were moved to another zoo. The pavilion opened in early 2011, with new exhibits for [[pygmy hippopotamus|pygmy hippos]], [[red river hog]]s, Nile softshell turtle, and lemurs instead of the mandrills, as well as a variety of exhibits for fish and reptiles.\n[[File:Scholfield statue toronto.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of [[Frank Schofield]] at the Schofield Memorial/Asian Gardens.

Each region showcases animals and plants from that area of the world.\n\n===Indo-Malaya===\nThe Indo-Malayan area contains two pavilions that exhibit plants and animals from South and Southeast Asia. There are four outdoor exhibits in this area. Featured animals in this area include [[Indian rhinoceros|Indian rhinos]], [[babirusa]], [[Sumatran orangutan]]s, [[Mandarin duck]]s, [[spiny turtle]]s, rare [[Sumatran tiger]]s, and various [[freshwater fish]]. The Malayan Woods Pavilion houses [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[whistling duck]]s, [[Gonyosoma oxycephalum|red-tailed green rat snakes]], and [[clouded leopard]]s.\n\n===Africa===\nOpened in 1998, the African Savanna became the zoo's largest expansion in history. The African Savanna combined with the African Rainforest Pavilion encompasses most of the southern third of the zoo. The African Savanna featured species include [[white lion]]s, [[Gr\u00e9vy's zebra]]s, [[olive baboon]]s, [[greater kudu]]s, [[cheetah]]s, [[white rhinoceros]]es, river [[hippopotamus]]es, [[spotted hyena]]s, [[African penguin]]s and [[masai giraffe]]. The African Rainforest Pavilion holds the world's largest indoor [[Western Lowland Gorilla|gorilla]] exhibit, home to [[Charles the Gorilla|Charles]], as well as dozens of other more sensitive African species, including [[meerkat]]s, [[red river hog]]s, West African [[dwarf crocodile]]s, and [[pygmy hippopotamus]]es. The south side of the African Rainforest Pavilion underwent extensive renovations in 2009 and 2010, and opened in the spring of 2011. The south side of the pavilion is completely refurbished and showcases [[ring-tailed lemur]]s and [[Aldabra giant tortoise|Aldabra giant tortoises]].\n\nThe Toronto Zoo received three white African lion cubs in 2012 to replace the single white lioness the zoo had since 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/04/new-white-lion-cubs-make-toronto-zoo-debut/|title=New White lion cubs make Toronto Zoo debut|date=May 4, 2012|work=Vidya Kauri|publisher=National Post|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Canadian Domain===\n[[File:Canadian Wood bison Bison bison athabascae.JPG|thumb|Two [[bison]] located in the Canadian Domain of the Toronto Zoo.]]\nThe Canadian Domain is situated in the [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge Valley]]. The animals in this area will all be regrouped onto the table land. The Canadian Domain was built in accompaniment with the [[Toronto Zoo Domain Ride|Canadian Domain Ride]], which exhibited North American animals in their native environment. Featured species in this area include [[wood bison]], [[moose]], [[bald eagle]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[Canada lynx|lynxes]], [[raccoon]]s, and [[grizzly bears]]. The Toronto Zoo is currently participating in a breeding program for the Canadian bison. Canadian Domain is slated to be moved onto the zoo's tableland in coming years and renamed Canadian Wilderness.\n\n===Americas===\nThis area of the zoo houses animals from both North and South America. Animals include several species of [[New World monkey]]s. The Americas Pavilion displays a wide variety of amphibians, reptiles, fish, and insects. Some of its most popular residents are the [[common marmoset]]s, [[golden lion tamarin]]s, [[Linnaeus's two-toed sloth]]s, [[American alligator]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[North American river otter|river otter]]s and a [[Enteroctopus dofleini|giant Pacific octopus]]. The Mayan Temple Ruins features [[jaguar]]s, [[capybara]]s, [[blue-and-yellow macaw]]s, [[scarlet macaw]]s, [[spider monkey]]s, and [[American flamingo]]s. The Americas Pavilion houses the majority of the zoo's reptile and amphibian collection, as well as a large number of its invertebrates, and was the designated area for the 2008 Year of the Frog conservation project. In 2006, a [[two-toed sloth]] was born; this was the first birth of this species at the zoo. The Americas Pavilion will undergo a transition as per the North Zoo Site Redevelopment from the Americas Pavilion to the Tropical American Pavilion. Some Americas animals will be relocated with this redevelopment project.\n\n===Australasia===\n[[File:2 Western Grey Kangaroos.jpg|thumb|A pair of [[western grey kangaroo]]s located in the Australasia Domain of the Toronto Zoo.]]\nThe Australasian Pavilion features animals from the Australian mainland, as well as [[Oceania|surrounding islands]]. Featured species in this area include thorny devil [[Phasmatodea|stick insects]], a variety of small Australian [[reptile]]s, [[Western grey kangaroo]]s, [[wallaby|wallabies]], [[echidna]]s, [[southern hairy-nosed wombat]]s, [[kookaburra]]s, [[red-tailed black cockatoo]]s, [[Matschie's tree-kangaroo]]s, and [[Komodo dragon]]s.<ref name=\"zoo_australasia\"/> The Komodo dragons were donated to the zoo as a gift from the [[President of Indonesia]]. This pavilion once had an \"Edge of Night\" section to highlight [[Crepuscular animal|crepuscular]] and [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] [[marsupial]]s, but this was later converted into the [[Great Barrier Reef]] exhibit featuring [[seahorse]]s, a live coral and [[Aurelia aurita|jellyfish]] tank, [[Pterois|lionfish]], [[brownbanded bamboo shark]]s, and a {{Convert|7|m|adj=on}} long community tank. The exhibits inside the pavilion also received facelifts during the transition, including and outdoor area for the hairy-nosed [[wombat]]s and swamp [[wallaby|wallabies]].\n\n===Eurasia Wilds===\nOften regarded as the oldest part of the zoo, Eurasia received a large overhaul in 2014. The featured species in this section of the zoo are [[snow leopard]]s, [[west caucasian tur]], [[mouflon]], [[chamois]], [[red panda]]s, and [[Bactrian camel]]s. With the area's redesign to the Eurasia Wilds [[Steller's sea eagle]]s were added; while several other species are now only viewable from the Zoomobile, including [[lion-tailed macaques]], [[Domestic yak|yak]], and a [[demoiselle crane]], as well as the herd of [[Przewalski's horse]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontozoo.com/ExploreTheZoo/AnimalsOffDisplay.asp|title=Toronto Zoo - Toronto Zoo - Animals Off Display|last=|first=|date=|website=www.torontozoo.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630144114/http://www.torontozoo.com/ExploreTheZoo/AnimalsOffDisplay.asp|archive-date=30 June 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Caged (4079886616).jpg|thumb|left|A [[red panda]] in the Eurasia Wilds section of the zoo.]]\nFrom May 18, 2013 to March 18, 2018, the area included two [[giant panda]]s: Er Shun (female) and Da Mao (male). With the pandas' arrival, the zoo has refurbished its seasonal attraction area into an extensive educational centre \u2013 the Giant Panda Interpretive Centre. In 2014, after her first estrus, Er Shun was artificially inseminated \u2013 the first such procedure performed on a panda in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontozoo.com/press/releases.asp?pg=20140612|title=Toronto Zoo - Press Releases|work=Toronto Zoo|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> No baby was born in 2014 and it was believed that Er Shun experienced a [[pseudopregnancy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontozoo.com/press/releases.asp?pg=20141211|title=Toronto Zoo - Press Releases|website=www.torontozoo.com|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> a phenomenon common in giant pandas. In 2015, Er Shun was again artificially inseminated, resulting in the first birth of giant pandas in Canada. [[Jia Yueyue and Jia Panpan|Twins cubs]], one male (later named \"Jia Panpan\" indicating \"Canadian Hope\") and one female (\"Jia Yueyue\" indicating \"Canadian Joy\"), were born on October 13, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontozoo.com/GiantPandaCubs/|title=Toronto Zoo - Giant Panda Cubs|last=|first=|date=|website=www.torontozoo.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018062232/http://www.torontozoo.com/GiantPandaCubs/|archive-date=18 October 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"CTV News Panda Cubs\">{{cite web|url=http://toronto.ctvnews.ca/first-panda-cubs-born-in-canada-at-toronto-zoo-1.2607126|title=First panda cubs born in Canada at Toronto Zoo|first=Kendra|last=Mangione|date=October 13, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citynews.ca/2016/03/07/toronto-zoo-panda-cubs-named-canadian-hope-canadian-joy/|title=Toronto Zoo panda cubs named 'Canadian Hope' and 'Canadian Joy'|date=March 7, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> The cubs were raised by Er Shun, with \"twin swapping\" occurring through the first four months of their lives until they were large and healthy enough that zoo staff were confident of their survival.\n\n===Tundra Trek===\n[[File:Arctic Wolf (14583046892).jpg|thumb|An [[Arctic wolf]] sleeping at the zoo's Tundra Trek, a section of the zoo that features animals from the [[Arctic]].]]\nAfter the closing of some of the Americas animal exhibits in 2007, the Tundra Trek opened on August 1, 2009. This area became the sixth region of the zoo, and showcases a variety of Arctic animals including [[reindeer]], [[polar bear]]s, [[snowy owl]]s, [[snow goose|snow geese]], [[Arctic fox]]es, and [[Arctic wolf|Arctic wolves]]. The new state-of-the-art exhibits are larger in order to encourage breeding. Educational theming emphasizes the lives of the Inuit and the effects of climate change.\n\nIn November 2019, the zoo announced that two [[walruses]] would be loaned to the zoo from [[Aquarium du Qu\u00e9bec]] in 2020. They are to be housed in one of the polar bear exhibits.\n\n===Discovery Zone===\nThis area is geared towards children by featuring educational themes and exhibits. The most prominent area is a children's water park, Splash Island, which features landscaping and themed objects depicting the three states of water: solid (ice), liquid, and gas. Exhibits are grouped around variously themed groups of aquatic animals, including rivers, lakes, and oceans. Waterside Theatre is an open-air enclosure where live demonstrations of a variety of animals are shown, including [[alpaca]]s, [[goat]]s, [[marabou stork]]s, [[grey crowned crane]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[ferret]]s, and [[abyssinian ground hornbill]]s. A third area, the Kids Zoo, consists of a variety of animals that children can interact with, such as [[guinea pigs]], [[common raven]]s, and [[secretary bird]]s. The Discovery Zone also hosted Dinosaurs Alive and the Stingray Bay exhibit for their respective durations.\n\nIt was originally known as the Zellers Discovery Zone, named after [[Hudson's Bay Company]]-owned discount department store sponsor [[Zellers]], which later became defunct in 2013 upon [[Target Canada]]'s purchase of Zellers' leases.\n\n==Conservation==\nThe Toronto Zoo makes considerable effort to conserve endangered species from around the world with the help of other accredited zoos. Captive breeding is often considered one of the most difficult and elusive rewards of captive animal care, but the Toronto Zoo's efforts have been met with much success, and even resulted in the re-introduction of many species.\n\nSome of the conservation initiatives that the Toronto Zoo has participated in are as follows:\n*The Toronto Zoo was the first zoo to establish a captive-breeding program for [[black-footed ferret]]s with the goal of releasing them back into their wild habitat<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.org/2011/09/23/black-footed-ferret-the-comeback-kid-celebrates-30-years-of-rediscovery/|title=Black-footed Ferret: The Comeback Kid Celebrates 30 Years of Rediscovery|first1=Jordan Carlton|last1=Schaul|first2=Jordan Carlton|last2=Schaul|date=September 24, 2011|website=National Geographic Society (blogs)|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> and, after years of successful breeding, had released more than 120 animals by 2011.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} This included re-introducing the ferrets, which had been extinct in the wild, to Saskatchewan's Grasslands National Park beginning in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cwf-fcf.org/en/discover-wildlife/endangered-species/mammals/terrestrial/black-footed-ferret.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203162531/http://cwf-fcf.org/en/discover-wildlife/endangered-species/mammals/terrestrial/black-footed-ferret.html |archivedate=February 3, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Government-Canada-Marks-Third-iw-2967274159.html | title=Government of Canada Marks Third Release of Black-Footed Ferrets in Grasslands National Park}}</ref>\n*The zoo has rescued orphaned polar bears from the wild: two in 2001, later named Aurora and Nikita and one in 2003, later named Inukshuk.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n*In 2008, the Toronto Zoo participated in 2008 Year of the Frog, where researchers were sent to study a deadly fungus causing problems to amphibians and reptiles worldwide.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n*The Toronto Zoo has acted and continues to act in the captive breeding, and re-introduction into the wild of critically endangered and otherwise threatened Canadian species, including the [[Vancouver Island marmot]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://marmots.org/rarest-marmot-in-the-world-in-our-backyard/|title=Captive Breeding Program Wins Prestigious CAZA Award!|date=January 25, 2012|website=Marmot Recovery Foundation|accessdate=August 15, 2017}}</ref> [[loggerhead shrike]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bsc-eoc.org/losh.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=March 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402190803/http://www.bsc-eoc.org/losh.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}</ref> and [[Blanding's turtle]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150610082008/http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/4636360-blanding-s-turtles-hanging-on-in-rouge-park/;send=false http://www.insidetoronto.com/news-story/4636360-blanding-s-turtles-hanging-on-in-rouge-park/;send=false]</ref> as well as Great Lakes fishes.<ref>http://www.torontozoo.com/pdfs/FINAL%20-%20Atlantic%20Salmon%20Release-%20June%2018%202013.pdf</ref> The zoo also runs a program for habitat preservation within the Great Lakes Region, focusing on the protection of endemic species of freshwater mussels.

Later named Noru, it was sent to the Lincoln Zoo, and was paired with a mate named Milla who gave birth to twins \u2013 a first for this species.\n\nIn 2004, two female West African [[dwarf crocodile]]s successfully hatched on October 1, the first hatching of this species in Canada. In September 2009, a male [[Western lowland gorilla|gorilla]] was born to Ngozi and [[Charles the Gorilla|Charles]], later named Nassir.\n\nThree Sumatran tigers were born at the zoo to parents Brytne and Rengat in 2003, and two more (Kali and Indah, which mean \"River\" and \"Beautiful\" in the Indonesian language) in 2006. Also in 2006, three orangutans were born and named Jinnga, Kembali, and Budi through a [[TVOKids]] naming contest.\n\nOn June 5, 2007, two rare [[snow leopard]]s were born, the first birth in thirteen years. Another snow leopard was born in 2009.\n\nA mandrill named Mohawk was born at the Zoo in December 2008. The Toronto Zoo no longer displays mandrills.\n\nTwo Przewalski's horses, one male and one female, were born on June 22, 2007, the first birth in fifteen years. Three more Przewalski's horses were born in 2008 and another was born in 2009. In 2007, one male and one female [[Siberian tiger]]s, were born.
