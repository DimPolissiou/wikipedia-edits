The Washington family owned land in the area since the time of Washington's great-grandfather in 1674.

In 1858, the house's historical importance was recognized and it was saved from ruin by the [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]]; this philanthropic organization acquired it together with part of the Washington property estate. Escaping the damage suffered by many plantation houses during the [[American Civil War]], Mount Vernon was restored.\n\nMount Vernon was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1960 and is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

A two-storied wing was added to the south side. Two years later a large two-story room was added to the north side.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Two single-story secondary wings were built in 1775. These secondary wings, which house the servants hall on the northern side and the kitchen on the southern side, are connected to the ''[[corps de logis]]'' by symmetrical, quadrant [[colonnade]]s, built in 1778. The completion of the colonnades cemented the classical Palladian arrangement of the complex and formed a distinct [[cour d'honneur]], known at Mount Vernon as Mansion Circle, giving the house its imposing perspective.\n\nThe corps de logis and secondary wings have hipped roofs with dormers. In addition to its second story, the importance of the corps de logis is further emphasized by two large chimneys piercing the roof, and by a [[cupola]] surmounting the center of the house; this octagonal focal point has a short [[spire]] topped by a gilded dove of peace.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|title=History of Mount Vernon |url=http://www.mountvernon.org/learn/explore_mv/index.cfm/ss/27/ |publisher=Mountvernon.com |accessdate=8 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811165542/http://www.mountvernon.org/learn/explore_mv/index.cfm/ss/27 |archivedate=11 August 2011 }}</ref> This placement of the [[cupola]] is more in the earlier [[Restoration style|Carolean]] style than Palladian, and was probably incorporated to improve ventilation of the enlarged attic and enhance the overall symmetry of the structure and the two wings; a similar cupola crowns the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's House at Williamsburg]], of which Washington would have been aware.\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe rooms at Mount Vernon have mostly been restored to their appearance at the time of George and Martha Washington's occupancy.

Instead they range from severe [[Palladianism]] to a finer and later neoclassicism in the style of [[Robert Adam]].<ref name=\"Mount Vernon\" /> This varying of the classical style is best exemplified in the doorcases and surrounds of the principal rooms. In the West Parlour and Small Dining rooms there are doorcases complete with ionic columns and full pediments, whereas in the hall and passageways the doors are given broken pediments supported only by an [[architrave]].<ref name=\"Mount Vernon\"/> Many of the rooms are lined with painted [[panelling]] and have ceilings ornamented by plasterwork in a Neoclassical style; much of this plasterwork can be attributed to an English craftsman and  emigree, John Rawlins, who arrived from London in 1771 bringing with him the interior design motifs then fashionable in the British capital.<ref name=\"Mount Vernon\"/>\n\nVisitors to Mount Vernon now see Washington's study, a room to which in the eighteenth century only a privileged few were granted entr\u00e9e.

Like them, by 1766 Washington had ceased growing tobacco at Mount Vernon and replaced the crop with wheat, corn, and other grains. Besides hemp and flax, he experimented with 60 other crops including cotton and silk. He also derived income from a new [[gristmill]] which produced [[cornmeal]] and [[flour]] for export and also ground neighbors' grain for fees. Washington similarly sold the services of the estate's looms and blacksmith. He built and operated a small fishing fleet, permitting Mount Vernon to export fish. Washington also practiced the selective breeding of sheep in an effort to produce better quality wool.

The estate is situated on the banks of the [[Potomac River]] in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Virginia]], near [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], across from [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], [[Maryland]]. The Washington family owned land in the area since the time of Washington's great-grandfather in 1674. Around 1734 they embarked on an expansion of the estate that continued under George Washington, who began leasing the estate in 1754, but did not become its sole owner until 1761.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountvernon.org/the-estate-gardens/the-mansion/expansion-of-mount-vernons-mansion/|title=Expansion of Mount Vernon's Mansion|website=George Washington's Mount Vernon|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106004817/https://www.mountvernon.org/the-estate-gardens/the-mansion/expansion-of-mount-vernons-mansion/|archive-date=6 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe mansion was built of wood in a loose [[Palladian architecture|Palladian style]]; the original house was built by George Washington's father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]], around 1734.<ref name=\"auto\"/> George Washington expanded the house twice, once in the late 1750s and again in the 1770s.<ref name=\"auto\"/> It remained Washington's home for the rest of his life. Following his death in 1799, under the ownership of several successive generations of the family, the estate progressively declined as revenues were insufficient to maintain it adequately. In 1858, the house's historical importance was recognized and it was saved from ruin by the [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]]; this philanthropic organization acquired it together with part of the Washington property estate. Escaping the damage suffered by many plantation houses during the [[American Civil War]], Mount Vernon was restored.\n\nMount Vernon was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1960 and is also listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The principal block, dating from about 1734, was a one-story house with a [[garret]].<ref name=\"auto\"/> In the 1750s, the roof was raised to a full second story and a third floor garret.

A two-storied wing was added to the south side. Two years later a large two-story room was added to the north side.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Two single-story secondary wings were built in 1775. These secondary wings, which house the servants hall on the northern side and the kitchen on the southern side, are connected to the ''[[corps de logis]]'' by symmetrical, quadrant [[colonnade]]s, built in 1778. The completion of the colonnades cemented the classical Palladian arrangement of the complex and formed a distinct [[cour d'honneur]], known at Mount Vernon as Mansion Circle, giving the house its imposing perspective.\n\nThe corps de logis and secondary wings have hipped roofs with dormers. In addition to its second story, the importance of the corps de logis is further emphasized by two large chimneys piercing the roof, and by a [[cupola]] surmounting the center of the house; this octagonal focal point has a short [[spire]] topped by a gilded dove of peace.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|title=History of Mount Vernon |url=http://www.mountvernon.org/learn/explore_mv/index.cfm/ss/27/ |publisher=Mountvernon.com |accessdate=8 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811165542/http://www.mountvernon.org/learn/explore_mv/index.cfm/ss/27 |archivedate=11 August 2011 }}</ref> This placement of the [[cupola]] is more in the earlier [[Restoration style|Carolean]] style than Palladian, and was probably incorporated to improve ventilation of the enlarged attic and enhance the overall symmetry of the structure and the two wings; a similar cupola crowns the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's House at Williamsburg]], of which Washington would have been aware.\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe rooms at Mount Vernon have mostly been restored to their appearance at the time of George and Martha Washington's occupancy.

Instead they range from severe [[Palladianism]] to a finer and later neoclassicism in the style of [[Robert Adam]].<ref name=\"Mount Vernon\" /> This varying of the classical style is best exemplified in the doorcases and surrounds of the principal rooms. In the West Parlour and Small Dining rooms there are doorcases complete with ionic columns and full pediments, whereas in the hall and passageways the doors are given broken pediments supported only by an [[architrave]].<ref name=\"Mount Vernon\"/> Many of the rooms are lined with painted [[panelling]] and have ceilings ornamented by plasterwork in a Neoclassical style; much of this plasterwork can be attributed to an English craftsman and  emigree, John Rawlins, who arrived from London in 1771 bringing with him the interior design motifs then fashionable in the British capital.<ref name=\"Mount Vernon\"/>\n\nVisitors to Mount Vernon now see Washington's study, a room to which in the eighteenth century only a privileged few were granted entr\u00e9e. This simply furnished room has a combined bathroom, dressing room and office; the room was so private that few contemporary descriptions exist.

Like them, by 1766 Washington had ceased growing tobacco at Mount Vernon and replaced the crop with wheat, corn, and other grains. Besides hemp and flax, he experimented with 60 other crops including cotton and silk. He also derived income from a new [[gristmill]] which produced [[cornmeal]] and [[flour]] for export and also ground neighbors' grain for fees. Washington similarly sold the services of the estate's looms and blacksmith. He built and operated a small fishing fleet, permitting Mount Vernon to export fish. Washington also practiced the selective breeding of sheep in an effort to produce better quality wool. George Washington was not as invested in animal husbandry as he was in cropping experiments, which were elaborate and included complex field rotations, nitrogen fixing crops and a range of soil amendments.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9780803296886/|title=The Five-Ton Life|last=Subak|first=Susan|year=2018|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=47\u201350|access-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401230928/https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9780803296886/|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Washington household consumed a wider range of protein sources than was typical for the Chesapeake population of his day, which consumed a great deal of beef.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9780803296886/|title=The Five-Ton Life|last=Subak|first=Susan|year=2018|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=32\u201340|access-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401230928/https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/university-of-nebraska-press/9780803296886/|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe new crops were less labor-intensive than tobacco; hence, the estate had a surplus of slaves.

He defined the thought process, and how it reaches the status of conviction or concepts. He discussed the internal working of thoughts, convictions, and concepts in shaping the ''Nafs'' (emotions and sentiments). Delving into the internal workings of how people reach conclusions, and the psychology behind the process derives itself from Taqiuddin al-Nabhani's roots in non-Ascetic legalistic Sufism from his first teacher and maternal grandfather Ismail al-Nabhani.\n\nAl-Nabhani's definitions of thought have been used in the study of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and information processing research discussed in the Addison-Wesley published book \"Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine (Systems Programming Series)\" and used in London South Bank University's information systems department.\n\nAfter many philosophical discussions on the nature of thoughts and emotions, Nabhani concludes that the only way to bring about change is through discussion, refutation, and revival of the relevant thoughts and emotions. It is from this philosophical basis that he argued that force does not work to change peoples' ideas. He also argued that a decline in Muslims' mental, emotional and conceptual lives led to the decline of muslim culture and the eventual destruction of the Caliphate. He believed the first major step of the decline in Muslim culture was confusion about and conflict with new foreign ideas, mainly Greek, Persian & eastern philosophy.\n\nHe argued that the Islamic world did not know how to tackle and contextualize these ideas because they became insular and complacent instead of preserving Islamic thought and philosophy and keeping it relevant to a world in flux. The heavy emphasis on pinpointing, defining and changing peoples thoughts, convictions, or emotions via stronger thoughts, diagnosis, and refutation of the process an individual uses to reach their particular 'incorrect' view, is the method of Hizb ut-Tahrir's argumentation on almost every issue.\n\n===Faith vs. rational belief===\nNabhani claimed that Islam is founded on rational belief and not blind faith, being very similar to Ghazali's Kalam Argument. However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after ''Aqeeda'' (belief) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the 'mind' of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (not that of the [[Mu'tazili]]), but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni in his book [4], contrary to the common western notion of rationalism. He tried to outline materialist arguments and axioms to prove that one unlimited creator of the universe, God ([[Allah]]) can be proven by rational deduction. He believed that the dependency of, and limited physical nature of every tangible thing within human perception point ultimately to an unlimited creator that is beyond need and dependency, an Absolute Infinite.\n\n==Books==\n*''Saving Palestine'' - 1950<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html Sheikh Muhammad Taqiuddin al-Nabhani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819200236/http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html |date=2010-08-19 }}, [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].</ref>\n*''The Message of the Arabs'' - 1950\n*''The System for Society'' - 1950\n*''The Ruling System in Islam'' - 1953\n*''[[The Economic System In Islam]]'' - 1953\n*''The Social System in Islam'' -1953\n*''The Party Structure'' -1953\n*''The Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic State'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic Personality'' (in three volumes) - 1960\n*''Political Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1969\n*''Political View of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1972\n*''Introduction to the Constitution or the Reasons That Make it Obligatory'' - 1963\n*''The Khilafah'' - 1967\n*''Presence of Mind'' - 1976\n*''A Burning Call to the Muslims from Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1965\n*''Thinking'' - 1973\n*''The Jurisprudence of Prayer''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n |magazine    = Al-Waie Magazine\n |issue       = 234-235\n |date        = August\u2013September 2006\n |language    = Arabic\n |title       = \u0628\u0632\u0648\u063a \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649: \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\n |url         = http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209002225/http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |archivedate = 2015-02-09\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n |title       = An-Nabhani: Palestinian Intellectual\n |work        = [[Islamic Da'wah Foundation Malaysia]]\n |url         = http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219055210/http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |archivedate = 2010-12-19\n}}\n* {{Citation |last=Watt|first=Montgomery|title=The Faith and Practice of Al-Ghazali (Translation of al-Munqid min al-Dalal)|year=2004|place=Oxford|publisher=OneWorld Publications}}\n* {{Citation |last=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=The System of Islam Nidham al-Islam|year=2002|publication-place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Thought al-Tafkeer|year=2004|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Islamic Personality al-Shaksiyyah al-Islamiyyah|year=2005|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nabhani, Taqiuddin}}\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Arab people in British Palestine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian Islamists]]\n[[Category:Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir]]\n[[Category:Al-Azhar University alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n'''Kamal al-Din al-Nabhani''' (January 3, 1929 \u2013 December 31, 2006) was one of the founders of the [[Islamist]] political party [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and was a son of Sheikh [[Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani]].\n\n== Early Life ==\nKamal al-Din al-Nabhani was born on January 3, 1929, in [[Beirut, Lebanon]].\n\n== Thought ==\n\n=== Philosophy and Theology ===\n\nNabhani in his books 'Thought' and 'System of Islam 2' after his father [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]] placed heavy emphasis on discussing modes and models of the psychology behind human thought, and concepts.

After saving it from a pack of [[leopard seals]] on an abandoned ship, and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private, (before the events of the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]).\n\nTen years later (after the events of the [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|previous film]]), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called \"Cheezy Dibbles\" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the \"secretary/mascot\".\n\nSuddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to [[soviet]], [[russia]] by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe. Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen.\n\nWhen cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover inter-species task force agency called \"The North Wind\" consisting of their leader, a [[wolf]] whose name is classified in which Skipper mistakenly calls him \"Classified\" throughout this film, a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.\n\nAt their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends them to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguises Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, but Private is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. \n\nMeanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge. Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.\n\nPrivate is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole, much to the latter's amusement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:John Malkovich & Benedict Cumberbatch, Penguins of Madagascar, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Malkovich]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] talking at the ''Penguins of Madagascar'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, the leader of the [[penguin]]s.<ref name=USATPeek>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Sneak Peek: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/08/penguins-of-madagascar-first-look/9727597/|accessdate=June 9, 2014|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, the brains of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private, the rookie of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Rico,<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-penguins-of-madagascar-1201353894/|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> the loose cannon of the penguins.\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Classified, a British [[wolf]] and team leader of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapCumberMalko /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7290373/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins |title=Here are some of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s most oddly sexy lines from Penguins of Madagascar |first=Emily Todd |last=VanDerWerff |date=November 26, 2014 |website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/penguins-of-madagascar-actor-benedict-cumberbatch-thinks-he-worked-on-a-disney-film-105013.html |title=Benedict Cumberbatch Thinks 'Penguins of Madagascar' is A Disney Film |date=October 24, 2014 |website=Cartoon Brew}}</ref>\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Short Fuse, a Belgian explosive and demolitions expert [[harp seal]] and a member of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapDateSwitch>{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Todd|title=DreamWorks Animation Switches Release Dates on \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 and \u2018Home\u2019|url=https://www.thewrap.com/dreamworks-animation-switches-release-dates-on-penguins-of-madagascar-and-home/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=May 21, 2014|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Annet Mahendru]] as Eva, a Russian [[snowy owl]], Kowalski's love interest, and the north wind's intelligence analyst.<ref name=\"USATPeek\" />\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Corporal, a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and a member of the North Wind who serves as the muscle.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Dave, a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who has the human disguise of Dr. Octavius Brine.<ref name=\"WrapCumberMalko\" /><ref name=\"USATPeek\" /><ref name=\"EWTralierSpies\">{{cite news|last1=McHenry|first1=Jackson|title='The Penguins of Madagascar' trailer: Spies and Benedict Cumberbatch -- VIDEO|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/11/penguins-madagascar-benedict-cumberbatch/|accessdate=June 13, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=SlashFilmRecap>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 Footage Recap and Panel Highlights [Comic Con 2014]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/penguins-of-madagascar-footage-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=July 25, 2014|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]].\n\n==Production==\nA [[direct-to-video]] film featuring the penguins had been in the works since 2005 when the first ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' film was released, with a release date initially planned for 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> The studio announced in March 2011 that the penguin characters would be given their own feature film to be directed by [[Simon J.

After saving it from a pack of [[leopard seals]] on an abandoned ship, and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private, (before the events of the [[Madagascar (2005 film)|first film]]).\n\nTen years later (after the events of the [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|previous film]]), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]] in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called \"Cheezy Dibbles\" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the \"secretary/mascot\".\n\nSuddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe. Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen.\n\nWhen cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover inter-species task force agency called \"The North Wind\" consisting of their leader, a [[wolf]] whose name is classified in which Skipper mistakenly calls him \"Classified\" throughout this film, a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.\n\nAt their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends them to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguises Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, but Private is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. \n\nMeanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge. Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.\n\nPrivate is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole, much to the latter's amusement.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{See also|List of Madagascar (franchise) characters}}\n[[File:John Malkovich & Benedict Cumberbatch, Penguins of Madagascar, SDCC 2014.jpg|thumb|[[John Malkovich]] and [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] talking at the ''Penguins of Madagascar'' panel at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]\n* [[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]] as Skipper, the leader of the [[penguin]]s.<ref name=USATPeek>{{cite news|last1=Truitt|first1=Brian|title=Sneak Peek: 'Penguins of Madagascar'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/08/penguins-of-madagascar-first-look/9727597/|accessdate=June 9, 2014|work=USA Today|date=June 8, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] as Kowalski, the brains of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Christopher Knights]] as Private, the rookie of the penguins.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as Rico,<ref name=VarietyReview>{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-penguins-of-madagascar-1201353894/|accessdate=November 12, 2014|work=Variety|date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> the loose cannon of the penguins.\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Classified, a British [[wolf]] and team leader of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapCumberMalko /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/11/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins-of-madagascar |title=Benedict Cumberbatch to voice wolf in new Madagascar movie |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas |date=June 11, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/26/7290373/benedict-cumberbatch-penguins |title=Here are some of Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s most oddly sexy lines from Penguins of Madagascar |first=Emily Todd |last=VanDerWerff |date=November 26, 2014 |website=Vox}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/penguins-of-madagascar-actor-benedict-cumberbatch-thinks-he-worked-on-a-disney-film-105013.html |title=Benedict Cumberbatch Thinks 'Penguins of Madagascar' is A Disney Film |date=October 24, 2014 |website=Cartoon Brew}}</ref>\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Short Fuse, a Belgian explosive and demolitions expert [[harp seal]] and a member of the North Wind.<ref name=WrapDateSwitch>{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Todd|title=DreamWorks Animation Switches Release Dates on \u2018Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 and \u2018Home\u2019|url=https://www.thewrap.com/dreamworks-animation-switches-release-dates-on-penguins-of-madagascar-and-home/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=May 21, 2014|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Annet Mahendru]] as Eva, a Russian [[snowy owl]], Kowalski's love interest, and the north wind's intelligence analyst.<ref name=\"USATPeek\" />\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Corporal, a Norwegian [[polar bear]] and a member of the North Wind who serves as the muscle.<ref name=USATPeek />\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Dave, a villainous and disgruntled [[octopus]] who has the human disguise of Dr. Octavius Brine.<ref name=\"WrapCumberMalko\" /><ref name=\"USATPeek\" /><ref name=\"EWTralierSpies\">{{cite news|last1=McHenry|first1=Jackson|title='The Penguins of Madagascar' trailer: Spies and Benedict Cumberbatch -- VIDEO|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/11/penguins-madagascar-benedict-cumberbatch/|accessdate=June 13, 2014|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Werner Herzog]] as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=SlashFilmRecap>{{cite web|last1=Han|first1=Angie|title=Penguins of Madagascar\u2019 Footage Recap and Panel Highlights [Comic Con 2014]|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/penguins-of-madagascar-footage-comic-con/|publisher=/Film|accessdate=July 25, 2014|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]] as King Julien XIII, a [[ring-tailed lemur]].\n* [[Andy Richter]] as Mort, a [[Goodman's mouse lemur]].\n\n==Production==\nA [[direct-to-video]] film featuring the penguins had been in the works since 2005 when the first ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' film was released, with a release date initially planned for 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=D'Works will rely on animal instinct|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117929100|accessdate=October 27, 2011|newspaper=Variety|date=September 14, 2005}}</ref> The studio announced in March 2011 that the penguin characters would be given their own feature film to be directed by [[Simon J.

But Scotland's rule over Mann did not become firmly established until 1275, when the Manx were defeated in the [[Battle of Ronaldsway]], near [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]].\n\nIn 1290 King [[Edward I of England]] sent [[Walter de Huntercombe, 1st Baron Huntercombe|Walter de Huntercombe]] to take possession of Mann. It remained in English hands until 1313, when [[Robert the Bruce|Robert Bruce]] took it after besieging [[Castle Rushen]] for five weeks. A confused period followed when Mann was sometimes under English rule and sometimes Scottish, until 1346, when the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]] decided the long struggle between England and Scotland in England's favour.\n\nThe Crown delegated its rule of the island to a series of lords and magnates. [[Tynwald]] passed laws concerning the government of the island in all respects and had control over its finances, but was subject to the approval of the [[Lord of Mann]].\n\nIn 1866, the Isle of Man obtained limited home rule, with partly democratic elections to the [[House of Keys]], but the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] was appointed by the Crown. Since then, democratic government has been gradually extended.\n\nThe Isle of Man has designated more than 250 historic sites as [[Registered Buildings of the Isle of Man|registered buildings]].\n\n==Geography==\n{{Main|Geography of the Isle of Man}}\n{{See also|Geology of the Isle of Man|List of islands of the Isle of Man|Biota of the Isle of Man}}\n[[File:Sound IOM.JPG|left|upright=1.05|thumb|The [[Calf of Man]] seen from [[Cregneash]]]]\n[[File:Isle of Man by Sentinel-2.jpg|right|upright=1.25|right|thumb|A satellite image]]\n\nThe Isle of Man is located in the middle of the northern [[Irish Sea]], almost equidistant from [[England]] to the east, [[Northern Ireland]] to the west, and [[Scotland]] (closest) to the north; while [[Wales]] to the south is almost the distance of the [[Republic of Ireland]] to the southwest.

There are eight Catholic parish churches, included in the [[Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite web | title=The Archdiocese of Liverpool  | website=Liverpool Catholic | url=http://www.liverpoolcatholic.org.uk | access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> as well as a presence of [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians.

There is a small [[Muslim]] community, with its own mosque in Douglas, and there is also a small [[Jewish]] community, see the [[history of the Jews in the Isle of Man]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/IsleOfMan/religion.xml|title=Religious Faiths and Organisations|date=2012-05-28|website=Isle of Man Government|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608055741/http://www.gov.im/IsleOfMan/religion.xml|archive-date=2003-06-08|url-status=unfit|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Myth, legend and folklore ===\n[[File:Isle of Man Peel Castle.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Peel Castle]]]]\nIn Manx mythology, the island was ruled by the sea god [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Manann\u00e1n]], who would draw his misty cloak around the island to protect it from invaders. One of the principal folk theories about the origin of the name ''Mann'' is that it is named after Manann\u00e1n.\n\nIn the Manx tradition of [[folklore]], there are many stories of mythical creatures and characters. These include the {{lang|gv|[[Buggane]]}}, a malevolent spirit which, according to legend, blew the roof off St Trinian's Church in a fit of rage; the {{lang|gv|[[Fenodyree]]}}; the {{lang|gv|[[Glashtyn]]}}; and the {{lang|gv|[[Moddey Dhoo]]}}, a [[black dog (ghost)|ghostly black dog]] which wandered the walls and corridors of [[Peel Castle]].\n\nThe Isle of Man is also said to be home to [[mooinjer veggey|fairies]], known locally as \"the little folk\" or \"themselves\". There is a famous [[Fairy Bridge (Isle of Man)|Fairy Bridge]], and it is said to be bad luck if one fails to wish the fairies good morning or afternoon when passing over it. It used to be a tradition to leave a coin on the bridge to ensure good luck. Other types of fairies are the {{lang|gv|Mi'raj}} and the {{lang|gv|[[Arkan Sonney]]}}.\n\nAn old Irish story tells how [[Lough Neagh]] was formed when Ireland's legendary giant [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool) ripped up a portion of the land and tossed it at a Scottish rival. He missed, and the chunk of earth landed in the [[Irish Sea]], thus creating the island.\n\nPeel Castle has been proposed as a possible location of the Arthurian [[Avalon]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/avalon.htm|title=Avalon's Location|website=Electricscotland.com|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> or as the location of the Grail Castle, site of [[Lancelot]]'s encounter with the sword bridge of King [[Maleagant]].<ref>King Arthur, Norma Lorre Goodrich, Harper and Row, 1989, p. 318</ref>\n\nOne of the most often-repeated myths is that people found guilty of witchcraft were rolled down Slieau Whallian, a hill near St John's, in a barrel. However this is a 19th-century legend which comes from a Scottish legend, which in turn comes from a German legend. It never happened. Separately, a witchcraft museum was opened at the Witches Mill, Castletown in 1951. There has never actually been a witches' coven on that site; the myth was only created with the opening of the museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837|title=Manx witchcraft and sorcery probed by academic - Isle of Man Today<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Iomtoday.co.im|access-date=10 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227154121/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837|archivedate=27 December 2015}}</ref> However, there has been a strong tradition of herbalism and the use of charms to prevent and cure illness and disease in people and animals<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/iomnhas/lm3p303.htm|title=Yn Lioar Manninagh: The Journal of the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society|last=Nisbet|first=Robert A|last2=Rhys|first2=John|date=1897|publisher=Brown & Sons|isbn=|volume=Vol 3|location=Douglas|pages=303\u2013314|language=English|chapter=Folk-Medicine in the Isle of Man \u2013 A.

A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop. However, its traditional folk music has undergone a revival since the 1970s, starting with a music festival called {{lang|gv|[[Yn \u00c7hruinnaght]]}} in [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceolas.org/Regions/Manx-article.html|title=Trad music in the Isle of Man|website=Ceolas.org|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> This was part of a general revival of the Manx language and culture after the death of the last native speaker of Manx in 1974.\nThe Isle of Man was mentioned in the [[The Who|Who]] song \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\" as the homeland of the song's titular character, who is always in a state of ecstasy, no matter what happens to him. The song 'The Craic was 90 in the Isle of Man' by [[Christy Moore]] describes a lively visit during the Island's tourism heyday. The Island is also the birthplace of Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, of the [[Bee Gees]].\n\n=== Food ===\nIn the past, the basic national dish of the island was ''spuds and herrin'', boiled potatoes and herring. This plain dish was supported by the subsistence farmers of the island, who [[Crofting|crofted]] the land and fished the sea for centuries. A more recent claim for the title of national dish could be the ubiquitous chips, cheese and gravy. This dish, which is similar to [[poutine]], is found in most of the island's fast-food outlets, and consists of thick cut [[French fried potatoes|chips]], covered in shredded Manx [[Cheddar cheese]] and topped with a thick gravy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isleofman.com/attractions/cuisine/|title=Attractions :: isleofman.com|last=isleofman.com|website=Isleofman.com|access-date=10 November 2017}}</ref> However, as of the Isle of Man Food & Drink Festival 2018, [[Queen scallop|queenies]] have been crowned the Manx national dish.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.locate.im/articles/national-dish-of-the-isle-of-man-}}</ref>\n\nSeafood has traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the local diet.

British [[Crown dependencies|Crown dependency]] situated in the [[Irish Sea]] between [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. The [[head of state]], [[Queen Elizabeth II]], holds the title of [[Lord of Mann]] and is represented by a [[Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man|lieutenant governor]]. The [[United Kingdom]] has responsibility for the island's defence.\n\nHumans have lived on the island since before 6500 BC. [[Gaels|Gaelic]] cultural influence began in the 5th century AD, and the [[Manx language]], a branch of the [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic languages]], emerged. In 627 King [[Edwin of Northumbria]] conquered the Isle of Man along with most of [[Mercia]]. In the 9th century [[Norsemen]] established the [[thalassocratic]] [[Kingdom of the Isles]], which included the Isle of Man. [[Magnus Barefoot|Magnus III]], King of Norway from 1093 to 1103, reigned also as [[King of Mann and the Isles]] between 1099 and 1103.<ref>{{cite web | title = Magnus 3 Olavsson Berrf\u00f8tt \u2013 Norsk biografisk leksikon | website = Store norske leksikon | url = https://nbl.snl.no/Magnus_3_Olavsson_Berrf%C3%B8tt | language = no | access-date = 2019-08-15 | date= 28 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1266 the island became part of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] under the [[Treaty of Perth]], after being ruled by [[Norway]]. After a period of alternating rule by the kings of Scotland and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the island came under the feudal lordship of the [[The Crown|English Crown]] in 1399. The lordship [[Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765|revested]] into the British Crown in 1765, but the island never became part of the 18th-century [[kingdom of Great Britain]], nor of its successors, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the present-day United Kingdom.

But Scotland's rule over Mann did not become firmly established until 1275, when the Manx were defeated in the [[Battle of Ronaldsway]], near [[Castletown, Isle of Man|Castletown]].\n\nIn 1290 King [[Edward I of England]] sent [[Walter de Huntercombe, 1st Baron Huntercombe|Walter de Huntercombe]] to take possession of Mann.

[[Tynwald]] passed laws concerning the government of the island in all respects and had control over its finances, but was subject to the approval of the [[Lord of Mann]].\n\nIn 1866, the Isle of Man obtained limited home rule, with partly democratic elections to the [[House of Keys]], but the [[Legislative Council of the Isle of Man|Legislative Council]] was appointed by the Crown.

Before the Protestant Reformation, the island had a long history as part of the unified [[Western Church]], and in the years following the Reformation, the religious authorities on the island, and later the population of the island, accepted the religious authority of the British monarchy and the [[Church of England]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n| last=Moore\n| first=A.\n| title=Diocesan Histories.

The island forms a separate diocese called [[Diocese of Sodor and Man|Sodor and Man]], which in the distant past comprised the medieval kingdom of Man and the Scottish isles (\"Su\u00f0reyjar\" in Old Norse).

The second largest denomination is the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist Church]], whose Isle of Man District is close in numbers to the Anglican diocese. There are eight Catholic parish churches, included in the [[Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool]],<ref>{{cite web | title=The Archdiocese of Liverpool  | website=Liverpool Catholic | url=http://www.liverpoolcatholic.org.uk | access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref> as well as a presence of [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christians. Additionally there are five [[Baptist]] churches, four [[Pentecostal]] churches, the [[Salvation Army]], a [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Isle of Man|ward]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], two congregations of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], two [[United Reformed]] churches, as well as other Christian churches. There is a small [[Muslim]] community, with its own mosque in Douglas, and there is also a small [[Jewish]] community, see the [[history of the Jews in the Isle of Man]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.im/IsleOfMan/religion.xml|title=Religious Faiths and Organisations|date=2012-05-28|website=Isle of Man Government|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608055741/http://www.gov.im/IsleOfMan/religion.xml|archive-date=2003-06-08|url-status=unfit|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Myth, legend and folklore ===\n[[File:Isle of Man Peel Castle.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Peel Castle]]]]\nIn Manx mythology, the island was ruled by the sea god [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Manann\u00e1n]], who would draw his misty cloak around the island to protect it from invaders. One of the principal folk theories about the origin of the name ''Mann'' is that it is named after Manann\u00e1n.\n\nIn the Manx tradition of [[folklore]], there are many stories of mythical creatures and characters. These include the {{lang|gv|[[Buggane]]}}, a malevolent spirit which, according to legend, blew the roof off St Trinian's Church in a fit of rage; the {{lang|gv|[[Fenodyree]]}}; the {{lang|gv|[[Glashtyn]]}}; and the {{lang|gv|[[Moddey Dhoo]]}}, a [[black dog (ghost)|ghostly black dog]] which wandered the walls and corridors of [[Peel Castle]].\n\nThe Isle of Man is also said to be home to [[mooinjer veggey|fairies]], known locally as \"the little folk\" or \"themselves\". There is a famous [[Fairy Bridge (Isle of Man)|Fairy Bridge]], and it is said to be bad luck if one fails to wish the fairies good morning or afternoon when passing over it. It used to be a tradition to leave a coin on the bridge to ensure good luck. Other types of fairies are the {{lang|gv|Mi'raj}} and the {{lang|gv|[[Arkan Sonney]]}}.\n\nAn old Irish story tells how [[Lough Neagh]] was formed when Ireland's legendary giant [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool) ripped up a portion of the land and tossed it at a Scottish rival. He missed, and the chunk of earth landed in the [[Irish Sea]], thus creating the island.\n\nPeel Castle has been proposed as a possible location of the Arthurian [[Avalon]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/avalon.htm|title=Avalon's Location|website=Electricscotland.com|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> or as the location of the Grail Castle, site of [[Lancelot]]'s encounter with the sword bridge of King [[Maleagant]].<ref>King Arthur, Norma Lorre Goodrich, Harper and Row, 1989, p. 318</ref>\n\nOne of the most often-repeated myths is that people found guilty of witchcraft were rolled down Slieau Whallian, a hill near St John's, in a barrel. However this is a 19th-century legend which comes from a Scottish legend, which in turn comes from a German legend. It never happened. Separately, a witchcraft museum was opened at the Witches Mill, Castletown in 1951. There has never actually been a witches' coven on that site; the myth was only created with the opening of the museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837|title=Manx witchcraft and sorcery probed by academic - Isle of Man Today<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Iomtoday.co.im|access-date=10 November 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227154121/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/manx-witchcraft-and-sorcery-probed-by-academic-1-1744837|archivedate=27 December 2015}}</ref> However, there has been a strong tradition of herbalism and the use of charms to prevent and cure illness and disease in people and animals<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/iomnhas/lm3p303.htm|title=Yn Lioar Manninagh: The Journal of the Isle of Man Natural History and Antiquarian Society|last=Nisbet|first=Robert A|last2=Rhys|first2=John|date=1897|publisher=Brown & Sons|isbn=|volume=Vol 3|location=Douglas|pages=303\u2013314|language=English|chapter=Folk-Medicine in the Isle of Man \u2013 A.

A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop.

The song 'The Craic was 90 in the Isle of Man' by [[Christy Moore]] describes a lively visit during the Island's tourism heyday. The Island is also the birthplace of Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, of the [[Bee Gees]].\n\n=== Food ===\nIn the past, the basic national dish of the island was ''spuds and herrin'', boiled potatoes and herring. This plain dish was supported by the subsistence farmers of the island, who [[Crofting|crofted]] the land and fished the sea for centuries. A more recent claim for the title of national dish could be the ubiquitous chips, cheese and gravy. This dish, which is similar to [[poutine]], is found in most of the island's fast-food outlets, and consists of thick cut [[French fried potatoes|chips]], covered in shredded Manx [[Cheddar cheese]] and topped with a thick gravy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isleofman.com/attractions/cuisine/|title=Attractions :: isleofman.com|last=isleofman.com|website=Isleofman.com|access-date=10 November 2017}}</ref> However, as of the Isle of Man Food & Drink Festival 2018, [[Queen scallop|queenies]] have been crowned the Manx national dish.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.locate.im/articles/national-dish-of-the-isle-of-man-}}</ref>\n\nSeafood has traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the local diet.

It has a capacity of 154 and also doubles as a conference venue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broadway Cinema|url=http://www.gov.im/villagaiety/broadway.xml/|website=Gov.im|access-date=6 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306124729/http://www.gov.im/villagaiety/broadway.xml|archivedate=6 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Palace Cinema is located next to the derelict [[Castle Mona]] hotel and is operated by the Sefton Group. It has two screens: Screen One holds 293 customers, while Screen Two is smaller with a capacity of just 95. It was extensively refurbished in August 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cinemas Refurbishment|url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/lifestyle/manx-entertainment-news/palace-cinema-reopens-1-3782747/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130412224857/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/lifestyle/manx-entertainment-news/palace-cinema-reopens-1-3782747/|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 April 2013|website=Iomtoday.co.im|access-date=6 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Fauna ===\n{{Main|Manx cat|Manx Loaghtan|Biota of the Isle of Man|Extinct animals from the Isle of Man}}\n[[File:Black Manx cat.JPG|Black Manx cat|thumb|left]]\nTwo domestic animals are specifically connected to the Isle of Man, though they are also found elsewhere.\n\nThe [[Manx cat]] is a breed of cat noted for its genetic mutation that causes it to have a shortened tail. The length of this tail can range from a few inches, known as a \"stumpy\", to being completely nonexistent, or \"rumpy\". Manx cats display a range of colours and usually have somewhat longer hind legs compared to most cats. The cats have been used as a symbol of the Isle of Man on coins and stamps and at one time the Manx government operated a breeding centre to ensure the continuation of the breed.<ref>{{cite book|last= Commings|first= Karen|date= 1999|title= Manx Cats: Everything about Purchase, Care, Nutrition, Grooming, and Behavior|url= https://archive.org/details/manxcats00kare/page/7|location= |publisher= Barron's Educational|pages= [https://archive.org/details/manxcats00kare/page/7 7\u201310]|isbn= 978-0764107535|url-access= registration}}</ref>\n[[File:Manx loaghtan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Manx Loaghtan]] sheep are bred on the island for their meat.]]\nThe [[Manx Loaghtan]] sheep is a breed native to the island.
